It has been around since the 1800s, making audio-related instruments and equipment. It began with reed organs in Japan and has expanded to become a worldwide corporation that owns many subsidiaries and affiliates presently. A good portion of the company&#39;s success is due to its manufacturing quality. This can be said for the Yamaha NS-777, which is one of its top <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">floor standing speakers</a>.","The Yamaha NS-777 has the widest frequency response range of all the floor standing speakers that we have reviewed. It sacrifices some on the low end of the spectrum but has an impressively high top end. This is primarily due to the variety of drivers and their quality. One of the drawbacks to these speakers is their size and weight, but for the average user of tower speakers, that is only a minor inconvenience. That aside, though, this is an excellent set of speakers."]},"id":"b40f79a0-ac2e-4f19-a3d6-56c9917b59da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"b7ff766d-1704-4c64-981a-67cf99ce8866","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/63F4tvSgmNng7r2Xzc4sSm.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"As we mentioned, the Yamaha NS-777 has a lengthy range of audio that it can output, especially when it comes to those high tones. The average human ear can hear between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Any lower, and they call it a subsonic frequency. Any higher, and it is called ultrasonic. These floor standing speakers fall a little short on the low end, bottoming out at about 30 Hz, but they really go the extra mile to achieve an impressive 35 kHz on the top end of the scale.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/54370-yamaha-ns-77711.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/63F4tvSgmNng7r2Xzc4sSm.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"63F4tvSgmNng7r2Xzc4sSm","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/63F4tvSgmNng7r2Xzc4sSm.jpg","alt":""},"id":"47516b06-034f-4efa-a474-9f181e9abca7","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["That is a pretty high leap into the realm of ultrasonic tones, and you will be able to tell the difference. Going so far beyond 20 kHz allows a lot of leeway room for the tweeters. With the tones that can be heard, the tweeters have no issue achieving accurately. Also, although we can&#39;t hear ultrasonic audio, it still adds to the experience and gives the high notes a nice crisp edge.","What about the bass, though, you ask. It is true that not hitting the bottom range of human hearing, let alone entering subsonic frequencies, takes away from the audio experience. However, like all modern floor standing speakers, the Yamaha NS-777s are meant to be teamed up with a dedicated sub woofer. Doing this gives you an ideal base for your audio endeavors.","The reason Yamaha neglects the lower end and leaves it to the sub woofer is because of the power requirements of bass. If you packed a sub woofer into a tower speaker so that it would cover the full range and more, you would most likely run into the issue of drawing power away from the other drivers. Doing that would cause you to lose audio consistency and quality. Depending on the system, you would have either bass or your high-end frequencies fading out and sounding weak. Essentially, it is just a recipe for disaster, and making it work would never add anything more to the setup that a 2.1 channel system couldn&#39;t do better."]},"id":"009622e9-a2d6-46bf-a059-b3e047ff9dda","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Peformance"},"id":"03a80583-33b9-4f12-9548-948170f4a2d9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/cGfMJHGNedyPL4tG6WeFHg.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The secret to the impressive high tones that the Yamaha NS-777 can output is the driver setup.

Instead of following that common setup, the Yamaha NS-777 added a small midrange-specific driver to take care of that problem, allowing the tweeter to go nuts in the ultrasonic audio area. That midrange driver has a diameter of 5 inches and is made of a polymer.","The other two drivers in the Yamaha NS-777 that cover the lower frequencies are both 8 inches in diameter and are made of mica that has been injected with polymer. That composition has been used a few times in similar speakers and seems to reproduce audio to the liking of enough people that it is still a common material.
