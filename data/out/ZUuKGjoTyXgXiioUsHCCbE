You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The Sharp BE-HP70U is a <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a> that is specifically designed to go with a Sharp AQUOS LCD TV to provide seamless video play. While it has many of the features we think are essential for any Blu-ray disc player, it is missing a few elements like built-in storage, Deep Color and an SD card slot. However, if you are still watching movies on your outdated DVD player, we definitely recommend upgrading.","You will immediately see results in the video quality when you upgrade from a DVD player to a Blu-ray player. The Sharp BE-HP70U has some of the same technology as our top rated products. Not only will this player upscale your DVDs, but they will play in Full HD 1080p resolution. 1080p means that 1,080 lines of vertical resolution are progressively scanned during the viewing process. This player also processes Blu-ray discs at 24 frames per second – the same rate at which movies are filmed – which means crisp transitions from scene to scene.","While your eyes are feasting on the HD resolution, your ears will be reveling in the fabulous sound coming from your speakers. The Sharp BE-HP70U has 7.1 channel audio output, making it possible for you to hook up seven different speakers, creating surround sound. Through those speakers, features like Dolby True HD and dts HD will blast their way through, encompassing your TV room with the latest technology in audio listening.","To ensure that your viewing and listening processes go smoothly, Sharp has smartly installed a child lock on its Blu-ray player. This feature may seem insignificant, but when you child deviously tries to turn off a movie you’re watching and is thwarted, you’ll be glad you have it. Although not DLNA certified, the Sharp BE-HP70U can still access the internet and stream video. Admittance to the internet also allows this Blu-ray player to obtain BD-Live content. BD-Live content can be anything from interactive games to extra scenes to director commentary. Even if you want to watch two things at once, say for example, the movie and the director’s commentary, BonusView makes that possible. BonusView can best be described as a picture-in-picture setup.","Wi-Fi ready, Compatibility is one of this Blu-ray player’s strongest features. You can view DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, CDs, and you can listen to audio CDs and MP3 files.  The Sharp BE-HP70U Blu-ray player even has a slideshow playback function for JPEG files. A wireless adapter is provided to make this player instantly Wi-Fi ready. Simply plug in the wireless adapter, setup the internet connection and from then on your Blu-ray player will be a portal to the internet. This player has quite an array of input and output connections available.","I/O Ports Available:"]},"id":"4ecb40ec-128a-4355-abb6-df993456cb40","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["7.1 Channel Audio Out","Component Video","Ethernet Port","HDMI Output","Optical Digital Audio Outputs","Two USB ports"],"type":"ul"},"id":"aa7b1eda-589d-416d-9343-12069b58864d","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although missing a SD card slot, the two USB ports provide the means to save external content.
