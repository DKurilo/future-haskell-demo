You to choose your own combination, which is useful if you’re prone to forgetting random number sequences. The batteries in the lock last a long time, but if they die, you can’t access the safe with your combination. In case this happens, SentrySafe includes two override backup keys that can open the safe so you can always access you valuables.","The safe is made of strong steel, so it’s durable. Weighing in at 14.2 pounds, it is a little heavy and may be difficult for some people to move into place. However, that is a good thing, since it could deter thieves from stealing it. Still, many safes, like th<a href=\"/first-alert-review\">e First Alert 2087F-BD</a>, are larger and heavier. To prevent anyone from walking away with your safe, use the hardware that comes in the package to securely bolt it in place.","On the inside, the SentrySafe Security Safe X055’s floor is carpeted to protect delicate items, such as jewelry and electronics, against scratches or abrasions. However, it doesn’t have a place for hanging files, a shelf, or hooks. Depending on what you plan to store, you may want to look elsewhere for a safe with organization features.","This small safe measures 8.7 x 13.8 x 10.6 inches, and it looks sleek with it black finish and silver digital keypad. There are three lights above the keypad that tell you if the safe registered a key press (yellow), if you successfully opened the safe (green) or if it is currently locked (red).","It is neither fire-resistant nor waterproof, though you can find UL-listed SentrySafe models that are. SentrySafe includes a one-year warranty with the Security Safe X005, which is standard for safes of this size."]},"id":"74f04b38-6b97-4ba7-8cd7-3c41061105a8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61960","url":"/sentry-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T00:22:50Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T00:22:50Z","name":"SentrySafe Security Safe X055","synopsis":"The SentrySafe Security Safe X055 is a low-cost, 0.58-cubic-foot home safe made for storing small valuables such jewelry, money and collectibles.
