Instead of being stacked, the ovens on this model are side by side. This Verona double oven has a powerful five-burner cooktop, several color options to match your kitchen and a two-year warranty. However, it is a very basic model that does not come with many of the features and settings you will find on similar products.","The ovens themselves aren&#39;t large, but they provide enough cooking space for a large turkey. The left oven is the larger of the two, with 2.4 cubic feet of space. The right oven only provides 1.5 cubic feet of space. However, it still offers four racks and four rack positioning guides per oven. It also boasts convection cooking technology, which is a large benefit to this device. With this feature, a small fan is located inside the oven to evenly distribute the hot air around the interior. This allows food to cook at a faster rate as well as more evenly.<br/>There are five burners on the gas-range cooktop. These burners range in power from 1,000 to 16,000 Btu. This wide range of power allows you to simmer foods or to sear food when a burner is at its maximum power.","The knobs on the front of the Verona let you control both the double ovens and the cooktop. This front placement saves you the potential safety hazard of reaching over hot burners and cooking food. If you prefer touch controls, the <a href=\"/whirlpool-review\">Whirlpool</a> double oven range is a good economical choice.   You can also choose from five colors for the finish of this oven to ensure it matches your kitchen: stainless steel, white, matte black, antique white and burgundy.","The Verona doesn&#39;t come with the features and settings of many other double ovens. There is no clock or start and cancel buttons. It offers only a 60-minute timer, which is too short when you cook foods that take hours, such as turkeys. There is no rapid preheat, delayed bake or automatic shut-off either, so you can&#39;t really make the oven work around your schedule. When it comes to settings and features, this is a basic double oven.","This oven has a two-year parts and labor manufacturer warranty. This is one of the longer warranties for this type of product. Most similar ovens are only covered for one year.","The Verona VEFSGG365NDSS&#39;s side-by-side design gives it a different look from many double ovens, and the five-burner cooktop is versatile for cooking. It lacks many controls and settings, though its long warranty is above average."]},"id":"956c3451-bee5-4de2-ad27-aab0f633634c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67571","url":"/verona-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-01-14T20:49:42Z","datePublished":"2016-01-14T20:49:42Z","name":"Verona VEFSGG365NDSS","synopsis":"The Verona VEFSGG365NDSS is a range double oven with an unusual design.
