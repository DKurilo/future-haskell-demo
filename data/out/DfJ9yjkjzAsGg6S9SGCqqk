This espresso machine is small and compact, perfect for places with limited space like apartments and dormitories. It is also small enough to keep in your office for a quick afternoon pick-me-up.","The removable water tank only holds enough liquid for 3 ounces. The drip tray is removable, so you can take it off for easy cleaning. Removing the tray also allows you to make a taller latte, or lungo. Flip the tray around and reattach it to the machine and it doubles as a cup holder to keep your cup from tipping while brewing.","This espresso maker only brews pods, so it doesn&#39;t come with either a measuring tool or a tamping tool. However, the Pixie series cannot be used with standard espresso pods because it is only compatible with pods made especially for the machine.","The Pixie is a par bump cappuccino maker, so it is a little noisy when being used. You can still have a conversation while testing this espresso maker. It uses less power than other units on our espresso machine review, so it takes a little longer to heat up and be ready for brewing. The crema comes out light and thick and rests on top of the espresso for several minutes before dissolving into the rest of the drink.","An automatic shut-off feature is part of the Pixie espresso machine. After only nine minutes of standing idle, the machine will automatically turn off. Other espresso machines we reviewed take up to five hours before shutting down. This unit also comes with a concealed cord, so it is hidden from the sight and reach of curious kids.","Nespresso has many support options. You can easily navigate its user-friendly website to find contact information. Customer support is available by telephone or through email. Limited support is also available through the Nespresso Facebook page. The Pixie comes with a standard one-year warranty."]},"id":"9d4a0d47-afd4-400e-ad30-cc5487fd2d48","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"47711ea6-81c8-41bd-9191-ed086293abab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pixie series of espresso machines make great tasting espresso with a bar pump pressure system.
