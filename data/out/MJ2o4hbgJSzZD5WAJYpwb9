It lists tickets to a plethora of games for the NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA and numerous other leagues. We compared the base ticket prices for three specific games across all the ticket websites we evaluated and found TicketNetwork was rather affordable, earning a B grade. However, the fees it charged on a $25 ticket were some of the most expensive, totaling $17 – that took it down a couple spots in our rankings. You should note that fees vary on almost every ticket website depending on the venue and the delivery method, so make sure to read the fine print.","You can search for games by team, location or date. The prices don’t appear until you click “get tickets” though. You can only filter by quantity, price and delivery method, but finding parking passes is really easy, much like at Ticket Liquidator – you just select the parking pass tab on the event page. Other websites often make you search for parking passes separately. You can click on any ticket to see what the field or court looks like from that seat so you don’t end up in a spot with an obstructed view.","Ticket delivery methods vary by event and venue, but this information is noted in the ticket information dropdown menu, so you know upfront. If you buy a mobile ticket, you need a smartphone to enter the game. When you buy more than one ticket, your seats are together unless otherwise noted. This is one of two websites we evaluated that don’t have a mobile app. If you&#39;re interested in buying tickets on your phone, you should try the <a href=\"/ticketmaster-review\">Ticketmaster</a> app. There is an app called TicketNetwork Mobile POS, but it&#39;s not tied to the TicketNetwork website.","Like most ticket websites, TicketNetwork has a 100 percent money-back guarantee. This guarantee says valid tickets will arrive in time for your event, and you’ll get your money back if the game is canceled, though this doesn’t apply to rescheduled events. You can buy ticket insurance as well, and in case you have questions, the customer service phone number is easy to find at the top of the webpage.","It’s also pretty easy to sell your unwanted tickets through this website – you simply create a free account and list your ticket. When it sells, TicketNetwork takes a 10 percent commission, though that’s common for this type of website. It’s a secondary market company, so all the listed tickets are being sold by another person. This means the prices might be marked up, but again, our tests found most tickets were pretty affordable regardless."]},"id":"df469b36-2fed-4711-8a1a-0571e13705f1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2612","url":"/ticketnetwork-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","datePublished":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","name":"TicketNetwork","synopsis":"This ticket resale website scored very similarly to Ticket Liquidator in our comparison.
