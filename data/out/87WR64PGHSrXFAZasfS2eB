Moms will notice the goggles right away. Even though your little scientist is not likely to be working with anything really dangerous, we like the idea of treating these instruments with respect and building healthy habits for future scientific experiences.","The list of equipment in this kit is pretty astounding. It includes a micro hatchery, a micro slicer, two prepared slides, 10 blank glass slides, 12 cover glasses, 12 slide covers, 12 blank labels, a vial of eosin, a vial of shrimp eggs, a vial of methylene blue, a vial of sodium chloride, a Petri dish with magnifier, three 10 ml graduated cylinders, two collecting vials, tweezers, a needle, a spatula, a scalpel, a dropper, a stirring rod, a 3x/6x magnifier, scissors and a condenser lens cap.","An included condenser lens cap, which concentrates light and narrows the field of view, may seem a little over the top for a kids&#39; microscope. However, we think kids are going to enjoy any tool they can get their hands on to adjust and change their microscope’s images."]},"id":"a3d33222-737f-4d76-b63d-a63f63f4ffab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"2cff0307-5f2d-472f-9061-ccbe76486be2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A few more prepared slides would be nice.
