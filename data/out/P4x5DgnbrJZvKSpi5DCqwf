Our internet service is through Comcast Xfinity and has advertised speeds up to 400 Mbps, though in our testing process, we never saw speeds that slow. Once connected to our Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR500, we hooked up an Xbox One, PlayStation 4, a gaming PC, a Dell XPS 13 laptop and a Microsoft Surface. On the gaming devices, we downloaded three large game files (Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Assassin’s Creed: Origins and Bioshock Infinite). We streamed Netflix in 4K from the Dell and used the Surface to monitor the network. Through testing, we found that every modem we tested performed exactly as it should, so you’re safe buying any of them.","Since all the modems passed our tests, most of our ranking evaluations relied on price and features.

We consulted with Philip Michas, owner of Tech Authority in Salt Lake City, UT, who recommends making the investment, explaining, “Modems are relatively inexpensive to purchase. Most manufacturers are vendor compliant, meaning that they are ‘endorsed by big-box ISP’s. Over the course of time with a rental, you rent it for more than you can purchase it for.”","Comcast Xfinity charges an $11 monthly rental fee, but all the modems we recommend here pay for themselves in less than a year. It’s worth the investment not only to save you money, but to protect your network against ISP shenanigans like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/comcast-sued-by-customers-for-turning-routers-into-public-hotspots/\">Xfinity’s public Wi-Fi</a> program or even data leaks, like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/comcast-is-leaking-the-names-and-passwords-of-customers-wireless-routers/\">one that Comcast addressed in May</a> 2018. We put together this simple buying guide to help you find the best option for your network.","Compatibility<br/>All the modems we tested are specifically for cable internet, like that provided by Comcast Xfinity, Spectrum and Cox. There are also DSL, fiber and satellite internet services, which won’t work with these products. Beyond finding the right type of modem for your type of internet, you need to make sure you purchase a modem that is supported by your ISP. All the products on our review are supported by most of the major cable internet companies, including the three mentioned previously, but it’s always safe to double check. Most companies have an easily accessible list of supported equipment.","Performance<br/>Consider your current internet plan and whether you may want to upgrade in the next year or so, then choose your modem accordingly. Along with the list of modem compatibility, your ISP probably includes which modems it recommends for each plan tier. If you subscribe to speeds less than 300 Mbps, any of these work great.","Cable modems are classified according to DOCSIS standards and the number of upstream and downstream channels available for data traffic. DOCSIS stands for &#34;data over cable service interface specification.&#34; It is the protocol that allows you to get internet via coaxial cable. Current DOCSIS standards are 3.0 and 3.1. The latter is slightly newer and a better investment for a high-tech, high-speed household, but 3.0 works for most users.","Downstream and upstream channels are represented like 16 x 4 or 24 x 8. The first number represents the downstream channels, which correlates to the amount of information the modem can receive from the ISP. The second number, upstream channels, correlates to the amount of data you can send to your ISP at any given time. More channels means more data modulating/demodulating capabilities, though network speeds are more reliant on your internet subscription.","While our tests showed each of the modems performing admirably on speeds up to 400 Mbps, we recommend going with a 24 x 8 modem such as the Motorola MB7621 if you have an internet plan advertising speeds of 300 Mbps or higher. Faster modems give you more room to expand as new services roll out, since modems can seldom perform at their advertised max speeds.","Value<br/>We recommend purchasing a modem that costs less than the rental fees for its warranty term. If you buy a modem with a 1-year warranty, it should cost less than a year’s worth of rental fees.  All the modems we tested cost less than a year’s rent on an Xfinity modem, and many have two-year warranties. Generally, a modem should cost less than $120 at most.","If a 16 x 4 modem serves you perfectly now, but you may want to upgrade your internet package to the next level within a few years, it&#39;s worth the extra money to future-proof your purchase. Having extra speed capabilities won&#39;t negatively affect your network in any way and may even make it more efficient.","Design<br/>Home networking equipment is designed to look more functional than elegant, but some design features help you optimally use your cable modem. For one, a physical power button is a nice feature. Only a few of the modems we tested have a power button, and without one, you must unplug the device to power it off. Plugging and unplugging works, of course, but it can add frustration to the already bothersome network troubleshooting process, especially if your setup area has unorganized wires.","If you’re short on space, a smaller modem or a modem and router combination device is a good option, though they still require breathing room to prevent overheating. Ventilation is always an important design feature to consider. Devices that are well ventilated on the sides, top and bottom run cooler than ones that aren’t, which can affect your modem&#39;s longevity and the operation of other equipment in the same area. Most of the modems we tested have a large foot, which prevents you from placing anything right up against them. This also helps stabilize the modems, as their vertical positions and power, Ethernet and coaxial connections make some of the devices easy to knock over.","<strong>Modems vs. Routers</strong>","The devices most ISPs supply to renting customers are modem and router combination devices, so replacing your rented equipment does necessitate replacing both devices. The modem is the first point of contact between your home network and the internet. It takes the cable input signal and modulates/demodulates it into a standard Ethernet connection that your router or computer plugs into.","If you want Wi-Fi or to connect multiple devices to the internet, you also need a router, which handles all the communications between your home network and the internet. You need both to create an effective and secure home network. You can buy combo devices, but we recommend each device unless you’re really pressed for space. Separate devices have the advantage of being more flexible when it comes to upgrades, and if one piece breaks, you don’t have to replace the whole system."]},"id":"104401f7-e97f-4f6d-894f-9d97f0f8c5aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f92f6de1-81ee-44d7-a892-1f27cc13d8ee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/motorola-mb7621-review\">Motorola MB7621</a>","<a href=\"/netgear-cm600-review\">Netgear CM600</a>","<a href=\"/tp-link-tc7650-review\">TP-Link TC7650</a>","<a href=\"/motorola-mb7420-review\">Motorola MB7420</a>","<a href=\"/netgear-cm500-review\">Netgear CM500</a>","<a href=\"/asus-review\">Asus CM-16</a>","<a href=\"/tp-link-tc7620-review\">TP-Link TC7620</a>","<a href=\"/arris-surfboard-review\">Arris Surfboard 6183</a>","<a href=\"/linksys-cm3016-review\">Linksys CM3016</a>","<a href=\"/linksys-cm3024-review\">Linksys CM3024</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8204a2db-44f3-4cc1-964f-73da9fb46f3a","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_340","url":"/best-cable-modems","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-03T22:14:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-03T22:14:00Z","name":"Best Cable Modems of 2019","synopsis":"You can save hundreds of dollars by buying a cable modem, rather than renting one.
