Do your laundry on your own terms with time delay start and add-a-rinse options.","This LG front-load washer does have a sanitary cycle that heats the water up to 158 degrees Fahrenheit. This will be important to some users and not to others. It will offer peace of mind when it is time for a diapers or washrags load.","Household water heaters are commonly set at around 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and that will kill a lot of undesirables in your laundry, but increasing the temperature will increase bacteria deaths. Again, this is more important to some consumers than others. Adding bleach to your underwear and other loads can do about the same job of wiping out bacteria as a sanitize cycle. Vinegar can also kill a lot of bacteria.  But if you want to remove any guesswork, buying a front-load washer with a sanitize cycle will be worth the higher price tag.
