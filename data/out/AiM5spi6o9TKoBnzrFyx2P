Note: This product has not been discontinued by the manufacturer, but it does not meet the criteria for this particular site.</em>","The Milestones in Science kit is built upon an ambitious premise â€“ demonstrating to children 100 outstanding scientific discoveries throughout the centuries. The historical approach introduces children to the great thinkers in the world of science and provides an excellent manual. Although it is a good introductory <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">chemistry set</a> for youngsters, its focus is more on historical discoveries than on providing a variety of chemistry experiments for kids.","With this kit, you get 100 experiments fashioned after a significant historical discovery. Along with that, your child receives information about the situations that resulted in the discoveries. Because of this, some experiments are quite traditional and others are hands-on activities.","The experiments include discoveries by Archimedes, Copernicus, Einstein, Watt and Darwin. In addition to chemistry experiments for kids that demonstrate properties of atoms and elements, this kit includes sections on heat, electricity, natural forces and basic electronics.","Milestones in Science comes with a full box of supplies, many of which are small pieces. Since several of the experiments in this kit deal with branches of science other than chemistry, a number of the supplies are different from what you&#39;d find in the other chemistry sets in our lineup. There are a variety of specialized paper, cardboard, plastic and metal pieces specifically designed for particular experiments. Unlike most chemistry kits, the equipment in this set is not useful for stocking your own home laboratory, which is a decided drawback if you are seeking a science set for kids that offers a complete emphasis on chemistry.","Several household items are required to complete the experiments in this kit, including aluminum foil, wool and scissors. On the contents page of the experiment manual is a list of every additional item you will need. Unlike many sets, this chemistry for kids set doesn&#39;t come with any chemicals. The chemistry experiments in this kit are performed either without chemicals or with readily available household substances such as vinegar.","Milestones in Science has a high-quality experiment manual with diagrams and detailed instructions. For each milestone, there is an introductory section discussing the featured scientist&#39;s background and the circumstances of the discovery that you can recreate in the experiment or demonstration. This exposes your young scientist to many of the major principles he or she will learn in elementary and middle school science classes.","The book is divided into nine chapters, including one on the periodic table and one on atoms and molecules. Within each chapter are several experiments. This kit encapsulates so many areas of science, it can be a great source of science project ideas."]},"id":"67ea03e2-6056-4050-ab82-875701850da2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"320432a0-d033-418c-a670-fabc47e804f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Milestones in Science is different from the other kits on our lineup because it uses a historical perspective coupled with hands-on experimentation to teach scientific principles.

Anything you can do at home to enhance your child&#39;s education is useful, and this kit definitely serves that purpose.
