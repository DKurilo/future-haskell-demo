Orchard’s Abundance Fruit Gift Basket from GourmetGiftBaskets.com is an excellent <a href=\"/best-gift-baskets\">gift basket</a> with good-tasting fruit and a unique caramel dipping sauce. The company also offers all of the extras like overnight shipping, delivery to APO/FPO addresses and a huge selection of baskets.","In our taste tests, the Orchard’s Abundance basket scored an average of 2.8/4 for all the food items. This resulted in a B- score for the taste of the items in the basket. However, the orange included with this basket was one of the highest-rated fruits we tested, and it averaged a 3.6/4. The apples in this basket, however, ranked poorly, as did the pears.","This was the only basket to include a caramel dipping sauce for the apple slices, and the sauce was ranked highly by our testers. The salted caramel sauce made the apples a joy to eat.","This basket has a wide variety of foods and may be perfect for someone who enjoys dipping fruit in caramel. Though the selection isn’t as eclectic as some of the other baskets, the cheddar cheese, peanuts and chocolate covered cherries all ranked well, too.","When we received the box containing the gift basket from GourmetGiftBaskets.com, it was damaged heavily on the bottom and there were gaps in the cardboard. It almost looked like the box had sat in water before being delivered. Inside, however, the food was unspoiled thanks to some heavy-duty bubble wrapping and the plastic wrap holding the food itself in the basket.","The food came in one of the nicest wicker baskets we saw in our testing. Our reviewers appreciated the two-toned wicker and heavy-duty construction of the basket. Part of the novelty of gifting a basket is the reusable nature of the basket, and this basket is suitable for a lot of different uses.","GourmetGiftBaskets.com offers over 250 different gift baskets, including a large selection of gift baskets for men. If you’re searching for a fun gift for a football or golf fan, this company has baskets that might work perfectly. This company also offers holiday-themed baskets as well as kosher and vegan baskets.","Like the other top gift basket companies we tested, GourmetGiftBaskets.com offers priority overnight delivery as well as regular overnight, express and standard ground shipping. If you want to ship a basket internationally or to an APO/FPO address, this company allows for that as well. You can only buy baskets with a credit or debit card, which isn’t as much flexibility as other companies that let you use PayPal and other online payments.","One downside to this company’s baskets is that you only have the option to add extra snacks to your order. You can’t select a stuffed animal or card to go along with your basket.","If you need help ordering, this company has phone, chat and email support. It also has a FAQs section where you can get help with your order."]},"id":"1ecba3df-90c9-4404-a23a-0efd118af048","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7e5dbefc-364f-451b-afd3-fc1421a725cd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its wide selection and good-tasting treats and fruit, the Orchard’s Abundance basket from GourmetGiftBaskets.com is an ideal option if you want to send fruit, sweets and a delicious caramel dipping sauce.
