No longer do we just run to the movie store and rent a good movie on a rainy day. Most movie lovers today purchase their own personal copies of their favorite action flicks and port it to their favorite portable media player. Beyond portability, DVD copy software not only rescues us from the mountain of DVDs littering our entertainment center, but it also protects the costly investment of a modern movie library. Damage such as scratches or breakage quickly add up to huge cost. Just like any other valuable, it is wise to protect your movie library with backup disks. DVD copy software can provide just the safety net you need by copying, or otherwise known as cloning, all your favorites.","When shopping for the perfect DVD copy software, it s best to compare. Furthermore, in just a few short minutes you can download a <strong>DVD copy software free trial</strong> and give it a test drive before you buy. There are many things to consider when comparing DVD copy software downloads. Think about if you need just a basic copy software service for simple DVD to DVD copies or DVD to computer hard drive. Most baseline DVD copy software will offer not only these functions, but will go a step further and allow you to customize your new copy by removing annoying warning labels and commentaries. Basic software will not be as fast as their upgrade counterparts and will require a careful eye to keep them up to date with the latest error correction updates, but these general backup copies will offer great quality. You will also find the interface extremely user-friendly, and most copies can be completed in a couple clicks of the mouse.","If, however, you love your movies on the go or your library is full of Blu-ray and HD DVD titles, you will need to go with the more expensive upgrades. These DVD copy software superstars get serious about cloning your DVDs and allowing you to convert those copies into formats suitable to be ported to your iPod, iPhone, iPad, PS3, Zune or 3G phones   just to name a few. Many additional features include decryption, compression, wide screen formatting and technology that detects and repairs bad sector structures to give you the highest possible video quality.","Downloading your DVD copy software free trial is a simple process, and it only takes a few seconds to install. Why not jump online and download a free trial today? Most free trials are good for 10 days or for copying up to three movies. This gives you plenty of test-driving. If you find you are not happy with the software, simply uninstall and try another.
