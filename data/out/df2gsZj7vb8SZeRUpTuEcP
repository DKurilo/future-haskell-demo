The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">Portable Air Conditioners</a> here.</em>","If you have a small- to medium-sized room and want a quiet, energy efficient portable air conditioner, consider the Koldfront Slim Design Portable Air Conditioner and Dehumidifier (model PAC701W) from Living Direct, Inc.","Using 7,000 British Thermal Units of power, it can cool a room up to 250 square feet in size. Results will, of course, vary, depending on the height of your ceiling and what items generate heat in your room. A room with computers or full of people will take more energy to cool. If in doubt, choose an air conditioner with more power, but not too much more, or you may waste money on your electric bill.","This mobile air conditioner weighs in at 48.5 pounds, and it is shorter than most units, at just over 26 inches high. It&#39;s nearly 18 inches in width, which is about average. However, it&#39;s narrower than most, only 13.5 inches, so it doesn&#39;t make as intrusive a presence as other portable ACs can be. The castors make it easy to move around, and as a bonus, the window kit that comes with it is adjustable, so you can move it from window to window without concern for size. The kit will work with windows up to 55 inches long, but you can purchase a separate kit for larger windows or sliding doors.","It&#39;s one of the quietest portable air conditioners on the market, with an operating noise level of 48 dBAs, which is less than the average dishwasher, making it a nice choice for a bedroom or office where you want to keep the noise to a minimum.","With a terrific energy-efficiency rating of 10.8, it costs less than a dollar a day to cool a room. In addition, the 24-hour programmable timer makes it easy to turn the unit off automatically during times you know the room won&#39;t be in use. It does not come with a sleep mode like many AC units, however. There is, though, a remote control that lets you program or change settings from across the room.","This unit will dehumidify and has a self-evaporative system to cut down the amount of water that collects in the drainage pan, but it nonetheless requires emptying. It has a light that indicates when the pan is full, and the system turns off if you need to drain the bucket.","You can adjust the fan settings, but unfortunately, you cannot direct the flow of air. This Koldfront portable air conditioning unit is designed to blow air from the top of the unit, pretty much straight up. Because of this, it may take longer to cool a room, especially with higher ceilings, and unless you want to loom over the air conditioner unit, you&#39;ll miss out on that refreshing blast of cold air.","You can clean the pre-filter yourself. This one catches most of the dust and particulates in the air. There is also a silver-ion filter. You&#39;ll need to periodically replace the silver-ion filter. The company sells replacements on its website.","Living Direct offers a three-year limited warranty on the unit, one of the longest warranties on the market for portable air conditioners. The website provides not only user manuals and FAQs pages, but also phone numbers and a live chat option if you have questions about the product.","The Koldfront PAC701W Slim Design portable air conditioner is energy efficient, and it&#39;s designed to cool small- to average-sized rooms. Living Direct, Inc, manufactures several portable air conditioners under its EdgeStar and Koldfront brand names."]},"id":"cb56e62f-3e5e-4ae3-b671-c76fb016d2c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58317","url":"/koldfront-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-04T23:10:51Z","datePublished":"2013-12-04T23:10:51Z","name":"Koldfront PAC701W","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
