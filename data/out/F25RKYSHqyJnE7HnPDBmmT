Its speaker set is nearly identical to the YHT-5920UBL, our Bronze Award winner. Like its older brother, this speaker system is small yet mighty. It, too, has five speakers, an impressive subwoofer, but a downgraded AV receiver.","As for audio quality, the 7-inch front speakers have a wide-frequency response. You’ll be able to hear both sounds on the high and low end. The subwoofer can emit frequencies from 30 to 200 Hz. To put that in context, sound waves from bass guitars and explosions travel around 30 Hz.","Yamaha has included several adjustable settings to ensure you get the most out of your home theater in a box system. You can adjust the receiver to different modes depending on what you are listening to. Another interesting setting is something that Yamaha calls Virtual Cinema Front. Essentially, if your living room is tight on space and you don&#39;t have space for rear speaker placement, or if you live in an apartment, you have the ability to configure your setup differently. You can install your speakers in a row directly in front of your living room. This setting provides you with virtual surround sound, similar to what you&#39;d find with a sound bar.","The included AV receiver isn’t as impressive with this model compared to our top three home theater systems, but it still has enough ports for most people, and it supports Bluetooth for streaming music wirelessly. When comparing it to models with Blu-ray players that stand-in as the AV receiver, this receiver is much better. It has four HDMI inputs, and it can transmit 4k video at 60 frames per second. It even supports HDCP 2.2, which is a copyright protection standard that is expected to be implemented in the near future. This unit doesn’t have a disc player or support Wi-Fi, so if you plan to watch movies, you’ll need to plug in a streaming box, Blu-ray or DVD player.","Yamaha offers a two-year warranty. The company includes several instruction manuals for setting up and operating the system, but if you need additional help, they even have a convenient app that guides you through setup. If something goes wrong with your system, Yamaha has several support options, including telephone, email and dedicated social media accounts strictly for support. There is no live chat option available though."]},"id":"982c39a9-fbed-48dc-ab11-5fa36f069577","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b6967193-ce85-4008-a19d-1b6d577b3b73","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Yamaha’s YHT-4920UBL is the best home theater in a box system for folks on a budget.
