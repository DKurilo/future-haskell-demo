That is if your DVD drive does not have region restrictions already installed. RioDVD allows you to adjust the movie easily using your specific room setting-you can click the video effect button and select the mode that best matches your room (for example-darker room or lighter room). The program also includes the ability to change the viewing screen from the standard view to either the pan &amp; scan (allowing you to move the screen view back and forth on a wide view movie) or digital zoom (allowing you to zoom in on your favorite scene). RioDVD can also play a movie in the background while you are working on other computer tasks. And this player can capture scenes and save them directly to the hard drive without interrupting the movie. You can also bookmark your favorite scenes to revisit later."]},"id":"9c47bb49-5c36-4ce1-aa05-26a294795158","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Options &amp; Settings"},"id":"997d6431-92f3-4aea-a888-c8509ff69a20","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["RioDVD&#39;s control panel is little more intricate than that of some DVD players but it’s nothing to worry about.
