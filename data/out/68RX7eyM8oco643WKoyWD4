The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-audio-editing-software\">Audio Editing Software</a> here.</em>","Many of the audio editors we reviewed have robust recording, editing and file conversion tools. MicroWave has a decent number of audio editing tools but is wanting in other areas, including audio extraction from video files. When compared to the stiff competition, MicroWave finds itself near the back of the line. However, it&#39;s a good place to start when you&#39;re new to audio editing.","It is easy to import audio files into this audio editor for Mac. You can browse your files or drag and drop audio files into the welcome window. However, we were unable to upload AU or ACC audio files into MicroWave, files that many other audio editors for Mac were able to process.","The wave editor window doesn&#39;t have much to it. Above the editor sits a transport within an empty toolbar. You can customize the way your editor looks by changing the colors of the background and waveform, but you cannot add editing tools or icons to the barren toolbar.","This sound editing software for Mac presents many of the tools that are commonplace among audio editors: markers, the ability to fade in and out, and a handful of other effects to apply to your audio. It lacks some special effects, such as a phaser, flanger and chorus, but only our top-tier audio editors boast these tools.","This is the only audio software program for Mac that was unable to extract audio data from the video file formats we used in our tests. This is unfortunate, especially if you are planning to use this software to edit the soundtrack for a video file.","The true bright spot of MicroWave is its ease of use. The most novice audio engineer can figure out how to upload an audio file and start making edits with little outside help. If you find that you need more information to properly use MicroWave, you can download the manual from the help section of the program. You can also email the company from within the program.","MicroWave excels at providing a simple workspace to edit audio. There are other audio editors that provide more editing tools and recording capabilities, but this user-friendly wave editor is good software for when you are just getting into audio editing."]},"id":"f16e8ac0-90f8-4892-9e54-0d0bd41756d5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69330","url":"/microwave-express-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-23T14:33:57Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T14:33:57Z","name":"MicroWave Express","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
