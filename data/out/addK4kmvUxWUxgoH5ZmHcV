Some websites offer DNA test kits as well, but those are extra and can run anywhere between $50 and $100. We found they’re the least expensive around holidays when DNA kits are on sale.","<strong>Your Data Privacy</strong>","Finding out about your family history can be a lot of fun, but some websites use the data you provide. Ancestry.com, for example, collects and stores the personal information of users as they navigate the website. If you use the website&#39;s DNA testing services, they store your saliva sample so it can be available for future testing. You can request the sample be destroyed within 30 days of sending the sample in, but if you&#39;ve already agreed to be a part of the company&#39;s research studies, they won&#39;t remove it from any active or completed research projects. In general, your data is used more by DNA testing companies than by family tree services. For example, the Golden State Killer was <a href=\"http://time.com/5256835/how-did-golden-state-killer-genealogy-websites-online-dna-police/\">caught in 2018</a> thanks to online DNA testing services. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dna-testing-delete-your-data-23andme-ancestry-2018-7\">Business Insider</a> reported companies can even sell your genetic information to drug companies.","<strong>More to Know About Genealogy Websites</strong>","Hints<br/>While genealogy websites have a lot of available information, remember that not all of it is accurate. Some websites rely solely on information entered by other users. That means if someone gets a birthdate or wedding date wrong, it could really change the way your family tree looks. The most reliable sources are public records and copies of physical documents like birth and marriage certificates, so we preferred websites that have those resources available. Keep in mind if someone in your family has purchased a burial plot anywhere under their name, it could show up in your search suggesting that someone who is still living is in fact deceased."]},"id":"edf7dde8-3940-4f9f-bbfe-06132a33c46b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/viqcBXxhhLbgkuQvRG2Bb8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/genealogy-search/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9DL0MvNzg0NTI0L29yaWdpbmFsL0dlbmVhbG9neS1TZWFyY2gtVGVzdGluZy0wMDIuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/viqcBXxhhLbgkuQvRG2Bb8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"viqcBXxhhLbgkuQvRG2Bb8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/viqcBXxhhLbgkuQvRG2Bb8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"ff0dec3b-0041-481d-a0a3-eaea18f1014f","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You also shouldn’t expect any genealogy website to build a family tree for you from nothing.
