Blu-rays are a serious investment that take time, energy and money to collect, and this program allows you to protect that investment. The program has some shortcomings, but overall it is a decent program.","When you first open FilePop, you are presented with a screen that is slightly reminiscent of Windows Explorer, which is familiar and helpful. As far as copying discs goes, the program is simple to use, as all you need to do is insert a disc in your computer and select a source to copy and a target to store the file. After this, all you need to do is press one button and the program takes care of the rest. However, the rest of the screen has numerous options in technical jargon that can be slightly confusing to work with if you are not familiar with this field.","This is the only software on our lineup that has the capability to bypass Cinavia, an audio watermarking technique used on Blu-ray discs. Since 2012, all Blu-ray players have the capability to detect this audio watermark to make sure the disc being played is compatible with the player itself. If the player detects a flawed signal or receives an error, the video stops playing. This program circumvents this from happening, allowing you to copy commercial discs for your own personal use. This Blu-ray copy software is able to create a complete 1:1 copy, main movie only or custom movie. This lets you create a disc copy to match your needs.","If you run into issues, you can contact the company via an email form located on its website. You can also search the FAQs for a solution. Finally, you can use the user guide to walk you through certain steps and processes to better grasp some functions of the program."]},"id":"b3de3c7d-f523-4e32-92d8-0cdadfef30b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"302d40c2-206e-4b75-aba5-10b4e77ab53a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["FilePop HD Platinum + CinEx is decent Blu-ray to Blu-ray copy software that enables you to back up your Blu-ray collection for your personal use.
