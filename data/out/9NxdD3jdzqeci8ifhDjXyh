This is not a bad thing. Instant messaging has become an integral part of our lives; although we associate the term &#34;instant messaging&#34; with the internet and much of what we think about the technology comes from services such as America Online and ICQ during the late 1990s, in sober fact, the concept of instant messaging has roots reaching back decades before the internet was born.","The history of instant messaging as we know it began in the mid 1960s, when innovators at universities such as MIT developed what are now known as time-sharing operating systems. Arguably, the most influential of these systems were the Compatible Time-Sharing System and later the Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. These early computing innovations contained protocols that we could recognize now as proto-email or instant-messenger seedlings. However, their power and usefulness simply was not realized in the limited environment that technology provided during that era.","The first protocols that we would firmly recognize as instant messengers came in the 1980s in the form of a technology best encapsulated by the product known as &#34;real-time text.&#34; This software enabled text to be instantly transmitted from one machine to another as it was being typed. While this technology was primarily developed and used for the hearing impaired, it provided the basis for what would eventually become the technology America Online used to develop its widely popular instant messenger service in the 1990s that is still in use today.","The 1980s also saw the advent of a pseudo internet in services known as bulletin board systems or BBS. It was in these Petri-dish intranets that we first saw consumers using modems at home with their personal computers, which provided the first truly personal online experience for the average person. People were provided with a username and an inbox for messages. Of course they didn&#39;t call it email or instant messages at the time. However, if you were online at the same time as another user, you could communicate more or less in real time.","It wasn&#39;t until the late 1980s and early 1990s that computer companies provided services that were explicitly designed for real-time communication between connected users. Many sources purport to be the inventor of the instant messenger as we know it today. Arguably, Quantum Link makes the best claim with its application for the Commodore 64 known at the time as On-Line Messages, or OLM. The entire application was essentially a chat log with options given each time a message was received. While it was still a long shot from the business chat software we use today, it had all the same basic tools and features for communication.","When America Online popularized and normalized widespread internet use in the 1990s, it became the most popular internet provider. In turn, the AOL instant messenger provided the first introduction to instant messaging to the American people and, in turn, to the world. AOL and its rival (and eventual partner) ICQ connected millions of people across the world and set the stage for instant communication between people that didn&#39;t involve a telephone.","While most people have moved on from their original AOL accounts, there are still some legacy users who still use their original usernames and email addresses from the 1990s. While many view those accounts as archaic and outdated, they are still a relative newcomer when it comes to the technology. With the advent of social media, text messaging and the rest of the range of instantaneous communication, it&#39;s easy to lose sight of how essential this type of technology is and how long ago humans developed its non-digital predecessors.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "," "," "]},"id":"c40560ee-9665-46f5-874c-d6b2455889c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7735","url":"/history-of-instant-messaging","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-01-15T18:21:57Z","datePublished":"2013-01-15T18:21:57Z","name":"History of Instant Messaging","synopsis":"Stripped of its tools, analytics and other features, enterprise chat software is nothing more than a simple instant messenger.
