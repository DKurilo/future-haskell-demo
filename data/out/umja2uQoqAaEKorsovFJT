For example, many contact lens websites have a live chat feature that offers immediate customer service.","“I think it streamlines the entire optical process for the customer and allows them to just forget about it,” Drumm said. “You don’t have to worry about your eyes. We just tell you when it’s time to take care of it.”","Drumm also warned of sketchy websites that aren’t legitimate. He said most of the time it’s pretty apparent when a website isn’t an authorized retailer.","While you can get your contacts from your doctor, online shopping does have its perks.","Laura Schmidt of <a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Cty0dj6o3sg&amp;offerid=366177.67&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0\">1-800 Contacts</a> said in an email that its online shoppers get the same lenses they would receive directly from an eye doctor paired with money-saving opportunities like rebates and promotions.","&#34;With over 15 million contact lenses in stock, 1-800 Contacts is more likely to have a contact lens wearer’s prescription than anyone else,&#34; she said.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","In testing, we noted all the different types and brands of contact lenses each website sells. Because all the websites we reviewed offer common types of contacts such as disposables, lenses for people with astigmatism, multifocal contacts and even colored lenses, we put a lot of weight on how many brands each website has to offer. This meant we went through and tallied up how many brands were listed on each website. In this process we counted brands that offer several lines of contacts only once. For instance, even though Acuvue has lines named Oasys, Vita, Define and Moist – among others – we only counted Acuvue once.","We also looked at every website’s price matching guarantee, shipping rates and general ordering information to make sure all prices were accurate upfront. In doing so, we found all the sites offer discounts if you sign up to have your prescription automatically refilled or simply purchase in bulk. We also discovered not all sites sell glasses, solution and drops, but since those are a pretty standard need for people who wear contacts, we favored websites that did.","<strong>How Much Do Contacts Cost?</strong>","How much you pay for contacts online is going to vary depending on your prescription. Customized RGP lenses, for instance, can cost upwards of $40 per lens while a 30-pack more commonly prescribed lenses are about $1 per lens. What you pay out of pocket depends on your eye insurance plan as well, so you’ll need to have that information handy when placing your first order. Many websites will also note whether you can use an HSA or FSA account to buy certain contacts.","<strong>Is It Safe to Wear Contact Lenses?</strong>","The short answer to this question is yes, as long as you wear them correctly. Most medical contacts are very safe to use, especially when prescribed by a doctor. Keep in mind that contacts could cause damage to the eyes since they are placed directly on the cornea. Still, at most this usually only results in minor scratches, which, while unpleasant aren’t life-altering. To prevent any problems, make sure you don’t wear your contacts for too long and that you clean them properly.","If you wear dailies, be sure to dispose of them properly and use a new pair every day, as these are not designed for multiple days of wear. If your eyes are dry or irritated, they are easier to scratch, so talk to your doctor immediately if they become uncomfortable. You’ll also want to use good hygiene practices to prevent any bacteria from finding its way to your eyes. Wash your hands and dry them thoroughly before placing or removing contacts. Additionally, before you swim or take a shower, remove your contacts to prevent chemicals and bacteria from getting trapped against your eyes.","<strong> Do Contacts Make Your Eyes Worse?</strong>","If you go in for a checkup and discover your vision has declined, you might want to ask if your contacts are the root of the problem. In the majority of cases, myopic changes are natural and would have occurred whether or not you wore contacts. In some rare occasions, usually when using contacts incorrectly, injuries can occur.","This leads us to another common question: Can contact lenses make you go blind? In very rare instances, usually when using poor hygiene practices, an <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/corneal-ulcer#1\">eye ulcer</a> can develop. Left untreated, this obstruction can cause permanent vision loss. Even when treated, scar tissue can sometimes result in reduced vision. But once again, this is very rare and only affects a small portion of the population. To prevent complications, follow your doctor’s instructions as well as the instructions on the contact lens box and solution bottle. If you start to experience any discomfort or develop red eyes, consult your doctor right away.","Read <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/corneal-ulcer#1\">WebMD</a> article if you want to learn more about corneal ulcers.","<strong>How Many Hours a Day Can You Wear Contact Lenses?</strong>","The unsatisfying but true answer is, it depends. Some people’s eyes can handle contacts for longer periods without needing a break, while others are more at risk of infection when contacts are worn for extended periods. Some lenses are made to be worn longer than others, so it also depends on the type of contacts you use. An absolute certainty is that for most people, wearing contacts overnight increases the chances of an eye infection.","According to <a href=\"https://www.allaboutvision.com/contacts/faq/cls-damage-eyes.htm\">All About Vision</a>, our eyes need oxygen to remain healthy. Wearing contacts too often can lead to oxygen deprivation, so make sure you take your contacts out regularly, especially before going to bed. Most people can wear contacts every day without a problem, but it really depends on your doctor’s diagnosis and directions. To prevent any complications, some doctors ask that you take your contacts out an hour or two before bed every night. To be safe, always follow your doctor’s instructions for proper contact use, and replace your lenses as directed.","<strong>Contact Lenses for Amblyopia</strong>","It’s not uncommon for young children to develop a vision disorder where nerve pathways between the brain and eyes are disrupted, making it so the burden of vision falls on just one eye. According to the <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/amblyopia\">National Eye Institute</a> (NEI), the most visible symptom of amblyopia is a lazy eye, but you may also notice your child has poor depth perception and eyes that don’t seem to work together. Your child might also get frequent headaches or have loss of vision in one eye. This can, in turn, cause them to squint or strain their good eye. If not corrected in childhood, this disorder can cause permanent vision problems.","There are corrective glasses that can help children overcome or lessen amblyopia, as well as eye drops. You can also correct this problem with special contact lenses. Contact lenses draw less attention to your child and their condition, which could help their self-esteem. You need to check with each contact delivery service to see if it offers corrective lenses specifically for amblyopia. As with any other contact order, you need a prescription from a doctor to purchase these lenses.","<strong>Contact Lenses for Astigmatism</strong>","Toric contact lenses are designed specifically for people who have astigmatism. Astigmatism is an imperfection in the eye’s curvature, which causes distorted vision. This usually means the cornea is oblong like an egg instead of being spherical. Astigmatism is very common, affecting more than 3 million people in the U.S. every year.","Toric lenses must stay in a specific position on the eye to correct astigmatism. They are usually made of soft materials like hydrogel, though some are made of Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP), also called Gas Permeable (GP), materials, which make them harder. Some toric lenses are weighted at the bottom to make sure they stay in the right location on your eye. This prevents them from rotating and only allows them to move vertically when you blink.","According to <a href=\"https://www.fogeyes.net/eyeglasses-contacts/contact-lenses/gas-permeable-gp-contact-lenses/\">Foothill Optometric Group</a>, GP lenses, while not as popular as soft lenses, don’t contain water and are therefore less likely to attract and breed bacteria. A single pair can even last a full year if you take care of them properly.","You’ll find that most contact lens companies sell corrective toric lenses in both soft and GP form. Talk with your doctor to determine which option is right for you. If you want to fully correct astigmatism, discuss LASIK with your doctor to see if it’s an option for your eyes.","<strong>Dry Eye Remedies</strong>","If you wear contacts regularly, you might be one of the thousands who suffer from irritated, red eyes. To get help, make an appointment with your eye doctor to see what the best remedy for your situation is. It might be something as simple as getting prescribed eye drops or changing the lens solution you’re using. There are also specialty lenses that help with irritated eyes. According to <a href=\"https://www.allaboutvision.com/contacts/lenses-dry-eyes.htm\">All About Vision</a>, there are at least five different types of contacts to help with dry eye: Bausch + Lomb Ultra, Dailies Total 1, CooperVision Proclear, Extreme H2O and Scleral Lenses. Speak with your doctor to determine if one of these contacts is a good solution for you.","There have been rumors going around that consuming Omega-3 from fish oil supplements will help with dry eye. However, a recent <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/content/omega-3s-fish-oil-supplements-no-better-placebo-dry-eye\">National Eye Institute</a> funded study found that these capsules are nothing but a placebo when it comes to dry eye. To get actual help, consult your eye doctor.","<strong>What Is Computer Vision Syndrome?</strong>","According to the <a href=\"https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/protecting-your-vision/computer-vision-syndrome\">American Optometric Association (AOA)</a>, prolonged screen use causes several eye and vision problems, and viewing a backlit screen, whether that be on a tablet, computer or smartphone, puts strain on your eyes. Most commonly, symptoms of computer vision syndrome (also called digital eye strain) include headaches, blurred vision, dry eyes, neck and shoulder strain, and eye strain. Typically, these symptoms are caused by poor lighting, uncorrected vision problems, poor posture and screen glare.","To get help with digital eye strain, you need to consult your eye doctor. He or she will evaluate your eyes’ ability to focus and check for vision problems like nearsightedness or farsightedness. Your eye doctor can prescribe treatments based on what they find. Seeing your eye doctor regularly and adopting healthy screen-viewing habits should benefit your overall eye health.","<strong>How to Treat Digital Eye Strain</strong>","There are special glasses and contact lenses to help people suffering from computer vision syndrome, including glasses that are tinted or created specifically to reduce glare. Your doctor should help you select the contacts you need.","According to <a href=\"https://www.lenscrafters.com/lc-us/vision-guide/digital-eye-strain\">LensCrafters</a>, 30 percent of adults spend more than nine hours on a digital device each day. It’s no wonder that many people have digital eye strain. Ideally, you should take breaks from screens, but this isn’t always doable when computers and tablets are part of your job or school routine. To reduce effects and improve screen time, the AOA says to make the following changes to your computer setup:"]},"id":"62535d0b-4fd0-4a72-bfc6-fa16174304e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Place your computer directly in front of you, 15 to 20 degrees below eye level.","Place any documents you need within sight of the screen so your eyes don’t need to adjust between the paper and the monitor.","Move the screens so there isn&#39;t glare from other light sources. You might even want to consider purchasing an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/3M-Anti-Glare-Widescreen-Monitor-AG230W9B/dp/B00IQCRO12/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">anti-glare screen for your computer</a>.","Make sure you use proper posture. Your feet should be flat on the ground with your thighs parallel to the floor. Sit with your back straight in a comfortable chair.","It’s best to take a 15 minute break for every two hours of uninterrupted computer use. This gives your eyes a rest and should reduce strain. There’s also the AOA’s 20-20-20 rule: Take 20 seconds to view something 20 feet away every 20 minutes.","When we stare at computer screens, we don’t blink as much as normal, which can lead to dry eyes. Try to develop the habit of conscientiously blinking frequently while at a screen."],"type":"ul"},"id":"629d7d35-10c0-4436-b51a-176978a57f92","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Keratoconus Contacts &amp; Treatments</strong>","Unlike astigmatism, which is an eye deformity, keratoconus (KC) is an eye disease that gets worse over time. Symptoms include blurred and distorted vision, progressive nearsightedness, and a sensitivity to glares and light. Physically, the cornea develops into an irregular cone shape. According to <a href=\"https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/keratoconus.htm\">All About Vision</a>, the first sign of KC for many people is needing to change their eyeglass or contact lens prescription every time they see their eye doctor.","When the disease first starts, it can be treated with special contacts and eyewear. The contacts must be fitted to your eye, which takes time and several visits to your ophthalmologist. If soft lenses don’t do the trick, then GP lenses are often used. However, as the disease grows, these lenses become less effective until they no longer work.","Scleral and semi-scleral lenses are another option. These larger GS contacts cover portions of the white part of the eye. Because of their shape, they put less pressure on the cornea, making them more comfortable to wear.","Prosthetic lenses treat advanced cases of KC. As with other contacts, you must get a prescription from a doctor for these custom-shape lenses. While they have proven to help healing and reduce symptoms, prosthetic lenses are very expensive – you’ll pay several thousand dollars for a fitting with a certified doctor.","When you reach a stage where contacts and eyewear no longer help your KC, it might be time to talk to your doctor about Intacs. The <a href=\"https://www.nkcf.org/intacs-for-keratoconus/\">National Keratoconus Foundation</a> (NKCF) states that Intacs were approved in 2004 for treating KC. They are plastic inserts surgically placed beneath the eye’s surface to help reshape the cornea. The foundation further states that the procedure usually takes only 15 to 20 minutes, and you will need to come back for follow-up visits. There are risks with this procedure, including infection and blurry vision. For more information, discuss this treatment thoroughly with your doctor.","<strong>What Are Multifocal Contact Lenses?</strong>","Multifocal lenses may be the best option if you&#39;re dealing with presbyopia or age-related farsightedness. Also called near/far contact lenses, one lens has more than one prescription to help you see near and far. <a href=\"https://coopervision.com/about-contacts/multifocal-contact-lenses\">CooperVision</a> explains there are pros and cons to using these lenses. On the plus side, you can usually see without wearing glasses, your range of vision is better and the transition between prescriptions is smoother. On the other hand, the viewing experience is very different and might take some time to get used to. New users usually experience hazy or shadowed vision during the transition. These lenses also happen to be very expensive since they are more complex than others.","If multifocal lenses don’t sound appealing, there are other options. For example, you could wear contact lenses with reading glasses or use monovision or bifocal contacts. If you’re willing to spend the money, see your doctor to discuss surgical procedures or lens implants.","<strong>What Key Features Should I Look for When Selecting an Online Contact Store?</strong>","Be Prepared<br/>You can shop around at contact lens websites all you want, but to place an order you’ll need a prescription from your eye doctor. Most websites offer several ways to verify your prescription, including uploading an image of the prescription or even getting in touch with your optometrist’s office. This even applies to zanier colored contacts or ones with a Halloween theme to really put your zombie or monster costume over the top. According to 1-800 Contacts, contacts can’t legally be sold without a prescription because the Food and Drug Administration categorizes them as a medical device. If you don’t need vision correction but want to have some fun with your eye color, Walmart Contacts recommends talking to your eye doctor about getting a prescription for 0.00 or plano contacts.","On a similar note, keep in mind that many Halloween and novelty stores sell unlicensed colored contacts, both at physical locations and online. Health Canada, a medical association, has stated that novelty stores’ contacts usually haven’t passed safety regulations and often contain toxins and harmful materials that could damage or infect your eyes. The <a href=\"https://opto.ca/halloween-comes-once-a-year-vision-is-for-life\">Canadian Association of Optometrists</a> says that even prescribed novelty lenses are often used incorrectly and result in vision complications, for example, scratching or cutting your cornea, which can cause an allergic reaction or infection. Of course, the most common problem with novelty lenses is vision obstruction, which can lead to accidents.","If you’re still determined to get novelty lenses to complete your costume, make an appointment with an eye doctor. To prevent complications, clean the lenses properly before putting them in, never sleep with them in and never share them with others. Above all, listen to your eye doctor&#39;s instructions for proper care, use and cleaning.","If color contacts sound like something you&#39;re interested in, there are two basic types. Prescription color contacts correct your vision while having a colored layer to change the appearance of your eye. Plano color contacts are purely for cosmetic purposes and don&#39;t correct your vision. Either way, you&#39;ll need a prescription from an eye doctor.","The cost of colored lenses varies, but generally speaking they&#39;re more expensive than regular corrective lenses. For example, a box of Air Optix Colors cost about $70 (as of March 2019) while contacts for astigmatism, night and day and several other kinds all cost around $50. Still, the Air Optix multifocal contact lenses also cost about $70, so not all clear lenses are less expensive than colored lenses","When shopping for colored contacts you&#39;ll have the choice between colored or tinted lenses. Colored lenses are typically more vibrant in color and will totally change the look of your eye. Costume lenses are also in the colored lens category, though these tend to be less opaque and very decorative.Tinted lenses are meant to be more subtle and only slightly change your eyes. These are ideal if, for example, you have very light blue eyes but want them to be slightly deeper in color.","<strong>Simple Contacts App</strong>","If you wish there was a more convenient way to get a prescription for contacts, you’ll be interested in using simplecontacts.com. The app is available for both Android and Apple devices. Once it&#39;s installed, you can renew your prescriptions after taking a mobile-based vision test that was designed by doctors. You can order your new contacts through the app, and they will ship within 24 hours. This means you no longer have to go into the doctor’s office for a prescription renewal. Imagine the time, and money, you’ll save.","Over 6,000 people have rated this app, and it maintains a score of 4.8 out of 5 in the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-contacts/id1069573128?mt=8\">Apple App Store</a>. In the customer reviews, some users say the exam doesn’t always work the first time, so you might have to retake it a couple of times before it goes through. This is definitely frustrating. Hopefully the program improves soon, but for now, not having to pay your doctor for an eye exam when you have a stable prescription is a pretty big perk.","<strong>Insurance</strong>","To get financial assistance for your eye care products, including contact lenses, you need vision insurance. Typically, regular health insurance covers a visit to the optometrist but doesn&#39;t cover additional purchases such as glasses or lenses.","There is a multitude of plans available from numerous companies, and each one is different. But generally, vision insurance covers all or part of the cost of your glasses and contacts as well as a fraction or all of the cost of the doctor&#39;s office visit, as long as you&#39;re within your plan&#39;s network. You should check ahead of time to make sure the eye doctor you&#39;re visiting is covered by your plan. Most plans cover an annual eye exam, and if you go more than that, you might have to pay some out-of-pocket costs. Vision insurance also usually covers part of some eye surgeries, including LASIK. If you need unique lenses, such as photochromic lenses, your vision insurance will also cover part of that cost as well.","However, if you rarely go to the eye doctor, you can use a health savings account (HSA) to pay for the visit instead of signing up for vision insurance. This isn’t viable long term or for those who often need new contacts or lenses, but it can work for those who are between jobs or in school.","<strong>Related Guides:</strong><a href=\"/best-eyeglasses-online\"><br/></a>"]},"id":"4d407d93-6c52-481d-a6cd-74c87a0091b0","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-eyeglasses-online\">The Best Online Eyeglass Stores<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-vision-care\">The Best Vision Care Providers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2775e652-f222-4757-a001-45dad5df3ba7","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_119","url":"/best-contact-lenses","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-07T00:40:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-07T00:40:00Z","name":"Best Places to Buy Contact Lenses in 2019","synopsis":"We looked for contact lens sites that deliver excellent customer service, a wide variety of lenses and accessories, and great shipping options.","review":{},"strapline":"We looked for contact lens sites that deliver excellent customer service, a wide variety of lenses and accessories, and great shipping options.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-22T15:50:48Z","id":"umja2uQoqAaEKorsovFJT","meta":{"title":"Best Place to Buy Contacts Online 2019 -
