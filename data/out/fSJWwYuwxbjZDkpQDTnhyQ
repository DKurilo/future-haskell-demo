The 5Star Urgent Response is unique because it can be used for both young and old. It is also unique as a GPS tracker because it includes a service that allows you to speak to a live, trained professional at the push of a button.","The tracking device is small and lightweight, easy for a child to carry in a backpack or in a pocket. The company recommends charging the battery every night. Should you forget or be otherwise unable to charge it because of an emergency, the battery will survive three days on a single charge. When locating your child, the device is accurate down to 15 feet. In the case of an injured missing child, accuracy can be one of the most important factors.","Unlike the other GPS trackers for kids we looked at, the 5Star Urgent Response does not send out any alerts. You won&#39;t receive a text or email, because the device itself doesn&#39;t have any zones set up or any ability to track a speed limit. What the 5Star Urgent Response does have is a live person available at the touch of a button, 24/7. If your child is scared or feeling threatened, they can press the panic button and speak to a trained professional who will talk to your child until the crisis is over. The GreatCall agent can even include you or anyone you want on the call, so you or someone you trust knows what is going on and can help console your child. You can add as many emergency contacts as you need so there is always someone available - and even if someone from your list is not, someone from GreatCall is.","GreatCall provides both a web-based user portal and a smartphone app for both Android and iOS users. These programs all use what GreatCall refers to as a “locator service,” which allows you to pinpoint your child&#39;s location on a map. What it doesn&#39;t do is tell you how fast they are moving, how far away they are from you, the remaining battery life or the strength of the GPS signal. We feel that these are all features GreatCall could implement in the future. While you can track more than one of these devices, you can&#39;t do it on one account. You have to create a separate account for each device.","The 5Star Urgent Response has several accessories available for purchase. You can get a waterproof pouch, a lanyard, an arm or wristband and a key chain attachment. The tracking device itself comes in black or silver."]},"id":"04c0bd5a-18db-4999-8911-c41257963647","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"30441f93-82c9-4f2b-8aae-7c1a37d4c4f9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GreatCall 5Star Urgent Responder can be used as a GPS tracker for kids, but the real value comes with the service.
