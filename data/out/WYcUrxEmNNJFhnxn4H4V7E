Meanwhile, enjoy our review below about the DeltaMaker.</em>","Most <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D printers</a> are large machines with small print capacities. The DeltaMaker, however, is a small printer with a large print capacity because of its optimal use of space. With both auto leveling and customizable user calibrations, the DeltaMaker is a nice choice for any creative project.","The DeltaMaker makes 3D printing easy by including auto leveling and user calibration features. Prior to each print, the DeltaMaker checks the height of the nozzle against the bed, as well as how level the bed is to ensure accurate prints.  Its 10 x 9.4 x 9.4-inch hexagonal print area is also an eccentric feature, but it’s not without purpose – its odd shape efficiently uses space and contributes to the machine’s large print capacity.","This 3D printer prints designs using 1.75 mm PLA filament in the color of your choice. The manufacturer sells proprietary filament for a reasonable price, but if you&#39;re looking for other colors, any universal filament cartridge will do. The acrylic print plate isn&#39;t heated, so you can’t print with ABS filament like you can on the <a href=\"/3d-printers/best-3d-printers/lulzbot-mini-review/\">Lulzbot Mini</a>. ","The DeltaMaker has a very unique design; for example, the print head is shaped like a triangle. Also, the print head travels vertically down to the bed – traditionally, 3D printers have beds that adjust up toward the print head. This aluminum printer only weighs 21 pounds and is easy to maneuver around your home or workshop.","Many manufacturers provide propriety software to slice models and control the printer. The DeltaMaker uses open source software such as Cura, Slic3r and Repetier Host. Since the machine supports completely untethered printing, you can print from these applications without connecting your computer to the machine. Its Wi-Fi printing feature is a major bonus. In addition to the printer itself, the box includes filament and maintenance tools so you can start printing right away.","DeltaMaker lists email, phone and social media support contact information on its website. However, we had trouble reaching the support team, and representatives only answered a few of our questions. Also, there aren’t any tutorials on the website. This 3D printer is covered by a one-year warranty, which is much longer than the warranties on comparable 3D printers, such as the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/makerbot-replicator-plus,review-3979.html\">Makerbot Replicator+</a>."]},"id":"6b101189-1833-4297-a1bf-ae03e8a60104","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a21d3d53-4ec9-40de-acb9-565a3d18cef5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The DeltaMaker can print 3D models via Wi-Fi, and it has a unique design and interface.
