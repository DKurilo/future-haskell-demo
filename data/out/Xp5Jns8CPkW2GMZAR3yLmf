It can be pulled apart to become a truly handheld unit, which is a rare plus among the <a href=\"/best-steam-mops\">steam mops</a> we compared.","The SF-295 tied for second fewest passes on our sticky messes – soda and orange juice – but was well over the average number of passes on the spaghetti sauce and mustard. Those were the most challenging messes by far, and the SF-295 was not the only one to struggle removing them. It still beat out a couple of contenders on those, and all mops removed all of the messes eventually, just not as fast as the best of the best.  If you prefer the one that cleaned in the fewest number of passes overall, check out the <a href=\"/bissell-powerfresh-review\">Bissell PowerFresh</a>.","This steam mop was well above average on our temperature tests, and that’s a plus. There was only one cleaning head that was hotter. None of the mop heads measured over 200 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the target for sanitizing, but the SF-295 was closer than most.","There was only one mop that was lighter than this one and it wasn&#39;t nearly as versatile. The SF-295 easily adjusts to become a handheld tool for steaming clothing, windows, showers and basically anything else. Some competing mops clean those surfaces as well, but require a hose to do so, or require hoisting the entire mop up to whatever you are cleaning. This one is truly handheld.","Being so compact and adaptable comes with some drawbacks. This one has a removable water tank, which means you don&#39;t have to take the whole mop to the sink to refill, but it is a small tank that’s difficult remove, and hard to close the lid properly.","This was an ideal steam mop in terms of maneuverability. Its swiveling head got in and around obstacles easily. The adjustable steam levels make it easier to get what you want on different surfaces, and we love the fact that you don&#39;t have to pump the handle to generate steam like you do on some competitors."]},"id":"3673c082-cb56-4023-9bf3-fbf37dc5ee78","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f7e1e5c6-b498-4977-8b41-bbc762eaf856","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Steamfast SF-295 3-in-1 Steam Mop took longer to remove some of the messes in our laboratory than some competitors, but it did remove them.
