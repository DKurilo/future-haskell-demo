The Weber Spirit II earned the highest heat-consistency score of any gas grill we tested.<br />\n<br />\nIt bested the competition with its three stainless steel primary burners, which produce a total of 30,000 BTU of heat. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a side burner, which would be a good addition for rotisserie and side dishes. <br />\n<br />\nThe grilling space on the Weber Spirit II is ample. The primary cooking area is 529 square inches, enough to fit 12 burger patties on the main grill and four on the warmer. It’s not the largest grilling area we saw, but it’s more than enough to cook for everyone at a family barbecue or friendly get-together. <br />\n<br />\nWeber is well-known for the sturdy, high quality materials in its grills. The Spirit II is backed by a five-year warranty for both the burner and parts, so you can expect it to last at least that long – and probably much longer. <br />\n<br />\nDuring our testing phase, we had our entire lab crew assembling and cooking on all the grills we reviewed.

That’s enough to cook 12 burgers simultaneously, the same as the Weber Spirit II. And it does come with a side burner, so you can cook the non-meat portions of your meal as well. <br />\n<br />\nIt produces 46,000 Btu and retains and distributes the heat very well.

Only our top pick received higher marks. <br />\n<br />\nYou can expect to have a nice, even grilling experience with no hot or cold spots, so all your food cooks at the same rate. While this grill is superior to our top pick in some ways, such as the addition of a side burner, more Btu and the price, the Weber Spirit II is simply better at grilling overall. <br />\n<br />\nThis grill costs $200 less than the Weber Spirit. However, that saved money may not be worth it in the long run. This grill only has a five-year warranty for its burners and a one-year warranty for all other parts.

During each test on gas grills, we record our personal experience with each grill, what we liked and disliked, as well as noting each model’s strengths and weaknesses. In other words, our conclusions are based on our own real-life experiences.","Our evaluation team included four members with years of experience grilling meals for large and small occasions. On top of that, we reached out to grilling experts and others who use gas grills regularly, asking what they look for when they buy a new grill. Antonio Lexerot of Salt Lake City is a member of a Utah outdoors club. He has catered their bi-annual summer camp for more than a decade – grilling food for dozens of people at a time. He owns several different types of grills, including charcoal, smokers, gas and infrared models.","Speaking about gas versus charcoal grills, Lexerot noted that gas grills give you even, long-lasting heat, whereas charcoal grills get hot quickly then “peter out over time.” His advice: “If you’re doing something quick, charcoal is fine, but if you are doing a larger project you need the indirect heat that gas grills provide.”","When asked about what he looks for in a good gas grill he said, “You want one that has some kind of flare-up control, so if you drip some grease it doesn’t turn into a tire fire and ruin your food – especially chicken.” The most important point Lexerot stressed was, “If you’re going to get a grill that you plan on using regularly, get a sturdy grill that has ample features, is easy to use and that will hold up over time. Make sure to get a gas grill that’s going to hold up, big enough for your needs, has a warming rack.”","However, not all grillers make gas grills their first choice. Jesse Johnson of the Utah BBQ Association is a pitmaster for a competitive barbeque team. At the time of publication, he owned 14 grills. He generally uses wood-burning grills because they create the Maillard reaction, which imparts more flavor to your meat. But he will use gas grills to create a reverse sear on steaks. His preference for wood-burning grills means that his 16-year-old Weber Platinum mostly gathers dust. However, he’s still a fan of the brand. “They make some of the best products before you get into the crazy money,” Johnson told us. “Weber is probably the biggest name in grilling out there.”","Although he favors wood-burning grills, he says it’s all a matter of personal preference: “If someone is just looking to cook hamburgers and hot dogs, a gas grill will work just fine. But when I’m cooking for the family I like to slow everything down. The environment of cooking with the family is more important than blasting meat on a gas grill.” And he said that while a wood-burning grill imparts more flavor, you can get a similar experience with a gas grill. “If you can cook, you can cook on anything. The biggest thing is that you get high-quality meat and proper seasoning. Those two things will increase the quality of the final product.”"]},"id":"359d7bbe-e3d4-4d8d-932b-ba7d5e4529d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/JYsAh8NenQoSDWmrTwcN8C.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/gas-grills/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9IL0ovNzcxNzUxL29yaWdpbmFsL0dhcy1HcmlsbHMtV2ViZXItU3Bpcml0LUlJLUUtMzEwLVRlc3RpbmctMDAyLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JYsAh8NenQoSDWmrTwcN8C.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"JYsAh8NenQoSDWmrTwcN8C","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JYsAh8NenQoSDWmrTwcN8C.jpg","alt":""},"id":"cabad58c-7cac-4b55-ad49-347517d1c647","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How we found the best gas grill</strong>","Our four-member grilling team gathered more than a dozen of the best grills on the market today.

However, if you do run into problems with heat distribution, you can probably confine your cooking to the center of the burner, where the heat will have the most uniformity.<br/><strong><br/>Design</strong>","Most of the grills we reviewed have stainless steel exteriors. When maintained and cleaned properly, most of these grills can stand up to weather, wear, tear and rust. The best grills have grates that are made of cast iron, which delivers a better cooking experience and is easier to clean than stainless steel.","<strong>Portability</strong>","When you buy a gas grill, you should consider what you’ll be using it for and how much you intend to move it. If it’s going to sit on your patio for years, you can probably get a bigger, heavier model like the Nexgrill or Char-Broil Performance. Most of the grills we reviewed have roller wheels, so you can move them around a bit.","But if you take your grill on the road with you, it&#39;s important to be able to move it around easily. Medium-size grills, such as the Weber Spirit II, have larger wheels and fit nicely into a truck bed. However, if space is tight, we recommend smaller models, such as the Coleman RoadTrip X-cursion, and tabletop models like the Cuisinart Petit Gourmet. They fit easily in a trunk or even the back seat of a car. "]},"id":"c5531fda-fd5a-469c-a388-01dc848ba3df","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/xAVCZwkMbLnmNJD77rQzu9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/gas-grills/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9IL0svNzcxNzUyL29yaWdpbmFsL0dhcy1HcmlsbHMtQ2hhci1HcmlsbGVyLUdyaWxsaW4tUHJvLTMwMDEtVGVzdGluZy0wMDEuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xAVCZwkMbLnmNJD77rQzu9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"xAVCZwkMbLnmNJD77rQzu9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xAVCZwkMbLnmNJD77rQzu9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"48c0e15e-1bc2-434d-9ccb-d3cc732a3cb9","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How much does a good gas grill cost?</strong>","You can potentially spend thousands of dollars on a gas grill. However, when we tested, we picked more affordable options, anywhere from $150 to $500. These are all good models that will get your food cooked with almost no problems, so unless you’re an enthusiast or have the money to spare, there’s no reason to shell out big bucks for a grill.","<strong>The best gas grill for $1,000</strong>","We also tested several more expensive gas grills. If you’re willing to spend up to $1,000, we recommend the <a href=\"/weber-genesis-review\">Weber Genesis E-310</a>. This Weber grill is the older sibling of our best overall pick, the Weber Spirit II, and it has the same great qualities with some enhanced features.","You can comfortably fit 24 4-inch burger patties on this grill’s 513-square-inch cooking area. That’s twice the capacity of the Spirit II. The burners on this grill can produce up to 37,500 BTU worth of heat. By contrast the Spirit II produces about 30,000 BTU. In our tests it took this grill 8 minutes and 34 seconds to heat up. And it scored perfectly in our heat consistency tests.","Another thing you get with this model that isn’t available with the Spirit II is a natural gas connection – no conversion kit required. If you happen to have a natural gas hookup at you home, this is a big plus.","Like all Weber Grills, this one is made of solid materials. Other stainless steel grills we reviewed feel somewhat flimsy and cheap. The Genesis II is sturdy, durable and reliable. And with it’s 10-year warranty, you can expect it to last a long time.","There are a couple of things missing on this grill. Chief among them is the lack of side and rear burners. So, if you want to boil some corn or saute vegetables you’ll have to use your stove.","All-in-all though, this is an outstanding grill for the price. If you have regular barbecues, or have a large family, this model is worth the extra cash.","<strong>Reinventing the Original Traeger Grill</strong>","When Traeger released its original wood-pellet grill in 1987, it was a landmark innovation in the world of home-grilling. The company recently announced a reinvented version of its classic model. This next-generation of grills improves on the past with the D2 direct drive technology. This is a drivetrain that features a 20-volt brushless motor with a one-piece direct mounted auger. It represents a major change to how Traeger grills deliver fuel to the fire, which results in more even temperatures because it ramps up and down based on the fuel need.","Each line of Traeger grills has all-new models. The new Pro Series grills have added two inches of cooking space and replaced their circular design with an oval one that raises the grill so you can cook more food. Traeger has also added its WiFire technology to this line, which allows you to control and monitor your grill remotely through the Traeger app.","Traeger’s flagship line, the Timberline, has everything you need for wood-pellet grilling. The one big improvement is its pellet-sensing technology that notifies you, through the app, when your pellets get low.","There&#39;s also an all-new line of grills – the Ironwood. This is a model that sits between the Pro Series and the Timberline. It includes an adjustable two-tier grate system and a double side-wall, which makes it more versatile than the Pro Series. It also replaces the traditional chimney for downdraft technology that improves its smoking capabilities. Unfortunately, it has limited availability and is only sold at the top Traeger retailers.","<strong>Read more:</strong> ","<a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\">Best Turkey Fryers</a><br/><a href=\"/best-grills-review\">Best Grills Overall</a><br/><a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">Best Infrared Grills</a><br/><a href=\"/best-digital-grill-thermometers\">Best Digital Grill Thermometers</a><br/><a href=\"/hottest-gas-grills\">Gas Grills that Get the Hottest</a><br/><a href=\"/gas-grill-large-cooking-area\">Gas Grills with the Largest Cooking Areas</a><br/>"]},"id":"7ef43cda-92ed-4231-a7ef-599e35c04a68","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_63","url":"/best-gas-grills","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
