The durable design and stay-put elastic strap ensure you see where you are going even when the weather turns problematic. It is designed for outdoor activity, and it is specifically made to handle rough environmental conditions. The ABS case that houses the light is impact resistant, and the polycarbonate lens is practically unbreakable. The strap is made of a rubber-elastic blend, so it is both durable enough to withstand heavy use and stretchy enough to snugly fit onto your head. This <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-running-headlamps\">running headlight</a> can even handle being submerged in up to 1 meter of water for up to an hour, so it continues running if splashed or dropped into a puddle.","In addition to the rugged design, this running headlamp also provides plenty of illumination so you can watch where you are going. The single LED provides 14.5 lumens of light at maximum power, so it&#39;s not as bright as other models. It can maintain this light level for up to 6 hours. In low mode, the light emits 6 lumens for up to 12 hours. The beam of light is narrow, so it can be difficult to see the entire road or path ahead without swinging your head from side to side.","This running headlamp isn&#39;t rechargeable. Instead, it uses two AAA batteries, so you need to carry extra batteries if you expect to keep it running for long periods of time. The battery case can be difficult to open, especially in dark conditions when you can&#39;t efficiently see what you are doing. This headlamp comes with a hat clamp, so you can remove the light from the headband and use it as a task light instead of a running light, increasing its usefulness as part of your night running gear collection.","The biggest disadvantage of the Streamlight Enduro is that it doesn&#39;t include many of the features that serious runners use. There is no strobe option to make you visible on dark roads, and there is no red LED you can use for night vision while reading maps.","The Streamlight Enduro LED Headlamp is a fairly basic running headlight, and it doesn&#39;t include many advanced features. However, the low price point makes it an attractive option for beginner runners, especially if you&#39;re just starting to try running at night."]},"id":"d684c6c0-9ead-4a21-bc70-7c04ab2488b0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62540","url":"/streamlight-enduro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:44:20Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:44:20Z","name":"Streamlight Enduro LED","synopsis":"The Streamlight Enduro LED Headlamp lights your run through rugged terrain.
