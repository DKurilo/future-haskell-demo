The handle was angled awkwardly and this vacuum wasn&#39;t all that easy to assemble either. The suction was really good, though, and you can adjust it to fit the specific surfaces you need it to clean.","We poured kitty litter, sawdust and flour onto three types of flooring in our laboratory to simulate different types of messes you may encounter in your home. We made messes on hardwood flooring and two types of carpeting to see how many passes it would take each vacuum to clean up. The Venture took very few passes in all the different scenarios. It struggled a little to clear the flour from the hardwood flooring but still did better than most competitors on that test.","This one was a little on the heavy side but the wheels are well-designed. The handle seemed to be always at the wrong angle. If you need a more user-friendly vacuum cleaner, consider the <a href=\"/dyson-review\">Dyson Cinetic</a>. One noticeably nice thing about the Venture was the quiet operation. It tied for producing the least sound out of all the units we tested. No vacuum cleaner is ever going to be silent, but this one is at least relatively quiet. If you need to vacuum at odd times or when someone is napping you can probably do so without disturbing them.","This is one of the bagged units, which is going to be better for allergy sufferers. It&#39;s pretty easy to empty the bag, and to do it without creating a dust cloud. And the bag has five layers of filtration to trap 99.97 percent of particles, including mold spores, pet dander and pollen.","Oreck really stands by this product in a way that stands out. The Oreck Venture is covered by a seven-year warranty â€“ the only one that long in our canister vacuum reviews."]},"id":"dfd349d5-192d-437c-a001-2cdfde07d0af","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e1fae40a-4add-4a0d-ab7c-6836174e98b8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This tied for the quietest vacuum we tested and it has a significantly longer warranty than most in our comparison.
