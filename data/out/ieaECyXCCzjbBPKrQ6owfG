It&#39;s one of the more affordable models from Hessaire, costing around $175 at the time of publishing this review, though that is higher than the $150 average price of the coolers we reviewed.","The Hessaire MC18M is an excellent portable swamp cooler for large spaces, especially outdoors.

Once it’s in place, the wheels lock to keep the cooler from rolling away.","This Hessaire evaporative cooler has a large, 4.8-gallon water tank.
