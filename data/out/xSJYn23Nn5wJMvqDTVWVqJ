You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","In the world of <a href=\"/best-video-capture-software\">video capture software</a>, CamVerce seems like a program lost in time. It can record your computer screen, but the quality of the recording was the worst of any product we reviewed. It&#39;s also missing some of the most critical features we look for in the best video capture software. As a result, it landed in the bottom tier of our side-by-side comparison chart.","When you launch CamVerce, you&#39;re greeted with the &#34;Tip of the Day,&#34; which gives helpful guidance about how to use the program and its capture tools. The capture tools are sparse. You can record your computer&#39;s full screen, a specific window frame, or you can select a custom area you want to capture. The capture tools work as well as other applications we reviewed, but it&#39;s limited to recording your computer&#39;s screen. If that&#39;s all you want to do, it&#39;s a fine program.","However, other programs on our top 10 lineup do much more. For example, CamVerce is the only video capture software that doesn&#39;t record footage from your computer&#39;s webcam. This would be useful if you wanted to make a &#34;talking-head&#34; video or if you wanted to use your face as a picture-in-picture effect in your project.","Another thing holding CamVerce back is its lackluster editing abilities. The editing module is unlike any video editor we&#39;ve come across. It&#39;s counterintuitive and in desperate need of an interface upgrade. It looks like an editor that was created in the 1990s. Even our video-editing experts had a difficult time navigating the workflow. And if they can&#39;t grasp it, there&#39;s little hope a novice user will make much use of it. For great video editing tooks, the <a href=\"/movavi-screen-capture-studio-review\">Movavi Screen Capture</a> software might be a great choice.","Perhaps this application&#39;s most critical failure is its abysmal video quality. Our video experts examined our test project created by CamVerce. What they found was an extremely pixelated, distorted, jumpy mess they immediately determined to be unwatchable. It was the only program on our lineup to receive an F for its output quality."]},"id":"3c4b3bc7-4e2c-453c-857b-0e9d809ab8b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"946d201c-d2ee-4ba3-94d6-9802db9aa129","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CamVerce failed nearly test we put to it.
