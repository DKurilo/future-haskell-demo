You&#39;ll find that the size, number of racks and number of cooking options increases the cost of a toaster oven. The best typically cost between $40 and $100, with the more expensive options usually being able to take large dishes like large frozen pizzas or even whole chickens or turkey, though you can find plenty of fashionable and affordable toaster ovens at lower prices.","One benefit of a toaster oven is it allows you cook in an apartment, dorm or other housing arrangement that otherwise doesn&#39;t have an oven. Plus, you can store it away if you have limited counter space. Even if you already have an oven, a toaster oven is a great alternative on a hot summer day since it won&#39;t heat up your home like a full-size range. Toaster ovens can also save college students money, since frozen foods like Hot Pockets and pizza are much cheaper than eating out. Toaster ovens do take longer to cook than microwaves, but the results are tastier and more evenly heated. ","<strong>What is the Advantage of a Toaster Oven with Convection?</strong>","A convection toaster oven is a unit with an interior fan. In theory a convection fan helps heat your food quicker than a standard toaster oven, which also helps keeps food from drying out during the cooking process. Quick heating and cook times also help with the exterior temperature of the oven, keeping it lower to help avoid burns if you accidentally touch it somewhere besides the door handle.","We tested both standard and convection toaster ovens for over 80 hours and didn’t see a difference in cook time. Our top pick for the best toaster oven, the <a href=\"/kitchenaid-kco253cu-review\">KitchenAid KCO253CU</a>, has a convection fan. It also remains relatively cool to the touch while in use. Something we learned during our testing is some convection toaster ovens have a switch or button so you can turn the fan on and off at will. Other models, however, turn on the convection fan automatically when you start cooking with the toaster oven.","<strong>Things to Look for in a Toaster Oven</strong> ","Performance<br/>To help you make the best choice for your household, we tested ovens extensively to see how quickly they preheated, how they performed at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, how hot the interior and exterior got, and how well they cooked a variety of foods. Great performance involves consistent temperatures, even heating, a reasonably cool exterior and, most important of all, properly cooked food. ","Design<br/>To decide which toaster oven is best for you, consider the type of cooking you do and the size of your countertop. Depending on how you like to cook, you might want to look for other useful features including the number and type of preset cook functions, built-in timers and adjustable racks. Some people love dial controls, but others might prefer touchpad controls. Most of the toaster ovens we tested can fit six slices of bread inside, while a few can only handle four slices. The larger toaster ovens can handle a medium pizza, while the four-slice toaster ovens can only cook a small pizza."]},"id":"0c7cd4fc-04b3-49f5-bf61-db19d54a1c54","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/2SEP7PqakotzhXBzpZmjmW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/toaster-ovens-black-decker-to1313sbd-4-slice-testing-003/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8yLzQvNzc3Njc2L29yaWdpbmFsL1RvYXN0ZXItT3ZlbnMtQmxhY2stRGVja2VyLVRPMTMxM1NCRC00LVNsaWNlLVRlc3RpbmctMDAzLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SEP7PqakotzhXBzpZmjmW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"2SEP7PqakotzhXBzpZmjmW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SEP7PqakotzhXBzpZmjmW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"cd6655d3-af64-425d-af89-290ea7b8545e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Safety<br/>If you have older children and teens using the toaster oven, safety features are especially important. Only a handful of toaster ovens have automatic rack ejection, which helps prevent burned fingertips and hands, because you don&#39;t have to reach into a small, hot oven to slide the rack out. Other things that can play a big part in your choice are the presence of an automatic shut-off function, how well the oven retains heat and the exterior temperature while food is cooking.","Energy Efficiency<br/>According to <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/ENERGY_STAR_Scoping_Report_Toaster_Ovens.pdf\">Energy Star</a>, toaster ovens produce about 1/3 to 1/2 less energy than a conventional electric oven when used to cook small meals. So, you can save energy by using these devices whenever possible. The toaster ovens in our comparison use between 1,200 and 1,800 watts while most conventional ovens use between 1,000 and 5,000 watts. An additional perk for using a toaster oven in the summer is that it prevents your home from heating up as much as using a regular oven. "]},"id":"77c3f2c7-24ab-4e93-9fd6-55add441cc8f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"68af901f-9fde-4ccf-96e3-7140472e18b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/kitchenaid-kco253cu-review\">Compact Contour Silver Non-Stick Interior Countertop Toaster Oven</a>","<a href=\"/black-decker-cto6335s-review\">Black &amp; Decker CTO6335S</a>","<a href=\"/hamilton-beach-31334-review\">Hamilton Beach 31334</a>","<a href=\"/black-decker-to1675b-review\">Black &amp; Decker TO1675B</a>","<a href=\"/oster-tssttvdfl2-review\">Oster TSSTTVDFL2</a>","<a href=\"/hamilton-beach-31126-review\">Hamilton Beach Easy Reach 31126</a>","<a href=\"/black-decker-to1313sbd-review\">Black &amp; Decker TO1313SBD</a>","<a href=\"/oster-tssttvdgxl-review\">Oster TSSTTVDGXL-SHP</a>","<a href=\"/breville-bov450xl-review\">BOV450XL Toaster Oven, The Mini Smart Oven</a>","<a href=\"/cuisinart-review\">Cuisinart Custom Classic TOB-40</a>","<a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic NB-G110P</a>","<a href=\"/hamilton-beach-toastation-review\">Hamilton Beach Toastation 22708</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"75ca5f7e-284a-4db5-ac84-5181221d8f17","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_167","url":"/best-toaster-ovens","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T22:34:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T22:34:00Z","name":"Best Toaster Ovens of 2019","synopsis":"It outperformed every other toaster in our cooking tests, notably making the best cookies that were golden on top and thoroughly cooked through in the middle in just 10 minutes.","review":{},"strapline":"It outperformed every other toaster in our cooking tests, notably making the best cookies that were golden on top and thoroughly cooked through in the middle in just 10 minutes.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-11T21:52:14Z","id":"Hpx34pWpY4a9nAhrVshTQk","meta":{"title":"Best Toaster Ovens of 2019 - Reviews of Traditional, Convection Ovens","description":"It outperformed every other toaster in our cooking tests, notably making the best cookies that were golden on top and thoroughly cooked through in the middle in just 10 minutes.
