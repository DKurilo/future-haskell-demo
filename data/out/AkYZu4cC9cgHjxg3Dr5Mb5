When you remove a waffle you can refill immediately or let it idle. If you do not refill it right away the grids will cool slightly but they will reheat again quickly, over and over again, until you unplug the unit.","The only possible drawback is also a potential benefit, depending on your household – this waffle maker produces a pretty small finished product. It measures right around 6.5 inches across and is one of the thinnest waffles of the ones we made during testing. The small size can be awesome if you like to freeze them and toast them up later – big Belgian waffles won&#39;t fit in most toasters – but if you have a large crowd gathered around waiting for waffles, the relatively small size might be a drawback.
