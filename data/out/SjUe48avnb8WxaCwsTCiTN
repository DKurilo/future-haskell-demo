The design of this machine is uncompromising as far as grass trimmers are concerned, and it eschews all attachments in favor of simple grass cutting. Stihl machines are durable and come with a great warranty.","This gas trimmer makes yard work easy in a variety of ways. It comes with an easy-start 27.2 cc, two-cycle engine that will work reliably for years to come. This engine requires a mixed fuel to work properly. The tank for the gas and oil mix can hold 11.5 ounces of fuel, which is sufficient, since you&#39;ll only use this model for trimming grass.","At 12.5 pounds, this weed eater is light, so you can direct its straight shaft around porches, trees and fences. The unit comes with anti-vibration functionality that decreases muscle strain. The D-shaped handle on this yard trimmer is adjustable to accommodate users of varying heights.","This weed trimmer incorporates a trimmer head with a 16.5-inch cutting swath. You can fit two debris shields on this machine; the one that comes with the unit supplements line-based trimmer heads with a bump-feed feature. The other debris shield is an optional add-on that works with heavy-duty blades intended for thick patches of grass. Those heavy-duty blades and a couple types of shoulder straps are the only accessories that work with this trimmer. If you want multi-tool functionality, Stihl offers a trimmer model for this purpose.","Stihl has a number of support features. The most important is the lifetime guarantee on the driveshaft, in addition to a two-year warranty on the entire unit. If you need repairs or maintenance assistance, you can take this gas trimmer to an approved Stihl service center or consult the online manual. Stihl customer service agents are available by email, but not by phone."]},"id":"de988ed0-9a4d-4776-ae31-4bbb5b7ee27d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b6f0ca78-7b60-4a93-a6da-9b501b6f0dd9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you only need to trim grass and weeds on your property, the Stihl FS 56 RC-E is well equipped for the task.
