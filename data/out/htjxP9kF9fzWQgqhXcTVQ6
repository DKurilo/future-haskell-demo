Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The DV50 is another high-performing, large-capacity <a href=\"/best-dryers\">clothes dryer</a> from Samsung. With 15 dryer cycles, including specialty cycles that will dry your delicates, jeans and towels, to name a few, this device will take care of all of your drying needs. Even more important than the number of cycles is how effectively each cycle dries. The Samsung DV50 is also one of the quietest electric dryers and you may forget at times that it is even on. The Bulky cycle is one of those inconsistent cycles that can be problematic on many machines, but this machine dries bulky items, like comforters and sleeping bags, without issue.","The control panel is easy to navigate with its clearly marked cycles and options. The button options surrounding the LED screen, like the Drum Light, Wrinkle Prevent and Signal On/Off buttons, should depress, but they don’t. This can be a little disconcerting at first, but you’ll soon get over it when you see how quickly and effectively the machine responds. The controls are very easy to read and the dryer is equally easy to use.","This dryer is consistent across all of its cycles and each one does what it is programmed to do without hassles. In the general marketplace, sensor dryers are inconsistent in their performance among different cycles. That is not the case with this dryer and all the cycles work equally well. The cycles have estimated dry times of less than an hour, some like Jeans and Heavy Duty, at about an hour, while most others are estimated well below that mark. It may not perfectly meet or beat the estimated time, but it will consistently come close.","This machine lets you adjust for five different dryness levels, in case you want to retain a little moisture for ironing, for instance. Speaking of ironing, this dryer has a wrinkle prevent function and several steam cycle options that will help reduce wrinkling, though it won’t always eliminate it. It will, however, always freshen your clothes as well as consistently remove unwanted odors. It also has an anti-static option. You can manually adjust the dryer for any time between 20 minutes and an hour, and you can customize your own preset cycles.","As a NSF-certified product, the manufacturer promises that this dryer will eliminate 99.9 percent of household bacteria from your laundry.","The smart technology on this dryer lets you diagnose problems through your smartphone, with the download of a Smart Care app. The app will provide a diagnosis and remotely notify the manufacturer, instead of making you do the guesswork and forcing you to wait for a service call. It won’t, however, allow you to do things like change dryer settings or monitor what is happening with the cycle through your smartphone when you’re away from home as other, pricier dryers do. The remote diagnosis is a nice feature, though, and makes troubleshooting much easier."]},"id":"865be178-1db5-4db2-ad74-bf20bc10b1c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"927f308e-02d5-452a-971d-eee3030b6222","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With a plethora of options, features and cycles, the Samsung DV50 is one of the best dryers in our lineup of clothes dryer reviews.
