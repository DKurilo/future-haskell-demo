This is especially true for students and families who have never been through the student loan process before.  It can seem intimidating to try and make the right choice without a lot of information. It&#39;s easy to see that there is a lot of information available, and that it&#39;s organized easily so that individuals can read quickly through the process of obtaining student loans, find what help there is available, and more.

First and foremost, they have a secure site, meaning that when you enter your account and personal information into their databases, it is encrypted before being sent over the internet.  This makes it virtually impossible for someone to utilize your information to steal your identity or hurt your credit. This is a very positive thing, especially when you&#39;re just starting out.","Calculators allow you to determine an estimate of what your monthly student loan payments might be, and you have the option of viewing your account online so you can keep track of what is owed and what is paid.  This is very convenient, as most students and their parents lead extremely busy lives.  Rather than waiting for a statement with a summary or having to contact a representative, those students can simply login to their accounts and access the information they need from the comfort of their own computer chairs.  Nelnet is a Better Business Bureau accredited company, meaning that they&#39;ve agreed to follow the strict guidelines of the Better Business Bureau when it comes to the customer service and support they offer.","There are a number of tips and advice available on the website, which are designed to help students become informed and make educated decisions regarding their futures.  From preparing to apply for student loans to planning your career after college life, the website contains tips and advice that can be utilized throughout the student&#39;s schooling process and even after that.  The level of information on Nelnet is absolutely beneficial to all students and parents who utilize the site.","The scholarship search allows students to find scholarships they may be eligible for, to help cut costs and receive financial breaks.  There is also a test preparation help option, with practice tests available for a number of tests including SAT, GED, MCAT, ACT and many more.  This is an added bonus that can really help increase the student&#39;s chances of passing their tests and moving on with their lives.  The practice tests contain the same type of questions and information that will be on the real test, allowing students to prepare  themselves over a period of time and increasing their chances of passing the tests.  Nelnet is very competitive when it comes to the features they offer, and you&#39;d be hard-pressed to find an online student loan company that offered more features."]},"id":"fa8be1cf-c2c3-4085-a90b-40c1fe6ececd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Repayment"},"id":"075c887e-eef9-4a5a-a427-cc89cb688036","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Help and support from a student loan company is also very important.

Payments are made through KwikPay.  Students have the option of setting up their account to make a one-time payment or recurring payments, so that the money is taken as it&#39;s due and you don&#39;t have to worry about remembering the due date. This can help reduce the instances of late payments and late fees.  There is also the option of making payments through your bank&#39;s online banking system.  However, if you&#39;d prefer the traditional method of sending your payment through the mail, that option is available as well.  If you suddenly remember that the deadline is upon you and you haven&#39;t paid, you can make an overnight payment to quickly get the money in and avoid late fees.","With the KwikPay option, you&#39;re unable to determine how the payment is distributed between your active loans, so they will be distributed evenly.  In addition, when you make a payment over the phone, there is a $6 fee.  Payments are always applied to the interest first, then the principal amount.  Nelnet seems to be very flexible in regards to payment and payment options, making them a competitive student loan company in this department.  Loan payments are dependent, of course, upon several things – including a student&#39;s financial situation and what they&#39;ve qualified for through the FAFSA, the student&#39;s personal credit score and more.
