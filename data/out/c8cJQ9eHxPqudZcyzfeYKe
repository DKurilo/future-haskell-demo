If you paired these speakers with a subwoofer, the audio performance would be impressive. Overall, the performance is exceptionally balanced when compared to other speakers. I suspect the reason the low end didn&#39;t perform as well as some speakers is because of the grille, which isn&#39;t designed to move air as freely as other grilles.

In our frequency tests, however, the first audible tone was about 35 Hz, which is closer to the lowest note on a standard-tuned bass guitar.
