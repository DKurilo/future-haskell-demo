This is not a fly-by-night company. BrightWork first incorporated in 1995 and started out building compatibilities for Lotus Notes, eventually becoming one of its premium partners. In 2000, the company was approached by Microsoft to join the SharePoint 2001 JDP (Joint Development Program), and TeamCentral for Sharepoint was released soon after. The company trademarked BrightWork in 2003 and became a Microsoft Gold Partner in 2005. Since then, it has rolled out numerous releases and has solutions that are compatible with all versions of SharePoint. One of the major advantages of BrightWork&#39;s compatibility with SharePoint is that most medium and large organizations already use SharePoint. They are familiar with how to use it and understand the features it lacks in terms of project tracking. BrightWork fills that niche and provides project and portfolio management alongside a time-tested collaboration tool that companies already use.","Interested in developing long-term partnerships, BrightWork provides extensive training and a choice of contract commitments. Training includes role-specific training, self-help tools and deployment consulting. The company also offers flexible deployment options to support any preference, including on-premise, a jump-start package and online month-to-month contracts. All accounts include free access to users outside the corporation who are not paid members.","<strong>Who Uses BrightWork?</strong>"]},"id":"1719c8d7-4316-4997-8ae5-f270ff18224f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/6xfveoSubEoxSUavDBLyS7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/7985/project-and-por-5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6xfveoSubEoxSUavDBLyS7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6xfveoSubEoxSUavDBLyS7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6xfveoSubEoxSUavDBLyS7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"fd5025ed-d774-4f63-b1cf-fe1a7ba2dd8b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The companies that use BrightWork are most often mid-size firms that already use a handful of business solutions and desire a project management solution that can complement the systems they use already.
