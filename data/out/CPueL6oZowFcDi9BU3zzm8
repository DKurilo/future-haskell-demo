The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-electric-razors\">Electric Razors</a> here.</em>","In an effort to provide you with the most comfortable shave possible, Braun created the CT5cc. This electric razor is a pioneer of a technology that cools your skin as you shave. Heat is a primary cause of skin irritation when using an electric razor. The CT5cc aims to eliminate that heat and give you a very comfortable shave. In order to cool your skin down, there is a ceramic element placed between the foils of the shaving head. This element remains cool to the touch during a shave, which provides your skin with a refreshing feeling.","The CT5cc comes equipped with a long-hair trimmer. If you have waited a few days in between shaving, it is important to trim your beard down to a size that the electric razor&#39;s shaving head can handle more easily. The handle also features a foil blade designed to catch hairs that grow in any direction, leaving you with a smoother shave.","The battery in the CT5cc is lithium ion, which equates to quick charging and long battery life. With a single hour of charging, you can expect the CT5cc to run for 45 minutes. However, if you are using the cooling feature, then the battery will only last for about 15 minutes. If you&#39;re planning on taking this electric shaver with you on vacation and don&#39;t want to bring the base, you should probably refrain from using the cooling feature.","The base unit that comes with the CT5cc acts as both a charging and cleaning station. When you&#39;re finished after a shave, you can clean the electric razor under running water or place it in the base. With the touch of a button, the base will clean, charge and lubricate the foil. It&#39;s important to note that the cleaning solution in the stand is alcohol, which means you should avoid shaving with foam or gel. According to the manufacturer&#39;s website, shaving foams and gels do not play nice with the cleaning solution and the combination could damage the CT5cc.","The best electric shaver provides you with ease of use, a close shave and comfort. The Braun CT5cc has many features that give you a close shave and provide you with a refreshing and comfortable feeling afterwards."]},"id":"66811e8b-1e3c-4285-9b5e-4cfd086eee92","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58054","url":"/braun-cooltec-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T20:02:43Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T20:02:43Z","name":"Braun CT5cc","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-30T20:02:43Z","id":"CPueL6oZowFcDi9BU3zzm8","meta":{"title":"Braun CT5cc Electric Razor Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
