You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The BOSS BV9378NV is an <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">in-dash navigation system</a> that has smartphone connectivity and preloaded maps of the United States and Puerto Rico, similar to systems like the <a href=\"/soundstream-review\">Soundstream VRN-65HB</a> and the <a href=\"/pioneer-review\">Pioneer AVIC-5200NEX</a>. With a large display, impressive media features and a lengthy warranty, the BV9378NV is a great value at its low price.","Like all the other aftermarket navigation systems we reviewed, the BOSS can play DVDs as well as CDs. You can also play streaming audio or satellite radio, or opt for saved media files in a variety of formats like MP3 or FLAC. The double-din unit offers flexible connectivity for external devices like smartphones, MP3 players, rear cameras and various storage media. Bluetooth makes it easy to connect your Android, iOS or Windows smartphone to play media, use apps or take a phone call. The included remote control allows rear-seat passengers to change the song or put on a movie. Steering wheel integration allows you to use volume controls built into your steering wheel.","The 6.5-inch digital TFT LCD monitor is the second largest of any in our comparison, and it has an 800 x 480-pixel resolution. You can adjust a variety of settings, including the screen brightness. It features multiple ports, including USB, SD, AV, aux, rear camera and steering wheel control input. It also has front, rear and sub pre-amp outputs. The built-in preset equalizer lets you enhance the sound for many genres of music, while the ID 3 tag shows the band name, song title and other information on your display.","The GPS navigation system ships with a one-year standard manufacturer warranty. If you purchase the system directly through the manufacturer, you can opt to purchase an extended warranty for two years. You can contact the company’s customer service team by email or telephone, whichever you prefer, or you can reach out to them via their social media presence. There’s also a variety of educational resources hosted on the company’s website that you can peruse at your leisure.","The BOSS BV9378NV has outstanding device compatibility and media playback capacities, making for a decent in-dash system. Although it could have more smartphone integration and navigation abilities, the unit is still a great deal and one of the better values on the in-dash navigation market."]},"id":"3e66900e-4eb0-4b8c-aec8-aed78f74995f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69231","url":"/boss-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-04-17T14:30:41Z","datePublished":"2017-04-17T14:30:41Z","name":"BOSS BV9378NV","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-04-17T14:30:41Z","id":"9oFmPBCLGbyqFe3PutQis3","meta":{"title":"BOSS BV9378NV Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Boss BV9378NV has a large screen and plenty of entertainment options.
