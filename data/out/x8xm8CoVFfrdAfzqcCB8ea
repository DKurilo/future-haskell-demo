You can plug your devices directly in the panels or you can purchase an additional external pack for energy storage. The solar power kit comes with two standard ports, a USB and DC output, and has a voltage regulator that prevents your phone or laptop from getting damaged. It’s suitable for an outdoor environment with a water-resistant canvas. It’s also compact and light, meaning it won’t take up much space in your camping bag.","The design of the portable solar power system consists of six folding panels. When folded, the Poweradd 40 watt is about the size of a large magazine. It does take up a lot of ground unfolded. Completely laid out, the unit is about 5 feet long. The panels are designed to start charging your devices directly, but you can expect a long wait for a full charge. The best option is to purchase an external battery pack and charge it back at basecamp, then use the pack to charge your electronics.","The portable solar generator comes with a USB port and a DC port for charging 18-volt laptops and other DC-powered devices. There are 10 notebook connectors included that fit a variety of brands. If you plan to use the solar panels primarily for powering a laptop, you should make sure your laptop is compatible. There’s also a small pocket in the front, so you can plug in your phone and place it in the pocket out of the sun. The manufacturer also provides a 12-month worry-free warranty and has 24/7 technical support through its website.","This is a good solar power kit  in terms of portability and powering smaller devices. The 40-watt capacity is high for its size and weight. The multiple attachments should work with almost any laptop brand you own. Most importantly, it isn’t complicated. It is easy to unfold, set up and start using. It doesn&#39;t have an external battery storage option, but it’s a small detail in an otherwise solid solar power kit."]},"id":"6ded50ec-b06f-45d8-b2ff-fb010176ff53","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61708","url":"/poweradd-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:29:04Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:29:04Z","name":"Poweradd 40W Solar Panel B00M16KLM8","synopsis":"The Poweradd 40W Solar Panel is an efficient solar battery charger that is notable for its 22 percent solar conversion rate.
