Jena means endurance, probably referring to the eight-hour battery life this device boasts. The Jena has several useful features, like a room thermometer and two-way talk. It has many of the features we look for in our baby video monitor reviews.","The Jena is a good video monitor that earns its place in our lineup. Some of its standout features include a 500-foot secure signal transmission range and 15-foot night-vision range, both of which should give you all of the range you need. The Jena&#39;s lullaby feature is useful, coming preprogrammed with five lullabies. Another great feature is the two-way talk, which allows you to calm your baby with your voice from the next room.","This baby video monitor comes with a room thermometer, one of the less-common features. One of the perks of the temperature sensor is that if your baby is being fussy, you can see whether the temperature is a possible reason for your baby&#39;s discomfort.","You can expand this video baby monitor to up to four cameras. If you anticipate needing to monitor multiple rooms in the future, this feature increases the product&#39;s long-term usefulness.<br/>The camera does have a nightlight, but it&#39;s on the weak side. It won&#39;t bother your baby, but it also may not do much soothing. The audio and video clarity are more than adequate, though neither will wow you. We were disappointed that the Jena doesn&#39;t have an AV output. This means you can&#39;t transfer the video feed to a TV or other viewing device.","When it comes to help and support, Levana is very good. The live chat is a great service, and the live chat operators are helpful. The company also has useful online support, with FAQs and online PDF manuals that answer many of the questions you may have."]},"id":"0f310926-4c21-41fb-94d4-aca978427552","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dbde57c6-c0c7-4055-b7f0-97842b2a92af","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The bottom line with the Levana Jena is that it is a monitor that does what it is designed to do and does it, for the most part, well.

It doesn&#39;t have a lot of unique or extra features, but for many parents, the Levana Jena will be more than enough."]},"id":"be087bc5-2b2e-4ddf-8254-33d0633db209","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56528","url":"/levana-jena-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-29T17:25:43Z","datePublished":"2013-05-29T17:25:43Z","name":"Levana Jena","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
