Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The T3 Featherweight 2 is a lightweight blow dryer that reduces frizz and increases your hair’s shine and volume. This <a href=\"/best-hair-dryers\">professional blow dryer</a> features SoftAire and tourmaline technology, which helps keep your hair healthy. Additionally, it features 1,800 watts of power.","The Featherweight 2 rated highly among our testers for its lightweight, well-balanced design and great air speed. We were surprised to hear that most of our testers didn&#39;t mind the noise level of this hair dryer, which we measured at 94 decibels. Although it is one of the loudest devices in our hair dryer reviews, the sound isn&#39;t high-pitched or whiny.","The settings on this hair blow dryer are similar to those of comparable products. It has three heat settings, ranging between 80 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. This wide temperature range allows you to choose the right temperature for your particular hair type. It also features two speed settings – high and low –which we measured at 16 mph and 23 mph.","This blow dryer has up to 1,800 watts of power. The high wattage provides plenty of heat and strength to dry thick hair, while the low settings and temperatures are ideal for thin and fine hair.","The T3 Featherweight 2 provides SoftAire technology, which is designed to reduce frizz and increase your hair’s shine. It also helps hair stay moist and prevents it from overdrying. The tourmaline technology dries your hair quickly without causing extensive damage.","This blow dryer has a user-friendly design. We weighed it at 15.3 ounces, which makes it extremely lightweight to the point that this could be a good travel blow dryer. It has a 9-foot power cord, which is one of the longest cords we have seen in our review.","The accessories included with this professional blow dryer didn’t meet our full expectations. This product only includes a concentrator attachment, which allows you to direct airflow to certain areas of your hair. While our testers stated that the concentrator did work well, the device lacks a diffuser tool for keeping curls intact. If you want a blow dryer that comes with a diffuser, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic Nanoe</a>.","The T3 Featherweight 2 comes with a two-year warranty, which is an average warranty length for a professional blow dryer. The best blow dryer warranties are five years or more. If you need to speak with a customer service representative, the company has email and telephone options."]},"id":"b5420b24-0b0d-484e-891c-3f21b777e786","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d9aa752b-c0a9-4c3f-ae58-2a64614ffd28","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The T3 Featherweight 2 provides many benefits, such as fast drying times and SoftAire and tourmaline technology.
