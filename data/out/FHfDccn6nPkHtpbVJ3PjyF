You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The MDHearingAid FIT is for active adults who need a small and unobtrusive <a href=\"/best-hearing-aids\">digital hearing aid</a>. Unlike behind-the-ear models, like the <a href=\"/simplicity-hi-fi-review\">Simplicity Hi Fi</a> and <a href=\"/hi-bte-review\">hi BTE</a>, this hearing aid fits into your ear canal and outer ear like a custom earpiece and delivers quality sound without the need to insert an ear bud into the ear canal. This device is for those with mild to moderately severe hearing loss.","This hearing aid features a completely in-the-ear design that eliminates the need for parts in the ear canal or behind your ear. However, if you prefer to have a closed fit, it comes with domes that you insert into your ear canal. The device features four sound-processing programs to give you control based on your listening environment. The programs start at level one for everyday conversations or watching TV and increase to level four for noisy parties or large crowds. There is also a volume dial that lets you adjust your level of amplification and an on-off switch.","The FIT hearing aid allows for natural air movement, and its design permits you to use the telephone naturally, without the need for telecoil. The shape of each aid is specific to the ear in which it&#39;s placed, which is important to note so you order the correct one.","This digital hearing aid features Layered Noise Reduction technology to help reduce background noise and Advanced Noise Reduction to enhance the clarity of speech so you can focus on your conversation. An Advanced Feedback Cancellation feature is designed to eliminate whistling sounds while the Wide Dynamic Range Compression feature helps amplify soft sounds.","When you purchase an MDHearingAid FIT you receive a carrying case, size 10 batteries, a cleaning tool and ear domes in three different sizes for a customized fit. The closed domes come in 7.8 mm, 8.0 mm and 8.5 mm sizes, so you can pick the one that feels the most comfortable. The manufacturer offers a 90-day warranty against factory defects and a 45-day satisfaction guarantee. It’s recommended you try a new hearing aid for at least 21 days to determine is true effectiveness.","This in-the-ear hearing aid is ideal for active adults who want a small yet effective hearing device that is virtually unobtrusive or an alternative to the behind-the-ear models. Although it features noise reduction and feedback cancellation technology, it is a basic aid that does not offer advanced features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or smartphone capability."]},"id":"6a7acf37-1a24-4b33-b2c2-9c1f9c5ee262","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66646","url":"/mdhearingaid-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-21T20:46:10Z","datePublished":"2015-08-21T20:46:10Z","name":"MDHearingAid FIT","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-21T20:46:10Z","id":"FHfDccn6nPkHtpbVJ3PjyF","meta":{"title":"MDHearingAid FIT Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The MDHearingAid FIT allows you to amplify a wide range of sounds and enjoy conversations with friends.
