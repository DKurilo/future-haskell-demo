While the average optical quality score of microscopes in our review was 67 percent, this one had a score of 85 percent. We could see both transparent slides and 3D objects fairly clearly. The only issue we found is that the display tends to be more dark than light. We were sometimes unable to see small details on thick objects, such as a bee&#39;s leg or a blade of grass. This was relatively minor, as we had no issues in viewing any other types of object. This children&#39;s microscope isn&#39;t the best at optics, but it certainly isn&#39;t the worse.
