The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">Infrared Grills</a> here.</em>","The Patio Bistro by Char-Broil is an infrared grill with some unusual features. Chief among them is the way Char-Broil chose to power the infrared grill. You will not find hookups for natural gas or even propane on this grill, nor is there anywhere to load charcoal. This little infrared grill plugs into your wall to draw power, just like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner. We were ambivalent when we first learned this about the Patio Bistro, but it won us over as a functional, worthy grill, if a basic one.","Not all barbecue lovers live in a place that accommodates large, restaurant-style infrared BBQ grills. If you have a big yard with lots of room and a large grilling budget, then you might prefer one of our top-rated grills over the Patio Bistro. However, if you live in an apartment with a balcony or a duplex with a small patio, then the Patio Bistro is worth looking into.","Convenience and small stature are the Patio Bistro&#39;s main selling points. In addition to heating its infrared element via electrical outlet, it only stands about 3 feet tall and weighs a paltry 50 pounds. This makes the Patio Bistro great for small spaces. Unlike its larger and weightier cousins that you can&#39;t simply wheel off and forget about when you&#39;re not using them, the Patio Bistro can easily sit unused in a corner when you don&#39;t need it.","When you are ready to grill some burgers for dinner or a small party, just plug the Patio Bistro into the wall. Unlike almost all the other infrared grills we reviewed, though, the Patio Bistro takes a while to heat up. The long heat-up time means this grill won&#39;t achieve the same searing temperatures of infrared gas grills. That&#39;s a letdown, but understandable considering its power source.","The cooking area on this grill measures just 240 square inches. That&#39;s less than half the cooking space available on larger grills, yet still enough to cook hamburgers or grill a few steaks. This infrared grill uses a single cooking grate coated in porcelain, which is the same material used on our top-rated product in this category. This is great because porcelain-coated grills last much longer than regular stainless steel grates.","The hood of this infrared grill does have enough space to include a warming rack. It&#39;s rather small – you can barely fit three burgers on it – but it&#39;s there. Some features we looked for on infrared grills that are not on the Patio Bistro include a smoker box, side burner and rotisserie. But on a grill whose primary function is bringing grilling to small spaces, there just isn&#39;t enough real estate to include these niceties."]},"id":"ecce1aa5-1ee5-4afa-b2a4-29a3f1b4982e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"90203b59-32f1-437c-925e-4871e094a594","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This infrared grill is great for apartment balconies or small patios with limited space.

It&#39;s not a powerhouse grill, but if you&#39;re looking for convenient grilling in small spaces, the Patio Bistro lives up to its name."]},"id":"ab1e7b8e-2bae-4246-96d3-9fd26e96ba75","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52772","url":"/patio-bistro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
