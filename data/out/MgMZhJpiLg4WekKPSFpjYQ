there are editing and sharing features in this software, at its core, Proxima Photo Manager 2013 is all about photo organization and management, and it lets you tag, sort and share your images easily. This <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo manager software</a> provides a list of your folders on a panel similar to what you see in your computer&#39;s folder drive, so you have quick access to your files; there&#39;s no importing or waiting for your images to appear. Since it is an older program, some of the sharing and editing tools, while not horrible, didn&#39;t provide us as much creative freedom in our testing as other programs. Still, considering the low price, I&#39;d say this program is especially good for people who just want basic organizing tools.","Other photo manager programs try to cram advanced editing, organizing and sorting features into one space. However, I found Proxima’s interface refreshingly simple for a photo organizer. New images sit in a folder list in the right panel, while you view your images in the middle and select actions on the left panel. You can customize the top toolbar to suit your preferences, which means you&#39;ll have easy access to the tools you use the most.","This photo management software has some useful organization features like duplicate searches and batch tools. If you have a lot of copies of an image with different edits and you want to eliminate the extra files, a duplicate search can thin your photo collection to the essentials. The batch tools allowed me to resize, convert, rename and rotate a large group of images at once. For batch renaming, I suggest adding a date first then tags and qualifiers, so your image names look something like 2018.Vacation_Mexico [34]. This makes your photos easier to distinguish.","Unlike most other programs, Proxima does not allow you to export your images directly to social media, email or disc. However, it can create web galleries and slideshows to share your photos. Creating a web gallery only takes a couple of minutes, and the program provides templates and settings to create a web album with your photos. The software provides layouts and a range of thumbnail and full image sizes. Proxima&#39;s slideshows are easy to make because they can start with one mouse click, but I found that convenience comes at the cost of customization. You can&#39;t choose slide length and music or make other adjustments that are standard in other photo manager software. If making incredible slideshows is interesting to you, visit our <a href=\"/best-photo-slideshow-software\">Photo Slideshow Software</a> comparison to see which ones we ranked the best.","Although Proxima is far from an all-purpose photo editor, this program does have balanced editing features. The tools are simple enough for beginners to use but still cover the basic essential adjustments pros want. There&#39;s no content-aware removal or cosmetic editing available in Proxima to easily remove blemishes or distracting elements. If you want a program that does offer these tools, you might want to consider <a href=\"/photo-director-review\">PhotoDirector</a>.","In Proxima&#39;s editing tab, you can adjust exposure, color balance, hue, saturation and white balance as well as correcting red eye. You can also sharpen or smooth your image, as well as play with grayscale and inverted colors. In addition, there are several tools to remove noise in low-light images.","Proxima is all about organization and photo management. You won&#39;t find too many extra features in this program, but if you want a streamlined photo manager, this may be a good choice. Sorting features include batch tools, duplicate searches and tagging to find photos easily. Images import quickly and directly into the program as well. While it lacks pizazz in the sharing and editing categories, Proxima accomplishes most management tasks."]},"id":"9dcd92ba-df3e-4dc2-9759-ecb716bb36c8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60516","url":"/proxima-photo-manager-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-15T23:00:41Z","datePublished":"2014-09-15T23:00:41Z","name":"Proxima Photo Manager 2013","synopsis":"While there are editing and sharing features in this software, at its core, Proxima Photo Manager 2013 is all about photo organization and management, and it lets you tag, sort and share your images easily.","review":{"rating":58,"verdict":"While Proxima lacks advanced features and sharing capabilities, this software can organize and sort photos quickly and effectively.","pros":["The program&#8217;s simple interface and tools make this a good choice for beginners or photographers with large image databases."],"cons":["You can create slideshows, but you can&#039;t do much to customize them."]},"strapline":"While there are editing and sharing features in this software, at its core, Proxima Photo Manager 2013 is all about photo organization and management, and it lets you tag, sort and share your images easily.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","id":"MgMZhJpiLg4WekKPSFpjYQ","meta":{"title":"Proxima Photo Manager Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While Proxima lacks advanced features and sharing capabilities, this software can organize and sort photos quickly and effectively."},"products":[{"slug":"proxima-photo-manager-2013","url":"/product/proxima-photo-manager-2013","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","name":"Proxima Photo Manager 2013","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","id":"zvzkCUhF6SuEw6PM7pFpoC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5nNjQzqpjeKDnjT6MsgDfD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","mimeType":"","name":"8cbe77d0bb6695d4a4ae1c826093c2ce.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8cbe77d0bb6695d4a4ae1c826093c2ce.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","id":"5nNjQzqpjeKDnjT6MsgDfD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5nNjQzqpjeKDnjT6MsgDfD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Proxima Photo Manager Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While Proxima lacks advanced features and sharing capabilities, this software can organize and sort photos quickly and effectively."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5nNjQzqpjeKDnjT6MsgDfD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","mimeType":"","name":"8cbe77d0bb6695d4a4ae1c826093c2ce.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8cbe77d0bb6695d4a4ae1c826093c2ce.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","id":"5nNjQzqpjeKDnjT6MsgDfD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5nNjQzqpjeKDnjT6MsgDfD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Proxima Photo Manager Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While Proxima lacks advanced features and sharing capabilities, this software can organize and sort photos quickly and effectively."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/proxima-photo-manager-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"photo-software","url":"/hobbies/photo-software","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","name":"Photo Software","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:15Z","id":"VW4y9RdMbVZFvSGe6M26Kb","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
