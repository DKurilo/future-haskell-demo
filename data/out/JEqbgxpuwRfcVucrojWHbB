This will save you both time and money. The PEM585 comes with a carafe that can hold all four ounces, but you can make espresso in your cappuccino cup if you prefer. You can also use the manual controls to set the machine to make smaller shots of latte.","The Premium PEM585 doesn&#39;t come with a tamper, but tamping coffee grounds is not necessary for this machine to function properly. A measuring tool is included so that you don&#39;t accidentally overfill the stainless steel filter. None of the cappuccino makers in the Premium PEM series are capable of brewing pods.","Espresso is brewed quickly; however, the portafilter doesn&#39;t seem to secure tightly enough in place. Water and espresso easily leak from around the machine. Reducing the amount of coffee grounds in the filter may help a little, but it comes at the cost of a stronger tasting brew. The drip tray catches most of the liquid, so a small, handy kitchen towel may be all that is needed to pick up any excess.","The drip tray of this cappuccino maker is partially removable. The grate comes off so you can wipe the catcher. This makes cleanup a bit easier and more efficient since more area can be reached. Other espresso machines we reviewed have completely removable drip trays, which helps reduce bacteria and calcium buildup.","The frothing wand is adjustable, so you can steam or foam milk to top your coffee drink. The wand cannot move and its position is awkward, which makes frothing difficult. It is also very short, so you can&#39;t use too deep of a cup, otherwise your milk will not be evenly heated.","The Premium PEM series models come with a concealed cord so you can store the espresso maker safely away. It also has a short cord and polarized plug to help reduce the risk of shock and burns to both adults and children.","Premium has a variety of customer service options. You can find an email address and telephone numbers listed on the Premium website. An online contact form is also available to fill out online. Telephone service is only available for a few hours during business days. You can download user manuals online that include simple operating instructions."]},"id":"4757e45b-a141-45d2-8074-16122b18a72b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"61678e25-b443-47b8-80fc-5f9e9af63cbf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though it lacks some of the functions and features of the best espresso machines, the Premium PEM585 is simple to set up and use.
