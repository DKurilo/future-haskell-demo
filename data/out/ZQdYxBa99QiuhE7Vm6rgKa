The Fire tablets have great capabilities and power, but the <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/amazon-tablet-guide\">Kindle</a> eBook readers continue to make major improvements and prove that dedicated eReaders are great devices. This eReader has excellent resolution and a battery life of up to 21 hours. It may lack the overall capabilities of a Fire tablet, but it is an excellent leap forward for eBook readers.","You can use the Kindle Voyage to read eBooks, magazines, newspapers and comics, all of which you can download from the Amazon store. Since it is a dedicated eBook reader, you cannot watch movies or listen to MP3s on the Voyage.","The biggest improvements to the Kindle Voyage are in its design. The new glass screen is microetched to reduce glare, and it gives the surface a paper-like feel. The screen resolution is higher than other eReaders, so if you&#39;re reading a newspaper or comic, the images look crisp. This eReader only displays black-and-white images, though, so you may not want to use the Voyage for new issues of X-Men and Batman.","You can use the touchscreen to turn pages, but haptic buttons are also located on either side of the screen. The right button turns the page to the right, and the left button turns to the left. When you gently press the button, the device sends a vibration to your thumb to show it registered your command.","The Kindle Voyage is front lit, similar to the Paperwhite. You can adjust the brightness manually, but it also automatically adjusts. When you read in the dark, the screen starts out bright, but as your eyes adjust to the dark, it lowers its brightness to reduce eyestrain. These improvements to the Voyage are also improvements to the technology of eReaders in general."]},"id":"674de649-693f-42e8-8180-e71dac848ef9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"eb145812-edbc-41f5-a9b2-7a97918c8168","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kindle Voyage does not have the multimedia capabilities of the Fire tablets, but as an eReader, it is one of the best devices we&#39;ve used.
