This experience has helped inform many of our conclusions about other HVAC equipment. We apply exacting standards to each pr­oduct we test, primarily focusing on performance and user-friendliness. We design our tests to simulate typical consumer experiences rather than focusing on numbers you need an engineering degree to understand.","When, as in the case of portable evaporative coolers, we aren&#39;t able to test the physical products, we apply the same due diligence to make sure our information and conclusions reflect the mission of Top Ten Reviews.","During our research, we found helpful guides on evaporative cooling from the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/home-cooling-systems/evaporative-coolers\">U.S. Department of Energy</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://www.nachi.org/evap-coolers.htm\">International Association of Certified Home Inspectors</a>. While these guides focus mainly on rooftop models, we recommend you take a look if you want more information on how evaporative cooling works.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","While writing this guide, we researched eight portable evaporative cooler manufacturers and evaluated the specifications and energy efficiency of 10 models. Our research to date has taken over 75 hours.","We aren&#39;t able to test portable evaporative coolers in-house at Top Ten Reviews due to installation requirements and uncontrollable environmental conditions in our lab. Instead, we researched each product’s performance, features and warranties as reflected in manufacturer specifications and online customer reviews. Our final decisions and suggestions, as well as how we interpreted the coolers’ specifications, are informed by years of experience with general product testing and evaluations.","<strong>What to Expect: Price and Efficacy</strong>","The cost of a portable evaporative cooler varies depending on cooling needs. You can easily spend $70 on a small unit for a dorm room or office or drop up to $300 to $400 on a much larger one to cool garages, warehouses and even outdoor spaces. Keep in mind, though, that these are basically portable swamp coolers, so they are only effective in hot, dry climates. They also put out cooler, moist air, but they don’t cool like an air conditioner would.","<strong>Choosing a Portable Evaporative Cooler</strong>","Portable evaporative coolers cost significantly less to install and operate than <a href=\"/best-central-air-conditioning-units\">central air systems</a>, although they have much less cooling power. They’re lightweight and require only water and electricity to function, which means you can put them to use in your home or office. Since these units cool by adding moisture to the air, you should never use one alongside a traditional air conditioner, which cools by removing moisture. In shared spaces, these different types of coolers cancel each other out and waste energy.","Your Local Climate Affects Performance<br/>Evaporative cooling technology is most effective in hot, dry environments such as the Western U.S., and it doesn’t effectively lower temperatures in places with high humidity.","Since evaporative coolers don’t have compressors, their power consumption is significantly lower than that of a central air conditioner. On average, evaporative coolers can make the ambient temperature anywhere from 20 to 30 degrees cooler than outside air. These limitations mean evaporative coolers don’t offer the same comfort as <a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">portable air conditioners</a>.","Weight &amp; Portability<br/>Since portable swamp coolers are intended to cool one room at a time, you may need to purchase a unit that’s light enough to move around your house. More sizable units cool larger areas, but they can be much harder to move than their lightweight cousins. The best-designed heavyweight units have caster wheels that make them easy to reposition. ","Size &amp; Effectiveness<br/>For portable evaporative coolers, bigger isn’t necessarily better. At the same time, choosing a unit that’s not big enough can leave you overheated. Evaporative coolers’ cooling efficiency is rated in cubic feet per minute (CFM). All portable swamp coolers have CFM ratings, which makes it easy to figure out if a unit is powerful enough to cool a given area.","To pick the right size cooler for your room, you must first determine how many cubic feet you need to cool. This is done by multiplying an area’s square footage by the ceiling height. For example, a 250-square-foot room with an 8-foot ceiling has a cubic area of 2,000 feet (250 x 8 = 2,000). You then simply divide the cubic area in half (2,000 / 2 = 1,000) to find out how many cubic feet your evaporative cooler needs to be able to cool per minute. So, in this example, you would need a unit with a CFM rating of 1,000.","Additional Features<br/>The best portable swamp coolers often come with extra features that make them more convenient and easy to use. Some models have timers, remote controls and automatic thermostats that turn the unit on or off depending on the room’s temperature. Others include oscillating fans to evenly distribute air, alarms that notify you if the unit is running low on water, and adjustable speeds for gradual or rapid cooling. Some portable evaporative coolers also double as ionizers that remove pollutant particles from the air.","Warranty &amp; Maintenance<br/>One of the most unfortunate things about portable evaporative coolers is the poor warranty support across every brand we evaluated. We did not find a single product that offers more than one year of warranty coverage.","We suspect poor warranties come mostly from the design of these units and the water they use for cooling. For example, although the design uses four simple components – a water pump, a fan, a cooling pad and a water tank – using these components causes a lot of wear and tear. Furthermore, dissolved minerals from your water supply will remain in the unit after the water itself evaporates, which makes it difficult to keep the unit clean and functioning properly in the long term.","You may still get multiple seasons of use from a portable evaporative cooler, but you may need to double down on maintenance tasks, such as replacing the cooling pad and occasionally removing hard-water deposits. Check the unit’s manual for additional maintenance instructions.","<strong>Do Evaporative Coolers Need to Be Vented?</strong>","Yes, but not to the same extent as a portable air conditioner. While evaporative coolers don’t produce any waste heat that would warm up an unvented room, they can raise humidity to a point where the cooling effect is not as strong. This is the same reason why evaporative coolers aren’t effective outside of dry climates. As such, you should consider cracking one or two windows in your home to create a cross breeze so humidity levels don’t get too high.","<strong>At What Humidity do Evaporative Coolers Become Ineffective?</strong>","The effectiveness of evaporative coolers depends on two factors: relative humidity levels and air temperature. In general, you can expect a temperature drop of 10 to 12 degrees as long as there isn’t more than 50 percent humidity in the air. That said, lower levels of humidity will give you much better performance. With an average humidity of 20 percent, for example, you can expect a temperature drop between 16 and 22 degrees. With regards to temperature, hot air can hold more moisture than cold air, allowing for greater cooling effectiveness, though this applies mainly to dry climates in places like the Western U.S., particularly Arizona, Nevada and Utah, where the hot air isn’t already saturated with moisture.","<strong>How to Make My Evaporative Cooler Colder?</strong>","There are several things you can do to help your portable evaporative cooler produce colder air:"]},"id":"836eb303-8960-4734-ba31-820dfea6370a","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Soak the cooling pads before using the fan– It’s important to run the pump by itself for at least 10 minutes before using the fan, especially on hot days when the warm air might dry out the pads faster.","Use cold water, but not too cold– The temperature of the water has some effect on how much cool, moist air an evaporative cooler produces. That said, if the water is too cold, it won’t evaporate as quickly, which can waste energy. On the other end of the spectrum, hot water might evaporate too quickly and could introduce some heat into the air. Because of this, you should use cold tap water in your portable swamp cooler, which is usually between 50 and 75 degrees.","Use ice cubes for a temporary boost– While it’s true that you don’t want water that’s too cold, it can be useful to put some ice cubes in the water tank to help chill water that’s warmed up over time.
