Our washing machine comparison was first published in 2010. Over many years we have developed expertise in everything that matters for washers, including capacity, features and functionality.

We look at which machines are selling as a starting point to get an idea of what price range and features interest the most people. We then research expert and user reviews and government websites to find the most efficient and best-regarded machines. We interview experts along the way, including those involved in manufacturing washing machines and those who repair them, to help us determine the very best appliances in each category."]},"id":"d29fc323-1dc5-41f0-aebc-c1511dbd5580","type":"text"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Top-Load-Washing-Machines-LG-WT7200CV.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/7/5/799889/original/Top-Load-Washing-Machines-LG-WT7200CV.jpg","id":"LWBRPX4Gq72nZTw4HtEJRF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LWBRPX4Gq72nZTw4HtEJRF.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"LG WT7200CV"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B079HGN7LV?tag=ttr_default-20&ascsubtag=TTRV15671537835322770-ttr:en_US_43_Review_313&SubscriptionId=AKIAITCRJ2RHQCM3KCIA&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&ascsubtag=%site%%transactionId%-gclid-%gclid%-Fallback","urlStyle":"button","name":"LG WT7200CV","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Top Load "},"id":"a34a0591-572b-42d6-84c2-94c2e25d755f","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"LG-WM1388HW.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/9/U/777954/original/LG-WM1388HW.jpg","id":"y7p2Lsivn6cWtXTZonUBF9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y7p2Lsivn6cWtXTZonUBF9.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"LG WM1388HW"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"http://www.sears.com/lg-wm1388hw-2.2-cu-ft-compact-front-load/p-02645322000P?sid=I0084400010000100600&aff=Y&PID=1569010&AID=13202604&utm_medium=1158153_1569010_13202604","urlStyle":"button","name":"LG WM1388HW","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Front Load"},"id":"65dc040e-c26f-4481-b060-2ecdc2f807be","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Washer-Dryer-Combo-Haier-HLC1700AXS.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/0/R/781515/original/Washer-Dryer-Combo-Haier-HLC1700AXS.jpg","id":"CytbJYgQLAnUYTDfTPqKYo","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CytbJYgQLAnUYTDfTPqKYo.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"Haier HLC1700AXS"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Haier-24-Inch-Washer-Combination-HLC1700AXS/dp/B01KIGZ3E8?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews-en_US_43_Review_6-20","urlStyle":"button","name":"Haier HLC1700AXS","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Washer-Dryer Combo "},"id":"f2ffa35d-ba20-4355-8d62-0c2b33eb3ae0","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"text":"Best Top Load "},"id":"dc0c1fe4-f13d-4e39-b93d-a642d02b61dd","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/LWBRPX4Gq72nZTw4HtEJRF.jpg","link":{"href":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/lg-mega-capacity-review?status=InProgress","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/7/5/799889/original/Top-Load-Washing-Machines-LG-WT7200CV.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LWBRPX4Gq72nZTw4HtEJRF.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"LWBRPX4Gq72nZTw4HtEJRF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LWBRPX4Gq72nZTw4HtEJRF.jpg","alt":"LG WT7200CV "},"id":"f14f8afa-6840-4dfc-8fb5-fcd4867d73d9","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"LG WT7200CV \",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/home-and-garden/laundry\">LG WT7200CV </a>","pros":null,"cons":null},"id":"08c635d8-483c-4c5e-ae09-9fa4b6aafaea","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["","The energy efficient LG WT7200CV has a broad range of cycles and features, an outstanding warranty and reasonable price.

It is built to last, judging by its long and strong warranty. The wash drum is covered for life and the motor is covered for 10 years. Lots of the competing units offered only one year of warranty coverage on everything. It should be fairly inexpensive to run for the duration of its life.
