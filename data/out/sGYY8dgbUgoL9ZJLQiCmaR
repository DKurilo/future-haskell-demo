This print-only machine has mobile printing capabilities and boasts low operating costs, and HP’s customer support is excellent. However, the M102w’s print quality and overall performance leave something to be desired.","This wireless laser printer only prints – it does not scan, copy or fax like higher-end models. However, this makes it compact enough to store on a shelf or leave sitting out on a desk. It is only 14.4 x 7.5 inches in size and weighs just 10 pounds, so it’s easy to move. Although the LaserJet Pro M102w doesn’t have a touchscreen, its feature set is so basic that it doesn’t need one.","The machine’s print quality is disappointing. During our testing, we found 32 print errors in our text-heavy 10-page document, including several small spots of unwanted ink scattered across the pages. Additionally, the HP LaserJet Pro M102w is the slowest printer we reviewed, printing at a rate of only 14 pages per minute.","This wireless laser printer is not designed for high-volume printing, unlike our top monochrome laser printer pick, the <a href=\"/brother-review\">Brother MFC-L6700DW</a>. The HP LaserJet Pro&#39;s 10,000-page duty cycle is the lowest in our review, and the manufacturer recommends it only print between 150 and 1,500 pages per month for optimum performance compared to the HP LaserJet MFP-M477fdw which can do between 750-4,000 pages. ","You can save money with this printer. The device itself is cheaper than most other wireless laser printers, and it has an average per-page printing cost of just $0.04. This is one of the lowest operating costs of the products we evaluated.","Additionally, you can print from your smartphone or tablet using Apple AirPrint, Google Cloud Print and Mopria. It also works with HP’s own printing app, HP ePrint. This printer can connect to a home or office network over a Wi-Fi, though not over an Ethernet connection.","HP has strong customer support. This wireless printer is covered under a one-year manufacturer warranty. If you have questions or concerns, you can talk to a support representative over email, telephone or live chat on the company’s website. In addition, you can view the online user guide on HP’s website.","The HP LaserJet Pro M102w is a compact wireless laser printer with quite a few limitations. Its print quality and speed are mediocre, particularly when compared to higher-ranked products in our review. However, those looking for a budget, compact printer may find it a worthwhile option, especially if it is only going to be used occasionally."]},"id":"886267f6-8a13-4b6d-9a4a-260e3ede8aa3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69315","url":"/hp-laserjet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-17T18:12:14Z","datePublished":"2017-05-17T18:12:14Z","name":"HP LaserJet Pro M102w","synopsis":"The HP LaserJet Pro M102w is a small, monochrome wireless laser printer.","review":{"rating":58,"verdict":"The HP LaserJet Pro M102w is a good choice if you only print occasionally and don&#8217;t demand perfect prints.","pros":["This HP wireless laser printer has a low per-page printing cost."],"cons":["It doesn&#8217;t perform well, producing mediocre prints at slow speeds."]},"strapline":"The HP LaserJet Pro M102w is a small, monochrome wireless laser printer.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-11T00:00:00Z","id":"sGYY8dgbUgoL9ZJLQiCmaR","meta":{"title":"HP LaserJet Pro M102w Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The HP LaserJet Pro M102w is a black-and-white printer with basic features and a compact design.
