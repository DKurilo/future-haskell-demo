This <a href=\"/best-homeowners-insurance\">homeowners insurance</a> provider has nationwide coverage and three tiers of home insurance policies, each covering more than the last.","The three levels of home protection offered by ANPAC are Silver, Gold and Platinum. While each offers liability and property protection, the most notable difference is the increasing percentage or dollar amount your home and possessions are covered. ANPAC tailors each policy to your needs, rather than just giving you a choice of three fixed policies.","ANPAC offers an online home insurance quote form and provides an extensive list of toll-free phone numbers and mailing and email addresses so you can conveniently and quickly get connected with the company. Their claims office is open 24/7 and an online account manager helps you to manage your account, print ID cards and manage a claim.","You can save even more on your house insurance by qualifying for additional discounts. Some of the discounts you can receive from ANPAC include holding multiple policies such as auto or life, having a burglar or fire alarm system and having a home that has been renovated, updated or newly constructed.","ANPAC is one of the few insurance companies that offers a dividend program to reward you for being claim free. To qualify for this program, you have to have your home and auto policies held by ANPAC and remain claim free for three consecutive years on both policies to receive 25% of your combined first year premiums back. This can be a great way to save, as long as you are willing to have both your homeowners and automotive insurance through the same company.","ANPAC isnâ€™t a large company, but it does a reliable job of offering an extensive line of home insurance. They have coverage for homeowners, renters and those owning a condominium. Additional endorsements for flood, equipment breakdown, identity theft and others are available to add on to your homeowners policy."]},"id":"ed6ddddd-a106-420a-b953-17e5d531685b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a3cde75-1bcc-4f7a-9f53-5808ae95ad4f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, American National Property &amp; Casualty has some great features and provides an inclusive list of homeowners insurance options.
