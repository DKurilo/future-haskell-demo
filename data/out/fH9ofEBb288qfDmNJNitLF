We update this site frequently to account for this ever-changing landscape. Since we know a bit about publishing content online, we have good insight into what features are useful for content creation. We research these sites extensively – reading reviews and reports about the software, checking their support options and reading their service agreements – before downloading or subscribing to each one to perform hands-on tests.","<strong>How Much Does eBook Creator Software Cost?</strong>","Like much of the software we test, eBook creators are in a bit of transition. Many still download to you desktop, but newer, more up-to-date programs tend to host their operating systems on the web. You often pay per project or for a subscription for online programs, while you purchase more traditional programs outright. We wouldn’t agree to a subscription costing more than $10 a month or a one-time payment more than $50, unless you’re publishing regularly.  ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We researched to find downloadable programs and online services for eBook publication, looking for options that have a variety of publishing templates. We counted the number of file types each software processes and how many template types each service has, taking note of those that include professional tools or support educators. We also looked for services that connect with the most popular eBook stores, including Amazon and Barnes and Noble.","We used the support options, like email, FAQ, tutorials and manuals to see if they were easy to understand and offered enough information so that you could manage your projects effectively.","After researching, we downloaded or subscribed to all the services so we could try out each one’s features. We created profiles in each system and tried out all of the programs’ tools to get a sense of how they well they work for common tasks. We loaded content into each software and timed how long it took to process the data. We also noted if the program malfunctioned or performed slower than other eBook creators.","When you publish online, you also want to protect your content. As such, we looked for services that offer support and clearly state what types of release agreements are available – whether for profit or the public – and articulate the differences between them so you can make an informed decision about how and where to share your work.","<strong>Key Features to Look For </strong>","Ease of Use <br/>Writing a book is hard enough, and you shouldn’t have to deal with clunky, unintuitive eBook publishing software on top of it. As you browse through the programs we reviewed, consider whether each one’s interface and support options fit your needs. During our research, we paid attention to each program’s layout and design and assigned it a grade based on how intuitive its interface is.","Multi-Language Capabilities<br/>If you want to write a story partially or wholly in a language other than English, double-check that the eBook creator you choose supports it. The best software makes it easy to choose your language or switch between languages without disrupting your workflow or inadvertently creating weird characters, typos and unexpected formatting issues.","Cloud vs. Desktop<br/>It’s worth noting how the software you choose stores your work. Does it save it to its server via the cloud, or do you download the software onto your computer? To use cloud software, you need a solid internet connection, so it is a good option if you plan to write at home or a cafe. On the other hand, if you write during your commute on the train, it may be better to find a program you can download. There are pros and cons to both, so consider your situation before making a decision.","Supported Formats<br/>The more format options you have, the better. Applications and services that let you publish personal journals, magazines, professional texts, guides, manuals, comic books and other types of work in addition to eBooks provide the best value.","Support<br/>However, services with lots of publishing options can feel overwhelming at first, especially if you have never loaded content into a publisher before. We found that the best software comes with enough guidance and support that extra features are beneficial rather than a hindrance.","We also considered how much support each offers. eBook creators that have tutorials, instruction manuals and contact information are much easier to use overall and received higher scores.","Output File Formats<br/>Many online publishing services make it easy to share your work on the web. Look for one that supports the big names in eBook publishing, such as Kindle and Nook. In addition, choose a program that supports many of the most common file formats, including EPUB, PDB, PDF, video, HTML, LIT and MOBI.","A few of the platforms we reviewed mimic social media accounts – almost like LinkedIn accounts for self-publishers. These can be a great resource for finding opportunities to host your work or connect with other authors. We liked services that let you customize your profile and make professional connections so you can publish your work to as many places on the web as possible.","Licensing &amp; Trademarks<br/>Make sure you check any contracts and fine print associated with the eBook creator software you choose to ensure you aren’t signing over part or all of your rights to what you wrote. You can also look into trademarking your work first."]},"id":"c4a6510f-a203-420e-9bb3-81d16be3eb7a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_181","url":"/best-ebooks-creators","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-30T21:49:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-30T21:49:00Z","name":"Best eBook Creators of 2019","synopsis":"However, its format selection is a little bare-bones, and it wasn’t as easy to navigate as some other services we reviewed.
