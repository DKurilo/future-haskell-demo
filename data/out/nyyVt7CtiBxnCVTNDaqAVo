Both devices will allow you to exercise in cordless freedom. Though they have different looks, they have similar specifications and are both good choices.","The BackBeat GO will require you to pair your device each time you use it. Most Bluetooth earbuds remember devices they’ve been paired to previously. The earbuds house straightforward controls that allow you to skip songs or answer the phone without looking at the buttons.","The sound quality with both the BackBeat GO and BackBeat 903+ Bluetooth earbuds are slightly above average. The bass sounds deep, but if you turn it up too high, you will get scratchy sound – a common issue for wireless earbuds. You get the standard effective range of 30 to 33 feet from the paired device.","These small wireless earbuds come with three sizes of cushioned eartips and optional stabilizers that customize the fit. The stabilizers attach to the back of the earbuds and fit back behind your ear. They offer the usual comfort of behind-the-ear earbuds, won&#39;t pinch and are very flexible.","The controls allow you to stop and play tracks, skip tracks and adjust the volume. These same controls also allow you to answer or reject incoming calls. Pairing the Bluetooth signal to a device is simple, but you can&#39;t pair with two devices, or switch between them. In order to switch between a phone and an MP3 player, you will have to pair the headphones again so they work correctly.","The battery life is also average at about 4.5 hours of continuous listening or talk time. The right earbud houses the micro USB port so you can charge them, and a full charge takes a little less than two hours.","The design of these earbuds is not only lightweight, but the cord that wraps around your neck is short enough that it&#39;s not going to tangle up. The rubber will sit on your neck, or under your chin, and stay out of your way.","The BackBeat GO earbuds come with a one-year warranty on any repairs and a lifetime warranty on sweat damage. Plantronics includes several downloadable guides on its websites as well as user forums and FAQs. You can contact them by telephone or submit an email to request technical support."]},"id":"fe60efaa-7f98-4a8c-b2f1-f2f213e7f0cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0fdb1ab0-c59d-48d3-b26e-3542aa023e63","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BackBeat series from Plantronics is simple and moldable, designed with a cord that stays out of your way whether you are working in the yard or working out.
