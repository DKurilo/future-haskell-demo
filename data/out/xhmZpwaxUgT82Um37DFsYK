The camera, mounted in the center of the rear cover, protrudes slightly, but it isn’t a nuisance and doesn’t make the phone wobble when you set it down.","From the back, the 10’s angled grace and weighty elegance make the phone a looker. From the front, everything feels generic. The device’s rim is a bit too wide, which makes the bezels around its screen feel wider – and therefore cheaper – than they actually are. The shape and placement of the phone’s fingerprint scanner is ripped from the <a href=\"/samsung-galaxy-s7-review\">Galaxy S7</a>.
