X-Talker"},"id":"618069d4-6432-4bbb-9c13-39880194be9b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"text":"Introduction"},"id":"384cbb9b-0d51-49cd-9089-064518015b34","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Midland X-Talker T71VP3 offers 38 channels and a three-year warranty, and it can access NOAA weather channels, all in one of the lightest and most convenient form factors among the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">walkie talkies we tested</a>.","The Midland X-Talker T71VP3 has an advertised range of 38 miles, the second longest of the walkie talkie radios we reviewed. However, as with all advertised walkie talkie ranges, it is extremely unlikely that you’re going to get anywhere close to this distance because it represents optimal conditions rather than real-life ones.","In our tests on the GMRS frequency, this X-Talker scored high over distances of a half mile and a mile, but the score dropped when the distance was increased to a mile and a half. This seems to be the maximum range of the unit when using high-powered channels. On the FRS channel, this unit scored the highest at a half-mile, with 98 percent transmission and reception accuracy, but it was completely silent when the distance increased to 1.5 and 2 miles.","The X-Talker two-way radios that we tested come with a rechargeable battery pack and a charging cradle that can hold both of the units. The charging cradle works well, but it lacks any light-up indicators to let you know that the units are securely inserted in the cradle and charging. Also of note, our testers had to push down rather firmly to click the walkie talkies into place.","One benefit to this X-Talker unit is Midland’s addition of a micro-USB charging cable to these units. This means that you can charge the walkie talkies on-the-go with any micro-USB cable you might have lying around. If you want, you can also replace the rechargeable battery pack with three AA batteries.","For emergency options, this two-way radio doesn’t have an LED flashlight, but it does have access to the NOAA emergency weather channels. Additionally, the X-Talker is one of the lighter units that we tested, weighing in at just 6.3 ounces. This means it can be easily taken on a backpacking excursion or camping trip. While we appreciated the light weight of the X-Talker, on our grip scale the units scored a D+ because it lacked any rubberized grips and only had a little texturized plastic for traction.","The Midland X-Talker’s waterproof rating is JIS4, which means it can withstand some rain and drips, but can’t hold up under sustained exposure to water or submersion, nor can it float.","One great part of the X-Talker design is the belt clip. Like all of the Midland units in our walkie talkie reviews, the X-Talker features an adjustable, alligator-style clip that opens a roughly 30-degree angle. This makes it easy to clip it to a belt, backpack or jacket pocket.","The Midland X-Talker T71VP3 features Midland’s three-year warranty, the longest of the walkie talkie sets we tested and reviewed. Additionally, Midland’s website is easy to navigate, so it’s simple to find and download the user manual. There’s also a FAQs section on Midland’s website as well as email and telephone support information."]},"id":"de5358ce-88b1-4a9c-acb5-e65f5e5fec0a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"01f5a9fa-145e-4c66-a5ad-69861e8d9cf0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Midland X-Talker T71VP3 is a great, no-frills two-way radio that has a small form factor.
