A local church, the web, the paper and the neighborhood  know it all  (just ask!) are all great resources to get connected.","<strong>Tip 2: Let s Get Physical! </strong><br/>Exercise .uggh! I know what you re thinking, but strap that baby into a jogging stroller or backpack and move that body. Baby will love the fresh air, you will feel better about doing something good for your body, and Daddy will love the results.","<strong>Tip 3: Don t Sweat the Small Stuff. </strong><br/>So your house is not as immaculate as before the baby was born, it s ok. I like to buy some nice baskets and keep a few baby toys, diapers and wipes in each room. That way I always have easy access to items I am constantly using. The result is less hassle and less mess in each room. Try to tackle cleaning bathrooms once a week and keep up on your laundry as best as you can. The housekeeping police won t come and beat you over the head with a toilet brush if your house is a little disheveled. You just had a baby-you re allowed!","<strong>Tip 4: Use humor to combat the  blah . </strong><br/>A great lady once said,  The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache.&#34; I agree. Motherhood is messy, inconvenient, trying, self-sacrificing and hard, but it is also the best thing you will do in this life. Savor the moments, even the difficult ones, because one day you will look back and those days will be gone. Try to find humor in being a mother; it will serve you well and teach a wonderful lesson to your kids about dealing with life s little  bumps in the road .","<strong>Tip 5: Invest in Quality</strong><br/>Invest your time, finances and energy in a few quality things, rather than allowing yourself to get bogged down in trying to be a  master  of many. This little gem of advice applies to a lot of aspects pertaining to motherhood. Buy a few quality baby items that will stand the test of time, research and find the best fit for your budget and needs. As your children grow, enroll them in a few activities that will develop their talents, but don t over-schedule your poor child. Kids need time to just be kids.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"ac792e0d-2d87-4c83-a618-25a4ae908f8b","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. <br/>"]},"id":"617b13af-c364-442c-9c8e-ecb4570652de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4908","url":"/top-tips-for-surviving-motherhood","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sherry-parker","url":"/author/sherry-parker","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Sherry Parker","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"coftSXaTVU5JsBU8gtsABj","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-16T12:21:28Z","datePublished":"2010-09-16T12:21:28Z","name":"Top Tips for Surviving Motherhood...","synopsis":"Want to know the secret to surviving motherhood?
