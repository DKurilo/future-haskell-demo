You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Using wireless headphones once meant enduring ho-hum sound for the sake of portability. That’s no longer the case with the best Bluetooth headphones. Case in point: The Sony MDR-1RBT headphones sound better than most Bluetooth models and cost less than most other top performers. That makes these Sonys one of the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lists/gift-ideas\">best Christmas gifts</a> for Grandpa to listen to the TV as loud as he wants, a commuting spouse or anyone who else on your list who would value good sound sans wires.","This set bucks the trend of sub-par Bluetooth sound in part because of its large drivers, wide frequency range and high accuracy — from deep, booming bass to smooth midrange sound to high, clear trebles.","These headphones are also comfortable. During our testing, the plush ear pads and well-designed headband frame remained comfortable through hours of listening, in part because these Sonys are notably light. The over-ear design also blocks outside noise and minimizes sound leakage, so you should be neither disturbed by nearby family members or commuters nor enrage them with blaring Beethoven or deafening Def Leppard.","An array of controls are on the right ear cup, including volume, forward/back, pause/play and a multifunction button that answers phone calls and pairs the headphones with other Bluetooth devices. There’s also a built-in microphone that allows you to use the headphones to answer phone calls.","Battery life is also outstanding. These Sonys can last up to 30 hours in active Bluetooth mode, or up to 200 hours in standby mode (with the Bluetooth turned off.) The headphones come with a jack and headphone cable, so you can listen without Bluetooth if your battery dies or you want slightly better performance, especially at higher frequency ranges.","These Sonys are compatible with both Android and Apple devices, as well as any other device that supports Bluetooth connectivity. NFC (near-field communication) also allows you to tap the headphones with your NFC device like your phone, and connect instantly. The wireless connection should stay intact up to 30 feet from the source. So you can move from room to room without losing connectivity with your phone. Since they sound great, are easy to connect and are comfortable, these headphones are a good choice for anyone on your Christmas list."]},"id":"8ff30591-403b-4af5-be8f-c62b34db2ae7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61265","url":"/sony-mdr-1rbt-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-21T22:57:07Z","datePublished":"2014-11-21T22:57:07Z","name":"Sony MDR-1RBT","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
