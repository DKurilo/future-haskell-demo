In the dark, you can see the spotlight from a longer distance than the person holding the spotlight can see you. This is because the light reflects off the environment. And if the spotlight is aimed directly at you, it becomes much brighter and you know the person has spotted you, or is very close to spotting you. This is how radar detectors work – like eyes in the dark looking for spotlights. But to be effective, they need to be easy to use and the alerts must be easy to understand.","Performance<br/>Testing highway performance is all about reaction time. The sooner you&#39;re alerted to potential police radar, the more time you have for adjusting your speed. To test this, isolated the radar frequencies to ensure that I was only detecting the signal from the radar gun I set up rather than false alerts. This required a miles-long road in a rural area away from buildings and businesses. I found the perfect road in the farmland west of Ogden, Utah.","We constructed a structure of PVC pipes to hold the radar gun still and in place. I then ran rounds of tests with the radar gun aimed down the road, at a 45-degree angle to the road and at a 90-degree angle to the road. I also ran tests with the radar gun aimed up a hill and aimed down a hill.","Using my odometer, I recorded the distances and graded the results. Every radar detector had a very long range when the radar gun was aimed directly down the road. Even the cheapest detectors were beeping past three miles. Things got much more interesting in the other scenarios, where the best radar detectors provided as much as a mile&#39;s notice of the radar while the cheaper detectors provided just 0.4-mile notice. Overall, the highway performance is a good refection of the prices. While it doesn&#39;t always apply to every product you buy, with radar detectors, the saying certainly applies – &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34; ","Testing the city performance was more difficult. The city settings on radar detectors remove the X-band from detection because that&#39;s used for long-range speed detecting. Some detectors have filters that minimize most of the K-band which is usually the cause of false alerts. The best city settings are ones that aren&#39;t so overly &#34;tuned&#34; that they filter out too much of the radar, but they can&#39;t be so sensitive that they turn the radar detector into an incessant beeping machine. There needs to be a balance.","Looking for this balance of alerts and silence, I created a route in and around the city of Ogden. I drove this route multiple times on different days and noted every alert that the detector provided. The best performing radar detectors were ones that used GPS to identify the same alert, muting it on the second time, but still providing a visual cue. The visual cue is important because it reminded me that there was radar in that location, and even if it was likely a motion detector from the nearby grocery store, it reminded me to consider my driving habits. The lowest graded detectors either wouldn&#39;t shut up making me want to turn it off, or they rarely alerted me to anything, even the known false alert locations. This suggests the digital signal processing, designed to filter out false alerts, could be too aggressive.","Awareness Evaluation<br/>I also evaluated the awareness improvement that the radar detector provided as I drove around. As I drove over 120 testing radar detectors, I made notes of detectors that improved my overall awareness. While considering the performance played into this evaluation, I also considered the effectiveness of the audible and visual alerts. Did they effective make me consider my driving or were they too easy to ignore?","I favored detectors with features specifically designed to help you drive safer. If you&#39;re prone to speeding, the over-speed alert is a feature that beats any radar sensor. It uses the internal GPS to measure your speed and alert you when you&#39;ve exceeded a specified speed limit. You can adjust the speed limit on the device. With this feature, your awareness is kept in check and you can&#39;t be ambushed by POP radar or a lidar gun.","Ease of Use<br/>You&#39;re not going to use your radar detector if the learning curve is too great. Fortunately, the best radar detectors are designed for both novices and experts. For example, the Escort detectors have novice and expert modes. Some detectors, though, make you feel like you need to read a book on radar physics to understand what all the display information means and how relevant it is to your drive. With the easiest detectors, you can take the device out of the box, plug it in and go for a drive.","<strong>Radar Detectors: What Else You Should Know Before You Buy?</strong>","Sensitivity &amp; False Alerts<br/>Radar detectors have a dilemma – and it&#39;s radar. Every manufacturer aims to create a detector with the longest range, but this requires making sensors that are incredibly sensitive. Increasing the sensitivity wouldn&#39;t be such a problem if it weren&#39;t for all the other non-police radar cluttering the streets.","According to Eric Peters, an automotive columnist and contributor to the National Motorists Association, there is &#34;more &#39;clutter&#39; in the air today than ever before. Even just a decade ago, radar signals pretty much emanated only from cops and automated doors (as at grocery stores and so on). It was easier for the detector to sift through the chaff and alert you to the real deal.&#34; Now, newer cars and trucks use radar for various sensors, like blind-spot awareness, collision warning systems, and self-parking. He notes that &#34;if you have a detector, you’ve probably noticed this. Suddenly, your unit shrieks, the warning lights go off. But where’s the cop? There&#39;s nothing around except that Escalade coming the other way.&#34;","In the U.S., radar guns are only allowed to work on three radar frequency bands – X, K, and Ka. Knowing what the alert means can help you understand whether it&#39;s likely a cop or if it&#39;s a new car. According to Peters, the Ka-band is only used by police, so if you receive a Ka alert, you should &#34;heed it.&#34; Likewise, the X-band has a much longer wavelength, so it&#39;s typically only used for long-distance purposes, like on a highway. This is why radar detectors turn the X-band off when in city mode. Most of the time a false alert comes from the K-band, but cops also use the K-band, so you can&#39;t disregard K-band alerts either.","While I understand why many users get annoyed when their radar detectors are constantly squawking at them, it doesn’t follow that false alerts are necessarily a bad thing. Every alert, whether real or not, is a moment where you are forced to consider your driving habits. Every alert forces you to think about your speed and look around for a cop, which forces you to pay closer attention to other cars on the road. False alerts help you be a safer driver.","GPS<br/>Most of the high-end and even most of the mid-range radar detectors have built-in GPS that automatically connects to a satellite as soon as you turn your car on. GPS has many purposes, but the primary reason it was added to radar detectors was so you could identify a false alert, such as the motion detectors at Home Depot, by locking that alert out using GPS coordinates. This is a good idea, in theory. However, Mike Valentine, creator of the Valentine One and the president of Valentine Research, Inc, makes a good point about the pitfalls of GPS systems – &#34;GPS knows only one thing—location. And if the frequency of a new threat is near that of a blocked alarm, SORRY, but GPS demands silence at that location, even if that means silencing a trap.&#34; So, if your detector&#39;s GPS has muted the motion detector from Home Depot, and a police officer is parked nearby, the radar gun is muted as well.","Some radar detectors use GPS to mute all radar when you&#39;re driving below a specified, adjustable speed. The assumption is that you don&#39;t need to be alerted to radar if you&#39;re driving within the speed limits.","The main reason for getting a radar detector with GPS is the over-speed alert. GPS allows the radar detector to accurately measure your speed, and when you exceed a specified speed limit, it alerts you. If speeding is a habit that you want to fix, this is the best way to do it. It decreases the chances of getting a speeding ticket and doesn&#39;t rely on detecting police radar at all.","Laser Lidar Detector<br/>A laser gun, sometimes called lidar, is another method that law enforcement uses to determine speed. Laser guns are highly accurate and very precise. While a radar gun emits radar waves that bounce all over the landscape like a flashlight, a laser gun uses an invisible beam of light. A police officer can aim a laser gun at your vehicle from over a mile away and receive an accurate and immediate reading. By the time your radar detector starts screaming at you, the officer knows your speed and has likely already decided whether or not to pull you over. Lidar sensors are not something you should ever base your purchase decision on for this reason.","The only way you can get around a lidar gun is to have a community-sharing app that alerts you to a different driver being hit with a lidar beam in the same area. But for these apps to be effective, other drivers must be using the apps in both proximity and time. These community sharing apps are not very effective, however, because there just aren’t enough drivers with radar detectors on the road and even fewer who consistently use the apps. So, the best way to avoid getting pulled over from a lidar gun is to drive within the legal speed limit.","Community Sharing Apps<br/>Some radar detectors are heavily marketed on their community sharing app. Cobra, for example, has the Cobra iRadar app, and the Escort detectors have the Escort Live app. These community sharing apps rely on the premise that drivers can report non-radar related traffic issues, like red light cameras and speed cameras and speed traps to assist other drivers. By sharing the location, other drivers using the app are alerted to the location as they drive near it. The apps boast having over a million users, but that&#39;s peanut crumbs when you consider how many drivers are sharing the roads of America. In the week I tested radar detectors, I didn’t uncover any useful community shared information from either app. Don&#39;t base your purchase of a radar detector on whether it has a community sharing app. You&#39;ll only be disappointed.","Radar Jammers &amp; Other Legal Concerns<br/>According to the Communications Act of 1934, you can legally use a radar detector so long as you aren’t a commercial truck driver. However, it is important to make sure they are legal in your state before purchasing one. In the United States, radar detectors are still illegal in Virginia and the District of Columbia and on every U.S. military base as of the time of this publication. Be considerate of local laws if you are pondering a cross-country road trip involving any of these areas. Also, individual states may have similar rules you need to follow.","In addition, it may be illegal to mount your radar detector directly onto your windshield, since it can be argued that a mounted detector blocks your line of sight as a driver. Certain states are stricter in regulating this than others and may have other conditions for mounting that must be met. It’s best to install your radar detector directly in your dash, though your sun visor may also work.","Internationally, laws and regulations regarding radar detectors vary by country and sometimes by individual provinces within a country. There are strict and lax laws around the world, so be sure to check local rules before traveling to a different country.","Radar jammers are illegal everywhere under United States federal law because they interfere with law enforcement’s ability to do its job. Although radar jammers are generally designed to be discreet, a cop can still tell if you have one if they try to detect your speed but are unable to. If a cop discovers you have a jammer, you may be ticketed and fined, and your jammer may be confiscated.","Ticket Reimbursement Guarantee<br/>Some manufacturers offer a ticket reimbursement guarantee with their radar detectors. Always be careful to read the stipulations. These guarantees share some things in common:","* Only applies to the first year that you own the radar detector<br/>* Only applies to the person who purchased the device<br/>* Limited to $250 reimbursement<br/>* You must prove that the police officer issued the ticket based on a reading from a radar gun"]},"id":"44796e6d-c192-4f91-914a-e4c76a9d0e08","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_158","url":"/best-radar-detectors","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-31T19:11:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-31T19:11:00Z","name":"Best Radar Detectors of 2019","synopsis":"Speeding is dangerous and irresponsible.
