You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Medi-Chip USB <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">Medical Alert Bracelet</a> from Key2Life looks very similar to a traditional chain link alert bracelet like the <a href=\"/lynx-roman-review\">Lynx Roman</a>. However, all of your medical information is stored on a USB drive that can be accessed using any computer, similar to the <a href=\"/care-review\">CARE</a> bracelet.","When you first look at this medical ID bracelet, it looks a lot like the classic engraveable bracelets that have been available for years. However, instead of engraving a few lines of vital information on this piece of jewelry, all of your information is stored on a built-in USB drive. This device allows you to keep all of your critical information in one place, which makes it readily accessible to EMTs, doctors and rescue personnel.","If you suffer from any type of severe allergy, illness or have a medical condition, a Key2Life medical alert bracelet may be a useful piece of jewelry to wear. This emergency medical records device ensures medical personnel are aware of any conditions you have that could affect their care decisions, whether you are close to home or traveling around the world. The software included with this device allows you to create, organize and update your medical history and critical information and keep track of prescription medicines, allergies, medical conditions and more.","This medical alert USB bracelet is fully HIPAA compliant, which means that many doctors and hospitals will be familiar with the device and know how to use it. With a 2GB capacity, it can hold all of your necessary health records including medications, allergies, X-rays, dental records, MRIs and more. It can also contain various forms such as a living will, DNR, consent for emergency treatment and limited power of attorney.","The USB device is compatible with any computer that runs Windows XP or a newer Windows operating system. It is also compatible with Mac and Linux if you have a Windows emulator installed. However, most doctor&#39;s offices and hospitals use Windows. Although this is a USB device, it requires no special drivers or software, meaning that you and medical professionals can use it without having to install anything on your system.","This bracelet offers plenty of security with double-password protection plus encryption. However, in an emergency situation, responders will be able to view necessary information that you choose to share, but they won&#39;t be able to make any changes or access more personal data without your password.","This Key2Life USB Medi-Chip USB Medical Alert Bracelet is a good midrange option that gives you the look of a traditional piece of jewelry with the convenience of a USB device. Because no special software or data connection is needed, any health care worker can quickly access important information from any computer or laptop."]},"id":"1c1660ae-843b-42de-af0a-dffea954809a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63670","url":"/key2life-usb-medi-chip-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:10:12Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:10:12Z","name":"Key 2 Life","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-24T19:10:12Z","id":"hNkzgjBPknJUUTfNr85ajg","meta":{"title":"Key2Life USB Medi-Chip Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Key2Life USB Medi-Chip Bracelet provides medical information when you most need it.
