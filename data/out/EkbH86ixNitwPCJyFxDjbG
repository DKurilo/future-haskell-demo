This helps to prevent getting into a rut or, worse yet, giving up on the entire enterprise.","The NordicTrack Rear Drive <a href=\"/best-elliptical-machines\">elliptical machines</a> give you plenty of choices with different features and price points. Within the Rear Drive line is the NordicTrack AudioStrider 990 Pro, a real winner because it is chock full of options to suit even the pickiest exerciser.","With 30 preset workouts to choose from, you certainly won’t get bored. You can change how hard you exercise by adjusting one of this cross trainer&#39;s 24 resistance levels.","Additionally, you can adjust the elliptical&#39;s incline between 15 and 40 degrees with just the press of a button. The stride length ranges from 20 to 23 inches and can also be adjusted.","Unfortunately, you do not get a quick-start option with this elliptical machine and it does not have a locking pin to lock the pedals. This feature would prevent young children or adult visitors from climbing aboard, starting to pedal and possibly getting hurt. The flywheel is fully enclosed, however, which adds a nice safety feature.","You can keep an eye on your workout times, distance covered and more on the easy-to-read LCD display that is backlit. To monitor your heart rate, this elliptical offers two options.","You can grasp the handle grips and your current heart rate will appear on the display, or you can use a chest strap that comes with the elliptical, which typically gives are more accurate reading.","This is a broad-based machine measuring 81.5 inches in length, 27 inches in width and 66 inches in height. It weighs 283 pounds and can accommodate individuals who weigh up to 350 pounds. The flywheel weighs 26 pounds, which helps keep the device stable.","Your workout should be fun with all the extras available with this elliptical. These include a reading rack, a water bottle holder, an auxiliary jack, speakers and a cooling fan.","This machine does not allow you to create user accounts and store fitness data. However, you can do just that if you subscribe to the iFit fitness app, which is compatible with the elliptical. The app allows you store to up to four user accounts. You can also download workout programs from various professional trainers, including the celebrity trainer Jillian Michaels.","With the extra iFit app, you can also use Google maps to create running routes through virtually any neighborhood to add spice to your exercise regimen. No matter what the weather is like outside or where you actually are when you start your routine, you can run virtually through the streets of London, Peking or Barcelona. This may a welcome distraction for those who find exercise tedious.","With this elliptical cross trainer, you get a lifetime warranty on the frame, a three-year warranty for parts and a one-year warranty for labor."]},"id":"1ffea788-1fb6-4a92-bb42-56e9e11edd45","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"92bfe102-1c22-4d0c-a959-8ebe2562c6a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nordic Track Rear Drive AudioStrider 990 Pro is a well-equipped elliptical that is sturdy and offers plenty of features to keep you deeply engaged in your exercise regimen or at least distracted enough so that time seems to fly by."]},"id":"c5a6a84c-87e2-41a8-aba8-6c4df1159090","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58395","url":"/nordictrack-rear-drive-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-10T21:11:34Z","datePublished":"2013-12-10T21:11:34Z","name":"NordicTrack Rear Drive AudioStrider 990 Pro","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been replaced by another product.
