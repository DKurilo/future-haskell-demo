As mentioned above, the icemaker is mounted in the door rather than above the shelves, which saves space within the freezer. The water dispenser uses a Samsung HAF-CIN filter to purify your water, and it can create crushed or cubed ice.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/59756-samsung-rsg3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E8UfNtGGpfCX2AuTh4VrMC.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"E8UfNtGGpfCX2AuTh4VrMC","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E8UfNtGGpfCX2AuTh4VrMC.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1c3e6dda-7ca6-426b-be25-3ef31c7caa83","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/AcjxrFunNXvdwdzrDUnUdT.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"To dispense ice and water, you use one of the most impressive features of the Samsung RSG309AARS: the built-in LCD screen. Not only can you easily control all of your settings, but you also can use specialized apps for the kitchen. Some of the apps include memos, so you can leave notes for your family. You can use the grocery manager to keep track of food purchases and expiration dates. Google Calendar syncs using Wi-Fi, so you can keep track of all of your family&#39;s appointments. You can use AP News to keep up on current events, WeatherBug to check the weather or Pandora to fill your kitchen with music. Epicurious lets you search for recipes by season, occasion, category or ingredient, so you can use up those random ingredients taking up space on your shelves. If you don&#39;t have the right ingredient for a dish you want to prepare, Epicurious allows you to create a shopping list so you can pick it up the next time you&#39;re out.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/59756-samsung-rsg14.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AcjxrFunNXvdwdzrDUnUdT.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"AcjxrFunNXvdwdzrDUnUdT","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AcjxrFunNXvdwdzrDUnUdT.jpg","alt":""},"id":"2a7a6413-2f19-47e4-82b5-4a97e734bdbe","type":"image"},{"data":{"text":"Efficiency &amp; Warranty"},"id":"7714d463-75cc-48e2-9d5d-d8a0f6bc4069","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Energy Star-compliant refrigerator uses an estimated 621 kWh per year.
