When used without blade guard combs, it can cut hair down to .5 millimeters, but it doesn’t provide a clean shave. If you want results comparable to a razor, the Shortcut Pro isn’t the product you need. In the Remington line, the <a href=\"/hyperflex-verso-review\">HyperFlex Verso 3</a> will do better. We also recommend Skull Shavers’ <a href=\"/pitbull-gold-review\">Pitbull Gold</a> or <a href=\"/pitbull-silver-review\">Pitbull Silver</a> shavers. These products are contoured like the Shortcut Pro, and they give you a much smoother shave.","If you don’t mind a five o’clock shadow, the Shortcut Pro is excellent. It’s easy to use and reasonably priced, and its five-year warranty is the best in our lineup. The clipper comes in a kit that includes nine guard combs, blade oil and a cleaning brush. There’s also a zippered storage pouch for the clipper, but there’s not enough room in it for the attachments. A larger pouch would be nice to help keep all 13 pieces more organized.","Before each use, you want to oil the Shortcut Pro’s stainless steel blades to reduce friction and prevent pulled or snagged hair. You can use this clipper on wet or dry hair, and it’s safe to use cordlessly in the shower. You can rinse its blades in running water during use, and they’re detachable for more detailed cleaning.","The Shortcut Pro gives you 40 minutes of hair-cutting time before its lithium-ion battery needs to recharge, and a blinking battery life indicator helps you keep track of time. Charging takes three to five hours, but you can use the clipper while it’s plugged in.","If you need help getting started with the Shortcut Pro, its downloadable user guide is a user-friendly resource. Remington customer service is outstanding, and you can reach a specialist easily by phone. You can also request service by email, and Remington’s website has a support request form."]},"id":"ed7589bf-96fa-4458-8c2c-f76f1940df53","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69960","url":"/remington-shortcut-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-17T16:09:14Z","datePublished":"2018-05-17T16:09:14Z","name":"Remington Shortcut Pro (HC4250)","synopsis":"When Remington customer service advised us that face and neck shavers aren’t meant for use on the head, they recommended the Remington Shortcut Pro as an alternative.","review":{"rating":78,"verdict":"The Remington Shortcut Pro is a best-selling, highly rated clipper designed for DIY hair maintenance.
