In addition to extensive online research, we contacted manufacturers and industry insiders to get their input on the best brands and important features. We read blogs, articles and dozens of customer reviews to get a feel for the models people liked the most and common issues.","<strong>How We Picked</strong>","We wanted to find ovens that would serve the needs of all types of people and families, finding ovens that cooked food efficiently with as many options as busy people need. We selected ovens with the right convenience features, cooking options, warranties and design features. Cooking features were of primary importance, but conveniences, like self-cleaning, are also an important consideration. We took that into account and selected the best wall double ovens we could find and did in-depth research to help you find the best one for you. ","<strong>Finding the Right Electric Oven for You</strong>","Convection vs. Thermal Cooking<br/>Thermal and convection are two main types of cooking technology on wall double ovens. Thermal ovens are traditional with the usual heating elements that raise the air temperature to cook the food. Convection ovens use similar heating elements to thermal, but these ovens also include a small fan that circulates the hot air throughout the interior, allowing the food to cook faster and more evenly. Many double ovens have one thermal and one convection oven.","There are three types of convection modes: bake, broil and roast. The convection bake mode emits heat from the lower heat element in the oven, making it ideal for foods with crusts, such as pizzas and pies. Convection broil emits heat from the upper element, which is great for searing vegetables and meats. On the convection roast setting, heat is emitted from both elements, so you can roast pork or beef.","Find the Right Size for Your Needs<br/>As you look for the right oven for your kitchen, the capacity is one of the most important factors. Keep in mind that even though two ovens may have the same exterior dimensions, each oven&#39;s cooking capacity may differ. When looking for the right oven, a good rule of thumb is to find a double oven with a minimum of 1 cubic foot of space per oven for each individual in your family. For example, a family of four or more will need an oven with at least 4 cubic feet of cooking space per oven.","How Much Do Electric Wall Double Ovens Cost?<br/>The electric wall double ovens in our comparison range between about $1,500 and $4,500. There are many options between those two price points, and many fall right in the middle. An online search on sites like Lowes and Home Depot reveals that the best-selling models fall in this range with the majority between roughly $1,500 and $2,500. Most people can find an oven they need in that price range, including ovens with convection cooking, but you may have to pay more for specialty features like dehydration."]},"id":"b3251bc7-7d53-4967-853a-969072454996","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"4e0460e2-dd1a-40a5-9bbb-1d381de1f4bc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/electrolux-review\">Electrolux EI30EW45PS</a>","<a href=\"/frigidaire-review\">Frigidaire FGET3065PF</a>","<a href=\"/ge-review\">GE JT3500EJES </a>","<a href=\"/maytag-mew9630fz-review\">Maytag MEW9630FZ</a>","<a href=\"/kitchenaid-review\">KitchenAid KODT100ESS</a>","<a href=\"/bosch-review\">Bosch HBL551UC</a>","<a href=\"/viking-review\">Viking 3 Series RVDOE330SS</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"acac2d31-933d-426c-8f2b-54edeba151b3","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_277","url":"/best-electric-wall-double-ovens","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-25T13:35:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-25T13:35:00Z","name":"Best Electric Wall Double Ovens of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best electric double wall-ovens, including recommendations from Whirlpool, Maytag, Frigidaire, GE, LG and Bosch.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best electric double wall-ovens, including recommendations from Whirlpool, Maytag, Frigidaire, GE, LG and Bosch.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-28T18:44:34Z","id":"3Kt8JfwYxSNnKvfzbYNf3m","meta":{"title":"Best Electric Double Ovens of 2019 -
