Quick brewing times and ease of use are just two of the qualities that make this a solid single-cup coffee maker.","The Keurig K55 Elite Brewing System makes coffee quickly and easily thanks to its K-Cup brewing system, and it&#39;s not limited to hot drinks, either. You can make iced coffees, and iced tea is easy as well, when you pour it directly over ice. The Keuring K55 heats up its water and dispenses it in 90 seconds, which is a somewhat relaxed pace compared to other single-cup coffee makers. However, it still saves a lot of time compared to conventional brewers.","As you&#39;d expect with such a system, it&#39;s easy to clean and keep maintained; the K-Cups see to that. On the other hand, the fact that it uses K-Cups adds to the expense of running the coffee maker, as the cost per cup is fairly high. You can also use ground coffee if you buy a specially designed, reusable K-Cup. If you want extensive variety in the way you make coffee, check out the <a href=\"/bunn-review\">Bunn My Cafe MCU</a>.","It has a relatively large water reservoir of 48 ounces, so you can make multiple cups of coffee rapidly, and you can easily adjust the size of the cup with a few touches. You can choose a 6-, 8- or 10-ounce size. However, the largest size here is smaller than the size some other coffee makers will make. The other place it falls short is in its lack of strength control, so it&#39;s not as versatile as other similarly priced single-cup coffee makers.","The removable drip tray makes for easy cleaning, and the company states you can fit a travel mug under the spout when the tray is removed, although if you use a 16-ounce travel mug, you might need a couple of K-Cups to fill it. The K-Cup holder is dishwasher safe, and it shouldn&#39;t need rinsing very regularly as the grinds never come in direct contact with it.","This Keurig K-Classic coffee maker does have an automatic shutoffthat can be programmed for as long as two hours. That said, if you need a cup of coffee every hour, on the hour, it&#39;ll always be ready for you, until you have to refill the reservoir.","The Keurig K55 Elite Brewing System is a reliable single-cup coffee maker from a trusted brand, but it does have its drawbacks. It doesn&#39;t offer much control and has smaller cup sizes than many equivalent single-cup coffee makers. However, it is simple to use and easy to clean, and it will brew a single cup of coffee more quickly than a conventional coffee maker."]},"id":"1a457c78-60f1-47e7-a1d2-d8c7f8bbf815","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61304","url":"/keurig-k-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-25T23:14:52Z","datePublished":"2014-11-25T23:14:52Z","name":"Keurig K55","synopsis":"Keurig is perhaps the name most associated with single-cup coffee makers, so it's unsurprising that the Keurig K55 Elite Brewing System is a formidable force.
