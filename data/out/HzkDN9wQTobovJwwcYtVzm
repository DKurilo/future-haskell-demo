This simple <a href=\"/best-ethernet-switches\">Ethernet switch</a> can help you expand your wired network and power devices, such as VoIP phones, wireless access points, high-resolution photo delivery, HD streaming devices, surveillance cameras and more.","The plug-and-play design means there is no software to download or configurations to set. You can simply plug this switch into your network and start seeing improved internet speeds right away.","This Ethernet switch is a Fast Ethernet device, not a gigabit switch like the <a href=\"/d-link-review\">D-Link DGS-1008G</a> or <a href=\"/tp-link-review\">TP Link TL-SG1005D</a>, which means it can handle speeds of either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps. However, it does have a fast switching capacity of up to 1.6 Gbps, which helps improve download speeds and reduce buffering times.","This ZyXEL product features environmentally friendly features as part of the company’s green networking initiative. These features allow the switch to reduce energy consumption, particularly when ports are not in use, to keep operating costs lower.","The front of the ZyXEL Switch has different LED lights that indicate power and link activity of the different ports. The first four ports are also PoE capable, and the device has separate lights to indicate PoE activity. The Ethernet cables then connect to the device’s rear ports. This switch is compact and made with desktop storage in mind. It also comes with the necessary mounting hardware to mount this device on a rack or on the wall.","The ZyXEL Ethernet switch comes with the N-Way Auto-negotiation function that activates the switch’s duplex mode automatically. This ensures that each connected device is always operating on the highest possible data speed. The duplex mode also means the switch has dedicated bandwidth, a feature that was created to eliminate congestion during the switching process. This also gives the store-and-forward switch two-way communication capabilities to lower the amount of delivery errors when transporting data packets.","Overall, this Ethernet switch is a reliable and simple option for home or office use. While it does not have gigabit Ethernet speed, it does come with a variety of features that can help boost the performance of any wired network."]},"id":"3d85514b-a21e-4ae5-8b03-76545e76a044","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66484","url":"/zyxel-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-07T15:37:36Z","datePublished":"2015-08-07T15:37:36Z","name":"ZyXEL ES1100-8P","synopsis":"The ZyXEL 8-Port Unmanaged Ethernet Switch is a fast-acting, plug-and-play style Ethernet port designed for use in homes and small offices.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The ZyXEL 8-Port Unmanaged Ethernet Switch is a fast-acting, plug-and-play style Ethernet port designed for use in homes and small offices.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-07T15:37:36Z","id":"HzkDN9wQTobovJwwcYtVzm","meta":{"title":"ZyXEL ES1100-8P Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The ZyXEL 8-Port Switch feature is a home and office Ethernet switch designed for those who want to expand their network.
