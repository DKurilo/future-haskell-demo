The solar power kit allows you to live off the grid without the noise or fumes that come with traditional backup generators. It can be charged three different ways. The sun is the main option, though you are also able to charge it through a regular wall outlet or with your car’s 12-volt battery. One thing you should be aware of is that the Goal Zero Yeti is a generator, not a fully functional solar unit, so it will require the purchase of an additional solar panel to work.","The portable solar power system is a small 8-inch box that weighs about 30 pounds. It packs a load of options though. The unit has a sturdy green handle on top for carrying around, but is a bit too heavy for longer trips on foot. Its main purpose is for keeping at a camp or using as an emergency power option at home.","The Goal Zero Yeti can store up to 400 watts on a full charge and comes with several power options. There are two wall sockets for powering devices like a CPAP or TV and there is a USB option for your cellphone or laptop.","Once power is stored in the Goal Zero Yeti, it will charge your small appliances as quickly as a wall socket. A device that requires little power to charge, like a headlamp, can be recharged up to 100 times, while a laptop can be fully charged around three to five times. For appliances that eat a lot more electricity, it might be best to consider a solar power kit that stores a higher total wattage.","The main concern with the Goal Zero Yeti is that it’s a power pack, not a complete solar power kit. Connecting a solar panel to the device is quite simple, but the panel must be purchased separately. The smallest solar panels will fully charge the Yeti in 40 to 80 hours, while larger panels could complete the task in as short as nine hours. This is a versatile machine, but may not be as convenient as you need.","The Goal Zero Yeti complements a camping trip. It can stay at your camp while you go out on excursions and can repower important devices when you return. It works with many third-party solar panels and you can charge it in the wall prior to leaving for the weekend. This is also a good option for keeping around the house for emergency situations."]},"id":"3f9e5b7b-42f7-4cca-8418-e4549c254a68","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61706","url":"/goal-zero-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:28:28Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:28:28Z","name":"Goal Zero Yeti 23000","synopsis":"The Goal Zero Yeti 400 is a quiet, portable solar generator for base camps or cabins, and can be kept at home in case of unexpected outages.
