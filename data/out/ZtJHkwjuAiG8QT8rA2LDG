This <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktop-ranges\">electric range</a> features a high-capacity oven with a covered heating element design and two dual burners at the front of the oven range.","While most radiant cooktop stoves have only one dual burner, both the front heating elements on this oven can be used as either a 9-inch or 6-inch burner. This gives the Samsung FE-R300SB more flexibility as you cook, especially if you have a large pan on one and you need another large pot to be heating up. Having both large elements at the front keeps you from knocking over other pans as you reach to the back to stir as you would with a traditional burner layout.","The large heating elements on the stovetop do a great job of heating up quickly and getting liquids to a boil. You need to be careful as you cook to monitor the heat levels so you don&#39;t burn your food though.","The glass-ceramic stovetop also stays warm long after you&#39;re done cooking. This can be problematic if you have a boil-over or spill as the stove will be too hot to clean up immediately. Fortunately, there is an indicator light that lets you know if the range is still hot so you don&#39;t get burned.","One unique feature of the Samsung FE-R300SB is the SteamQuick self-cleaning option. While most electric stoves only use high temperatures to burn away any debris or spills, the SteamQuick feature use 10 ounces of water to steam away the baked-on food in about 20 minutes. All you have to do is wipe the oven clean after the cycle.","This electric range comes with two oven racks you can place on seven positions to get the right distance from the heating elements. The 5.9-cubic-foot oven is big enough to handle multiple dishes for simultaneous baking. This can help you get meals onto the table quicker.","The 5.9-cubic-foot oven has a hidden heating element that is essentially a covering over the heating element on the bottom of the stove. This keeps food and spills from being baked onto the element and makes it easier to clean the oven. Unfortunately, this covering can sometimes alter the actual temperature of the electric stove, so you may need to adjust the temperature more frequently than with other electric ranges."]},"id":"d6e69f93-b4fd-4406-b3e9-8e09a8455da9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e642ea82-ebc9-41c5-a68b-ab823c78a7e7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it can overheat your pots and pans if you don&#39;t monitor them, the Samsung FE-R300SB brings convenience to your kitchen with its two dual burners, SteamQuick cleaning option and large capacity.
