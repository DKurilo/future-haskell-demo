It weighs just over 3 pounds but is short enough to fit in a standard kitchen cabinet.","The pasta maker machine comes in red, green, pink, light blue, black, blue, gold, silver and copper to accommodate a large range of kitchen color schemes. The color is accented by a steel finish along the shaper. In order to produce each batch of pasta, you must manually turn the hand crank on the right side of the machine. A manually powered machine is not beneficial to those who have minimal strength due to physical disabilities or tire quickly from manual labor. For those who have the ability to withstand the resistance, a manual crank allows you to pace the speed of the dough as it is shaped so that you can correct any issues during production. It also means that you don&#39;t have extra wires running over your kitchen surface. However, if you donâ€™t like a hand-cranked machine, check out the <a href=\"/philips-review\">Philips Avance Collection Pasta Maker</a>.","This pasta maker model is limited, allowing you to make only three shapes. The lasagna and fettuccine noodles are come out in sections 6 mm wide sections, and the tagliolini comes out in 1.5 mm sections. Essentially, this machine by itself is designed to make varying widths of flat noodles and does not make your standard spaghetti. In case you need to create other pasta shapes, the manufacturer created 12 compatible accessories, but none are sold with the kit. You should consider this inconvenience and limited range of pastas if you need to consistently make a variety of shapes.","Even though this pasta maker is manually powered, the manufacturer constructed a bayonet fitting on the opposite side from the pasta machine&#39;s hand crank. A motor attaches at the end and allows you to quickly produce your noodles. This lets you choose the method you use to push the dough through the combing mechanism. At each speed, the anodized aluminum material is resistant to sticking, helping to keep your pasta intact without tears and breaks.","This noodle maker comes with a 10-year warranty and is manufactured in Italy. It is not dishwasher safe and must be cleaned with either a small brush or a toothpick. This process is cumbersome after spending a long time making pasta and makes it difficult to get all of the dough out if some sticks against the aluminum steel.","The Marcato Atlas Wellness 150 Pasta Maker coordinates with many kitchen colors, but it has a limited amount of shapes and requires the purchase of accessories for more variety. It is also difficult to clean. However, it does have the capacity to make pasta both manually and with the use of an electrical motor."]},"id":"a800fb9a-1bb2-420d-8790-0003ec45fd57","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64680","url":"/marcato-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-06T15:34:21Z","datePublished":"2015-05-06T15:34:21Z","name":"Marcato Atlas Wellness 150","synopsis":"The Marcato Atlas Wellness 150 Pasta Maker is a manual pasta machine that is available in several colors to match your other kitchen appliances.
