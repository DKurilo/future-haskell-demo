It gives you compatibility with ANT+ sensors, has preloaded course navigation and is simple to use. However, it lacks certain navigation abilities and Bluetooth compatibility, which is disappointing considering its high price point.","The Navi2coach has customizable data fields that allow you to choose what is displayed on the screen as you ride. It also comes with a small remote that attaches to your handlebars. This means you won’t have to take your hands off the handlebars to scroll through the data that the Navi2Coach is gathering.","This bike computer is fully compatible with ANT+ heart rate, pedal cadence and pedal power sensors, so you’ll have access to the most important training data to track your progress. If you pair the Navi2Coach to one or more of those sensors, data from those sensors will display on the screen during your ride and on the computer after you upload your ride to the O-Synce software.","The software that comes with the Navi2Coach is easy to use, and it allows you to see the route you rode overlaid on a variety of maps. One of the best things about this cycling computer is how easy it is to upload rides to Strava, Training Peaks, Garmin Connect or other online cycling communities, because O-Synce exports your ride files in the industry-standard FIT file format. Not all bike GPS units use FIT, and this file compatibility adds to the simplicity of using the Navi2Coach.","The cycle computer also has preloaded course navigation, which is commonly called breadcrumb navigation. You can preload routes onto the Navi2Coach from your computer, and on your ride, it will display a line of dots – or breadcrumbs – for you to follow. This feature will keep you from getting terribly lost, but you shouldn’t rely on it too heavily for navigation as this style of navigation is unable to show obstacles or terrain changes.","O-Synce has email support as well as a YouTube channel with tutorials. Although not all of the videos are in English, there are enough to help you get feeling comfortable with the Navi2Coach’s features."]},"id":"2c2e1455-3696-4db8-bdbb-2ce55f076fbc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"553dc115-d999-4210-9b30-9d4bd5cb6b0b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The O-Synce Navi2Coach is a well-designed, practical bike GPS unit.
