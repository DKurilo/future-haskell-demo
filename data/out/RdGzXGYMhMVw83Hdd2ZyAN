Many of these services also give you the ability to create and send surveys, either as part of your current plan or for an additional cost. Surveys are a great way to get feedback to better your company and future email marketing campaigns.","<strong>Surveys: Everyone s Doing It</strong>","More than likely, you ve seen or even taken a survey from a company, either from an email newsletter you subscribe to or on a receipt for a purchase at a store or a dinner at a restaurant.","Usually, the company offers to enter you to win a prize, such as cash or an iPad, in exchange for giving it valuable information regarding your recent purchase or visit.","The survey can be specific, with questions about the service you received from a sales associate or server, or about the product you bought. Surveys can also be general, with questions about how the particular store or restaurant looked and how the service was overall.","Companies use this information and data to learn how they can improve their service or products. They can also learn how often customers visit their stores, restaurants or websites, which helps them better customize future email marketing campaigns.","You can create, send and monitor a professional survey using most email marketing services, and these companies usually offer this option at no extra cost when you sign up for an email campaign creation service. Other companies charge an extra fee for survey creation and monitoring.","Like creating an email marketing campaign, you can choose from a set of nicely designed templates, and customize one to fit your needs. You can set up questions and how your customers will answer them, whether it is multiple choice or on a scale of 1 to 10. If you run a restaurant, store or website, you may want to include a question asking how often they visit.","If you sell a specific product, you may want to be more specific and ask what your customers think about the product and how often they use it, whether it&#39;s a vacuum cleaner or software application. If your business offers a service, such as a martial arts academy, you can send surveys on a quarterly basis asking the students how they feel about the classes and instructors.","<strong>Survey Says</strong>","It s easy to track and monitor the survey results within the email marketing service you use. All of this data from the survey will help you improve how your store, restaurant or website looks and runs, or to fix a product you sell or fine-tune a service you provide.","You can also use the survey results to perfect your email marketing campaigns by offering specials or more specific advertising based on a consensus from the survey. Surveys can also help you get an idea of the majorities within specific demographics, such as the age ranges and income groups your restaurant&#39;s customers fall in. This greatly aids in your overall marketing plans.","You can also set up an autoresponder that will email a confirmation that the subscriber who took the survey has been entered into a contest for a prize, if you offer one, or a message with a coupon for your subscriber to use. Sometimes you have to offer something to entice your subscribers to take a survey.","<strong>Summary</strong>","There are many advantages to creating and sending surveys with your email marketing service, no matter what your business is, be it a store, website or restaurant. Surveys also provide you want feedback on the products or services you offer. Customer surveys provide you with valuable data to improve your business, advertising strategy and email marketing campaign."]},"id":"6bf76c69-b95d-4336-9217-e2449d781f96","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6065","url":"/email-marketing-using-surveys-to-improve-your-business","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"heath-mcknight","url":"/author/heath-mcknight","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"Heath McKnight","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"nzA74pybDSvtEy2edLUeu7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-02T04:30:22Z","datePublished":"2011-06-02T04:30:22Z","name":"Email Marketing: Using Surveys to Improve Your Business","synopsis":"Email marketing services allow you to create, send and monitor effective email marketing campaigns.","review":{},"strapline":"Email marketing services allow you to create, send and monitor effective email marketing campaigns.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-23T22:25:35Z","id":"RdGzXGYMhMVw83Hdd2ZyAN","meta":{"title":"Email Marketing: Using Surveys to Improve Your Business","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
