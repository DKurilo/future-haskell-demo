You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Onkyo BD-SP308 is Onkyo’s least expensive <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a>. And while it may be inexpensive, it isn’t cheap.  It has many of the features we think a standard Blu-ray player should have like Dolby True HD, a USB port, DVD upscaling and more. However, it isn’t in our top three reviews because it doesn’t have surround sound capability, built in storage or DLNA certification.","When you purchase a Blu-ray player, you are buying it for its ability to make your video-watching experience leagues better. Good thing the Onkyo BD-SP 308 has an excellent video technology arsenal. Not only can you adjust the picture, but the Blu-ray technology automatically upscales all of your DVDs, has 24p True Cinema and Full HD 1080p resolution. Best of all, the Deep Color option makes the movie’s colors seem even richer and complex than you’ve ever seen before.","While your eyes are being dazzled by the video features, your ears will be just as impressed. This Blu-ray player has the works when it comes to audio technology: Dolby True HD, dts and dtsHD. It will also playback MP3 music files.","One area the Onkyo BD-SP308 is sorely lacking is features.  One might say that features are the icing on the cake, and while this Blu-ray player does have internet access for online content and BD-Live capability, that’s about it. However, BD-Live is a pretty cool feature, maybe you won’t miss the absence of a child lock or DLNA certification.","As long as you’re connected to the internet, BD-Live can access additional content on your Blu-ray discs. This bonus content can be anything from additional footage, behind the scenes action, interactive games or director commentary. The BonusView option associated with BD-Live is another perk, allowing you to view an extra window in the upper corner of your screen for picture-in-picture viewing.","Since accessing the internet via your Blu-ray player is so important, it’s essential that it is Wi-Fi ready. Although the Onkyo BD-SP308 is WiFi ready, that doesn’t mean it will automatically connect to the internet. You still need to setup internet access and make the appropriate connections whether via a USB adapter or something else. Before purchase, make sure you have all of the necessary accessories.","The Onkyo BD-SP308’s functionality score was redeemed by the variety of input and output options.","I/O Ports Available:"]},"id":"601c94c1-bf11-48cf-b233-324f7ae030b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Component Video","Ethernet Port","HDMI Output","Optical Digital Audio Outputs","SD Card Slot","USB"],"type":"ul"},"id":"062624c6-01e9-4742-ba0c-ca7b7e6850d7","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The one I/O port the Onkyo BD-SP308 is missing is a 7.1 channel audio output which makes surround sound possible. If you purchased this player, you’d have to settle for a 2 channel audio output and no surround sound.","With so many different video formats out there, Blu-ray players have a heavy burden to bear. The Onkyo BD-SP308 makes video format compatibility look easy because it can play every format we could think of. From Audio CDs to DivX to MP4 to regular DVDs, this Onkyo can play it."]},"id":"a5b61742-c86d-47d6-b1ee-a0d52d0271ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9fa7a6d3-98ed-4f2c-9a1a-5fab890a0923","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Onkyo BD-SP308 Blu-ray player may not have all of the features we’ve deemed important; it is missing an Energy Star qualification, DLNA certification and built-in storage to name a few.
