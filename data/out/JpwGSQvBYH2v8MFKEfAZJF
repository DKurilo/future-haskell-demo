You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Eagleye Technology EGS-28 DVR Clock is a mini desk clock camera that touts a modern, stylish design. In fact, we dare say it has hands-down one of the best designs of any <a href=\"/best-nanny-cams\">nanny cam</a> we reviewed and would be perfectly situated on any bookshelf, end table or countertop. But the nanny cam&#39;s attractive appearance fails to fully compensate for a few obvious drawbacks.","To begin with, the clock camera has built-in DVR so it can capture and store recordings internally, but it is not equipped with a motion detector. A nanny cam without motion detection mode seems completely counterintuitive since footage is captured regardless of whether or not there is any observable activity. Furthermore, without this vital function the hidden clock camera seems a bit gimmicky and more like a novelty trinket than a respectable recording device.","In addition, the nanny cam has no time-scheduled recording capabilities. While other nanny cams in our lineup lacked this feature as well, the deficiency is particularly amplified with this clock camera simply because it does not offer motion detection mode either. Subsequently, recording must always be activated manually, which is highly inconvenient for users.","The last conspicuous shortfall we came across is memory capacity. While an internal microSD card is included, the clock camera can only support a maximum memory capacity of 4GB. We are somewhat perplexed as to why a nanny cam that is limited to solely nonstop recording would not support a larger memory capacity. Assuming the battery actually lasted, the clock camera would likely run out of storage space in less than five hours with such a little amount of memory capacity.","There&#39;s no question we have some major issues with the functionality (or lack thereof). However, to be fair, it does offer some beneficial features as well. For instance, all recordings are time-stamped, the camera is equipped with a built-in lithium-ion battery and the device offers dual functionality as an analog clock. Additionally, it can take still digital images and serve as a lightweight webcam.","The nanny cam also had better video output than we had expected. With a VGA resolution of 640 x 480, the clock camera delivers AVI-format video that is unexpectedly clear and fluid. One thing we found surprising is the camera is outfitted with a USB port instead of RCA video output. While this doesn&#39;t necessarily hinder usability, it means users must connect the camera to a viewing device that has a USB port, such as a computer, instead of a conventional television."]},"id":"89fe0526-c9d9-4ff1-be6b-3bd5d4a134cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d71c9e48-94e2-4f2e-920a-513a3f2be530","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We absolutely love this nanny cam&#39;s contemporary, polished design, and it&#39;s one of the least expensive clock cameras we came across.

The Eagleye Technology EGS-28 DVR Clock may be apt for consumers set on a stylish product, but for most users we&#39;d recommend selecting a more robust and versatile camera."]},"id":"a31e3d9e-65e0-4550-aee2-5a57ce764751","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51250","url":"/eg-desk-clock-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-28T14:34:31Z","datePublished":"2010-10-28T14:34:31Z","name":"EG-S28 DVR Clock","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":66,"verdict":"While stylish, there are overall better and more functional nanny cams available.","pros":["The nanny cam offers an incomparable stylish design and a built-in battery.
