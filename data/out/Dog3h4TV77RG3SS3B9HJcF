With dedicated connections, internet security, encryption and network protection, business ISPs offer more quality, more freedom to download and exchange data, and better security options for businesses. Popular business ISPs like <a href=\"/centurylink-review\">CenturyLink</a>, <a href=\"/frontier-review\">Frontier</a> and <a href=\"/earthlink-review\">EarthLink</a> offer residential, small business and large business internet solutions.","<strong>Business ISP: What to Look For</strong>","Choosing the business ISP for your needs means selecting features, choosing security and networking protection, and considering your bandwidth and downloading needs. The following criteria can help you with decide which internet options suit your business.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>Network security is important for most types of business, even if you are only handling basic internet searches. With credit cards, online purchases, orders and potential data transfer, you need your connections to be secure. Depending on the business internet company, security might include firewalls, DDoS mitigation, email and web defense, encryption or even personally managed security.","<strong>Bandwidth Speed</strong><br/>Bandwidth speed affects how many connections you can have at once, as well as how much you pay for certain amounts of data and performance when using applications such as video streams, VoIP and file downloads. Most business ISPs offer service levels, and charge according to the bandwidth cap that you want to set. If you go over your cap, you have to either pay extra or you lose connectivity or internet speed for the rest of the month. For this reason, it is important to choose a service plan that offers the bandwidth you need for all of your devices and applications.","<strong>Connection Types</strong><br/>Network connections are important for supporting speed, download types and number of connections. The basic option is DSL, which uses standard phone lines, supports up to 15 Mbps for download and 1 Mbps for upload, or around 12 simultaneous connections. Cable connections are faster but cost more money. They require that the ISP runs a cable to your business, but they usually offer speeds of 50 to 100 Mbps for downloads and 2 to 10 Mbps for uploads, with enough bandwidth for a few dozen connections, or several point-of-sale applications. Fiber-optic cables are the most expensive but offer the fastest speeds with up to 150 Mbps download speed and 5 to 35 Mbps upload speed.","<strong>Hardware</strong><br/>Hardware installation allows you to get your internet and other online services set up without needing to hire a separate IT technician to do the work for you. Most business ISPs only set up a single router and may charge fees for doing so. Other internet providers offer full installation. This means that they will ensure that all of your computers and devices are connected, although this may be for a separate fee.","<strong>Bundles &amp; Packages</strong><br/>Bundles and packages allow you to add telephone, TV and sometimes various functions like remote IT, IT service, backups and VoIP (voice over internet protocol). Packages allow you to get everything you need from one provider, but it is important that you make sure they offer everything you need.","Choosing the right business internet service allows you to get the best internet options for your business, no matter how much you rely on the web."]},"id":"7d73335d-30e3-4d08-a3c2-4b698c18dbc0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"be1c468e-e9ec-40a8-892b-e4d6f5498f58","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7911941-12221671-1442582560000\">AT&amp;T</a>","<a href=\"http://www.centurylinkquote.com/business?kbid=47468\">CenturyLink</a>","<a href=\"https://www.charter.com/browse/browse-bundles/bundles?intcmp=internet_hero\">Charter</a>","<a href=\"http://www.earthlinkbusiness.com/data-services/internet-access.xea\">EarthLink</a>","<a href=\"https://frontier.com/small-business/internet-services/high-speed-internet-plans/?kbid=74083\">Frontier</a>","<a href=\"http://www.level3.com/en/contact-level-3/\">Level 3 Communications</a>","<a href=\"https://mediacomcable.com/site/bundles.php\">Mediacom</a>","<a href=\"https://www.tdsbusiness.com/GetAQuote.aspx\">TDS</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7911941-12304914-1443793143000\">Verizon</a>","<a href=\"http://www.windstreambusiness.com/products/small-business\">Windstream</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"528b1d2d-8f9e-4384-8c4d-1dcf3baad220","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1638","url":"/best-business-isp-providers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T21:00:45Z","datePublished":"2016-04-08T17:48:52Z","name":"Business ISP Providers Review","synopsis":"Business ISPs allow you to use business quality internet service with features including management, content sharing and security.
