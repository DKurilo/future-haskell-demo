One of the difficulties that every Bluetooth car kit contends with is background noise and echoing caused by the microphone picking up the caller&#39;s voice from the speaker. The four microphones allow for better filtering of the audio because they can better distinguish between your voice and the background noise while ensuring that you don&#39;t get feedback when the caller talks.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60108-motorola-roadster-pro3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lvh2XsFnNA7EbZ968h4UF3.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Lvh2XsFnNA7EbZ968h4UF3","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lvh2XsFnNA7EbZ968h4UF3.jpg","alt":""},"id":"3692e077-969b-446e-ac7b-ec0fa8b1b69b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Roadster Pro also features HD voice technology that relaxes the bandwidth frequency range of your voice and the caller&#39;s voice so that it sounds like your caller&#39;s in your car. The standard narrowband frequency for phone calls is only 300Hz to 3.4kHz. The narrowness of this frequency range causes the voice to sound tinny and flat because this only covers a small portion of the human voice&#39;s frequency range, which is approximately 80Hz to 14kHz. HD voice simply widens the frequency range to 50Hz up to 7kHz so that more detail is present in the voice, leading to better communication.","You can also use multiple devices at the same time. Many Bluetooth car kits allow you to connect multiple devices, but only one device can pair at a time. With multipoint sharing, you can have your personal mobile phone and your work phone paired to it at the same time.
