We learned as much as possible about upright vacuums, starting with extensive reading and watching a number of videos showing how effective different models were and what qualities they offered. We also read manufacturer websites, looked at specifications and examined warranties. In addition, we read user reviews from people who had purchased different models to see what they liked or disliked about the upright vacuum cleaner they had gotten. We purchased the best-regarded products of those we researched to test.","<strong>How Much Does an Upright Vacuum Cleaner Cost?</strong>","We also took cost into account. We tested a wide range of vacuum cleaners to get an idea of how lower-priced options compare with more expensive ones – from a $99 unit to a $450 one. Most folks are not looking for the pricey models. The average price of the best-selling uprights on Amazon, Best Buy and Lowe&#39;s is only about $225. Generally speaking, though, the more you pay, the better the suction and cleaning quality. The more expensive units were dramatically better at cleaning in our tests, on all surfaces.<br/><strong><br/>Things to Look for in a Vacuum Cleaner</strong>","When buying a vacuum cleaner, you must first decide which configuration you want – canister or upright. Americans tend to choose uprights, said Leo Steinys, director of product management with Kenmore, which makes both upright and canister models. Also, Americans often have more than one vacuum in the home, so they might have an upright for cleaning flooring and a canister or hand vacuum for stairs and furniture. Europeans tend to buy one canister that can do it all, Steinys said. Others in the industry have observed the same.","&#34;Canisters are the preferred platform for outside of the U.S. really,&#34; said Dirk Sappok, director of product development at Miele. &#34;Canister vacuums are very popular in Europe and Asian markets.&#34;","Every company is different, but at least one of the big names is now looking at traditional uprights as a thing of the past. James Dyson has actually stated he is no longer investing in the research, design and development of conventional upright machines. We spoke with Josh Mutlow, senior design engineer at Dyson, and he explained the decision to move away from the traditional upright design. &#34;We as a company definitely, definitely believe that the cord-free machines transform the way you clean and change your habits so much that the conventional full-size machines are kind of now obsolete,” said Mutlow.","The idea is that you will clean more often for less time with the new, more powerful <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vacuum cleaners</a>. Not everyone is interested in that, though. ","<strong>Are Bagged Vacuums Better Than Bagless?</strong>","If your sights are set on an upright configuration, there are still a lot of decisions to make. For one thing, you have to decide between bagged and bagless units. Bagged units are better at containing the dust and are easier to use in some ways – you just throw the bag out. Units with a dust cup eliminate the ongoing cost of buying bags and they can be sort of fun in a way.","&#34;You can actually see what you are removing from your flooring. It&#39;s very satisfying,&#34; said Steinys.","You invest more time, though, because you have to periodically wipe out the dust cup. You also create a pretty massive dust cloud when it is time to empty the dust cup, so people with allergies should look for a bagged unit, said Steinys. They encapsulate the dust more. He also recommends looking for units that are certified by groups like the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America if you have anyone with sensitivities in your home.","Once you have decided between bagged and bagless, consider these other important upright vacuum factors:","<strong>Performance</strong><br/>Obviously, strong suction and cleaning power are the most important factors in choosing a vacuum cleaner. Strong suction saves time by helping you get a surface clean in fewer passes. The problem is it&#39;s hard to know, before you buy it, how quickly a vacuum picks up debris. The numbers on the box are of little help so we recommend reading reviews from those who have tried the vacuum you are considering. We test the best upright vacuum cleaners by hand and update our selections on a regular basis to gauge cleaning power and maneuverability. When a vacuum is easy to move around and under furniture, it can save you time. Pet owners should look for comments and scoring related to hair removal in all user reviews, including ours. We have a specific score just for pet hair removal. Aside from reading expert and user reviews, you should consider factors like price and the quality of filtration.","<strong>Convenience &amp; Design</strong><br/>It’s great to get a lightweight upright vacuum that is powerful at the same time because you can carry it from one place to the next, or upstairs, without difficulty. It’s also useful to buy one with a long enough electrical cord so you don’t have to keep stopping to plug and unplug it. Although all vacuums are fairly loud, it’s also good to get a relatively quiet machine.<br/><strong><br/>Accessories</strong><br/>A long and extendable vacuum hose helps you clean above windows, along baseboards and in other awkward areas. It’s also useful to get an upright vacuum that comes with an upholstery brush so you can clean your furniture while you’re doing the floors. Having a dusting brush helps you can clean Venetian blinds, light fixtures and other dust-collectors in your home. You’ll also undoubtedly appreciate having a crevice tool so you can clear the dirt and dust from tight spots.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We used our test vacuums in our laboratory on strips of hardwood flooring, medium-pile carpeting intended for homes and low-pile industrial carpeting. We tried each machine on each surface and tested how well every model cleaned Cheerios that we’d walked on so they had crumbled and gotten crunched into the flooring, which is typical of what happens in real-life settings. We then tested suction on flour we had scattered onto each surface and checked how well each vacuum performed on finer, dust-like substances. After that, we used each upright vacuum to try to clean ground-in dog hair. The final test was checking to see how each vacuum cleaned up scattered kitty litter.","We experimented with all the controls on each vacuum, counted how many passes we had to make over a surface to clear away different types of debris and noted how much of each scattered or ground-in material remained. More subjectively, we examined the maneuverability of each vacuum, using each around table legs and under a TV console. In addition, we looked for a swiveling head.","We also measured the noise each vacuum made and checked cord and hose length, machine weight, the cleaning path size and the handle height. We scored each machine for various extra features such as onboard attachment holders, the number of accessories, whether you get good customer support, warranty length and more.","<strong>What Is a Good Wattage for a Vacuum Cleaner?</strong>","It can be difficult to tell how much power a vacuum cleaner has before you buy it, and there is really no number that gives an accurate indication. Wattage is no help, although it may seem like a logical number to care about. Wattage is just a representation of the amount of electricity that will be consumed by the vacuum cleaner. More wattage just means consuming more energy.<br/><br/>Amps are also useless in choosing, even though vacuum cleaner marketers sometimes tout it. “Amperage is merely the amount of muscle that it takes to push the voltage,” said Keith Quimby, a Utah-based vacuum dealer and repairman with more than 30 years of experience. Higher amperage generates more heat, which will lead to more wear on the motor. More amperage can lead to higher rotations per minute, but that doesn’t matter if the machine is not built well.","Good airflow and good agitation are the key to effective cleaning with a vacuum, according to Quimby. There really aren’t any numbers that indicate that. That’s why talking to a professional and reading well-researched reviews is so helpful.","There may not be a number to indicate agitation, but air wattage can offer some helpful information about cleaning power. It is one of the few numbers that might help you narrow down your search for the best vacuum cleaner within your budget. The air wattage (AW) is basically the wattage used by a vacuum to move a unit of air through an opening – the hose nozzle or the cleaning head. &#34;It&#39;s an internal technical term for how strong the suction is on a vacuum. The more Air Watts, the stronger the suction,&#34; said Caitlin Wagner, Product Manager for upright vacuums at Shark. ","One problem is that the air wattage can be a hard number to find. Manufacturers often list the motor wattage in their literature, which is not meaningful in terms of performance, but not air wattage, which is. You can request this information from manufacturers directly. ","Suction claims can give you some idea, because they are based on air wattage, in theory.","<strong>Environmentally Friendly Options</strong>","A vacuum cleaner’s environmental footprint may not be your top consideration when choosing a machine. But if this factor is important to you, consider the following options for finding a greener vacuum:"]},"id":"ede77aa2-cb37-40f5-9145-d90066bb2a35","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Consider durability. One way to make a more environmentally friendly vacuum-cleaner purchase is to buy a brand that has a reputation for durability. Don’t know which brands those are? Consult with local vacuum-cleaner dealers, and read lots of online reviews. Putting a vacuum cleaner in the landfill every year or two is not the most environmentally friendly option.","Repair, rather than replace. Many vacuum-cleaner problems can be resolved by replacing a part rather than getting a new vacuum. Check with the local vacuum shop for an estimate on repairs.","Research the batteries. If you are looking at a model with a battery, do a little research about where that battery will eventually go. For example, Hoover has partnered with the <a href=\"https://www.call2recycle.org/\">Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corp</a>., which can connect you with a drop-off location so that your battery doesn’t end up in a landfill.","Look for the label. Many studies have shown that indoor air quality is substantially worse than outdoor air quality in many areas, so look for labels from organizations that certify that vacuum cleaners will keep your personal environment pollutant-free. The Carpet and Rug Institute gives products a <a href=\"https://carpet-rug.org/testing/green-label-plus/\">green label</a> only when they have been proven to do a good job of containing dust particles.

It may seem like a pretty big risk to run something so harsh along hardwood flooring, especially if you have older or less lacquered finishes. However, in our experience, upright vacuums pose little risk to hardwood floors. We&#39;ve run a lot of vacuums across a lot of flooring over the years and have not seen any damage from bristles or wheels, which also have the potential to cause problems.","The bigger risk when using a typical upright on hardwood is that the flooring may not get clean. Even when we adjust the cleaning head up or down, we&#39;ve found that a lot of uprights fling debris out of the way rather than cleaning it up. Carpeting holds debris in place until the suction can reach it. On hardwood, debris can slide far out of the cleaning path. The <a href=\"/shark-rotator-review\">Shark DuoClean Powered Lift-Away NV800</a> was the best upright vacuum at cleaning hardwood. It even stood out among vacuums specifically designed for hardwood floors.","While the vacuums we&#39;ve tried haven&#39;t damaged our floors, they still might damage yours, depending on the wood&#39;s finish and other factors. Check out our review of the <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\">best hardwood floor vacuums</a> for a list of specialized models.","<strong>What Is the Best Vacuum Cleaner for Hardwood Floors?</strong>","The Shark DuoClean Powered Lift-Away NV800 was spectacular at cleaning hardwood flooring. In fact, it earned the title of best overall <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\">hardwood floor vacuum</a> when we tested it alongside similar products. It didn’t rank higher in our upright vacuum comparison for a couple reasons. First, it was edged out by one competitor when we expanded our testing to include carpeting – both low and high pile. It was almost as good on carpeting, but the Eureka Brushroll Clean was slightly better. Since that is the most common flooring upright vacuum cleaners are used on, it weighed heavily in our scoring. Second, the NV800 is relatively expensive. Most people are looking for something lower in price. The NV800 was the absolute best for hardwood floors, though.","While the NV800 was edged out for best overall in our upright vacuum comparison, it did win for maneuverability. The NV800 was easy to weave around obstacles in our tests, and it pulls apart to become a canister vacuum.","<strong>Unexpected Uses for Vacuum Cleaners</strong>","A new upright vacuum cleaner is a pretty big investment for most people. Fortunately, these machines do more than clean carpets. We scoured the internet for other tasks vacuums can tackle.

Just put a stocking over the end of the attachment, and secure it with a rubber band. That way, the vacuum won&#39;t mangle the item.","Grooming pets: Want to prevent some of your pet&#39;s shedding? Use the brush attachment and a low setting to vacuum your animal’s coat. That way, you can collect a little dog hair before it migrates to flooring and furniture. A dog with the right temperament might actually love this.","Soothing a baby: This may take some conditioning, but the white noise of a vacuum cleaner can be quite calming for a baby. You can get newborns used to the routine by putting them in a strap-on carrier and taking them with you as you vacuum. Once you get them to sleep that way a few times, they will start responding the same way every time.","Caring for plants: Plants with larger leaves get dusty. You can use the brush attachment and the hose to clean them gently.","Dusting ceiling fans: Vacuum cleaners with long hoses can help you clean the blades of your fans. The benefit is that the vacuum sucks up the dust, so you avoid unleashing it onto your furniture.","Cleaning windows and doors: Use the hose attachment to clean window and sliding-door tracks. This is a prime place for allergens to collect, and you can get rid of them before they get into the house.","Adding scents: Soak a cotton ball with your favorite perfume or scented oil, and drop it into the vacuum cleaner bag. It leaves a subtle scent.","Cleaning dryer vents: You could ball up the lint by hand, but to clean your dryer vent well, use your vacuum cleaner.","Repairing carpets: If you rearrange your furniture and find dents where the legs used to be, try leaving some ice cubes on those spots.

The only problem is it might not get clean. Vacuuming vinyl flooring comes with the same problems as vacuuming wood flooring – lots of traditional vacuum cleaners fling debris out of the way instead of sucking it up. The slick surface makes it easy for the debris to slide away from the suction path as the spinning brushroll of a traditional upright hits it. If you have a lot of vinyl and you don&#39;t want to break out the broom and dustpan, consider a vacuum cleaner that works better on hard surfaces. The <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleanersshark-duoclean-review\">Shark DuoClean Powered Lift-Away NV800</a> is excellent. If you prefer a cordless model, consider the <a href=\"/dyson-cyclone-v10-review\">Dyson Cyclone v10 Absolute</a>, which is also wonderful on hard floor surfaces.

However, the CRI does recommend you establish a vacuuming schedule, and the organization is more specific about deep cleaning, recommending a professional deep cleaning every 12 to 18 months.","Doug Payne, owner of the Utah-based Payneless Floor Care, has 30 years in the carpet care business. He recommends a regular carpet cleaning by a professional who knows how to use the right amount of soap and water. He also said too much vacuuming can be bad for carpets. &#34;Three times a week is the perfect amount because the dust won&#39;t have a chance to settle in,&#34; Payne said.","When he cleans carpets that have been vacuumed every day, he can see signs of damage to carpet fibers. Payne told us you can never restore carpet fiber, and when you fray fibers too much, they become like microfibers, attracting more dust. New, tightly twisted carpet repels more dust and stains.","Still, there’s really no final word on how often you should vacuum your floors, since much depends on what makes you feel comfortable and how much traffic each area gets.","<strong>How Long Does Carpeting Last?</strong>","You can prolong the life of your carpets by vacuuming and shampooing them, but you&#39;ll eventually need to replace them.
