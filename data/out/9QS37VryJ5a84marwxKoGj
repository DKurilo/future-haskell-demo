The program is divided into training courses and practice exercises, so you divide your time between learning about speed reading and practicing it. This software’s training exercises focus on improving your speed by training your eyes and your memory. During these exercises, 7 Speed Reading flashes phrases on the screen, which teaches your brain to read by grouping words together rather than by focusing on them individually. The program comes with a built-in library of over 20,000 eBooks you can use during training. You can also import PDFs and entire webpages to practice your speed reading – for example, you can upload and practice with material you need to read for work or school. The software lets you customize font and text size so you don’t strain your eyes, and you can adjust the reading speed so you can still comprehend the text. This software is more expensive than several other programs we tested, and your license expires after 10 years. However, that should be more than enough time to increase your reading speed. Also, you can install the program on an unlimited number of computers.","<a href=\"/7-speed-reading-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"5e04d52c-0d13-47e8-9418-7146240fb067","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"5fbce93c-59b3-4128-abff-dced27dc3b79","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/hVTfx6PayLbj6Z9XZYtwhS.jpg","link":{"href":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/speed-reader-x-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/V/6/790386/original/Speed-Reading-Software-Speed-Reader-1a.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hVTfx6PayLbj6Z9XZYtwhS.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"hVTfx6PayLbj6Z9XZYtwhS","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hVTfx6PayLbj6Z9XZYtwhS.jpg","alt":"Speed Reader-X"},"id":"7d800858-f2ee-4d04-954f-8e81c36f0bf2","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Speed Reader-X\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":122,"url":"/speed-reader-x-review","name":"Speed Reader-X","id":"1227"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/speed-reader-x-review\">Speed Reader-X</a>","pros":["You can have an unlimited number of user accounts","The software automatically gives you speed and comprehension tests","The software includes 17,000 eBooks"],"cons":["The software looks outdated and the website is hard to navigate","The software doesn’t include comprehension exercises","This software only has a one-year license"]},"id":"ff6e46c1-69bd-48c7-8d68-86697f6fca27","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Speed Reader-X is the cheapest software we tested, and it includes lessons, activities and tests to help you increase your reading speed.

We’ve tested and compared these programs to find out which can improve your reading speed the most.","We didn’t test the multitude of free apps, such as Spritz and Amazon Fire’s Word Runner, that help you speed read by flashing text from articles and books on the screen. Instead, we reviewed downloadable and online speed reading software with exercises and instruction that help you improve your eye muscle movement with daily workouts.","We also spent time researching speed reading to gather the latest information about the topic from the scientific community. Learning more about speed reading helped us evaluate which programs make reasonable claims about improving speed. ","<br/><strong>How Much Does Speed Reading Software Cost?</strong>","Some programs only require a one-time download fee, though they often have a bit less connectivity than others. You access other programs by paying for a subscription that lasts several days, months or even years. While programs you pay for outright are often cheaper, we found that subscription software usually has more up-to-date features and can help you achieve your goals quickly. The programs we tested range in price from hundreds of dollars to less than $20 a month. We recommend you pay no more than $100 total, whether you opt for a subscription course or a one-time download. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","After downloading each software, we compared its features to those in the other programs we reviewed. We paid special attention to how many people can use the software as well as how many computers you can install it on. We preferred online programs because they are easier to access, and you can use them anywhere you have an internet connection.","We also considered the number of activities and exercises each software includes. Programs with a variety of activities, eye fixation exercises and a tachistoscope are best, and a few even include test preparation and memory improvement add-ons.","Many programs come with eBooks and other texts to read during the exercises and as you practice. We counted the number of eBooks in each software to see which offers the best value overall. We also considered whether you can import your own content into the program. That way, you can read material you’re interested while you practice. ","<strong>Does Speed Reading Really Work?</strong>","Over the years, some incredible claims have been made about how quickly humans can read. Reports of American presidents, such as John F. Kennedy, reading at speeds over 1,000 words per minute have perpetuated the creation of online and correspondence courses as well as seminars. There are even a few competitions where readers clock incredible speeds. However, according to most of the research we found, the average human’s comprehension drops off precipitously at about 600 words per minute. Olga Khazan, a writer for The Atlantic, reported, “in the World Championship Speed Reading Competition, top contestants read about 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute, but they only understand about half of what they take in.”","Another article from the Guardian states most readers average a pace of about 250 to 300 words a minute. Most of the programs we reviewed guarantee a two- to three-times increase in speed. While it’s possible to increase your reading speed, we’d hesitate to use any programs that make claims about speeds over 1,000 words per minute – if you reach such speeds, you should be aware of how it impacts the amount of information you retain. That’s why we think comprehension tests, like the ones you find in the very best speed reading software, are so important as you train.","<strong>Is Speed Reading Software Popular?</strong>","Reading, whether for work or pleasure, has long been popular. However, over the past 70 years, there has been increasing interest in speed reading thanks to the ever-growing amount of news, books and other types of information we take in daily. Many people feel as though there is simply too much to take in at a normal pace or that they can’t read everything they need to in a timely manner.","With speed reading software, it is possible to learn to balance faster reading speeds with comprehension and retention. This software also teaches good reading habits, such as how to skim or look for rhythm, and can help reduce or eliminate bad habits like subvocalization. Most of these programs are easy to use, and it doesn’t take long to get a feel for how they work and to get in the habit of using your new skills to speed through whatever text is in front of you.","People are increasingly turning to speed reading applications to get through all the text thrown at them every day. These programs help people get through all the daily news, social media posts, emails and books they need to. If you’ve set a resolution to read more books this year, speed reading software is a great way to get the assistance you need to meet your goal.","<br/><strong>How Do You Become a Speed Reader?</strong>","The programs we tested use eye exercises, tests and practice materials to overcome some of the natural habits we develop while reading. For example, many focus on eliminating regression, or rereading passages you’ve already read. They also target subvocalization, where you sound out the words in your mind. Both habits can slow a reader down.  Many of the programs use eye exercises to help you reduce fixation, or the amount of time you need to spend on a word before you move on.","Each program contains different instructions about how to best uses its exercises.
