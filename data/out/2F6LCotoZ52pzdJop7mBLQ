The 8-Inch Sensor Mirror does for <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">lighted vanity mirrors</a> what the company has previously done for dish drainers and trashcans. Its sleek style and slim profile fit in well on almost any bathroom counter or vanity.","A sensor turns on the LED lighted mirror as soon as your face appears in the glass. The circular light illuminates your face evenly, without creating irritating shadows. The light itself is powered by long-lasting and energy-efficient LED bulbs that last for years. The cordless mirror can be recharged completely using the included USB cord. A single charge lasts for up to five weeks, and you may never have to replace the bulbs during the lifetime of this mirror.","This lighting system simulates natural light, making it appropriate for adjusting colors and shades in professional environments and outdoor events. simplehuman uses a color rendering index (CRI), to simulate natural sunlight for all of its lighted mirrors. This mirror has its highest rating of 90, which includes the full color spectrum of natural light. Micro reflectors in the light ensure even distribution. The mirror is curved to help prevent the distortion inherent in flat mirrors. Both the height and swivel are adjustable to give you different views.","The five times magnification allows you to see tiny details without squinting or leaning in. It may also help with shaping eyebrows, applying eye makeup, trimming mustaches, putting in contacts and other detailed tasks. This may also serve as a good mirror for shaving. Even with this magnification, you can sit anywhere from 8 to 10 inches from the mirror and get a full view of your face. While this is a high-end device, the company provides a five-year warranty.","This is not a double-sided mirror, so the five times magnification is your only option. This may be a downside if you prefer a regular mirror to double check hair and makeup at a standard view. The light turns on every time you pass the mirror, so you may want to keep it set up in an area of your home that isn&#39;t exposed to heavy traffic. A light that clicks on at irregular intervals may not be a welcome addition to the bedroom, especially at night. If you want a double sided mirror that isn&#39;t motion activated, you might be interested in <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">Ovente</a>.","The simplehuman is a modern lighted vanity mirror with design features like micro reflectors, natural sunlight replication and rechargeable LED lights that should last a lifetime. A five-year warranty is provided for additional security. You may want to set this up in a bathroom or area where the automatic light sensor won&#39;t be a nuisance."]},"id":"78c3502b-f6cd-4b29-827a-f8b5a77b0f9c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66159","url":"/simplehuman-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-10T21:46:08Z","datePublished":"2015-07-10T21:46:08Z","name":"simplehuman 8-inch Sensor","synopsis":"simplehuman is known for giving household objects playful designs, as well as improving their features for a modern world.
