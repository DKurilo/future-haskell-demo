You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Since the ‘90s, Nintendo has dominated the handheld game console market, seeing other mobile consoles come and go. However, Sony learned many lessons from its mildly successful PlayStation Portable and offers a top handheld <a href=\"/electronics/gaming/best-video-game-consoles\">video game console</a> with the PS Vita.","The PlayStation Vita is a major improvement over the original Vita. It is lighter and more comfortable in the hands, and its expected battery life capacity is approximately between four and six hours, nearly double that of its previous iteration. However, its one downside is that its LCD touchscreen is less crisp than the original Vita’s OLED screen. Also, the Vita Slim utilizes Sony’s proprietary memory cards, which are far more expensive than standard SD cards. Still, with its remote play on the PlayStation 4 and wide range of independent games, the Vita Slim is a top mobile gaming console.","The PlayStation Vita Slim offers impressive technology, including 512MB of RAM and 1GB of internal storage. Its quad-core CPU and GPU give it more power than nearly any handheld device. All this helps the Vita keep up with the PlayStation 4 itself. You can play your PS4 video games on your Vita as long as you are connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the console.","The exclusive Vita games are not as impressive as games from other consoles, though. While it has a few impressive titles like Tearaway and Gravity Rush, most of the titles are independent games or ports available on other systems. Also, the Vita Slim is not backward compatible, so if you own PSP games, you’ll have to buy them again if you wish to play them on the Vita. It’s worth noting that this is an extremely popular console for JRPG lovers – that’s Japanese Role-Playing Games, if you’re unfamiliar with the term. The console does have a variety of games available, whether you’re looking for lengthy games that’ll take you 70 hours to complete, or rapid-fire shoot-em-up gameplay.","The Vita Slim has a few downgraded features compared to its predecessor. For example, while the original Vita offered both 3G connectivity and Wi-Fi, the Slim only connects to the internet via Wi-Fi. It also has an LCD touchscreen, as opposed to the original’s OLED touchscreen. Fortunately, it is lighter and more comfortable than the original, and it has an impressive battery life, lasting between four and six hours depending on the game you’re playing.","The Slim offers dual analog sticks and two touch surfaces. The touchscreen and the rear touchpad offer physical controls for many games. You can buy games on Vita cards, similar to cartridges, or on the PlayStation Network store.","This handheld console gives smartphones and tablets a run for their memory when it comes to extra entertainment. You can listen to music or watch movies stored on the memory card, and there are apps for Netflix, Hulu Plus and YouTube. The system features both front and rear cameras, and the Skype app helps keep you connected to family and friends.","Sony offers excellent support from the PlayStation website. There, you can browse FAQs and see the status of the PlayStation network. You can get help from the user forum or download new manuals and guides. If you need help from customer service representatives, they are available by telephone and live chat.","The PlayStation Vita Slim is a great handheld game console, allowing you to play games on the go or at home. Paired with a PlayStation 4, it’s a well-rounded entertainment hub wherever you go. The Slim is lighter and more comfortable than the original Vita, though its downgraded LCD screen and low number of exclusive games in comparison to other platforms may be disappointing to some. Still, it offers several unique features that make it a great system for hardcore mobile gaming."]},"id":"f008ce2b-d6af-4e8e-9cc1-d8a30b096ae5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69295","url":"/vita-slim-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-10T16:11:17Z","datePublished":"2017-05-10T16:11:17Z","name":"PlayStation Vita Slim","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":33,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-05-10T16:11:17Z","id":"DPVeQeEkXBC6qWAKP6es7h","meta":{"title":"PlayStation Vita Slim Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Sony PlayStation Vita Slim has a huge range of independent games and works well with the PS4.
