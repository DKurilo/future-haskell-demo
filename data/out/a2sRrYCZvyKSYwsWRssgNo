The original review is below, but check out our current site about </em><a href=\"/best-health-insurance-providers\"><em>Health Insurance</em></a><em> here or our comprehensive review which covers all <a href=\"/best-health-insurance-providers\">BCBS</a> entities.</em>","Empire BlueCross BlueShield is a branch of Wellpoint, a large <a href=\"/best-health-insurance-providers\">health insurance</a> company that operates BlueCross Blue Shield brands across the nation. Empire&#39;s coverage area is small and specific – just 28 counties in New York state – but we wanted to get a feel for what the smaller BlueCross BlueShield branches can offer.","One thing that will be a great benefit to getting medical insurance through any BlueCross BlueShield company is access to its vast network, which includes 784,000 physicians and 5,800 hospitals nationwide. This company also makes it easy to buy dental, vision, life and other types of insurance, so you can manage all that in one place.","We only found three potential plans when we entered our first scenario – a 27-year-old non-smoker. Since this health insurance provider only offers plans in New York, we were not surprised by the much-higher prices and the shorter list of options compared to the offerings of other insurance companies. And, we did find one option that would probably work for someone in their 20s who is between jobs or who was recently taken off their parents&#39; insurance plan. For $187.70 a month on the TraditionPLUS Hospital Program, you are covered for all preventative care, surgery and emergency care. You pay for your own prescriptions, though, and for specialist and primary care visits not related to preventive care. Someone who is healthy and in their 20s would have few occasions to visit the doctor, so we thought this plan could work well for them.","The selection for family plans is equally limited but, again, we give some allowance for the fact that this provider only covers one state – a state with a unique economy. TraditionPLUS is the only option that is somewhat comparable to the other providers&#39; options. For $421 a month, you get full coverage for preventative care, hospital stays and emergencies. It does not cover much else, but that might be okay for a young and healthy family.","Empire BlueCross BlueShield has a website that makes it easy to find and purchase private health insurance, and we love the live chat option for quick questions."]},"id":"6b1a0c3b-0cc2-45e0-a39c-2be4bc31af13","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dc98d5ea-ff59-4b8f-83c0-36cdad35d999","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Empire BlueCross BlueShield covers such a small geographical area and offers a relatively small selection of plans, but if you live in New York, it is worth a look.
