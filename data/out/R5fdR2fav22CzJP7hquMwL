The camera takes snapshots of events as they happen, and it includes an LED to illuminate the scene when it&#39;s dark. If someone tries to break in and your camera catches it, the intruder may be deterred by the flash of light. For more security, you can buy extra equipment. You can also purchase extra pieces from abode to make your home more secure.
