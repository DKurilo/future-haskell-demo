You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Nokia Luna is all about being different. The slogan on the box is &#34;Dare to be different.&#34; Unfortunately, &#34;different&#34; here doesn&#39;t carry any value unless all you&#39;re concerned with is the look of your <a href=\"/best-bluetooth-headsets\">Bluetooth headset</a>. If you want discreetness, the triangular shaped earpiece is the smallest headset in our review. It&#39;s no bigger than a large, oddly shaped marble. You don&#39;t have to worry about an awkward boom microphone peeking through your hair to reach across your cheek.","However, there&#39;s nothing discreet about the bright colors. If you&#39;re more interested in style, this Nokia Bluetooth headset comes in pink, blue, white, green, red and black. With the exception of the white and black models, the colors are vibrant, almost neon in brightness. These colors match Nokia&#39;s penchant to make phones with similar flair.","If you&#39;re looking for a Bluetooth headset because you need a high-quality hands-free device for multi-tasking while at work or while you&#39;re on the road, you should look elsewhere. The audio from your caller sounds like a standard telephone audio signal – tinny muffled high-end and hollow low ends. If your caller has an accent or has a tendency to mumble, you&#39;ll likely spend much of your conversation saying, &#34;What? Huh? Say that again.&#34;","In addition, there is no discernable noise cancellation system in the headset to filter out background noises. Without a boom microphone pointed at your mouth, the microphone picks up more than your voice. Your caller will hear whatever background noises surround you, causing them to say, &#34;What? Huh? Say that again.&#34; <br/><br/>"]},"id":"c8d02a5c-dfa8-4c35-ad4c-67d67d45718f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"10840a50-c188-428f-8acd-7e3fa2815d7e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nokia Luna is a small and stylish headset that comes in several bright colors, but the audio and noise cancellation are below average for Bluetooth headsets.
