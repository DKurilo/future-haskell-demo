The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about Photo Manager Software here.</em>","The best <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo manager software</a> allows you to arrange your photo collection to your preferences, since flags, color labels and star ratings aren’t much help if you can&#39;t organize your images in a way that makes sense to you. StudioLine Photo Pro 4 provides the framework to create a database of photos the way you want. The software also imports images quickly and allows you to share photos from your collection.","This program uses keywords, geotags and custom folders to help you make sense of your photo collection. Its manual and automatic geotagging features are useful in different situations. Automatic geotagging pinpoints images and maps their location using GPS data from your camera. This is handy for collections of photos, such as birthday or wedding photos, taken in one place. With the manual tagging feature, you can add your pictures on the exact street corner you took them. While the geotagging features in StudioLine are strong, you won&#39;t find other extra features like facial recognition or password protection.","When it comes to organizing and labeling, StudioLine can change album names both in the application and on your hard drive with one click, rather than requiring you to adjust albums on your hard drive first and then in the program. Most of the features in StudioLine have a pop-out window option that allows you to view a before and after of your photo. For example, from the image viewer you can use two monitors to rotate, zoom and add star ratings, as well as toggle between views to see your image before, after and split between edits. The software also has flags and color labels to help you further categorize your images, whether by flagging those you want to remove or adding colors to similarly themed photos.","The image editor is basic but good for beginners or basic touchups. Professionals may tire of basic editing tools and crave advanced features, but those new to digital photography and editing can learn quickly with StudioLine. You can add auto tone levels, colorize, crop and rotate your photos.  Many of these editing tools are on a toolbar that pops out like the image viewer. You can arrange this toolbar to your preference, placing the most popular tools at the top. While the software has a selection of both basic and advanced organizing and editing tools, it takes practice to navigate and master. With the large number of tools and capabilities, it takes time to learn what they do and how to use them.","Using this program, you can share your pictures via email, Flickr or with some design chops, you can create an entire web gallery with StudioLine. This photo organizer doesn&#39;t directly connect to other sites like Facebook or SmugMug.","For print sharing, you can create calendars, cards and contact sheets. If you plan to share photos on a CD or DVD, you can create CD covers for photo albums or mix CDs. This program isn&#39;t a full publisher by any means, but you can customize your print creations with text, font and image adjustments. There&#39;s even a spell check."]},"id":"5e0677be-0a83-4c7d-8363-804ead157a98","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"03c2c1a4-867f-4e8e-92a5-cdd78b1342b3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["StudioLine covers all the essentials with photo editing, organizing and automatic sorting features.
