Only a handful of missing features prevent it from achieving a higher position in our countdown of the <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">best 3D Blu-ray players</a>.","One of the missing elements is the ability to upscale Full HD video to 4K. This isn&#39;t going to be an issue if you don&#39;t own a 4K TV and will be even less of an issue if you don&#39;t plan on making the leap from Full HD to ultra-high definition (UHD). However, given the fact that 4K TVs are starting to drop in price, the inability of the S5200 to play nice with UHD could be a key consideration.","What this player does exceedingly well, aside from playing 3D movies on your 3D TV, is stream video and music. When you buy it, you can access the more than 200 streaming services offered by the Sony Entertainment Network. These include Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, YouTube and Pandora Internet Radio for music. (Note that the majority of these services also require a subscription or fee to access.)","The S5200 also does well in the audio performance category, supporting both of the most widely popular codecs responsible for delivering high-quality surround sound: DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD. This is a plus for audiophiles with a penchant for super fine-quality audio, but its inability to play SACDs is disappointing. Also be aware of the modest number of ports to be found, which are represented by a single HDMI out, one USB port, a coaxial audio out, and an Ethernet port (the player comes with built-in Wi-Fi)."]},"id":"3f6c8d75-1c18-49c1-8e3c-e413fdf73740","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"77a4ee62-73e7-4069-a16f-0fd0f5e09987","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sony&#39;s BDP-S5200 Blu-ray 3D player occupies the space where value meets with the highest level of acceptable quality and functionality.
