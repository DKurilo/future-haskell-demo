Fundraising is fundamentally different from crowdfunding, so we made sure to pick sites that only ask for donations, with no products or gifts offered in return for contributions. Kickstarter and Indiegogo, two of the most popular crowdfunding sites, are focused on products. Fundraising sites are focused on individual and nonprofit causes and campaigns.","Many of the fundraising sites we compared are smaller and less well-known, but we researched them anyway, just to make sure we weren’t undergoing selection bias by choosing sites that have good name recognition.","Top Ten Reviews has been reviewing tech products and software for over a decade. We’ve published reviews about fundraising sites since 2015. Ryan Brown is an experienced writer and reviewer, and he’s tested and written reviews for many digital products and services for Top Ten Reviews.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","To compare each company, we looked at fee percentages, fundraiser management features and how easy it is to withdraw money from each site. These sites have a lot of similarities, but each company offers a different set of features.","Some sites, like Classy and Razoo, charge a monthly platform software fee to stay in business. Others, like GoFundMe and Fundly, make money by taking a percentage of donations. We compared these different ways of collecting fees separately. We also looked at organizations that use specific platforms and which platforms have the most name recognition.","<strong>Other Things to Consider with Fundraising Sites</strong>","Fees<br/>Each fundraising site we researched varies in its fees and costs. Some are free, but most extract a fee from the donations you collect. Fees generally hover between 5 percent and 8 percent. And that’s in addition to the 3 percent fee that third-party credit card processors charge.<br/><br/>Customization<br/>The main goal in hosting a fundraiser on one of these sites is to raise money for something that’s personal to you. Each site we researched lets you customize your fundraiser description, add personal photos and videos, and send out updates to your donors. Some sites, like Classy, take personalization further and let you create your own URL and send receipts and automated thank-yous to donors.<br/><br/>Analytics &amp; Reporting<br/>All the sites allow you to see how much money you’ve raised, but some give you special reports and segmentation features. If you’re managing a fundraiser for someone else or a nonprofit, these features can help gauge your effectiveness at spreading your message. Classy’s pro plan integrates with Google Analytics and Salesforce, so if you need tracking, that’s a good option.","Support<br/>Every site we researched has customer support. Our top pick, GoFundMe, guarantees that it will answer your support emails within five minutes. Some services also let you speak with a professional coach or team to help you reach your goals. ","id:1771"]},"id":"8061075f-f134-4c1f-bb86-6bf97494a851","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_82","url":"/best-fundraising-sites","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-brown","url":"/author/ryan-brown","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Ryan Brown","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"HR3J5H9LhLCfWmFnumxwPW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-12-18T20:30:06Z","datePublished":"2017-12-18T20:30:06Z","name":"Best Fundraising Sites of 2018","synopsis":"Our experts have reviewed the best fundraising sites for 2017.
