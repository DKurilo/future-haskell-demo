The Audiovox D1917 manages to take all three and place them into one small, portable, DVD package.","The Audiovox D1917 features a large 9-inch widescreen display, with 2.5 hours of playtime and weighs less than 4 ounces. It also has progressive scan, a dialog enhancer and parental controls. The memory card slot is handy for viewing pictures. The unit includes two built-in speakers, stereo sound and a remote control.","Users found the Audiovox D1917 produced a good picture and like the easily accessible USB port. One person suggested it wasn’t good for airplane travel and doesn’t play WMV. Another found that it didn’t include A/V plugs for additional accessories like video game consoles; additionally, the unit doesn’t fit in the case when the battery is connected.","The Audiovox D1917 isn’t a particularly fancy portable DVD player, but the large screen and light weight make up for many of its pitfalls."]},"id":"8019c1ee-3329-477c-a7a8-4e4c79f83203","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_20157","url":"/audiovox-d1917-17693-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-06-06T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-06-06T06:00:00Z","name":"Audiovox D1917 D1917","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
