It also has one of the largest collection reservoirs capable of holding 18 pints of water before needing to be emptied. Though it can remove a lot of moisture from the air, this unit uses the most energy of any home dehumidifier on our review – 750 watts while the most efficient unit, the <a href=\"/danby-review\">Danby DDR070BDWDB</a>, only uses 515 watts. Keep in mind, too, that it only dehumidifies small rooms of approximately 600 square feet.","The large collection bucket means less monitoring than models with smaller collection buckets, but it still comes with a full-bucket alert so you know when it&#39;s time to empty it. This is helpful since the Haier HM70EP dehumidifier doesn&#39;t have a water-level window so you can see the water level without opening the machine.","If you&#39;d prefer to bypass using the collection bucket altogether, this small room dehumidifier comes with a built-in drain pump and an included hose that pumps water from the machine to a nearby drain or sink. Also, because of its pump action, you&#39;re not relying on gravity to feed water to a sink or drain. Instead, you can easily run the drain hose from the machine and up into a sink or out a window to remove water the unit collects.","The Haier dehumidifier includes a removable air filter, so you can remove both humidity and dust from the air. The filter is reusable: You simply rinse the filter under warm water, then return it to the unit. The dehumidifier has two different fan settings: The high setting removes humidity as quickly as possible, but the machine is very loud on this setting. The slower speed takes longer to remove humidity and is somewhat quieter than the high setting, but it is still louder than all the other dehumidifiers on our review at almost 60 decibels."]},"id":"53d89903-c06f-4fe8-a0be-d82c319a54d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"709f79de-f2bd-4961-9f01-1293152f8e9a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Haier HM70EP dehumidifier can remove the damage-inducing humidity in your home quickly and efficiently since it&#39;s capable of pulling 70 pints of water from the air in a 24-hour period.
