All the dragging, pinching, and rotating features worked well on this display.","While it isn’t the most flexible monitor – the<a href=\"/planar-helium-review\"> Planar Helium</a> has a larger range of motion – we found it to be the easiest to change from position to position. Despite the large size, it only took one hand to adjust the angle. Some of the more flexible monitors we tested were unsteady during basic tasks like typing or web browsing, but the Acer T232HL felt secure and sturdy.","The Acer T232HL provides a good balance between size and weight. When you’re buying a touchscreen monitor, the size of the viewable area is important because touch functions, like the on-screen keyboard, take up a lot of room on the display, but you also want the monitor to be as light and as thin as it can be so that it’s easier to use.

This placement solved a problem that some of testers ran into with other touchscreen we reviewed – accidentally pressing the control buttons with their arm or wrist, triggering an on-screen menu and interrupting their workflow. This didn’t happen with Acer’s side-button placement, indicating that Acer thought about how people might use a touchscreen.","The overall smart touchscreen design certainly gave the Acer an edge over the competition in our comparison."]},"id":"6f953b78-d39a-4624-95d1-49600e55cbdb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"0554f60f-2a66-45aa-8204-f4208ac844aa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/zKqWwm4KL7CnU4xktF4THM.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Acer T232HL performs well in all areas except color accuracy, but ultimately this is a small blip on an otherwise practical and well-designed display. ","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/55587-acer-t232hl21.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zKqWwm4KL7CnU4xktF4THM.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"zKqWwm4KL7CnU4xktF4THM","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zKqWwm4KL7CnU4xktF4THM.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8cca7495-d574-43da-804e-498bc5476d2f","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though most touchscreen users aren’t overly concerned about the visual quality of the monitors – there are higher-quality non-touch displays available – the technical specifications can still be an important factor. We looked at the resolution, brightness, response time, gamma average and color accuracy of the Acer T232HL.","The Acer’s 1920 x 1080 resolution qualifies it as a high-definition display, a quality it shares with most of the other monitors we reviewed. While the number of pixels a display has is important, another popular measurement we used to determine the quality of the display was the distance between each pixel, or pixel pitch. Displays with a shorter distance between each dot are sharper and clearer. For its screen size, the Acer has good pixel pitch of 0.2595 millimeters.  ","The Acer has the capability of producing 300 candelas per meter squared, higher than all the other displays we reviewed. The brightness, or luminance, of a display determines the display’s visibility in ambient light. The added brightness is useful when combating the glare of the Acer’s reflective surface.","The Acer T232HL reports a quick response time of 5 milliseconds. The response time refers to the amount of time it takes for the pixels in the monitor to change from one color to another. While this only matters for quick action, such as gaming at high speeds, it makes this 1080p touchscreen monitor standout from its competitors.","The Acer T232HL’s gamma score was better than most the monitors we considered. The gamma correction score is a number that represents a display’s ability to show dimension and make sure important images aren’t lost in shadow or washed out, which is most significant when you’re watching videos or playing games. We found the depth and dimensionality of this monitor to be satisfying when we tested games and videos. ","Unfortunately, this display averaged some of worst color accuracy scores we saw in our tests. We also found the overall color accuracy had a mild impact on color consistency at different viewing angles; in other words, the further away we were from the center of the screen, the more we noticed problems with the Acer’s color. However, we only tested the default settings of the monitor, and there are a multitude of settings and color options available for you to tinker with to get the display where you want it to be. ","While this is certainly not good news if you’re looking for a super accurate display right out of the box, we didn’t feel that it impeded the overall experience of using the monitor. The other features, which make it one of the most practical touchscreens we tested, outweigh the nearly imperceptible impact of the color difference."]},"id":"12835d20-303c-48d9-8c18-b4a25eb42576","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"55f67c2d-a621-4b1e-960a-2850e901ec95","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Acer T232HL was by far the easiest to connect. The ports were easily accessible and comfortable to reach. The hook-shape of the A-frame stand made a big difference to the accessibility of the ports, especially compared to some of the solid stands that got in the way of other touchscreens’ connections.","Pretty much the only thing missing is a DisplayPort connection to future proof the display over the next few years, but the monitor has four USB 3.0 ports (one is a mini USB to enable the touch function), speakers and an audio in and out (headphone jack) port. You can also mount the Acer T232HL on the wall with standard VESA mounting."]},"id":"c2977e8a-0d4e-479e-9e34-e022b23c662a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"57662a78-616f-4b61-8be4-653ea6d676f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Acer website is easy to navigate, and we didn’t have to visit page after page searching for contact information.
