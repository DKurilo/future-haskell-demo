This all-in-one desktop has a 21.5-inch widescreen so you can watch movies comfortably and the 1920x1080 display resolution is great for its class.","With 500 GB hard drive space you can store a lot of documents and a decent amount of music and movies. If you see that you&#39;re running out of space, you can always use the USB 3.0 ports to connect an external hard drive for added storage. The home PC also comes with three USB 2.0 ports if you want to connect peripherals, such as a keyboard or mouse.","The touchscreen has 10-point touch capabilities, giving you enhanced navigational control right at your fingertips. The best part about this feature is that you can use the screen with a friend or coworker if you&#39;re playing a game or collaborating on a project.","The 720p HD webcam is good for chatting with family members across the globe or holding a videoconference remotely. The all-in-one desktop PC also has a plastic wireless keyboard and mouse. However, the keyboard is on the smaller side, so you might want to replace if it you&#39;re use to a full-size keyboard.","This PC weighs about 17 pounds, which is comparably light, making it easy to move from room to room if you have it on a multipurpose table. If you run into any issues while using the home PC you can reach tech support by sending an email or calling their phone support. And if you have an immediate issue, there is a live chat option on the website where you can seek assistance.","An added plus of this PC is that it&#39;s Energy Star qualified, so you can feel good that you&#39;re not eating power when using it."]},"id":"7b919dd4-116d-44b6-9c62-686461f5cd3c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"12cd677a-e9ee-4db2-a012-fdb2cb2aaee5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ATIV One 5 DP500A2D-K01UB is a great budget-friendly all-in-one PC because it offers a wide variety of features such as HDMI in and out ports that can be used to connect an extra monitor or your TV, which is a feature mostly found in higher-end models."]},"id":"bbd6511f-1b1e-4a85-afb0-2a5aa35b7032","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58153","url":"/ativ-one-5-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brian-westover","url":"/author/brian-westover","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Brian Westover","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"TBtnELo8v5XHxqU9uBG9c7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T02:46:03Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T02:46:03Z","name":"ATIV One 5 DP500A2D-K01UB","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
