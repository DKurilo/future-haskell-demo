However, the overall value is much higher because you're get loads of additional features. For example, the watch syncs with an app for caretakers and family, allowing you to monitor your loved one's health and activity.

However, the Samsung Galaxy smartwatches can cost as low as $60 and as high as $500, depending on the model. Since Android is an open-source operating system, you can even find some Samsung smartwatches customized specifically for seniors, with larger text and simpler interfaces. The MobileHelp Smart is a Samsung smartwatch, after all.   <br />\n  <br />\nAnd like Apple's Emergency SOS app, the Galaxy Watches also have an SOS app. However, it's not quite as functional. The app on the watch calls emergency contacts when activated. This can be an appealing alternative if you need help but aren't in an emergency. But since emergency contacts aren't guaranteed to answer, it doesn't provide the same kind of safety-net of a medical alert device. You can work around this by adding 911 as an emergency contact, but you have to do this manually.  <br />\n  <br />\nAlso, the Samsung Galaxy Watch doesn't have fall detection, yet. It has the necessary sensors though – an accelerometer and a gyroscope, used for the fitness tracking apps.

There aren&#39;t many users yet to attest to their effectiveness. With only a few services offering them, the options are limited, and nobody is totally sure how this technology is going to shape the future of the medical alert industry. Personally, I see big potential, especially as the percentage of smartphone users among seniors continues to increase. Since these smartwatches focus on health and fitness tracking as much as emergency response needs, they can help your aging loved one maintain and even improve their quality of life and independence. Other medical alert systems simply call for help. ","Discreet<br/>Many seniors resist medical alert systems for a variety of reasons, but one of the most common is the stigma associated with being seen wearing a medical alert pendant or mobile device. Since medical alert smartwatches don&#39;t look like anything other than a smartwatch, others aren’t likely to recognize one for a medical alert device.","Fall Detection<br/>Everyone is at a risk of falling, but the risk of falling for people over 65 is much greater than the rest of the population. In fact, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html\">Centers for Disease Control</a> and Prevention, one in four seniors over 65 experiences a fall each year, with hip fractures and brain injuries being the most common injuries. The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls\">World Health Organization</a> cites falling as the second leading cause of &#34;accidental or unintentional deaths&#34; worldwide. In the U.S., WHO suggests that between 20- and 30-percent of seniors who fall suffer a moderate to severe injury with women having the highest risk for falling, but with males having the higher fatality risk.","With these facts in mind, it&#39;s easy to understand the importance of having a fall detection sensor added to your medical alert system. Unfortunately, fall detection technology has not been very good since it reached the market in 2014. Over the last two years, I&#39;ve thoroughly tested over 40 fall detection sensors from 31 different medical alert services, and I have found the technology to be either too sensitive or not effective. If it&#39;s too sensitive, it causes false alerts, and this causes seniors to avoid wearing the device. But if it&#39;s not sensitive enough, it doesn&#39;t detect real falls accurately. You can read the detailed results of my testing on my review of fall detection sensors.","However, the Apple Watch 4 is a game changer. It&#39;s the first fall detection sensor I&#39;ve tested that hits the sweet spot of accurately detecting falls without causing false alerts. Much of this is due to the process rather than the technology. Like all fall detection sensors, the Apple Watch 4 relies on an accelerometer and gyroscope to measure g-forces. This allows it to detect when a body hits the ground. But rather than immediately calling 911, it only detects the fall if the person remains still after the fall. This eliminates false alerts caused by minor bumps. I even tested whether I could cause false alerts by falling and immediately getting back up. It never detected those falls.","In addition, when it does detect a fall, it gives the senior a minute to cancel the fall detection before calling 911. So even if it falsely detects a fall, you can easily cancel the call for help by simply tapping the watch face. None of the fall detection sensors I&#39;ve tested have a cancel feature. Considering how often some of them falsely detect falls, the ability to cancel an emergency call is needed.","Finally, if your loved one doesn&#39;t cancel the detected fall, the watch emits an alarm as it calls 911. This helps alert anyone within earshot to their situation.","Overall, this is how fall detection should work. It&#39;s effective and accurate. It gives users the ability to cancel false alerts and it alerts people nearby.","Heart Monitoring &amp; ECG<br/>Once of the main advantages of a smartwatch is the heart monitoring sensors, and the Apple Watch 4 takes this to new levels. Not only is the heart rate monitoring app very accurate, it can alert you when your heart rate is below or above a certain level. This can help alert your loved one to potential heart issues before they become serious. And with the addition of the ECG sensors, the potential for tracking heart health and getting help for symptoms before they become serious threats is significant. Imagine being able to predict the signs of an oncoming heart attack and getting help before it hits. This can have significant impacts on helping seniors maintain their independence longer.   ","That said, I haven&#39;t been able to test the ECG monitoring sensors yet, as the app has not been released. The technology, which measures your hearts electrical patterns and can detect a myriad of heart-related issues, was once only available in hospitals.","Health &amp; Fitness Tracking<br/>The most significant way for seniors to maintain their quality of life is to pay close attention to their health and fitness levels. Maintaining fitness has a lot of health benefits for everyone, but for seniors, it can dramatically reduce the risk of falling, alleviate symptoms of geriatric depression and reduce social isolation. The MobileHelp Smart, Apple Watch 4 and Samsung Galaxy watch all have comprehensive health and fitness tracking apps. These apps are impressive and comprehensive and include alerts to keep you moving and active. The Apple Watch 4 even includes de-stressing reminders with breathing exercises and reminders to meditate.","<strong>CES 2019: Nonwearable Option Announced</strong>","In January 2018, MobileHelp and Medical Guardian delivered the two biggest announcements for the medical alert industry during CES in Las Vegas, and we&#39;re now reviewing those wearable smartwatch medical alert systems. ","This year, there weren&#39;t any major announcements from the big players in the medical alert system industry, but there was an interesting announcement from a lesser-known company, Xandar Kardian. The new product, the <a href=\"http://kardian.com/\">Xandar-Kardian NZEL100</a>, is a contact-free, nonwearable personal emergency response system capable of detecting falls and monitoring your heart rate, breathing rate and sleep patterns.","The Xandar-Kardian integrates with Amazon Alexa for voice control and smart home integration via Wi-Fi. It also uses 4G cellular and GPS. The Xandar-Kardian has two parts: a smart LED lamp that you place on a nightstand, and a ceiling monitor similar to a smoke detector. The ceiling monitor uses radar to monitor movement, activity and falls. It works very similarly to the <a href=\"https://walabot.com/walabot-home\">Walabot Home</a>, another recently launched nonwearable medical alert system. Both systems use radar to detect falls, and both integrate with smart home devices to call emergency contacts or 911 for help.","By using noninvasive radar, the device tracks your senior loved one’s basic health and activity and sends the details to an app on your phone. As such, this product is ideal for caretakers of an aging loved one with dementia or health issues that restrict their activity to the home. It can be especially valuable after the senior has experienced a significant health issue, such as a fall, as it allows you to monitor their progress without intruding on their privacy. ","Rather than contacting an emergency response center, the NZEL100 calls emergency contacts, family members or 911 (depending on your preferences) when there is an emergency. It&#39;s not on the market yet, but it&#39;s expected to be around $35 per month after a $99 setup fee, putting the price on a par with those of most mobile medical alert systems."]},"id":"19dd8623-bbce-4254-9d63-43134e3d39b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_369","url":"/best-medical-alert-smartwatches","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-24T08:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-24T08:00:00Z","name":"Best Medical Alert Smartwatches of 2019","synopsis":"Medical alert smartwatches are the latest tech to hit the senior care market.
