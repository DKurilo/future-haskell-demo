It has energy efficient LED sidelights and a modern, slim design that can fit in well in most contemporary homes.","This mirror has a stylish, white painted steel base. It can be mounted in either a portrait or landscape position, depending on the design of your bathroom. A sensor switch is included and can be optionally installed to switch the light on or off automatically. A manual on and off switch is also included for regular operation. It also includes a 110-volt demister pad, making it ideal for bathroom use. The demister should keep the mirror clear after a quick shower or while running the hot water in the sink. If you&#39;d prefer a mirror that is easy to travel with, you might be interested in <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">Tweezermate</a>.","Lighted Image&#39;s 6000K LED lights provide enough of a light source for a small bathroom. LEDs use up to 80 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs and can last for years without needing replacement. The overall dimensions of this lighted bathroom mirror are 36 x 28 x 2 inches.","The light quality from LED lights often matches that of sunlight, for optimal application of skincare and cosmetic products. However, note that these side lights are directed outward, so additional lighting may be required for accuracy. The cords are located in the center back of the mirror and may require professional installation by a qualified, licensed contractor. There are complete installation instructions, including a DIY video, on the manufacturer&#39;s website. Note that the demister and the lights are connected separately.","This lighted wall mirror can be powered on the same circuit as other bathroom lights if wired correctly. The sensor switch or on and off switch solely power the lights attached to the mirror itself. A complete set of mounting hardware is included with each purchase.","The Lighted Image LED Vertical Sides Illuminated Mirror is a modern and sleek vanity mirror appropriate for installation above a bathroom sink. An included demister keeps the glass from steaming up. Its LED lighting outlasts incandescent bulbs and uses less electricity than fluorescents. The side lighting mimics natural light but may not be bright enough for applying makeup or skincare products."]},"id":"4c503eae-64e5-486b-b848-dae902a8a540","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66164","url":"/lighted-image-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-10T21:46:49Z","datePublished":"2015-07-10T21:46:49Z","name":"Lighted Image LED Vertical Sides","synopsis":"If you are planning to replace the mirror above your bathroom vanity or are remodeling your bathroom, this lighted mirror may be a nice option to consider.
