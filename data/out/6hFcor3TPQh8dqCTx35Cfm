Some programs analyze the amount of energy your business consumes each month while others manage all of the utilities in your building and identify any errors or problem areas that may be costing you money. If you are a landlord, some software breaks down energy consumption for each rental space you own and bills your tenants based on the amount of electricity, water or even natural gas they use. Some types of energy management software, or EMS, include <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-access-control-systems/\">BuildingIQ</a>, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-access-control-systems/\">SIMATIC B. Data</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-access-control-systems/\">Panoramic Power PowerRadar</a>.","Energy management has been used extensively by governments and large companies for years. The category is growing, and, today, commercial businesses and even landlords use EMS to monitor their energy consumption and find ways to conserve energy. Using EMS gives you the ability to track the amount of energy you are using so you can make changes to save you money. EMS also provides you access to information that may be pertinent to government agencies or your customers. The data can also help you reduce the amount of risk to your service, business and the environment.","<strong>Energy Management Software: What to Look For</strong>","Using EMS can offer many benefits, but only if you choose the right one for your particular business. To do this, you have to determine what features are important to you and can help make a difference in your company&#39;s operations. Some vital elements to consider include the following.","<strong>Data Access</strong><br/>While obtaining access to data regarding your energy consumption is important to you, it may also be important to your clients and others that work with you. Most systems let you share the data you have gathered in some form with your customers or stakeholders. Some let you exchange data via cloud-based software while others share data via an online dashboard that can be accessed from any computer with internet access. A few EMS programs offer you the option of data sharing through a smartphone or tablet.","<strong>Environmental and Legal Obligations</strong><br/>Certain information, like greenhouse gas emissions, permits and carbon emissions, are important details that are necessary for meeting the environmental and legal obligations of both your clients and the government. EMS provides you with a solution to gather and store this critical information so it can be given to those who need it quickly.","<strong>Benchmarking</strong><br/>A good way to determine if you are using too much, just enough or very little energy is through benchmarking. This capability lets you compare your energy consumption to the standard amount used by companies just like yours. Some software even makes it possible for you to evaluate and compare your energy use to baselines developed by the amount of energy you have used in the past.","<strong>Support</strong><br/>From troubleshooting to technical support, many EMS companies offer customer support through a variety of modes. Some provide trained consultants while others offer online support. Most offer user training, so you understand the ins and outs of the software you are purchasing.","Energy management systems can help you track, analyze and understand your energy use. Finding the right software with the features that work for you is essential to monitoring your energy usage and taking steps to conserve energy, which has global consequences."]},"id":"f961ba75-b0ab-49a4-93a1-fd0c54fcb3ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"36314374-853e-4866-9b50-9971f43bc956","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.buildingiq.com/solutions/guaranteed-energy-savings/\">BuildingIQ</a>","<a href=\"http://www.eft-energy.com/\">EFT’s Energy</a>","<a href=\"http://www.enernoc.com/solutions/enterprise-solutions/pricing-and-packages\">EnerNOC</a>","<a href=\"http://www.esightenergy.com/us/software\">eSight Energy</a>","<a href=\"https://www.gridpoint.com/enterprise-software/\">GridPoint</a>","<a href=\"https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/signup.do?source=raq&amp;S_TACT=109HJ02W&amp;lang=en_US\">IBM</a>","<a href=\"http://www.panpwr.com/technology/web-based-monitoring-software.html\">Panoramic Power</a>","<a href=\"http://www.powerlogic.com/product.cfm/c_id/2/sc_id/15/p_id/28#\">PowerLogic</a>","<a href=\"http://go.sap.com/solution/lob/sustainability.html\">SAP</a>","<a href=\"http://w3.siemens.com/mcms/automation-software/de/energie-management-sw/simatic-b-data/Seiten/default.aspx\">SIMATIC B.
