Typically when you think of Honda, however, you think of cars or motorcycles. The HRX217HYA Gas Mower is just another testament to how powerful and reliant the Honda brand is.","The feature list for this self-propelled mower is quite lengthy, so we’ll just touch on our favorites. Bringing in an automobile element, this lawn mower has a cruise control system that lets you set your speed  and easily adjust it as conditions change. You can modify the speed at any time using a shift level up to 4 mph. You can even save your preferred speed. To make your mowing experience even more comfortable, you can adjust the handle into three different positions.","Acting as a safety feature, the Blade Stop System is also a convenience feature. The Blade Stop control button is located on the mower’s handle. As you step away from the mower to empty grass clippings, pass over cement or move the sprinkler, press the button and the Blade Stop System stops the blades but doesn’t cut the engine. You will only need to pull the recoil starter once, which is excellent.","Unlike other mowers, the Honda self-propelled mower goes beyond the 3-in-1 and ads its own twist. You can still choose to discharge, mulch or bag your grass clippings, but it can also shred your leaves. Adding cut up leaves to your grass clippings will provide a rich mulch mixture."]},"id":"21909bcb-7d32-4ba0-b1c8-886582c0498c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/BfHMEu3aETZ9spFQcwhzA7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56372-honda-cruise-control-gas-mower3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BfHMEu3aETZ9spFQcwhzA7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"BfHMEu3aETZ9spFQcwhzA7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BfHMEu3aETZ9spFQcwhzA7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4085924b-ab88-4aee-a1f3-db5e1533fa62","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The mower continues to impress with a five-year residential warranty and a lifetime warranty on the 21-inch cutting deck.
