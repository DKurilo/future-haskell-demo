With this digital video recorder you can save hundreds of hours of TV in one user-friendly location.","It goes without saying that DirecTV knows their stuff. They’ve been in the business long enough to know what their consumer wants. With the DirecTV Plus HD, you have 500GB of storage space available to record up to 100 hours of live HD television. You can even watch and manipulate (rewind, pause, fast forward) live television for up to 90 minutes. When recording, you have the option of simultaneously recording two channels at once. And with parental controls, you have complete control over what your kids can and can’t watch or record.","Because DirecTV requires you to sign up for their own service to use with the DirecTV Plus HD DVR, you can’t access over-the-air stations or other digital cable channels. But let’s be realistic, why would you want to access other content when you have DirecTV’s thousands upon thousands of channels? There aren’t enough hours in a lifetime to watch that much TV.","The unit works with both HD and SD TVs, which makes it easy to connect to televisions in multiple rooms in your home. With DirecTV’s on-demand services, you can access tons of movies and television channels as well as online services like Pandora or YouTube.","DirecTV’s website is more centered around selling you a DVR than helping you figure out your current model. They do have an online forum with FAQs and a “tips and tricks” section with helpful information. However, there isn’t a direct number for technical support; you have to go through the hoops of contacting customer service first. On a high note, you can contact support 24/7. A warranty isn’t included with the unit, but you can pay a minimal fee each month to protect yourself against a hardware blowup."]},"id":"86744848-0691-45e5-abef-cdc75fb2b36b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c10041e1-58f9-41c8-b19b-c36d119505fe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The biggest problem we have with the DirecTV Plus HD DVR is that there seems to be hidden costs for everything.
