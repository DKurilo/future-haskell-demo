Microsoft Word has all of the basics that you would expect from word processing software, with a few extras mixed in, including the ability to add a custom watermark to your documents.","While older versions are software that you pay for once, newer versions are available either as a one-time purchase or as a subscription-based model. In the subscription system, you get not only the latest edition of Word, but also several other programs made by Microsoft as digital downloads. Subscription costs vary depending on how many computers you would like the software to run on and whether you choose student, home or professional versions of the software.","This word processing software breaks away from the traditional drop-down menu navigation. Microsoft Word implements the use of tabs in what they call a &#34;ribbon&#34; instead. Each time you click on a tab, a menu opens that doesn&#39;t close until you click on another tab. This can be a useful tool to use during different stages of document creation. For example, while you are editing a document you can have the Review tab open so all of the editing tools are available with one click. This type of layout also makes it easy to find the tool you are looking for. Each tab displays tools using large fonts and icons. The whole program is very intuitive, which makes it easy for new users to learn.","Word has several standout tools, such as the highlighting feature, which works just like using a highlighting marker. You can even highlight text in different colors. This feature is helpful for keeping track of certain passages in the document you may want to refer to later. You can also add notes, such as “see table on page 7” that will change automatically if the item they refer to is moved. This can save a lot of time and can help avoid errors in the document.","There are tools to make formatting easy, too. You can use the Format Painter to copy a format in your document and paste elsewhere. The new format is set up automatically. If you don&#39;t want to mess with any type of formatting, but still want a clean, professional looking document, then Word&#39;s templates may be the answer. Word has dozens of pre-made documents, such as chore lists, brochures, business cards and contracts, you can add your text to.","The Microsoft Word line of software has one of the best selections of editing tools around. No matter what your writing level, chances are, with this word processing software, you can produce a neat and tidy document free of most errors. In the Review section you can check your spelling, grammar, word count, character count and look up words.","You can also choose whether you want your document have citations in certain style guidelines such as APA, MLA, Chicago and more. There’s a bibliography button, as well, that helps you insert properly formatted bibliographies depending on the style you choose.","Collaboration tools include a comment option that allows you to add notes to the document that another user can clearly see when they look over the document. Word also has a tracking system that displays the changes made to a document in red, so it is easy to see how the document has evolved. If you really hate the changes, there is a Reject button that quickly changes the document back to the original wording.","There’s even a translate button that can change a document into more than 25 different languages, including Greek, French and Japanese. You can also insert charts, pictures, clip art, tables, photo captions, callouts, word art, drop cap letters, signature lines and shapes.","Microsoft Word&#39;s massive number of features and easy learning curve makes this software a good choice for the casual user and the die-hard writer alike. It sets the standard for word processing software and is one of the most commonly used programs in offices and homes. As such, it does everything you’d expect from a useful word processing application, and then some."]},"id":"74080a75-0eae-40aa-9c04-775d3501c723","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49278","url":"/microsoft-word-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-16T19:42:23Z","datePublished":"2010-04-16T19:42:23Z","name":"Microsoft Word","synopsis":"Microsoft’s line of word processing software sets the standard.","review":{"rating":88,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Microsoft’s line of word processing software sets the standard.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-04-16T19:42:23Z","id":"eBMnRiqazyvwF7VbQwo7vW","meta":{"title":"Microsoft Word Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"This word processing software is ideal for most users&#8217; needs thanks to its clean layout and careful creation.
