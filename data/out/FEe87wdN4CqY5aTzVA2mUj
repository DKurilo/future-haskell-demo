Macs are still relatively safe from viruses, so the emphasis of this Mac security software  is to protect against phishing swindles and social networking website attacks. It is a tool that maintains control of your identity and personal information. Although McAfee doesn&#39;t offer the best internet security for Mac, it recognizes phishing sites and rates them with a risk factor color code. When someone tries to send you infected files, it intercepts and cleans them.","This internet security for Mac also blocks threats in Apple Mail and iChat. And when threats arrive via an external drive, McAfee attempts to block them. It also protects the people that you communicate with because it won’t let you send infected files or email. McAfee repairs and disinfects files, and understands how to neutralize viruses, Trojans, worms, bots and rootkits. It is rather unfortunate that in tests conducted at AV-Test, McAfee could not equal the performance of the best internet security software for Mac. At AV-Test, McAfee detected just 26.5 percent of the Mac malware samples it was exposed to. Some applications in the test intercepted 100 percent of the malware.","Similar to many of the Mac security products, McAfee Internet Security for Mac incorporates a proprietary firewall that is not difficult to use. You can use it to shut down all traffic in both directions if necessary. The firewall also lets you define trusted networks, establish rules about where traffic can go, or block categories of traffic from entering.","Technical support is free. The support webpage directs you to technical support, customer service or virus removal services. A virtual technician diagnoses many common problems and collects data to assist the person who helps via live chat. There is telephone support if the McAfee Virtual Technician cannot resolve an issue."]},"id":"b0dd8ec5-9e1d-4954-b878-f50bc996e84b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e28243d7-ebe5-4c22-b0e3-b2a48111dc51","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When it comes to your personal information, hackers can either breach your firewall or trick you into disclosures.
