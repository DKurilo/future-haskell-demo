The company is like Coca-Cola when it comes to electronics – the name is everywhere. However, unlike its big-market products such as TVs and gaming consoles, the Sony XS <a href=\"/best-marine-speakers\">marine speaker</a> series feels like an afterthought. While the audio quality is an upgrade over a factory-installed boat speaker, its power handling and durability are only average compared to the best marine speakers. It doesn&#39;t stand out either in good or bad ways. It&#39;s simply a reliable speaker with a reliable name.","We tested the audio signal accuracy by recording the Sony XS-MP1621 as it reproduced a 20Hz to 20kHz sine wave file. We used a frequency analyzer program to grade the low-, mid- and high-range frequencies. Overall, the audio quality was good, but not great. The low-range frequencies scored a 91-percent and the high-range frequencies scored an 85-percent. Both are reflective of above-average audio quality. However, the midrange frequencies scored an 85-percent, which is slightly below average. The midrange is where you hear all the detail in your music, so it&#39;s arguably the most important frequency range to consider.","The best aspect of the XS-MP1621 is the 91 dB sensitivity, which is just above the 90 dB average. However, this difference is significant, because every 3 dB increase in volume requires twice as much power. This means that the speaker is 33.3 percent more efficient than most 6.5-inch marine speakers are. It needs this added efficiency, because the continuous power handling is slightly below average at 70 RMS watts. For comparison, it&#39;s about half as loud at its maximum RMS wattage as the best marine speaker at its maximum RMS wattage.","All the components – woofer, tweeter, basket and grille – are made of polypropylene, which doesn&#39;t warp or degrade when splashed with water. It&#39;s also ASTM certified for salt, fog and UV protection. The only significant durability issue is the lack of a sealed crossover network, which protects the wiring for the coaxial unit that separates the signals between the tweeter and the woofer. It also lacks gold-plated terminals, though the stainless steel terminals are still noncorrosive."]},"id":"1b219540-2b7c-4f22-9eb7-0a6c31f6fdb3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"14a10958-9eb9-40ce-8f5d-2b9662df9639","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony XS-MP1621 is an average marine speaker from a big, reliable brand.
