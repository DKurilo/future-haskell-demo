","It was also accurate in our tests. The alarm sounded when we disturbed the water with a wet sweatshirt and when a person got into the water.

It passed the wind detection test with flying colors though, so you don’t have to worry about it going off on a particularly windy day.   <br />\n   <br />\nThe Brickhouse installs on the side of the pool, so it won’t work if yours is free-standing in your backyard. Your pool needs to be in-ground or deck-adjacent, and if it’s larger than 16 x 32 feet, you need to invest in a second alarm. The slider on the side of the alarm makes it easy to disable or turn off when it sounds. Also, the different alarm functions are clearly labeled, something we really appreciated as some units are confusing to use. According to our tests, the Brickhouse puts out 100.5 decibels of sound, so you’re going to hear it. You can install the remote receiver up to 300 feet away from the alarm as well – the longest range of any alarm we tested.   <br />\n   <br />\nLike most of the alarms we tested, the Brickhouse requires batteries.

Turning the alarm off once it sounds is a little more complicated than simply pressing a button: You have to touch the side of the buoy with the included magnetic key and hold it there for two or three seconds before the alarm will stop beeping.

When submerged, the bracelet sends a signal to a remote receiver you can install up to 200 feet away from the pool, and the alarm sounds instantaneously. The bracelet requires a plastic key to take it off, so there’s no way a pet or kid can remove it and slip into the water unnoticed. It doesn’t keep intruders out of your pool, but the Safety Turtle is great if you’re worried about pool safety. <br />\n <br />\nIt earned an A+ in our object detection test because it went off every single time we submerged the device and didn’t when we flicked a few drops of water at it. If your kiddo likes to wash their hands up to their elbows, you might experience the occasional false alarm though. The receiver puts out 98.7 decibels of sound, and while that makes it the second-quietest pool alarm we tested, it’s still incredibly loud. For comparison, that’s about 10 decibels short of a rock band. <br />\n <br />\nThe batteries on the bracelet last from three to five years, depending on how much you use them. They are sealed inside the bracelet, and you can’t replace them – instead, you have to purchase a new turtle bracelet when they die. However, the receiver plugs into an outlet and should outlast the bracelet. The alarm on/off button on the receiver is also easy to use so you won’t be deafened by the sound of the alarm. The Safety Turtle is elegant in its simplicity and a great way to make sure your kids and pets are safe around the pool this summer.","<a href=\"/safety-turtle-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"d4c2f0bf-0a93-47d0-9588-aff8869d3001","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Design"},"id":"4ff9c8de-8005-4830-a2a8-301ee74c7ee9","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/pHstZ3zCh3hSXiE8krRCib.jpeg","link":{"href":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/pool-patrol-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/P/E/790178/original/Pool-Alarms-Pool-Patrol-PA-30-003.jpeg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pHstZ3zCh3hSXiE8krRCib.jpeg","credit":"","align":"","id":"pHstZ3zCh3hSXiE8krRCib","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pHstZ3zCh3hSXiE8krRCib.jpeg","alt":"Pool Patrol PA-30"},"id":"e5e4b9fc-d0ac-4346-8d42-137b66b6b2dd","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Pool Patrol PA-30\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":80,"url":"/pool-patrol-review","name":"Pool Patrol PA-30","id":"1013"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/pool-patrol-review\">Pool Patrol PA-30</a>","pros":["Earned an A+ in our wind and object detection tests"],"cons":["Expensive"]},"id":"ec9c659c-cb7e-4deb-a715-37e6f7cc708c","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pool Patrol PA-30 is very well designed, making it easy to change the alarm sensitivity.EKIEQBP","While some in-ground alarms require you install an extra plastic plate if you hear too many false alarms, the Pool Patrol PA-30 has a base you simply rotate to the left or to the right.

If you’re concerned about a young member of your family falling in the pool or keeping intruders out of your backyard, an alarm is worth the investment.","<strong>What to Look for When Buying a Pool Alarm</strong>","Installation<br/>Most pool alarms work in one of two ways. Some float on the surface of your pool and sense when water is displaced – the sensors measure the disturbance and react to it, making the alarm go off. This type of alarm works in both above- and in-ground pools.","Other pool alarms mount to the deck of the swimming pool and use sub-surface detection to pick up on changes in water pressure, which cause the alarm to sound. These kinds of alarms work best for in-ground pools, though they also work if your above ground pool has a deck built around at least part of it. If you get this kind of alarm, make sure to read the instructions about where is best to install it based on the shape and depth of your pool.","There are also pool alarms that go off when they get wet, and they work best when attached to pets or children. That way if Junior jumps in the pool, you&#39;ll know.","Batteries<br/>The majority of the pool alarms we tested are battery-powered. Most are supposed to last for an entire year, but the more your pool alarm goes off, the more its battery life will suffer. Check your device every month or so to make sure the batteries haven’t died. You should also remove your pool alarm and take the batteries out during colder months while your pool sits unused. The alarms we tested all take 9V or D batteries.<br/><strong><br/>Choose a Pool Alarm That Meets Your Needs</strong>","When selecting a pool alarm it’s important to think about what you’re trying to accomplish. If you’re trying to keep intruders out of your backyard oasis, you should select a highly sensitive alarm that is discrete and loud. If an intruder can tell exactly where your pool alarm is, there’s a chance they’ll be able to disarm it.","On the other hand, if you have several small children spending time around your open backyard pool, you might want something a little different. If you know your pool alarm is probably going to go off several times a week because Junior jumped in the pool without adult supervision, you’ll want an alarm that is easy to turn on and off but still very loud. Look for alarms with buttons built in rather than those you have to use an external key to deactivate. If you have pets who are very young or even very elderly, you might want to consider a water-activated alarm. This way if your dog gets in the water – accidentally on purpose – you’ll know.","Some U.S. states require certain kinds of pool alarms, but regardless of where you live, having an alarm can protect you from lawsuits. Even if you’re in a safe neighborhood and don’t have any young children yourself, there’s always the possibility of someone else’s children getting in to your pool without you knowing. An alarm can stop that from happening and stop any accidents before they start. This in turn protects you from the possibility of being sued if injuries happen on your property."]},"id":"32ac32d4-7502-4f75-9c45-b6d4e353b8ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"da0b6244-ccb4-4671-ada6-18f708e30a4c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/brickhouse-review\">Brickhouse Pool Alarm</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5b7d3451-6961-4883-8d9b-50ab3d79b94a","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_281","url":"/best-pool-alarms","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-12T00:15:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-12T00:15:00Z","name":"Best Pool Alarms of 2019","synopsis":"Here are a variety of options for keeping your swimming pool safe, including: floating buoy alarms, sidewall alarms and pool gate alarms.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are a variety of options for keeping your swimming pool safe, including: floating buoy alarms, sidewall alarms and pool gate alarms.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-14T22:39:52Z","id":"5sbggKWndtDxa6YBFFCvfJ","meta":{"title":"Best Pool Alarms of 2019 -
