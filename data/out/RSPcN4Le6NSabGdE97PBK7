The notable exception is if you’re looking for a simple talk and text plan without data. Most prepaid carriers we evaluated offered limited data plans and either unlimited-data or data-less plans, but not both. Since we focused on unlimited plans, this is one of the few basic plans we evaluated. Even though Cricket only has five plans, it covers a wide range of usage needs, making it a great carrier if you want to combine multiple types of plans on the same account. Even among companies that offer a variety of plans, you can’t always mix and match on the same account.     <br />\n      <br />\nOn average, Cricket doesn’t offer many features beyond standard talk, text and data. Even with the autopay and additional line discounts offered on some plans, its prices are comparable to, or higher than, other similar carriers. Hotspot tethering, something often included in the price of top-tier unlimited plans, is extra with Cricket. Cricket also puts speed caps on all data usage. The top-end cap is eight Mbps, which applies to most of its plans. There’s one unlimited data plan that maxes out at three Mbps, too. Compared to its parent company’s top data speeds, which can reach upwards of 25 Mbps download speed, according to tests performed by Tom’s Guide, those three or even eight Mbps is very slow.

We put 30 hours of research into our evaluations and considered more than 60 prepaid wireless providers in the U.S. We took all the information about network performance from reliable, impartial sources such as RootMetrics, OpenSignal, Ookla, Consumer Reports, J.D. Power and Tom’s Guide, our sister site. All other information came from the services’ websites and customer service representatives.","On top of our own knowledge base and extensive research, we spoke with a few industry experts, including Michael Melmed, CFO of US Mobile and Ximena Cuevas, senior director of marketing for MetroPCS.","<strong>How we tested</strong>","We researched over 60 companies before narrowing our list down to the providers with the best plans, prices and network service. We focused on providers offering both limited and unlimited data plans, national networks and services with a wide selection of compatible devices. Unfortunately, this last qualifier knocked Google’s <a href=\"http://fi.google.com/about/\">Project Fi</a> out of the running, though it is a strong competitor if you have or want to buy one of the very few Google, Motorola or LG phones compatible with the service.","To evaluate the narrowed-down list of providers, we first graded the coverage, reliability and speed of the operating network. Though there are dozens of companies selling cellular service, there are only four nationwide networks in the U.S. These belong to AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. The Big Four allow other companies, known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to piggyback off their mobile infrastructure. Though the Verizon network had distinct advantages over all other carriers in the past, recent expansion efforts made all four networks reliable on a national scale. Each network has stronger and weaker areas, however, so you should check coverage maps and ask around to see what networks perform best in your area. We gathered our information for these network evaluations from sources including <a href=\"http://rootmetrics.com/en-US/rootscore/map\">RootMetrics</a>, <a href=\"http://opensignal.com/reports/2018/01/usa/state-of-the-mobile-network\">OpenSignal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/reports/united-states/\">Ookla</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jdpower.com/ratings/industry/telecom\">JD Powers</a>.","Next, we directly compared each service’s most expensive unlimited data plan with hotspot tethering and the cheapest basic plan that had at least 1,000 texts, 1,000 minutes and one GB of data. Of course, most carriers offer many other types of plans, but for our test we stuck with two. We weighed prices for different individual and family plans, the value of each and optional extras like additional data or international calling.","In the end, the best prepaid provider is the one that offers your custom preferences and has the best service where you live. But our recommendations can guide you in the right direction, no matter which network performs well in your area, how much data you need or what your budget is.","<strong>How to shop for a prepaid cell phone plan</strong>","<strong>Choosing a network</strong>","There are four national cellular networks in the U.S.: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile. Generally, the strongest is Verizon, though other carriers’ continued expansion efforts are closing the gap. The Big Four mainly offer postpaid service, though they also offer a few prepaid plans. The dozens of other companies, MVNOs, partner with one or more of the networks to provide discounted service.","Though the four national mobile networks all have their strengths, each carrier performs differently in rural and urban areas. Because availability of service is the most important factor when choosing a provider, make sure to check coverage maps to see if the places you live, work and travel to are adequately covered. Beyond the carrier’s own coverage maps, look at independent sites like RootMetrics and OpenSignal to see how the network performs.","<strong>How much do prepaid phone plans cost?</strong>","In general, prepaid plans cost less than traditional plans from Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&amp;T. Postpaid plans from the Big Four cost $65 to $90 for one-line on a top-tier unlimited plan, but a prepaid unlimited plan through an MVNO can cost as little as $55 a month. Prepaid carriers present more of a value across the board, however, with their limited-data plans, which can cost as little as $25 per month. Price depends on the features and services on your chosen plan, and a good way to judge value is to compare prices across plans operating on the same network in your area. For example, if you are currently on Verizon’s $60, 5 GB plan, you could save more than $8 per month by switching to a similar plan with US Mobile, which also uses Verizon’s network.<br/><strong><br/>The difference between prepay &amp; post-pay</strong>","We spoke with Michael Melmed, CFO of US Mobile, about the differences between prepaid and postpaid plans. One major advantage of prepaid is that “prepaid plans give you 100 percent control over your bill. You decide upfront how much talk, text and data you want, or can afford. Then you pay for just that. There is no risk of overage or unexpected charges at the month’s end.”","Of course, in addition to the upfront nature of prepaid billing, there’s also the distinct possibility of paying less than you would for a postpaid plan. Most of the unlimited data plans we evaluated cost less than an equivalent postpaid plan on the same network.","On top of the generally lower prices, you can save even more by being a conscientious user. With the Big Four pushing their unlimited everything plans, it’s easy to pay for more than you need. “We tend to see that customers who use a lot of either talk, text or data don’t use much of the other two units,” Melmed explained. Prepaid carriers often have more plan options than the Big Four, so you can find the best plan to fit your use.","The main disadvantage between a Big Four postpaid plan and any MVNO prepaid plan is quality of service. Since the Big Four own their own networks, they can choose to prioritize their direct customers’ data over anyone else’s. This usually isn’t a problem, but if you use a lot of data each month, it’s worth checking out each carrier’s high-speed data threshold for unlimited plans. Usually, Big Four carriers allot their postpaid unlimited users more data per cycle, but you can still get over 30 GBs out of carriers like MetroPCS.<br/><strong><br/>Bringing your own device</strong>","When switching phone plans, you can save a lot of money by sticking with the device you already own instead of buying a new one, especially since smartphones can cost upward of $1,000. If you want to bring your own device to a new plan, however, there are a couple things to check. First, your phone needs to be unlocked. Most carriers put a software lock on phones they sell so devices only work on their own network for a certain amount of time, which differs from carrier to carrier. If you purchased your phone factory unlocked from a manufacturer like Verizon, have your phone fully paid off or have had your phone for more than a few months, it should already be unlocked. You may need to request an unlock code if you bought your phone through AT&amp;T, and several prepaid carriers impose year-long lock periods on their phones, especially if purchased at a promotional price.","In addition to the lock status, check if your phone is compatible with the new network you’re switching to. Wireless companies in the U.S. use two cellular technologies: CDMA and GSM. Verizon and Sprint use CDMA, which is a less universal standard than GSM, used by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and the rest of the world. Some manufacturers make phones that are only compatible with one technology or the other, so you can’t bring certain AT&amp;T phones to Verizon or Sprint, or vice versa. Each of the Big Four carriers has an easy way to check online if your phone is compatible with its network, which you can also use if you know the network of an MVNO you want to subscribe to.","<strong>Quality of service</strong>","The main advantage a traditional, postpaid plan has over a prepaid or MVNO plan is quality of service. In the fine print of almost every prepaid plan we evaluated, there is a clause stating that the prepaid customer’s high-speed data may be deprioritized in times of network congestion. For unlimited plans, this may happen after using a certain amount of data for the month, or it may happen at any time during your billing cycle, as is the case for Verizon’s prepaid plans.","Depending on where you live and how many other people in your area use the same network, deprioritized data and network congestion may not affect you. But if you’re on a prepaid plan and often notice sluggish service, it’s worthwhile to see if switching to a traditional plan provides better quality of service. It may not, as heavy network congestion affects everyone on the network. In that case, a different provider that has good coverage and fewer users in your area is a good solution.","Network congestion happens when there are too many users trying to send and receive information at the same time. You may have experienced this at large events like concerts or festivals. The cellular network can only handle so much data traffic, and when there’s more than the network can handle all at once, each piece of data has to wait its turn in a queue. The more data, the longer the queue, and the slower the network works. In times of light congestion, having priority data gives you a leg up over deprioritized users, but heavy congestion can affect both prioritized and deprioritized data enough that there’s hardly a difference.","<strong>Using a prepaid phone for emergencies</strong>","Besides being cheaper than their postpaid counterparts, prepaid phone plans are excellent options for emergency phones for children or seniors. Most of the plans we evaluated offer monthly service, which isn’t ideal if you don’t plan to use your phone often. In these instances, a customizable plan, such as those available from US Mobile; a pay-as-you-go plan; or a prepaid card with a lengthy service period could work better.","Many prepaid MVNOs offer very inexpensive talk-and-text-only plans. US Mobile gives you 40 minutes and 40 texts for just $4 per month, not including taxes. The prepaid carrier also makes it easy to add minutes, texts or data month to month if necessary. Many MVNOs that we did not include in our side-by-side comparison offer similarly bare-bones monthly plans that are perfect for emergencies.","Pay-as-you-go plans charge a low monthly base fee and add a nominal charge every time you use the service beyond the base allotment. For example, T-Mobile’s pay-as-you-go option charges $3 per month, which gives you 30 minutes, 30 texts or any combination of the two. Beyond those 30 minutes or messages, you pay 10 cents each.","Finally, we recommend prepaid service cards with minutes and texts that don’t expire for a long time. TracFone has a $100 card that&#39;s preloaded with 400 minutes and lasts a year from the date of activation. However, this one costs a little more, at just over $8 per month, and it’s easy to forget to recharge your minutes every year. ","<strong>Take advantage of promotions</strong>","Cell phone carriers and MVNOs constantly cycle through promotions, offering promotional service rates, discounted devices and free add-ons. The trick to getting the best deals is to watch out for sales and discounts and to be willing to switch services, as many promotional offers are available only to customers switching from a competing service. Over the course of our evaluations, we found that Metro by T-Mobile, in particular, often runs promotional rates for family plans, so if you’re thinking about switching to a Metro unlimited data plan, look for discounts. Virgin Mobile has member benefits, which provide deals and discounts at various partner companies.","It’s common for major prepaid retailers to offer a free phone if you’re willing to switch services. The devices offered aren’t top-of-the-line flagship smartphones, but they function for your calling, texting and browsing needs. If you want something a little higher-end, prepaid retailers also sell a variety of discounted previous-generation devices and pre-owned tech. ","<strong>Current Promotions</strong>"]},"id":"67e68e1f-a5f3-40e9-b5ba-6cb703158696","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Metro by T-Mobile: </strong>Metro by T-Mobile has an in-store deal offering four lines of unlimited data for $100 a month. This is less than the usual price of $140 a month. This plan includes unlimited talk, text and high-speed data up to the cap of 35 GB per line, as well as 5 GB of mobile hotspot data. The prepaid carrier’s higher-tier unlimited plan, which includes more hotspot data, also has promotional pricing at $120 a month for four or five lines. If you switch to Metro with four lines, you are also eligible to get four free mid-tier Samsung and LG phones.","<strong>Boost Mobile: </strong>Boost Mobile’s Unlimited Gigs plan is currently running a four-line promotion. Four lines of unlimited talk, text and data is $100 per month, with taxes and fees included. The Unlimited Gigs plan comes with 12 GB of hotspot data per line and video streams DVD-quality picture at 480p resolution. Boost also has several smartphones on sale for up to $270 off, including the iPhone 6s.","<strong>Cricket Wireless: </strong>Cricket’s current promotions focus around deals on devices when you switch or add a new line.

In 2018, scam calls made up 29.2 percent of <a href=\"https://firstorion.com/nearly-50-of-u-s-mobile-traffic-will-be-scam-calls-by-2019/\">all calls made in the U.S.</a>, up from 3.7 percent in 2017. That number is expected to grow to nearly 50 percent in 2019. Not only are these calls annoying, but they’re also dangerous, often encouraging people to give up personal information like account numbers, passwords or Social Security numbers.","At the moment, there aren’t many great ways of combating the spam. The national <a href=\"https://www.donotcall.gov/\">Do Not Call Registry</a> only prevents calls from legitimate, sales-oriented telemarketers, and most call-blocking services only block known scam numbers, which does little against spammers who use a technique called neighborhood spoofing. Neighborhood spoofing hijacks phone numbers in your local area to increase the chance you answer the call. It’s an increasingly popular technique, and it makes it difficult for you to block the scammers, since the calls come from a different phone number every time. This could change soon, however, following adoption of FCC-recommended SHAKEN/STIR standards. These authentication standards cut the number of spam calls that make it to you by validating each call with the originating and recipient carriers before connecting the call. In November 2018, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-354933A1.pdf\">urged</a> phone companies to adopt these standards by 2019.","In the meantime, many cellular carriers provide spam identification tools. T-Mobile recently <a href=\"https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2018/T-Mobile-Has-Blocked-Over-a-Billion-Scam-Calls-and-Now-Industry-Leading-Tech-Keeps-Customers-Even-Safer/default.aspx\">announced</a> that its Scam ID and Scam Block features have blocked over 1 billion calls and marked 6 billion calls as “Scam Likely.” These features are available to both T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers.","<strong>Prepaid phones and 911 </strong>","One of the main disadvantages of cell phones versus landlines is that it&#39;s harder to determine their location during emergencies. Because landlines are locked to a location, it&#39;s easy for emergency responders to find the origin of the call. Determining a location of a cell phone, particularly in rural areas, is more difficult. Whereas a landline gives the emergency service your exact location, a 911 call made from a cell phone pings the nearest cell tower. It can give your general area, but the information is often not specific enough for emergency services to find you.","This issue has made news recently, as the Missouri Department of Public Safety reported that 28 counties in the state, including nine in the Ozarks, were not equipped to pinpoint locations for emergency services based on mobile calls. On Jan. 1, 2019, Missouri added a 3 percent tax to prepaid cell phone plans. These funds are set to go toward the expansion of 911 services in the underserved counties. Most cell phone bills, including those for prepaid cell service, include a surcharge that goes toward 911 services, but this is a first for prepaid customers in Missouri. This surcharge varies by state and may be a set fee or a percentage based on your plan.","The FCC recommends that, when calling emergency services from a cell phone, you immediately give the 911 operator your exact location. If you are unfamiliar with the area, it can be helpful to describe landmarks. You should also provide your cell phone number in case you get disconnected. ","<strong>Prepaid phone security</strong>","If a traditional cell phone plan does not offer the level of security or anonymity you desire, a prepaid phone plan may be a good fit for you. All phones connected to a wireless network are traceable, either through GPS functions or cell tower triangulation, and many apps track your location data as well. Wireless carriers keep this information, which is available to authorities with a warrant – and to pretty much anyone else, through less legal, indirect means. Cell phone carriers sell data, including location data, to third parties, which, as <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile\">Motherboard reported</a> earlier this year, can end up in the hands of bounty hunters or anyone with $300 and your phone number. The only way to prevent your phone from broadcasting your location is to turn it off.","Still, prepaid phone services offer a little more privacy than traditional plans, as prepaid companies often collect much less personally identifiable information when you begin service. In some cases, it&#39;s possible to purchase a prepaid phone service card and a prepaid device from a big-box retailer without even having your name attached to the phone number. In this case, the phone could still be traced with its phone number, but it’s more difficult to connect you to the phone and service. A few tips for securing your device and protecting your privacy include using a VPN, leveraging third-party apps for messaging, and turning off your phone’s GPS and location services. You may also want to buy both your device and the prepaid service in person, with cash.","Read more:","<a href=\"/best-smartphones\">Best smartphone</a><br/><a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\">Best cell phone services</a><br/><a href=\"/choosing-the-best-cell-phone-signal-booster-for-your-home\">Choosing the best cell phone signal booster</a>"]},"id":"6d40f42c-d8ae-4e57-a6b2-e77c58544eb8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_332","url":"/best-prepaid-cell-phones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-11T17:29:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-11T17:29:00Z","name":"Best prepaid phone plans 2019: know your data","synopsis":"A review of the best prepaid cell phone deals of 2019 based on the price for both limited and unlimited data as well as coverage.","review":{},"strapline":"A review of the best prepaid cell phone deals of 2019 based on the price for both limited and unlimited data as well as coverage.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-17T16:10:58Z","id":"RSPcN4Le6NSabGdE97PBK7","meta":{"title":"Best Prepaid Phone Plans 2019 - Carrier Reviews and Comparison","description":"A review of the best prepaid cell phone deals of 2019 based on the price for both limited and unlimited data as well as coverage."},"products":[{"slug":"metro-by-t-mobile","url":"/product/metro-by-t-mobile","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","name":"Metro by T-Mobile","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"rPMSFaBLGhvHSyfRQ94LdT","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"cricket-wireless","url":"/product/cricket-wireless","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","name":"Cricket Wireless","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"k2tbDzzQ4NBX3YFgDYzT5N","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"us-mobile","url":"/product/us-mobile","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","name":"US Mobile","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"fLvAjuUuUsKt6CAP6TRDN3","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"visible","url":"/product/visible","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","name":"Visible","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"K54Ma67G6pwjCrKrsE38Q9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"walmart-family-mobile","url":"/product/walmart-family-mobile","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","name":"Walmart Family Mobile","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"heTZayQqmDi5su7WgWGrfS","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HdGqJwiAqrBTb6QPeGhdyW.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Prepaid-Phone-Providers-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/I/O/795120/original/Hero-Prepaid-Phone-Providers-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"HdGqJwiAqrBTb6QPeGhdyW","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdGqJwiAqrBTb6QPeGhdyW.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best prepaid phone plans 2019: know your data","description":"A review of the best prepaid cell phone deals of 2019 based on the price for both limited and unlimited data as well as coverage."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HdGqJwiAqrBTb6QPeGhdyW.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Prepaid-Phone-Providers-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/I/O/795120/original/Hero-Prepaid-Phone-Providers-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"HdGqJwiAqrBTb6QPeGhdyW","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdGqJwiAqrBTb6QPeGhdyW.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best prepaid phone plans 2019: know your data","description":"A review of the best prepaid cell phone deals of 2019 based on the price for both limited and unlimited data as well as coverage."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"mobile","url":"/electronics/mobile","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","name":"Mobile","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:38Z","id":"LWfuBdpYombsbwBKLD65DE","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
