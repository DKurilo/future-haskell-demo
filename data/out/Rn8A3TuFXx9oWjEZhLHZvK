You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Panasonic ER-GS60-S, <a href=\"/best-electric-hair-clippers\">electric hair clippers for men</a>, have the power to cut through wet and dry hair, as well as facial hair. These hair clippers feature sharp blades angled at 45 degrees, a handful of accessories and cordless capabilities. Furthermore, these hair clippers are easy to maintain and don’t require any special cleaning oil or brushes but can be rinsed under the sink for fast cleaning and maintenance.","These Panasonic hair clippers feature a rotary motor for full power. You can use these clippers plugged in or cordless. When cordless, you can recharge the batteries to keep them working at their best. A full charge will power the clippers for up to 50 minutes. This is an adequate amount of time, but low when compared to similar products. The best cordless hair clippers will last 75 to 100 minutes on a single charge.","Additionally, these Panasonic hair clippers feature a 45-degree blade that easily cuts hair. It also has the power to cut wet and thick hair, which is an excellent capability, as many similar products are only intended for dry hair that is easy to cut.","Three comb attachments are included with these hair clippers. These combs help you get the length of hair and the look that you desire. One included attachment is designed to cut hair as short as 1 mm, and the other can cut hair between 2 to 10 mm. The clippers feature 10 settings that allow you to choose the exact cut that you desire without the need to change and keep track of numerous attachments.","One drawback to these hair clippers for men is the lack of included accessories. We would like to see a type of blending attachment and left and right ear taper attachments. Furthermore, a barber cape would be ideal for cleanup as would some type of storage container for the product. If you&#39;d prefer a clipper that comes with more items, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/conair-home-haircut-and-grooming-kit-review\">Conair Home Haircut and Grooming Kit</a>.","Another of the Panasonic&#39;s standout features is that you can easily clean it. It doesn’t require any cleaning oil or brushes. You simply run the hair clippers under water to rinse any excess hair that might be found on the blades. This easy cleanup is a luxury when compared to similar products that require you clean the blades with a brush and oil.","The Panasonic ER-GS60-S is covered under a two-year warranty. This warranty is nothing extraordinary when compared to similar products. However, if you have any concerns or questions, you can speak with a support representative via email, telephone and live-chat support. This is one of the few companies that offers live-chat support for questions regarding its hair clippers."]},"id":"d46b0797-0189-4c35-9678-0816d1b66be7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1ac7006-0779-4d3a-b8fe-4090f8b678b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic ER-GS60-S is an excellent option for hair clippers if you have thick hair or like to cut your hair in the shower.
