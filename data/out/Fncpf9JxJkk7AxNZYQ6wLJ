The Fisher-Price Kid Tough Digital Camera takes on a large box like shape that has handles at both ends making it easier for kids to use. The box-like shape provides more durability so the camera can survive drop after drop. The design alone makes it one of the best <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital cameras for kids</a> available on the market today.

The absence of these features simplifies the design of the digital camera for kids, which makes it easier for young children to control the camera on their own. Older kids, however, will wish they could record videos with the camera. The camera does provide a 4x optical zoom, which sets it apart from many other digital cameras for children.","Digital cameras for children on the lower end of the spectrum offer only 0.3 megapixels of resolution while the Fisher-Price Kid Tough digital camera offers 1.3 megapixels of resolution providing a difference in quality that users will see. We found that while some children prefer taking pictures, others have more fun looking at the pictures afterwards on a computer or TV. It seems that the camera is perfect for younger kids who have shorter attention spans and just enjoy taking the pictures. The recommended age for the digital camera for kids is 3 to 7 years; if your child is 6 or 7 years old, we would suggest looking into a digital camera that will provide them with higher-resolution pictures.","Like most digital cameras for kids this one comes with photo editing capabilities. You have to download the photo editing software from the Fisher-Price website. When you click on the Software Downloads link, you&#39;ll be navigated a page with three options: software for the Kid Tough Music Player, the Kid Tough Digital Camera and the Kid Tough Video Camera. Photo editing is a popular feature for children because it is educational and entertaining."]},"id":"9d50197c-5192-4e9f-9f9e-cf2a49a833ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"724b942a-a5f9-4f27-ae09-f5a2bab55e63","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Without a doubt the most popular feature of this product is its ability to survive drops, bumps, kicks and trips.

The two top buttons will let the child move forward and back as they review the images on their camera. The bottom button on the left of the LCD screen is the power button, and the bottom button on the left side of the LCD screen allows the kids to delete images from their camera.","On the left side of the back of the camera there is one additional button in the shape of an 8. This button has a “+” at the top and a “-“ at the bottom, which allows the user to zoom in and out while taking a photo.

We found most children catch on rather quickly, so they should be using the camera on their own in no time. Another feature that we felt made the camera easier to use was its ability to time-off after inactivity.
