The latter includes unlimited talk and text and a set amount of 4G data you can share between multiple lines or roll over to the next payment cycle if you don’t use it all. You can buy data buckets in 1, 5, 10 and 20 gigabyte increments. Each line added costs $20 monthly on top of the cost of the plan. These plans aren’t the most cost-efficient. The absolute cheapest plan for four lines at AT&amp;T, at $115, costs the same as Verizon’s cheapest four-line plan but includes less data. The cheapest individual plan through AT&amp;T is $55 for 1GB, while Verizon offers a 5GB individual plan for $5 more a month. You should also be careful when shopping AT&amp;T’s plans, as they are not intuitive.
