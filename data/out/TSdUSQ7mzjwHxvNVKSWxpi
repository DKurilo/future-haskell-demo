It uses its GPS receiver to tell you how far you&#39;ve gone and how fast you&#39;ve gone there. It is not compatible with any ANT+ sensors, so information such as heart rate, cadence and power is not something this unit can provide you. However, the simplicity of the Edge 200 does carry appeal. It&#39;s the easy to use, and the battery life lasts 14 hours, which is a solid figure for bike GPS units in this class.","The Edge 200 has a monochrome LCD display that features a backlight for riding in low-light conditions. You control the Edge 200 with four buttons on the side. A power button turns the unit off or on, a page button allows you to cycle between displayed data, a pause button instructs the unit to stop recording your ride data, and a lap button starts a new lap and saves the old one.","One  of the best parts of the Edge 200 is the courses feature that lets you create a number of routes online and store them on the device. You use the Garmin Connect website has to create a courses or routes by tracing them on a map. Then you can transfer the courses to your Edge 200 via USB, and the display will show your progress on the course as you ride.","While the Edge 200 doesn&#39;t have full-fledged turn-by-turn navigation, it does give you breadcrumb navigation in the Courses feature. You&#39;ll see a line representing your path and a dot representing you as you ride, and the device will display data about your progress along the course. This bike computer will store courses and ride data, so you can also compete against your past performance on a loaded course and track your progress.","Like other Garmin GPS units, the Edge is optimized for integration on Garmin Connect, an online social network for cyclists, where you can share your ride information with friends. When you export your ride data from the Edge 200 to Garmin Connect, you&#39;ll be able to see a map of where you rode, as well as speed and distance data. Ride information from the Edge can also be uploaded to Strava or other third-party cycling social networks, so you can share your adventures with friends who may not own a Garmin-brand bicycle GPS."]},"id":"d237f100-9edf-4194-a323-fd5b03aa604d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"38871b74-a118-4d65-ad0c-6cfa439dadd2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Edge 200 is easy to figure out, and you&#39;ll quickly learn how to get the most from its limited features.
