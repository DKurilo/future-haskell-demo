Do you go with a laptop or traditional PC? Luckily, all-in-one computers are the perfect compromise between the two. They offer the type of performance you&#39;d expect in a traditional PC in a portable package. And the HP Omni 27-1015t all-in-one PC is no exception.","The 27-inch widescreen and 1920 x 1080 display resolution are great for watching movies and videos and for other multimedia activities. It also comes with an HDMI-in port so you can connect to your TV or game console. Unfortunately, this all-in-one desktop only comes with a DVD drive and not a Blu-ray drive, which means you&#39;ll have to connect an external one unless you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray drive for an extra charge.","One thing that&#39;s clearly missing from this home PC is the touchscreen. In its class, almost every other all-in-one PC comes standard with this feature. This means you wonâ€™t be able to physically interact with the screen and use shortcuts.","The PC also lacks a Thunderbolt port, but it does have two USB 3.0 and four USB 2.0 ports that give you a reasonable amount of connectivity. You can use the USB 3.0 ports to connect to high-end external devices like a hard drive, while the USB 2.0 ports are better for peripherals such as your keyboard and mouse. Fortunately, a wireless keyboard and mouse are included in the package.","If you&#39;re a music lover or movie fanatic, you&#39;re sure to appreciate the impressive Beats Audio. The sound is crisp, clear and resonates throughout the room.","The 3.0GHz Intel Core i5-3550S processor makes it easy to multitask on this computer without experiencing lag. You can easily have numerous tabs open while watching a movie or listening to music.","If you run into issues when using your PC, you can reach HP by phone or email. You can also connect to a live chat session right on the website if your problem is time sensitive or urgent."]},"id":"fdb39029-398d-43b3-8e32-8a6c75a84839","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ee581b41-3b3f-470a-8265-31f7a07393bd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Omni 27-1015t is a solid all-in-one PC with a 27-inch widescreen and 1920 x 1080 display resolution.
