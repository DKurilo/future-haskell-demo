Not only does it offer reasonable rates for its basic shared hosting plan, it also offers free domain registration. There&#39;s no setup fee, and you have a 90-day money-back guarantee.","InMotion Hosting gives you room to grow, offering three separate shared hosting plans. While many services only allow one hosted domain, InMotion allows two, and you get 25 subdomains. You can create an unlimited number of email accounts, which is helpful when you have a large team and each person needs their own email address.","The cPanel dashboard is standard, but this web host offers nearly £200 in advertising credits.

You get unlimited bandwidth and storage space, within its guidelines, and email accounts are unlimited too. You&#39;re only allowed one MySQL database, though, and no parked domains.","There are other costs associated where most services charge nothing, such as domain transfers.

Arvixe scored higher in control panel testing than any other provider we tested.

Arvixe also offers the latest and most popular apps with one-click installs. You get access to a large library of blogs and CMS apps, so you don&#39;t have to code anything. Arvixe is also the only web hosting provider to offer free domain registration for as long as you&#39;re under contract with the company."]},"id":"dc86c6cf-d33f-45b2-8aa9-a6d970ed9e70","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Web Hosting: What We Tested, What We Found"},"id":"e44dc8ec-65af-4cee-b6fe-8d448f2beda8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["To review U.K. web hosting services, we created websites through each of the providers we evaluated, and we purchased month-to-month hosting. Unless you cancel, these plans renew each year. Most of them offer free domain name registration for the first year.","We focused on the basic shared hosting plan from each web host. So, the numbers you see on our side-by-side comparison for disk space and bandwidth are based on each service&#39;s introductory plan.","<strong>Plan Offerings</strong>","You need shared hosting that grows with you. As you gain more fans and more web traffic, you should be able to upgrade your plan. We looked at the flexibility of each provider by considering the number of plans each one offers, and then evaluated how easy it is to move up to another tier.","On average, web hosting companies in the U.K. offer three hosting plans, so you have some room to grow and move upward. You&#39;ll still find some providers that only offer one shared hosting plan, though. Generally, these one-plan providers don&#39;t offer enough bandwidth and storage for businesses that start booming – not for the value, anyway. If you have to upgrade from one of these plans, you&#39;re going to have to move into the VPS and dedicated server territory, which is much more expensive.","<strong>Control Panel Usability</strong>","After building a landing page for a business with standard content and images, we had several reviewers at Top Ten Reviews test the cPanel and apps, such as WordPress, to determine compatibility. You&#39;ll find most providers&#39; control panels are similar, but the best UK web hosting providers include several features to make creating a website simple. The usability score is all about the host&#39;s interface, the cPanel and the included website builder.","Our first test involved creating an account. The website hosts that offer one-step website creation, including account verification through email and domain and host package approval at the same time, received points for immediate usability. About half of those we tested didn&#39;t let us start an account without first providing a copy of an ID card and a credit card statement. The more difficult it is to set up an account, the more likely you&#39;re going to move on to another service.","The next test involved each provider&#39;s dashboard. The industry standard is cPanel, but others, like <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-web-hosting\">iPage</a>, offer their own panels so you get more customization. We checked for the tools available in the basic shared hosting plans, such as the ability to create cron jobs, easy email creation and a disk-usage meter. It&#39;s common to find web host services that let you back up your site manually or offer a one-click install of the most popular apps.","<strong>Customer Support Quality</strong>","While pricing and usability are important factors when you&#39;re looking for the best hosting service in the U.K., customer support is an equally vital part of the service. You want your website to have 100% uptime, but things happen, so you&#39;re probably going to have to deal with server fails or intermittent outages. When that happens, you want to have immediate access to a customer support representative, which is why 24/7 support by phone and live chat is standard.","We placed phone calls to each service we tested several times at various times of the day and night to test the quality of support we received, regardless of the hour. Our percentage score is based on our reviewers&#39; ranking of five criteria.","Each representative was expected to have decent product knowledge and not automatically send us to the FAQs page. If a representative tried to upsell us rather than help in support calls, the service lost points. We also considered how personable each representative was in both live chat and phone support.","Live chat can be spotty, so we tested chat during busy hours and after normal business hours to evaluate the wait time for being connected to a representative and the response time between each question. The service with the fastest response time is <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-web-hosting\">GreenGeeks</a>.","The average wait time overall was just over 10 minutes. The longest we waited to reach a representative was 45 minutes. It&#39;s necessary to test the customer support service because it&#39;s often what separates the good hosting services from the great ones. In many cases when a company touted its live chat support, we found support was often offline or unavailable. In other cases, customer support was only able to help with sales and upgrades, rather than tech issues."]},"id":"9aa2dacc-6a6c-4ecd-b887-518a0ffff893","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Should You Consider Free Web Hosting?"},"id":"34c40e78-5b53-4edf-a3fd-ec9f0b73ea71","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When is free really free? Web hosts such as Weebly, Jimdo and Wix are good choices for those who need personal sites but don&#39;t anticipate too much traffic or need lots of storage space. As with most free stuff, there&#39;s a trade-off. In this case, free website hosting equals ads on your site featuring the provider, and you usually only get a subdomain.","Free website hosting is a good option for small, personal sites, but small business owners should consider paid web hosting services. Having a unique domain provides credibility and gives you a more professional look. Plus, you get features that are necessary as your business grows, such as unlimited disk space and bandwidth, and security to help protect your site from hacks and malware."]},"id":"7838985f-2022-40cd-959f-dd564592e096","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"What About Free Domain Name Registration?"},"id":"ce45da54-75fc-4ba2-9540-c8af68eb17c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It&#39;s tempting to choose a website host when it offers free domain name registration, but this is usually just for the first year. Domain names are generally $10 to $15 and require you to re-register annually. Some hosts out there make a deal with you, though, like Arvixe – keep using its service, and it&#39;ll pay for your domain name registration.","All of the website hosting companies out there can charge what they want for domain name registration, so it could be free with one service, $5 with another and as much as $20 with a different provider. You&#39;ll have to look beyond the promotional prices to see what you&#39;ll end up spending in the second, third or fourth year with the service.","Once you look past the introductory rates, you&#39;ll see how much you can expect to pay for hosting each year. Our comparison chart shows you the regular monthly rates for a single year of hosting for individual and business plans – these prices do not factor in promotions, so you&#39;ll know what to expect to pay when the promotions end."]},"id":"2d30e984-8c91-4994-9f06-14d01c2ca5d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"How to Get Cheap Web Hosting for Businesses Big &amp; Small"},"id":"031efc08-fcc6-46c2-825b-16555b1b7489","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re new to websites and website hosting or migrating your current website to a new provider, you need to arm yourself with the knowledge of what services the companies provide, what you can expect from each plan, how the fees add up, and the terms web hosting businesses won&#39;t necessarily tell you upfront.","Web hosting in the U.K. is the same as everywhere else: You have options of plans that offer dedicated or shared hosting, and which one you should choose depends on how much storage you need and what your web traffic looks like.","For example, if you post lots of large files, such as images and videos, you want to find a provider that gives you unlimited disk space. Unlimited bandwidth is necessary for those with lots of web traffic.","It can be difficult to figure out which plan to choose for your website and know which of the features, options and pricing plans are best for you and your business. Generally, you&#39;ll find website hosts offer about three differently priced tiers. There are a few exceptions to that rule.","DreamHost, GreenGeeks and <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-web-hosting\">FatCow</a> offer one plan only. Many of the options and the bandwidth of these plans are like those you&#39;d find in the top tiers of other web hosting companies, and the cost is slightly higher. Although you don&#39;t get the choice of different shared hosting plans with these companies, they do offer virtual private server and dedicated server hosting plans if you require more bandwidth.","<strong>Shared Hosting</strong>","Most web host providers offer shared hosting, which is when many clients&#39; websites are hosted on a single server. It&#39;s the most cost-effective plan for individuals and businesses that don&#39;t get a ton of traffic to their sites. The low prices you see advertised for a web hosting company are usually for a shared hosting plan.","If you&#39;re wary of a shared hosting option – don&#39;t be! It&#39;s an excellent solution for small businesses that are just getting started and don&#39;t see too many visitors at once on their websites. However, as your business grows, you may exceed the allotted average bandwidth that the web host expects. If and when this happens, your provider is likely to require you to upgrade to a higher-priced plan. Every hosting company is different, though, so be sure to read through the terms of service to see what the specific restrictions are.","<strong>VPS Hosting</strong>","A virtual private server, or VPS, is still shared web hosting, but this option nets you more elbow room, so to speak. If your website is generating more web traffic, then you may want or need to choose this hosting plan.","You aren&#39;t just paying more for extra bandwidth. Most hosting companies also offer stricter security and more features for tracking data and customizing your space management.","<strong>Dedicated Hosting</strong>","When your website expands even more in bandwidth or storage space needs, you may want to consider switching over to a dedicated server. You won&#39;t share space with any other websites, which means you could get an influx of visitors to your website and there should be no discernible slowing. Plus, you won&#39;t have to worry about other websites&#39; traffic clogging the line, causing a crash to your site.","This isn&#39;t the most cost-effective solution for most individual users or small business owners, though. Aside from the cost of hosting, you&#39;ll need to know how to set up and manage a dedicated server, or have someone working for you to do it.","<strong>Cloud Hosting</strong>","You hear about the cloud all the time, and it&#39;s usually an inexpensive route for storing your documents or photos, but in hosting, it&#39;s a different story. Your website&#39;s data and bandwidth are shared among many servers, which helps protect your information. It&#39;s expensive, though, and you are responsible for maintenance and repairs."]},"id":"c8198806-2694-47b8-8b81-682f7bd32382","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Small Business Web Hosting: When the Promotion Ends"},"id":"ab780222-7281-4d68-bbc4-c304762d563b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Many UK web hosting companies get your attention with their promotions, but when the introductory rates end and you&#39;re paying for the regular service, these are the features that will be most important to you.","<strong>If It&#39;s Unlimited, Why Would You Ever Need to Upgrade?</strong>","The word &#34;unlimited&#34; seems to imply &#34;infinite,&#34; but really it just comes down to marketing language. What most web hosting companies mean is that you get unlimited bandwidth and storage space as long as you don&#39;t exceed what it determines is &#34;regular use.&#34;","Although these providers assure that more than 99% of customers won&#39;t have issues and throttling won&#39;t be a problem, you still may get warnings from your service. If you store large media files that push you past the company&#39;s allotted usage, you could get warnings to use less storage or upgrade to a higher plan.","<strong>Plan Details</strong>","Each web host defines &#34;unlimited&#34; differently and offers varied amounts allowable for domains, subdomains and parked domains. DreamHost is one service that doesn&#39;t have expandable shared hosting plans, but it doesn&#39;t need to, because it offers unlimited data and space in its basic plans.","<strong>Downtime Responsiveness</strong>","Every host in our review claims it has 99% uptime, which means at some point, your website is going to experience some downtime. It could mean lost traffic or income for you, but there&#39;s not much you can do during those events except wait.","What&#39;s important, then, is your web hosting provider&#39;s responsiveness when that downtime occurs. Typically, you can expect a company to bounce back from a failure within 20 minutes.","<strong>Compatibility</strong>","One of the best things about there being so many web hosting companies is that you have a choice. Even if you invest in a host for a couple of years, if you feel like you need a change, there are other web hosting providers that make moving over easy.","We found the best services make it a painless process to migrate your information from one host to another, or even export your site content from theirs to another. Those that do this received higher scores. InMotion Hosting is one of the providers that make data and domain migration easy.","You can expect a limited money-back guarantee from each of the services in our review. Some of them let you cancel at any time with no penalties.","<strong>Security</strong>","While it&#39;s true that you get more security with VPS and dedicated hosting, shared servers include security features to keep your website safe. The best ones offer secure sockets layer (SSL) security protocol, which keeps data that&#39;s transferred back and forth through your website encrypted and safe, and secure shell (SSH), which requires remote login.","Many of the providers we evaluated will back up and restore your site with no additional cost to you if your site goes down. A few of them offer antispam protection for free, while others offer advanced spam protection for an additional cost.","If you sell products or services online, you can find several hosting providers that offer eCommerce solutions, such as shopping cart systems and the ability to accept credit cards. You&#39;ll find that almost every web hosting service in our review includes promotional advertising credits to help your marketing efforts."]},"id":"aa4dd55d-2aa2-41ea-893f-62fa91dd07e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Our Verdict &amp; Recommendations"},"id":"d5fda084-9e33-40e4-ad26-e202fd5b6d41","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["After evaluating and testing the basic shared hosting plans from each service, we were pleased with the features, level of control and security options available at such affordable prices.","There&#39;s no question that the overall best web hosting service title belongs to InMotion Hosting.
