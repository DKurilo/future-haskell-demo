It gives you access to over 500,000 movies and TV episodes and provides an intuitive interface that you can easily navigate with the remote. If you go on vacation, you can take the Roku Stick with you and use it as long as you have access to Wi-Fi. You can also download the Roku app, which allows you to use your phone as the remote control. Anyone wanting more shows and features should look into the Roku Streaming Stick+ or the Roku Premiere. If you’re looking for a more budget friendly option, you might be interested in the Roku Express. "]},"id":"70a12646-a83b-4054-94c9-07420d940135","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"ClearStream ECLIPSE"},"id":"dc8ad614-31a6-4d66-bcae-dbd367a2fb96","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Z8mYf7ytM4oqAymLLk4h2N.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/Y/2/778826/original/ClearStream-ECLIPSE-Edited.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z8mYf7ytM4oqAymLLk4h2N.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Z8mYf7ytM4oqAymLLk4h2N","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z8mYf7ytM4oqAymLLk4h2N.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f9b682fc-9829-4054-acff-775b4d5aaa87","type":"image"},{"data":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"bestof","data-model-name":"ClearStream ECLIPSE"},"source":"hawk","embedtype":"unknown"},"id":"f32e485e-1f3f-4f3d-9ceb-c93689c057da","type":"embed"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When we tested HDTV antennas, the ClearStream Eclipse was able to pick up the most channels. It had the longest search range of 50 miles. Additionally, each of the 32 channels it received had great reception without any interference whatsoever. It has a very different design compared to the common square or rectangle shape and is made of a paper-like material that easily sticks to walls and windows due to the sticky grip strip. If you’re wanting something a little more economical, you should consider the Insignia Fine Tuning Indoor HDTV Antenna. It has an antiquated design, but it works well. Of course, if you’re wanting to ditch the antenna entirely, you might want to look at the Roku Streaming Stick or Fire Stick. Anyone looking for an inexpensive TV should look at the Vizio 24-inch D-Series (D24f-F1), which scored highest in our comparison of TVs under $250.
