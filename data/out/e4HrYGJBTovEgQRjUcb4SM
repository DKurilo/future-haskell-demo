This is an important feature because it eliminates the need for customers to buy an extra piece of equipment before they can use their back up cameras. Some lesser rearview cameras do not include a monitor; rather, they either rely on preinstalled monitors or compel users to buy a monitor separately.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/53905-rear-view-safety-rvs-7706136.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k6X4fhbwRwESD8xcG4iodF.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"k6X4fhbwRwESD8xcG4iodF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k6X4fhbwRwESD8xcG4iodF.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5ee83d08-f093-4353-b0e7-a91975cb45ac","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Buying a third-party monitor poses several problems. Chief among them is compatibility; there really is no way to determine whether a back up camera will work with another aftermarket device. By including its own branded display, Rear View Safety dispels those concerns. The included monitor measures 7 inches diagonally. Save for one, every other monitor on our side-by-side comparison chart measures half this size or less.","The monitor flawlessly integrates with the camera. It has a picture resolution that would make the smartphone in your pocket blush. At 1440 x 234 pixels, it displays objects and obstacles in the rear of your vehicle bright and clear. However, we can&#39;t seem to get our heads around the lopsided nature of the pixel resolutions. A 1440 x 234 resolution just doesn&#39;t fit right, especially on a 7-inch display. That figure reads more like the score of a video game in which one of the players was much better than the other rather than a screen resolution. However, it is what it is, and the monitor displays images just fine, so it may not matter.","The signal-to-noise ratio from the camera to monitor is a robust 48dB. This ensures that there is little static and few visual artifacts displayed on the monitor of the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123. Much like the resolution specs, the signal-to-noise ratio seems like an oddball figure. Most other back up cameras on our side-by-side comparison chart have more-rounded figures such as 40 and 65. A signal-to-noise ratio landing at exactly 48dB is odd, to say the least. However, not many back up cameras have a higher ratio. So, in the final analysis, it&#39;s nitpicking but worth mentioning.","The monitor of the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 comes with the option to activate automatically when you shift your car into reverse. This is good because you don&#39;t always have the time to switch your camera on before going into reverse. Situations such as this include parallel parking or rushing out of the driveway because you&#39;re late for work. It happens.","An interesting feature present on the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 that is not present on any other product on our lineup is speakers. The speakers allow you to hear what&#39;s going on behind your vehicle in addition to seeing it. This is especially useful in vehicles that are longer or higher than a standard automobile, such as RV trailers, campers and some large trucks.","Another feature unique to the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 is infrared night vision. There are other back up cameras on our lineup that feature night vision, but none that employ infrared technology. The Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 is the best nighttime back-up system of any product we reviewed."]},"id":"f8788ee0-5c17-42cb-a168-039fa24c0c60","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"332a49b8-75d8-43fe-a516-aeecb1108642","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/JSaraQLD68ZRyCFF7xjrjM.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Given all the outstanding features the monitor possesses, we were shocked to find that the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 has the narrowest viewing angle of products on our lineup.

At 2.1mm, this back up camera captures images in focus whether they are near of far from the camera itself.","This helps in situations when you need to see close objects and obstacles clearly, especially when it comes to children and small animals that may dart across your driveway when you&#39;re backing into the street. It also enhances the back up camera&#39;s parallel-parking features. The cautionary label &#34;Objects in the rearview mirror are closer than they appear&#34; no longer has any meaning with the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123.","We mentioned earlier that the monitor of the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 has built-in speakers. You find the complimentary feature in the form of a built-in microphone on the camera component of the system.","To steal an adage from the U.S. postal service, whether rain, sleet, hail, or snow, the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 pulls through. This is due to the extremely durable weatherproof casing that surrounds the camera. Short of ultra-extreme weather conditions such as a hurricane or blizzard, the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 operates and functions just as well on a dark, snowy winter night as it does on a warm spring morning.","Connecting the camera of the Rear View Safety RVS-7706123 to its display requires a bit of installation work on your part. The system includes a lengthy cable to connect the camera to the monitor. Wiring this cable through your vehicle is a small chore. If you follow the instructions precisely, you should be able to install it yourself. However, if you aren&#39;t confident in your electrical skills, you may want to consider having a mechanically minded friend or professional install the wiring for you."]},"id":"5e19515c-bf88-4d1d-abc2-d732b4f573c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Camera"},"id":"5d982ded-e55b-404b-b4df-fa193a63ecc0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/YoPXQAY68h4NJrHYPCQQq8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"When we rated and ranked rearview cameras, we looked for specific extra features that transform an ordinary back up unit into a truly versatile piece of auto technology.
