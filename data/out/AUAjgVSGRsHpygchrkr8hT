Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For an <a href=\"/best-alarm-clocks\">alarm clock</a> with a variety of features that help you with customization and functionality, the Magnasonic AM/FM Projection Clock Radio is a top possibility for best alarm clocks. This alarm clock has a projection feature in addition to a choice between either radio or buzzer alarm. Besides functioning as an efficient radio alarm clock, it offers features to make it easier to use, like automatic time set and a projection for the wall or ceiling. Overall, this digital alarm clock is a great, convenient option to use to wake up.","To make using this clock radio easier, the clock comes with a preconfigured factory time. You can set it to match your local time by either selecting one of the time zones or by manually setting the clock. It won&#39;t auto-set according to a central location, so if it&#39;s off at all, you can use the manual settings. The Magnasonic also has a setting for daylight saving time to automatically adjust the time for you.","The snooze button, often the most-used button on any alarm clock, is large and set right on top for easy access. Each button is raised and textured. You can feel for them without opening your eyes. A potential drawback to the button layout is that the alarm off button is right next to the snooze button on the top of the clock. In the morning when it&#39;s sometimes difficult to think or see clearly, you might accidentally hit the alarm off button instead of the snooze.","The digital clock face is backlit in blue. You can adjust to any of three brightness settings or turn it off completely. For when you&#39;re awake, you can make it bright enough to see in a light room. For sleeping, you can turn off the backlight. That way, you won&#39;t be disturbed by the bright light, but if you want to see the time in the middle of the night, you&#39;ll have to push a button or use the projection feature. If you would rather have the backlight always on, then you can dim it down, so it won&#39;t interrupt your sleep or hurt your eyes when you look at it in the dark. Even on dim, the backlight is bright enough to serve as a nightlight and may interrupt the sleep of lighter sleepers.","The Magnasonic Projection Clock Radio doesn&#39;t have as many alarm options as a few others on our list, but it has a good balance of features to complement its alarms. This alarm clock radio has some standard features like a snooze of nine-minute increments. You can also use the radio with the sleep timer. You can listen to the radio as you fall asleep and set the clock to turn it off after a set amount of time from 15 minutes to 90 minutes.","On the front display, you can see the room temperature (in either Celsius or Fahrenheit) and date along with the time. The Magnasonic is also a projection alarm clock. You can display the temperature and time can on the wall or the ceiling. You can tweak the adjustable projector on the side for the best fit for you. A button lets you flip the projection 180 degrees, and you can rotate the projector extension for the best angle. You can aim it to project onto any surface, such as the ceiling, so at night you can look up and see the time without having to roll over and look at the actual clock. You have the option to set the projection to display for the whole night or to come on when the alarm sounds.","If you want to listen to your own music with the sleep feature, the radio has a 3.5mm auxiliary input jack on the back. You can attach your smartphone or MP3 player and listen to music through the alarm clock&#39;s speakers. You can&#39;t use the external device as an alarm, however.","If the power goes out, you won&#39;t have to worry about whether or not you&#39;ll wake up on time in the morning. The alarm clock comes with a backup battery already installed. Additionally, since resetting all your alarms is a hassle, the Magnasonic will back up all your alarm settings in case the clock loses power.","Perhaps the most important part of an alarm clock is the alarm. You don&#39;t need a dozen alarm options, just one or two that work for you. This clock radio has two alarm types: the AM/FM radio and a standard buzzer. You can adjust the volume for the alarms up to a range that&#39;s loud enough to hear in the next room. Neither alarm has a gradual wake-up option.","The Magnasonic has a dual alarm feature. You can set two alarms for the morning as a main alarm and a backup, or a separate alarm for you and a partner. If you have to wake up Monday through Friday but get to sleep in Saturday and Sunday, you can program the alarms with an optional weekend skip. You don&#39;t have to remember on Friday to turn off your alarm and on Sunday night to turn it back on. You can also set an alarm for the whole week, the weekend, or just one day a week.","If you need help or support with your alarm clock, you won&#39;t be without options. The Magnasonic has a one-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty. A potential drawback is that the manufacturer is located in Canada, so those living outside of Canada who need to ship the clock to the manufacturer might find it more expensive than the clock is worth. If you need technical support, you have several options. You can send an email through a detailed contact form on the company&#39;s website. The website also allows you to talk with a representative through live chat. Additionally, you can call the number listed with the warranty information in the manual."]},"id":"417c25ad-b527-42a1-9dd7-53dbb64e47cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"437b57df-2b5d-45d8-97f0-3fc14f2e5119","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magnasonic AM/FM Projection Clock Radio is a well-rounded alarm clock that has several useful options for both nighttime and in the morning.
