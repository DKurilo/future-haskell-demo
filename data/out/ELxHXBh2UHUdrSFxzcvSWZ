The grammar and culture lessons aren’t part of the main course but rather serve as appetizers.

Pronunciation exercises are scattered throughout each lesson and grow in difficulty through the course. These exercises begin each unit with simple words and build to full Spanish sentences. You also play several vocabulary memory games to keep your skills sharp.","The program has a slick and modern interface, but we did have problems with the audio during the recording and pronunciation sections. We used the same microphone headset to test each of the learn Spanish programs we reviewed.

Each unit takes about an hour to complete, so you may need to set time aside to learn. If you’ve previously taken Spanish lessons, you probably don’t want to start at the beginning. Transparent allows you to jump around, so you can go between lessons or skip sections. Still, the program has a clear linear progression. This makes it a better choice for new leaners than those with a semester or more of Spanish under their belts.","All Spanish programs save and report your progress, but Transparent Essentials does this to a lesser degree. We found the progress tracking to be weak compared to similar programs.

A large chunk of the exercises are speech and recording activities; these lessons present a Spanish word along with a clip of a native Spanish speaker saying it for you to imitate. You can slow down the clip to hear the word better or record right after hearing the word.","The pronunciation section is similar those in other learn Spanish software. It has an accuracy meter that gauges how close your attempt is to the native speaker&#39;s speech. The gauge is stricter than those found in other programs. During out tests, the gauge never gave us credit for being perfectly accurate; this motivated us to spend extra time trying to improve our score.","In addition to the main course, the program has an additional learning section with 24 video lessons. These short videos look more like PowerPoint presentations with slides of text and images than actual videos, but they still contain useful information, covering basic grammar and cultural topics surrounding the Spanish language. Visual learners will respond well to the flashcards sections and the bright written Spanish words that repeat throughout the lesson.","Kinesthetic learners may still find themselves engaged with the program’s matching and memory activities, although they are probably more useful for visual learners.
