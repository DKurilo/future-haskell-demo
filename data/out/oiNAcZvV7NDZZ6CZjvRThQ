The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-hdmi-cables\">HDMI cables</a> here.</em>","The Bytecc HDMI High-Speed Male-to-Male Cable with Ethernet is a low-priced cable that is sold by various online retailers. It exceeds the 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second) bandwidth requirement of high-speed HDMI cables. It also provides support for 3D and advanced color spaces that exceed 1080p, the current high-definition screen resolution standard. However, the cables lack some important quality factors.","The cable uses triple shielding around the conductors to prevent interference from other electronic signals nearby. The company doesn&#39;t specify the metals it uses for its conductors or its connectors, but the best HDMI cables use high-purity copper conductors inside and gold-plated connectors at each end. As a result, the cable is likely to corrode over time, and its signal may not be as sharp as cables that use higher-quality materials.","HDMI Licensing LLC has certified the Bytecc cable as a high-speed HDMI 1.4 cable with Ethernet, as it has for many of the cables we reviewed. Its Ethernet channel supports an internet connection, but the channel only works with a device that is equipped to receive Ethernet through an HDMI cable, a technology that is still emerging. The cable is also RoHS certified as being free of hazardous materials such as lead. However, the product is not HDCP certified, which is a license issued when an HDMI cable has included a protocol that prevents the unauthorized duplication of copyrighted materials.","The Bytecc cable supports a resolution of 1080p, or 1080 vertical pixels across a screen. This resolution supports the 8-bit RGB (red, green and blue) and the 16-bit Deep Color. The cable also supports 3D and advanced color spaces that use deeper resolutions. 3D is comprised of two separate 1080p images that transmit simultaneously, and advanced color spaces, such as sYCC601 and Adobe YCC601, require even higher resolutions than 1080p.","The cable supports compressed digital audio formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS (Digital Theater System). It also supports uncompressed digital formats including Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.","The Bytecc cable is available in lengths of 3, 6, 10 and 15 feet that are 28 AWG, the gauge (or cable diameter) of most of the cables we reviewed. The company also provides longer models in 24 AWG that&#39;s larger in diameter including lengths of  25, 50, 75 and 100 feet. The company had to use a thicker gauge in its longer models to meet the HDMI licensing requirements. However, the Bytecc website does not indicate whether these cables are CL3 safety certified for in-wall installation. CL3 is a certification issued by UL (Underwriters Laboratories Inc.), which tests cables on their resistance to open flames. The certification verifies that a cable burns less than 59 inches before dampening.","The Bytecc website also does not verify if the company provides a warranty for its cables, nor does it list a FAQs page. However, the company provides customer support by phone and email."]},"id":"596483b5-bc7f-4434-a5bd-36248816483b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b9011613-677f-4339-b57c-7b118de7e645","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bytecc HDMI High-Speed Male-to-Male Cable with Ethernet is a certified high-speed HDMI cable that meets the 1.4 specification established by HDMI Licensing LLC.
