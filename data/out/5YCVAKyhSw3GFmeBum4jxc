You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The Nuvi line of navigation GPS devices has always been reliable for giving great service and accurate information. The Garmin Nuvi 200 is a perfect example of how well this line of GPS works and comes at a better price than most other GPS units. In fact, the Garmin Nuvi 200 is like the introduction to GPS navigation because it is a simplified version of some of the more complex (and expensive) models in the Nuvi line.","The smaller price is not the only attractive part of the Garmin Nuvi 200. It has a compact design that won’t take up much room in your car and a large screen that makes it easy to read directions and maps. The greatest asset of the Garmin Nuvi 200 is accuracy. Like most Garmin products, the Garmin Nuvi 200 excels at providing accurate positioning and concise and useful directions to your destination.","Experts who used the Garmin Nuvi 200 praise its accuracy, but they also like the various tools built in for travelers. Consumers love the cheaper price of the Garmin Nuvi 200, but they also like the route planning. Some people did mention that the rerouting engine was sometimes slow to calculate the new route if you missed a turn.","Getting accurate GPS directions in your vehicle doesn’t have to be expensive; the Garmin Nuvi 200 is proof of that. The Garmin Nuvi 200 provides all the accuracy and usability of more expensive GPS units and an easy-to-use interface.
