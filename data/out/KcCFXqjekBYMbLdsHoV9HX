It’s hard not to suppose that the sound quality will be substandard and the speaker build flimsy. Surprisingly, the Dayton Audio B652 bookshelf speakers offer sturdy construction and solid sound quality for a pair of speakers that are so inexpensive.","Don’t raise your expectations too high; these speakers won’t blow you away with sharp, high definition imaging or a concert-quality soundscape, but they don’t sound like you&#39;re listening through a tin can either. The 6.5-inch polypropylene woofer and 0.75-inch tweeter produce neutral sound quality that doesn’t overemphasize high or low frequencies to make up for its lack of power or size. This means these speakers don’t produce off-color tones that make you cringe. This is an impressive feat for an inexpensive speaker.","On paper, these small bookshelf speakers won&#39;t wow you. The 70Hz to 20kHz frequency range is one of the least dynamic in our comparison, but at least it&#39;s honest. These speakers don’t produce deep bass like some of the best bookshelf speakers we reviewed, but this isn&#39;t surprising given the 70Hz low-end frequency response.","Power handling is another minor issue for the B652. It runs off an average of 40 watts and can only handle 75 watts of peak power. This suggests that the speakers are not strong enough to serve as your mains for your home entertainment center but can be a solid complement to your current tower speakers.","Dayton Audio states that the B652 has a sensitivity rating of 87dB and carry a 6-ohm load. Some users suggest that the speakers actually carry a 4-ohm load. This means that in order to make these bookshelf speakers sound their absolute best, you will need a decently powered amplifier to properly drive them. You&#39;ll find that 8-ohm speakers give you more flexibility because they can typically be paired with just about any amplifier or receiver.","The simple all-black enclosure is only 11.6 inches tall and weighs 11.6 pounds. The enclosure is sealed and has keyhole hangers near the top of each speaker. This gives you the option to hang your bookshelf speakers on your wall. The Dayton Audio B652 speakers are covered by a five-year warranty."]},"id":"c7e5c3be-c3da-49b3-8bf0-edb0049b3a85","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0d02b14e-c693-4cc0-b1d1-9b77397335f4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Affordable and enjoyable is the best way to describe the Dayton Audio B652 bookshelf speakers.
