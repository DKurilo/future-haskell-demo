Our device ran a lot hotter than others when set at regular temperatures, but you can easily adjust the temperature dials to prevent your food from burning. It doesn&#39;t have some of the conveniences offered by the best toaster ovens, however, the beautiful exterior, large interior and five cooking settings make this a great option for any kitchen.","This convection toaster oven is a Walmart Exclusive, so you will need to purchase it at a brick and mortar store or on Walmart&#39;s website. It is very affordable, selling for a little under $40. We were able to find it on Amazon, but it was selling for $12 more at time of publishing. Either way, it is the least expensive six-slice toaster oven in our review.","This Oster performed as well as expected in our testing, but it didn&#39;t perform as well as the top products in our comparison. During the bread test, all six slices came out equally toasted. In our bagel testing, most of the slices came out the same color except for one in the back that burned a little darker. So, for the most part, this toast oven cooked food equally across the rack.","The burrito test fared well, cooking thoroughly, but the tortilla itself burned slightly and felt a little dry compared to others we tested. When we baked cookies, the exterior was golden brown and slightly too crisp but when we bit into them, we discovered that the inside was still very doughy. It took us a few minutes longer to get the insides cooked but by then the outsides were burned. Finally, the pizza slices we reheated were overcooked on top with the pepperoni being burnt around the edges. The crust also came out dry and hard. We did notice that the interior temperature ran about 20 degrees hotter than what we had set it to, which could contribute to the food being drying and hard. While you can adjust the temperature and find the perfect settings with practice, we docked the score on this toaster oven because of its poor cooking performance at the manufacturer designated temperatures.","This device only comes with one rack, but it can be placed in three different positions to get further or closer to the heating elements. While this unit has a very chic look to it, it doesn&#39;t feature a touchpad or display screen but rather uses dials. The timer can be set up to 60 minutes or you can turn the knob counter clockwise to the stay on setting if you wish it cook for longer periods. This device can set the temperature anywhere between 250 and 450 degrees Fahrenheit, and you can choose between five different cook settings: Warm, Broil, Bake, Toast and Turbo. Turbo basically initiates the convection fan for more even and thorough cooking. The oven has one of the shortest cords in our comparisons, measuring only 24.5 inches. You&#39;ll need to place it closer to an outlet and keep the area around the oven free from objects that could melt or catch fire.","We found it easy to remove and replace the crumb tray when cleaning. However, the interior of this toaster oven is not stick-resistant so you might have to work hard to remove some food debris. While it comes with a baking pan, it doesn&#39;t come with a broiling rack, which limits some of your cooking options. If you&#39;d prefer a toaster oven that comes with a broiling rack you might be interested in <a href=\"/black-decker-cto6335s-review\">Black + Decker CTO6335S</a>.","Oster covers this toaster with the best warranty in our comparison, spanning five years. This toaster oven can take a lot of use and is covered if something goes wrong during that time. As part of our safety inspection, we measured the exterior temperatures of this device after it had been heating at 350 degrees for several minutes. The backside got up to 116 degrees while the top and sides reached 178 degrees. This is by no means the hottest toaster oven we found, but it is pretty hot so you&#39;ll want to handle it with care. Like most other toaster ovens, the handle stays cooler so you can grasp it without fear of burning your fingers."]},"id":"82b4a81c-e26f-4dc7-a693-d344f01ca55a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d0535bbc-b5ec-432a-9c25-2a2b9af1b33c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It might not be the best toaster oven in our comparison, but overall it works well once you figure out the right settings and it can cook a large amount of food at once.
