The metal casing and internal structure makes it more durable than the average tower fan with plastic casing, and the unit weighs just under 18 pounds.

This fan does come with an integrated handle that makes it easy to reposition the fan.

This allows the Crane to remain partly hidden in a room when you are facing it, and hides the grille, making the tower fan more attractive.","While the Crane looks great and is remarkably quiet for a tower fan of its size, it does lack the strength other large tower fans have. This is disappointing, as Crane says this fan can move air at a rate of 2,500 CFM (cubic feet per minute), which is a much higher rate than most tower fans. It does move a lot of air, but if you are looking for a fan with strength in its breeze, then you may want to consider a shorter fan with a similar CFM rating. That being said, this fan does a great job providing a gentle cooling breeze that is perfect for homes and offices that just need increased airflow without the noise."]},"id":"316ae787-5947-42e1-b91c-42cec516d2c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Functionality"},"id":"50327b39-fe6e-49cb-9e42-950bc9285ecf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/F5Ncip4bTfS3mRbybhimWb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Crane really shines in help and support.
