Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Tatung looks good, works well, especially with foods requiring higher temperatures, and gives you several power and temperature settings.","Are you in the market for a great-looking and fully functional induction cooktop? Then it is a good idea to check out the handsome Tatung 1502MU Induction Cooker with its microcrystal ceramic surface, fast cooking capabilities and numerous helpful features.","This <a href=\"/best-hot-plates\">hot plate</a> is black with a white, almost sparkly finish on top, circular decals on the top surface showing the heating area and a silver control panel with push-button power and an LED display.","When we tested this electric hot plate, it brought water to a full boil in 5:24 minutes, the third-fastest speed of all the hot plates we evaluated. The Tatung can a good choice if you are craving pasta and want it as soon as possible, or if you need to quickly heat water for instant oatmeal or if you simply must have a pot of piping hot tea.","However, our testing with chocolate produced some mixed results. We melted chocolate using the standard kitchen technique of improvising a double boiler with a glass bowl positioned just above some water in a pot. We placed 4 ounces of chocolate chips in the bowl and waited. It took longer than any electric hot plate in our product line-up to melt the chocolate – 23:57 minutes.","Melting chocolate can be a bit troublesome since you do not want to heat it too fast or at too high a temperature. If you do those things, the result is clumpy and unappetizing and you run the risk of burning it, so melting chocolate slowly is the best approach.","However, the Tatung&#39;s chocolate melting time was somewhat disappointing since it took so long. However, we did end up with nicely melted chocolate that was silky and smooth, and it tasted fine.","The results for testing crepes also were a mixed bag. We used a traditional crepe batter and nonstick spray in a pan. The crepe was smooth and cooked all the way through, but there was very little browning, leaving it looking a bit like a pale omelet. However, the crepe tasted perfectly fine.","The Tatung is a nicely sized hot plate for cooking, measuring 13.6 inches long, 11.1 inches wide and 2.4 inches high. Its cooking surface is 7.5 inches in diameter. You get a 57-inch cord with it, and the unit weighs 5.2 pounds.","It provides temperatures ranging from 140–392 degrees Fahrenheit, and you get nine power settings. It is easy to control the temperature since this device presents push-button controls and a digital control panel. A helpful timer can assist with cooking, reminding you when to add an ingredient or stir, and this induction hot plate features an automatic shut-off capability.","You get another great safety feature with its nonskid feet that keeps it firmly in place on a tabletop or countertop. Another safety feature is its automatic shut-off capability.","This induction cooktop is covered by a one-year warranty and the company will repair or replace your electric hot plate if it shows defects after normal use."]},"id":"44182cb1-70fc-4c8e-b6fc-221368808b3c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"063be09b-f739-48d3-81ca-877e8248d9eb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Tatung does not brown crepes very well and takes an exceptionally long time to melt chocolate, but it heats fast when you need high heat, and everything we made turned out to be tasty.
