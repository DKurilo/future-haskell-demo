You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The 3M PocketProjector MP160 is an average <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">mini projector</a>. Though it doesn&#39;t have the best picture quality, it is still fairly decent and will work when you are giving a presentation on the go. The built-in speaker and decent battery life are added benefits that almost make up for the low brightness level. Overall, this product does have a few things going for it.","The picture quality of this mini projector could be a little better when it comes to the brightness, only 30 ANSI lumens, but the image size, 10 to 80 inches, is quite respectable. We were also pleased to see that although the native resolution is only 800 x 600 it is compatible up to 1044 x 900. This might make up for the fact that you need to have a fairly dark room in order to see what is being projected.","There are a couple of different options for connectivity on this product, although there is only one port. This mini projector comes with two cables that enable you to hook up devices: a composite video cable and a VGA cable. We were pleased to see that there is a separate port for the power cord. The battery in this mini projector only takes three hours to charge and will last upwards of three hours, though that does depend somewhat on the settings.","The other features of this mini projector include a 20,000-hour lamp life, which is very respectable, especially when you consider how many presentations that covers. There is also a 0.75 W speaker. This is handy when you don&#39;t want to worry about packing speakers as well as your computer and laptop projector. The overall size of the unit is 5.9 x 2.5 x 1.2 inches, and it only weighs 0.7 pounds, making this a true pocket projector. The last feature we found useful on this projector was the fact that it comes with a tripod. This is a great addition when you don&#39;t know how your room is going to be set up. Now you don&#39;t have to fret about the screen being in an awkward position or the table being too short.","This mini projector is easy to use but doesn&#39;t have the same capabilities as we&#39;ve seen in other products. When a device is hooked up to the mobile projector, it will immediately register and just show what is on the screen of the device. It isn&#39;t meant to act as a media player. The buttons located on the top of the unit only consist of volume, power and battery. This unit doesn&#39;t come with a remote, which isn&#39;t a bad thing, but it does limit the control of the projector. We never had any problem working this projector during our testing."]},"id":"8caf4764-1fcd-4a39-9239-b387ef1433ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"67c76af4-6862-4279-b036-96dfca31f6a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The 3M PocketProjector MP160 is a typical mini projector that works well.
