These well-designed Gigaset phones are not only attractive devices, but include the DECT 6.0 sound quality and Gigaset&#39;s High Sound Performance.","Of the Gigaset A phone series, the all-black Gigaset A510A-2B is a practical cordless phone with 12.5 hours of battery life and 25 minutes for message recordings. You also get a remarkable 20 hours of talk time.","There is no Bluetooth capability with this home phone, which detracts from its overall appeal since cell phones are so popular and the link-to-cell capability adds such value to cordless phones.","This model comes with two handsets, one for the base and an extra one, and you can add more – but unfortunately, you are limited to only two more, which could be a decided drawback for many households or businesses.","One helpful feature is the headset speakerphone that makes talking without holding a phone receiver a breeze as you go about household- or business-related tasks and still communicate with anyone with whom you need to converse.","The Gigaset A510A-2B cordless phone offers conferencing capability, an alarm clock with a snooze setting that will make the ringer go off at five-minute intervals, and a handset silent setting. You can make calls internally and transfer calls to another handset.","The phonebook handles 150 names and numbers while the caller ID can hold 25. You have a 10-number redial function with this cordless phone.","For help and support, you can consult the user guide that comes with these cordless phones. You can also download it from the company website, where you also can access frequently asked questions.","If you need other help, Siemens Gigaset provides email and phone support. There is no live chat, which would be a highly beneficial tool for many consumers if they need to get answers quickly to any difficulties they might be having with their phones. This phone comes with a two-year warranty, which is double the typical warranty for cordless phones."]},"id":"12404ebb-a273-4e6d-8be6-39d0cc7bbd3e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"286474c0-eec2-4b7b-af56-3cc9e8dcb22e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Siemens Gigaset A510A-2B presents outstanding talk time and battery life and a number of helpful features.
