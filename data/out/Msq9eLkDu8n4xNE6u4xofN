You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Timex Cycle Trainer 2.0 is an affordable <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-bike-gps\">bike GPS</a> with good functionality, including training software integration and compatibility with ANT+ sensors.","The Cycle Trainer displays data through five screens you scroll through to navigate the device.","You can customize these screens to display up to six pieces of data each. This means you can customize one screen to show your basic cycle data, another to show your heartbeat and pedal statistics, another to display waypoint navigation, and so on. This is useful because you have a great wealth of data readily available without having to scroll through multiple menus to find it.","Like other GPS-enabled bike computers, the Cycle Trainer uses data supplied by GPS satellites to display your speed, distance traveled, time of ride and other related basic information.","Because the Cycle Trainer is compatible with ANT+ sensors, it can communicate wirelessly with heart rate, speed and cadence sensors to display their data. You&#39;ll find this useful for training purposes, because you can make sure you&#39;re staying with the parameters of your optimum heart rate, power and cadence levels.","The Cycle Trainer uses a pressure-based altimeter to determine your altitude and a magnetic compass to find your heading. Although cycling computers are capable of using satellite information to determine this data, real-time GPS data can be off by tens of feet; this local means of gathering data gives you information that is more precise. This precision will be important if you&#39;re a competitive cyclist and need to know exact ride data while on the bike. GPS-based altimeters correct to exact levels when you upload data post-ride, but in-ride the pressure-based altimeter and magnetic compass will be more accurate.","The Cycle Trainer&#39;s navigation feature is disappointing, because you must manually program waypoints into the device or software to build a route. Other bike GPS units allow you to draw routes over a map and transfer them as a file, but the Cycle Trainer doesn&#39;t have this feature. Manually programming waypoints into the software or device is tedious, and it&#39;s often more trouble than the navigation is worth.","The Cycle Trainer comes with a Training Peaks account, which is excellent training software. However, Cycle Trainer exports files in a format not supported by Strava, the popular online cycling community. You can convert the Cycle Trainer files to be compatible with Strava, but this is an unnecessary and frustrating in-between step."]},"id":"016ad288-fd90-4701-9fce-a0b07905459b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b69813eb-a8d3-446a-bf89-daae8dba4027","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Timex Ironman Cycle Trainer 2 is an affordable mid-level bicycle GPS that has excellent value and functionality.
