And if you re using an <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-seo-tools-and-rank-trackers/\">SEO software</a> product for your internet marketing, you re probably carefully monitoring and hopefully optimizing your Adwords  performance.","But like all things marketing, Adwords isn t for everyone. Just because it s hot and all your friends are doing it, doesn t mean it will make business sense for you. Many companies delve into Google Adwords, only to throw in the towel a short while later. For a variety of reasons, they don t get the return on investment they think they should.","Here are some ways to know if Google Adwords is or isn t for you."]},"id":"deac1020-9656-40ac-bbf5-90dcd79b7a84","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Think like a customer</strong><br/>Your customers are probably using the web to find you or companies like you. But if you re simply using your company name as your keywords, you re missing out. Organic search will almost always take care of that just fine, thank you very much. I just Googled a large organization by their name. The first listing was their Adwords ad. The second was their organic homepage listing.","Without thinking, I clicked on the Adwords ad. How many others are clicking on the ad instead of the organic listing? And how much unnecessary money is that costing the company? Are you in that position?","If your customers already knows your name, they don t need Adword s help in finding you.","So think like a customer and make sure your keywords are what s driving buyers. Any good SEO software product can help you with that and most of them will integrate with Adwords.","By the way, Adwords also uses the business-as-a-keyword model. Their ads pop up when you Google  Adwords  and  Google Adwords.  But they can afford it. They get a pretty sweet deal. ","<strong>Have the stomach<br/></strong>If you re going to really benefit from Adwords, you ll need to be prepared to spend what it will take to get the clicks and move the dial. If you re in a highly competitive industry, this means you ll need ample budget to get results.","Sure, a good Adwords strategy works to lower cost per click (CPC) and increase your overall ad quality score. But you ll still need to spend enough to make success happen. If you re pinching pennies and your competitors have big budgets and smart campaigns, you re in for a battle. One that you may not win. ","<strong>Make the time<br/></strong>The reason you use a top SEO software product is because you don t want to spare the countless hours finessing and tweaking your Adwords strategy. Sure, we get that. But you still need to monitor progress and ensure you re strategy is reaching your audience. Someone from your team will need to commit to at least high level involvement in this campaign.","<strong>Measure (and Broadly)<br/></strong>That takes us to the next step. Adwords will show you your conversion ratios, but often it s not that simple. You need to track inbound leads that come in through your website, phone lines, and through your front doors.","Especially if you re in a service business, many customers will look around and evaluate you. They may come back to your website or call your office for more information. These customers may have first learned of you from your pay-per-click ad, or been influenced by it, but it may have been your website or customer service team that sealed the deal. So take these spikes into consideration when measuring the success of your Adwords campaign.","<strong>Is it for you?<br/></strong>Don t get me wrong. For many of you, Google Adwords is a very smart move. It can drive well qualified traffic if you do it well. But it s not a silver bullet and it s not a replacement for an organic SEO web strategy."]},"id":"8524b349-3fa1-466a-9d97-924cca2d08af","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4783","url":"/when-to-use-google-adwords","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"becky-sheetz-runkle","url":"/author/becky-sheetz-runkle","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Becky Sheetz-Runkle","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"237HigvJqt9DW93qktfagF","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-17T18:46:19Z","datePublished":"2010-08-17T18:46:19Z","name":"When to Use Google Adwords","synopsis":"If you have an online marketing strategy, there’s a good chance that Google Adwords is an important part of it.","review":{},"strapline":"If you have an online marketing strategy, there’s a good chance that Google Adwords is an important part of it.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-13T23:02:15Z","id":"mvUt8Jrqt8xZJL6GPR9UHD","meta":{"title":"When to Use Google Adwords","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
