You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Netgear was the first manufacturer to make a DOCSIS 3.1 modem: the Netgear CM1000. This ultra-fast <a href=\"/best-cable-modems\">modem</a> delivers existing DOCSIS 3.0 data through 32 downstream channels and eight upstream channels. That is twice the channel bonding capacity of the <a href=\"/motorola-mb7420-review\">Motorola MB 7420</a>, the recommended high-speed modem in our buying guide.","The CM1000 is capable of download speeds of 1.2 Gbps and upload speeds of 304 Mbps. This performance upgrade will be noticeable for someone who is currently renting an 8 x 4 modem from their ISP.","When the DOCSIS 3.1 standard becomes available in your area, you will need a modem capable of delivering the upgraded bandwidth. While providers like Google have to build new fiber-optic infrastructure, cable companies can deliver the DOCSIS 3.1 standard through existing cable lines. Because of this, they can make the upgrade available to populous areas quicker and cheaper.","The Netgear CM1000’s back panel has a simple design that includes one Gigabit Ethernet connection, the coaxial connection, reset button, power input and power switch. The power switch sits below the coaxial connection, so if you place it against a wall, the cable could push into the switch.","The icon indicator LEDs are on the front panel hidden behind an aluminum strip. This makes the modem look elegant, but it is hard to see the indicator lights from across a large room.","There are five indicator LEDs on the front panel:"]},"id":"f4622ffb-edea-42ed-85d5-db5fdd479c01","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Power:</strong> Green LED indicates power is supplied to the modem.
