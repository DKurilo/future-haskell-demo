If you&#39;re looking for a cheap <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> that has all the safety features you need but doesn&#39;t have all the other bells and whistles, the Evenflo Nurture is a great option.","The Evenflo Nurture has all the safety features we look for in car seats. Like all other car seats, it is crash tested and offers side impact protection. It also utilizes a five-point harness and energy-absorbent foam to keep your baby safe in an accident. Its LATCH connectors make it simple to install in most cars, and its level indicators will help you position the seat at the perfect angle. Unfortunately, it does not have a reclining seat or base, so you&#39;ll have to use old phone books if you need to adjust the angle.","The biggest problem with the Nurture is its limited weight range. It only supports newborns as light as 5 pounds, so some premature babies will be too light for this car seat. Also, the maximum weight and height is 22 pounds and 29 inches, so you may have to find a new rear-facing car seat by the time your child is a year old.","The seat comes with a stay-in-car base, an adjustable harness and installation instructions. You can install the seat without a base if you need, and it is FAA approved for air travel. Best of all, the cushions are machine washable. Unfortunately, this infant car seat is not compatible with any other Evenflo strollers, so you won&#39;t be able to pop the carrier out of the base and transfer it quickly to a stroller. Also, the canopy is shorter than we like and gets in the way of the carry handle.","Evenflo offers a three-month warranty, which is much shorter than most other car seats we reviewed. You can download a new user manual online, and the website provides phone and email support. We were able to get answers to our questions very quickly."]},"id":"81b882a6-013d-42dd-aed9-dcdba900efce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1fe436f7-9a10-427e-b4ea-6e4f7a82ff24","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Evenflo Nurture may be a cheap baby car seat, but it meets all of the federal safety requirements.
