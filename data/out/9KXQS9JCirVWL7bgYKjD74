Cooking time is 3.5 minutes, which is slightly longer than average but not as lengthy as other donut makers.","It achieves a high safety rating for the inclusion of a locking lid latch, which prevents accidental spillage, and convenient cord storage. The unit is also designed with non-skid rubber feet. These safety features are somewhat overshadowed by the fact it comes with no bonus accessories and only two suggested recipes in the included user guide.","This electric donut maker comes equipped with a non-stick cooking surface, however during testing, we had difficulty removing all seven cooked donuts with ease. This caused the donut maker to score low in the area of post-cooking cleanup time. Additionally, it failed to cook donuts evenly. Donuts that were cooked in the outer molds were overbaked and dry. By comparison, donuts cooked in the center mold were evenly brown and moist.","All of the best donut makers not only perform well, but they also come with manufacturer warranties that protect you against the possibility of equipment failure and defects in workmanship. The New DM-6/2389 donut maker comes with no manufacturer warranty and no avenues for receiving product help and support. For this reason, if you’re planning on purchasing the New DM-6/2389 donut maker, first contact the selling retailer to check if they offer an extended return policy. Depending on where you buy it, you may be able to purchase an extended warranty directly from the retailer."]},"id":"de324e5a-0133-4e90-a717-832f5dd6de46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"87a1da70-8d06-44d5-988b-7dd1945094b6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A top-notch ranking in the area of safety features gives the New DM-6/2389 home donut machine all the necessary components to ensure minimal risk of injury when baking.
