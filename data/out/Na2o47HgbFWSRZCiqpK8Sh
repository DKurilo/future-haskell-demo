However, we were disappointed to see that this DVD copy software lacks the ability to copy DVDs to CDs. Other omissions that kept this application out of award-winning territory include the lack of built-in CSS decryption capabilities and the ability to convert DVD movies into formats playable on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.","CloneDVD offers in its DVD copy software package the ability to copy all the menus, subtitles and bonus features to two discs or compress it to fit onto one disc, or you can just copy the main movie to a single disc. CloneDVD also removes region codes, supports multiple languages, does not require an ASPI driver, has episodic DVD support, and supports Windows 8, 7, Vista and XP configurations. One useful configuration option is a &#34;visual quality bar&#34; that shows how choosing Windows 7 or Vista will affect your movie quality.","For those just beginning to dabble in DVD burning, CloneDVD is a good jumping-off point. CloneDVD&#39;s interface is not the simplest, but it still has some great features and does have simple instructions for various burning steps. Two different tutorials are recent additions to the SlySoft website. The first tutorial is &#34;How to clone a DVD movie using CloneDVD&#34;; the next is &#34;How to convert a DVD movie using CloneDVD mobile.&#34; These tutorials offer step-by-step instructions to help beginners get started.","This DVD copy software is very easy to install, but unfortunately, in order for the product installation to even be worth the effort, you must download a CSS decryptor first. After going through the entire DVD copying processes, all you want is a perfect DVD copy. Well, with CloneDVD, that is exactly what you will get. The quality of the DVD copy was superb, and it only took an hour to complete."]},"id":"d7568c71-a034-4020-b8e8-764ff010eb9f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d2b16f17-0a69-4522-a69b-f8065cebb867","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, SlySoft CloneDVD 2 is a solid DVD copy software application.
