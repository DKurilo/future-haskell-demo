It is just 0.2 inches thick, and its circular shape resembles a drink coaster. Because of its compact size, it is the best wireless charger to take with you on the go. Despite its thinness, it still is mighty. It  has a power output of 5 volts, so  it takes a little more than 3 hours to charge a smartphone. The device will still charge through a case if your phone uses one.","Unfortunately, Anker doesn&#39;t include an AC adapter with its wireless charger. A microUSB cable is in the box. It&#39;s about 3 feet long, which offers plenty of slack to plug it in your outlet. Because the charger uses microUSB, you&#39;ll be able to easily switch or replace the cables if need be.","This inductive charger is Qi-compatible, so it will work with several phones. However, when you lay your device down on the charging mat, sometimes it doesn&#39;t begin to charge right away. You may have to play around with it to get the coils to line up properly.","The charger is black and sleek. It looks great and blends nicely with tables and countertops. It is made of plastic, and  it won&#39;t slide around much, thanks to the rubber-like dots that are on its underside. It also has an LED light, which flashes blue and green when your device is charging. When it isn&#39;t charging, the light is solid blue, meaning it&#39;s in standby mode, ready to begin charging.","Anker offers an 18-month warranty with its wireless charger. Most manufacturers only offer a one-year warranty. You&#39;ll also fine email, telephone support and a FAQs section on the company website."]},"id":"473cc2c9-ffde-4478-a673-bdedb79f4327","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ca841082-b155-406a-bef9-47bf65be01a7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Anker&#39;s Ultra-Slim charger is a gorgeous, minimalist charger.
