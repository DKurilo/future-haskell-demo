This is a large drain on time and money. In fact, studies have shown that manually entering data comprises over half of accounting tasks. <a href=\"/best-billing-and-invoice-software\">Accounting software</a>, however, has become increasingly better at automating these tasks, so much so that many in the accounting industry are concerned about being replaced by machines.","You may not want a machine to completely take over your accounting department – especially if you’re a &#34;Terminator&#34; fan – but here are four automation trends you can take advantage of rather easily.","<strong>1.\tOptical character recognition: </strong>Many accounting programs are compatible with character recognition devices, and the software has grown more sophisticated. That means instead of keying in bills from your vendors or keeping all those receipts and hand-typing in the information, you may be able to scan or feed them into a OCR machine, and let the machine not only copy the information but put it in the correct places in your accounting software. Some systems include receipt apps that allow you to snap a picture of a receipt with your phone and upload it to the software, which saves the image and adds the data from it to an expense report.","Many OCR programs can also pull information from PDFs. Some programs may include simple rules, such as ensuring specific figures are correct and flagging errors. Thus, these programs can be your first line of defense against costly errors. For example, an accounts payable clerk might scan in a vendor&#39;s invoice and then verify that the data uploaded correctly rather than spend his or her time keying in the entire bill.","<strong>2.\tAll-in-one solutions, integrations and API capabilities:</strong> Of course, as we continue to innovate in payment technologies, the need for paper records decreases. Many accounting programs are keeping up with this trend by allowing integrations with other programs for invoicing, point-of-sale systems, inventory and payroll. Thus, it’s possible for your customer to pay for something using their credit card on your POS register and for it to automatically populate into your bookkeeping software as profit for the day. By the same token, if you run low on a product, your inventory software can alert you, forecast future inventory needs and, in some cases, automatically send out the purchase order, then record the payment to your bookkeeping.","These capabilities aren&#39;t present in all accounting programs yet, but there is a growing number of all-in-one solutions. Plus, many programs offer add-ons or apps, and API capability for integrating programs.","<strong>3.\tCloud solutions and apps: </strong>Cloud-based storage has enabled people to access their files or programs from anywhere, and companies are capitalizing on that by creating apps that let you run your programs on your smartphone or tablet as well as a computer. FreshBooks and QuickBooks are among the most popular programs to offer mobile apps, but a majority of programs are moving to this. You may be able to scan a receipt, make a sale and generate an invoice that you can email to your customer, or transfer money via a mobile wallet to a vendor and have that information populate to your accounting program in real time.","<strong>4.\tAutomation of repetitive tasks: </strong>Already, accounting and billing software can do simple automated tasks like recurring bills, and, as noted above, some can do more complex tasks, like flag low inventory and place an order. Some can also be configured to automatically send reminders to customers with outstanding invoices.","While technology makes it easy to automate simple tasks like data entry or recurring billing, it cannot replace more complex and creative tasks like setting goals, interpreting reports, and factoring in human emotions and preferences that influence the future of any company. “Robot accountants” can indeed make your business practice easier, but they cannot take over all your business practices, even when it comes to the numbers."]},"id":"d50c075c-e59c-461b-8d79-680ffdb75e3d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10214","url":"/automate-accounting","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T13:42:07Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T13:42:07Z","name":"Is Automation the Answer to Your Small Business Accounting Needs?","synopsis":"The days of green-shaded, double-entry accounting books are long gone, but many people still depend on paper receipts and transfer data from one program to another by hand.","review":{},"strapline":"The days of green-shaded, double-entry accounting books are long gone, but many people still depend on paper receipts and transfer data from one program to another by hand.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-04-14T16:59:54Z","id":"7w2mLWdGJAxEV7gzBo5uY6","meta":{"title":"Is Automation the Answer to Your Small Business Accounting Needs?","description":"It&rsquo;s easier than ever to automate many of your accounting tasks, saving you time and money.
