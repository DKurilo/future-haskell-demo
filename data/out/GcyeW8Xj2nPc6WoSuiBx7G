Speedo also has a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof camera</a> to add to its collection of products. The Speedo Waterproof Digital Camera has a 5-megapixel resolution and captures underwater movies and still images.","It operates in depths up to 10 feet and takes photos above the surface, so you can get shots poolside or at the beach. Equipped with an 8X digital image zoom, the camera will get acceptable close-up shots for computer viewing. However, with the relatively low resolution, some images won’t be suitable for printing. This camera is equipped with a built-in flash, so you can use it in the dark and low light settings.","The camera is equipped with a dedicated scenery button that helps analyze the type of condition you are shooting in. You will also appreciate its video mode that allows you to make movies with sound. You can record children running through the sprinklers or jumping off of a diving board and capture their laughter at the same time.","The Speedo Waterproof Digital Camera comes with a built-in rechargeable battery and AC adapter. The 32MB of internal memory is more than you will get with most cameras in its class; however, you will still need to buy more memory, such as an SDHC memory card, to store more than just a few photos.","The most impressive feature of this camera is its innovative design. The rubberized grip with rounded edges makes it easy to handle. Its lightweight construction enables it to float on top of the water, and its lime green color is easy to spot if it escapes from your hand.  It has a 2.4-inch LCD screen for easy viewing.","The Speedo website has a toll free telephone number if you need customer service. If you have questions about this underwater camera, you can browse the FAQs page. Unfortunately, you will not find an online manual or live chat. For technical questions regarding this camera you will be directed to a long distance telephone number for assistance."]},"id":"893767a6-2329-4e7c-bf0b-bf7f28c2b14c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"92a6d299-d2cb-4a61-9992-1473ed0c8dde","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Speedo Waterproof camera is a worry-free camera that floats on the water.
