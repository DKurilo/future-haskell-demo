This system is powerful and efficient, but blending the small satellite speakers with the powerful subwoofer can be difficult.","The Klipsch HD subwoofer does nothing short of impress, especially considering that packaged subwoofers generally aren&#39;t very powerful. This 5.1 home theater system&#39;s subwoofer has an impressive frequency range of 33Hz to 200Hz. The 33Hz is the lowest tone produced by any subwoofer we reviewed, and the 100 watts of power impressively drive the subwoofer to produce floor-rattling bass tones. The 8-inch down-firing driver is made up of a fiber-composite cone surrounded by an all-black enclosure. The subwoofer is rear ported, so be sure to give it a little space away from a wall so the port has room to push air.","The four satellite speakers have a glossy black finish that looks sharp and modern. Within the sleek enclosures are 2.5-inch long-throw IMG woofers. The IMG woofers that Klipsch includes in many of its speaker systems are highly efficient, producing powerful audio that is crisp and clean.","Unfortunately, the small 2.5-inch drivers don&#39;t have the capacity to handle mid-bass range as well as larger drivers. It can be difficult to blend the powerful subwoofer with such small satellite speakers without hearing a gap in frequency response. Setting the crossover frequency on the subwoofer to a high number, 120Hz to 150Hz, helps bridge the gap between the speakers.","The center speaker has two highly efficient 2.5 IMG drivers and a 0.75-inch aluminum dome tweeter between them. The two long-throw drivers help pick up where the satellite speakers leave off. The extra driver helps produce upper bass extension and bridge the gap between the small satellites and the strong subwoofer.","The speakers are covered by a five-year warranty, but the electronics, such as the subwoofer&#39;s onboard amplifier, is only covered up to two years. You can contact Klipsch via email or phone if you need further assistance with your home speaker system."]},"id":"74f1d60a-6e38-4d27-94a3-3a92b7c0f1c7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bd8af2e8-4f7d-498e-ab2a-ffe09f2f733c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Klipsch HD Theater 600 is sleek and modern, and fits in great with just about any home decor.
