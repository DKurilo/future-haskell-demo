At the end of our evaluation, our top pick was the <a href=\"/honda-review\">Honda HRX</a>. Of all the mowers we reviewed, it scored the best marks in our performance tests. It has a variable self-propulsion system that you control with a simple flick of your thumb. It cuts a 21-inch path, which cuts down on the number of passes needed to cut your entire lawn. And it has a 2.5-bushel discharge bag, so youâ€™ll have to empty your bag less often compared with other mowers."]},"id":"771a217d-ee96-4b24-bdad-a751865b4053","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_34","url":"/best-gas-lawn-mowers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-26T14:24:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-26T14:24:00Z","name":"Best Gas Lawn Mowers of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best self-propelled (walk-behind) gas mowers, ranked by their cutting performance, conveniences, design and warranty.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best self-propelled (walk-behind) gas mowers, ranked by their cutting performance, conveniences, design and warranty.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-10T20:12:33Z","id":"ApatUp287tmERPCKLK3c88","meta":{"title":"Best Gas Lawn Mowers 2019 - Self-Propelled, Walk-Behind Mowers","description":"Here are the best self-propelled (walk-behind) gas mowers, ranked by their cutting performance, conveniences, design and warranty."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LFbpRtfZgPR7WFeJ3UPgWb.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Lawn-Mowers-Gas-003-5-.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/C/Z/822131/original/Hero-Lawn-Mowers-Gas-003-5-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","id":"LFbpRtfZgPR7WFeJ3UPgWb","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LFbpRtfZgPR7WFeJ3UPgWb.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Gas Lawn Mowers of 2019","description":"Here are the best self-propelled (walk-behind) gas mowers, ranked by their cutting performance, conveniences, design and warranty."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LFbpRtfZgPR7WFeJ3UPgWb.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Lawn-Mowers-Gas-003-5-.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/C/Z/822131/original/Hero-Lawn-Mowers-Gas-003-5-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","id":"LFbpRtfZgPR7WFeJ3UPgWb","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LFbpRtfZgPR7WFeJ3UPgWb.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Gas Lawn Mowers of 2019","description":"Here are the best self-propelled (walk-behind) gas mowers, ranked by their cutting performance, conveniences, design and warranty."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"van-disable-sidebar","url":"/van-disable-sidebar","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","name":"van-disable-sidebar","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","id":"LA6eRKa38msqSWJs5yh98Z","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"control","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pgid_24fbd613","url":"/pgid_24fbd613","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","name":"pgid_24fbd613","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:38Z","id":"KqMMMsc2EvtK4wreSNrkGW","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"control","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
