You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","As a high-end remote car starter system, the Viper Color OLED 2-Way Security Plus <a href=\"/best-remote-car-starters\">Remote Start System</a> has a high price point, but it offers an array of both basic and advanced features. It has an OLED screen, a long range and can manage multiple vehicles.","The Viper Color OLED 2-Way Security Plus Remote Start System has a range of one mile in optimal conditions, so it gives you ample time to get your engine warm and car interior comfortable before you reach it. The remote alerts you when you go in and out of range. This model features a color OLED screen that has a 160-degree viewing angle and anti-glare coating so you can view it even in direct sunlight. You receive text and icon status updates on the screen, including a variety of icons for faults, lock status and battery level. It tells you the temperature of the vehicle&#39;s interior, and you can set the remote to switch off once the interior reaches a specified temperature. If the temperature is below 55 degrees when you start the engine, the remote starter turns on the heating and defrost functions automatically.","This automatic car starter is compatible with the SmartStart app, allowing you to use your smartphone as a controller. It has a failsafe starter kill that acts as an immobilizer and prevents hot-wiring for added security. The six-tone siren increases in volume depending on the issue it detects. If, for example, your car receives a light impact, the alarm chirps, while if it receives a heavy impact or detects a break-in attempt, the volume and tone increases dramatically.","To prevent you getting a parking ticket, this remote car starter alerts you 15 and five minutes before your parking meter expires and at the exact time the meter expires. This model features valet mode and uses speed sensing to prevent over-revving. The remote controls charge via USB, which saves money on batteries but can be problematic if you forget to charge them.","The Viper Color OLED 2-Way Security Plus Remote Start System offers good value, with security features to keep your car safe, automatic defrost and a color OLED screen. It provides a range of status alerts to keep you informed and is compatible with SmartStart."]},"id":"0effcecb-49a1-4430-84d6-e8e32f1739f0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63682","url":"/viper-oled-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T15:23:07Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T15:23:07Z","name":"Viper OLED","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T15:23:07Z","id":"T44nP2eQRjb45hv7nCzq4K","meta":{"title":"Viper OLED Remote Car Starter Review","description":"The Viper OLED remote starter has a high price point, but it has an OLED screen, a long range and can manage multiple vehicles."},"products":[{"slug":"viper-oled","url":"/product/viper-oled","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","name":"Viper OLED","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","id":"A4ipqmm25MN3T6PFCfteT6","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mHB4SDke9PJeLXVkDfJjnX.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","mimeType":"","name":"63654-viper-oled-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63654-viper-oled-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","id":"mHB4SDke9PJeLXVkDfJjnX","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mHB4SDke9PJeLXVkDfJjnX.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Viper OLED Remote Car Starter Review","description":"The Viper OLED remote starter has a high price point, but it has an OLED screen, a long range and can manage multiple vehicles."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mHB4SDke9PJeLXVkDfJjnX.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","mimeType":"","name":"63654-viper-oled-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63654-viper-oled-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","id":"mHB4SDke9PJeLXVkDfJjnX","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mHB4SDke9PJeLXVkDfJjnX.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Viper OLED Remote Car Starter Review","description":"The Viper OLED remote starter has a high price point, but it has an OLED screen, a long range and can manage multiple vehicles."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/viper-oled-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"car-tech","url":"/travel-and-auto/car-tech","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","name":"Car Tech","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:04Z","id":"JteG32DMJqAaptK5hKu7Wk","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
