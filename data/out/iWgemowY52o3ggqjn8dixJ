You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Best Reader is a <a href=\"/best-speed-reading-software\">simple speed reading software</a> program that teaches standard speed techniques to those who prefer a no-frills approach to learning a new skill. The single-user software has a bit of a steep learning curve, but it provides good speed reading and eye-training exercises and tests to help you increase your reading speed and comprehension.","This software is ideal for those at intermediate or advanced reading levels, and is not geared toward younger users. Though it lacks a visually-appealing, modern interface, it offers classic speed reading text-based and eye-training exercises meant to strengthen your focus and field of view. Multiple reading speed and comprehension tests gauge your progress. It does not feature any educational games, however.","Of all the speed reading software we tested, this one was the most difficult to figure out how to use. As we tested it, we found that we did not like its exercises as much as those of the other software programs. They simply weren’t as intuitive or engaging. For more engaging exercises, we recommend our top pick, <a href=\"/7-speed-reading-review\">7 Speed Reading</a>.","You can put your newly-developed speed reading skills into practice by reading through the 90 eBooks included with this software. It also lets you import your own text. One other feature with this program is that you can adjust the word speed manually so that you can find a starting speed just right for you and then increase it as you progress. Text options let you customize the font settings so you can use a font that is comfortable and easy to read.","As you complete the exercises, the software displays sections of the practice text as highlighted word groups. This helps your eyes focus on a chunk of words at a time instead of seeing all the text on the screen.","This software program only allows for one user, which, if that is all you need, can be a good option. But if you are looking for speed-reading software for your organization, then one that allows for multiple users, like <a href=\"/acereader-review\">AceReader</a>, may be a better fit.","This software lets you take an initial speed assessment test to see your baseline reading speed. It also tracks your speed as you progress through the program so you can see your progress. It does not, however, record test scores."]},"id":"01381a36-e292-4bd5-b686-3e105e6133c9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"43475c19-eb6e-4214-b34b-0cdee1e842ad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Best Reader is a decent speed reading software that gets straight to the point, leaving off the frills.
