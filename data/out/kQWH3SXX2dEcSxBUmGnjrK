At 9.6 oz, this shoe weighs in on the lighter side of the trail running shoe spectrum, constructed of mesh upper, rubber outer sole and EVA midsole. Those nature lovers with passion for the environment will be pleased to know this Newton trail running shoe is not only vegan but also green, with 100 percent recycled laces, webbing, insole top and upper mesh.","This trail running shoe keeps it light thanks to components such as the open weave and breathable upper mesh. While not made from a waterproof material, the upper received a water-repellent coating to assist in keeping your foot dry.","The midsole of Newton Running&#39;s Action/Reaction Technology cushions the impact of each step you take on your run. The lugs in the outer sole retract slightly up into the EVA midsole as your foot comes down, taking in part of the shock and also bouncing your foot back upwards for a quick rebound, propelling you forward on your course.","On the test course, this lightweight trail running shoe beautifully danced over loose gravel, scattered stones and muddy sections with traction-backed confidence. While Active Junky does not recommend this model for novice runners, experienced trail runners will appreciate its ability to confront and tackle obstacles you may encounter on a less groomed trail. In all test scenarios, the Boco Sol come in with times up to 20 percent faster than its competition.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments: </strong>Even as I train for non-running activities, this shoe inspires me to push harder for higher performance levels. This shoe offers so much, even down to the laces that actually stay tied when navigating through underbrush.","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Innovation","<strong>Best For: </strong>Those explorers seeking more difficult objectives who need a top-performing shoe as well as those who are taking it easy while recovering from an injury.","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"9dfc9fe4-eda1-4a85-a4e1-8704e06edb9b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 9.6 oz","Drop: 3 mm","Upper: Mesh","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4166775e-5c28-4011-9ee0-4193b253f73f","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background: </strong>Based out of Boulder, Colorado, Newton Running is not surprisingly comprised of outdoor enthusiasts who love to run.
