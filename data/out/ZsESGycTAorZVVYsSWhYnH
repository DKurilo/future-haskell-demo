Though it is slightly limited in features – at least in comparison with the best slide converters – it is still a decent option since it’s also one of the least expensive models.","The scanner is a standalone device, meaning it’s not dependent on a computer connection to run and process your images. You can simply plug it into a power source and begin scanning. Like the <a href=\"/hammacher-schlemmer-review\">Hammacher Schlemmer Slide &amp; Negative to Digital Picture Converter</a>, it allows you to use an SD card up to 32GB, so you can easily transfer your images once they’re converted.","If your old media collection consists solely of 35 mm slides and negatives, then this converter is a decent option for you. However, the unit lacks the ability to process and digitize 110 and 126 slides or negatives, Super 8 film or physical prints. So, if your collection contains those formats as well, you’ll probably be better off considering another slide converter.","Despite being limited by its format compatibility, the FS-ONE comes with a variety of accessories that can help make your photo conversion process a bit simpler. The included cleaning brush can assist in removing dust and smudges on old slides, and basic image editing software allows you to apply more in-depth editing and polishing to your newly digitized images. You can apply those edits or even review your images on the built-in 2.4-inch TFT LCD screen, and there is a convenient TV-out jack located at the front of the device.","If you have a question or concern about using the slides to digital converter, you can contact the company by email. However, the company doesn’t provide live chat or over-the-phone options. The device measures 5 x 3.7 x 5.7 inches and weighs just 1 pound, the same as the <a href=\"/wolverine-titan-review\">Wolverine Titan</a>, so it’s plenty portable."]},"id":"febc1dd9-cc1f-4b26-80da-4695d809bc01","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8bcf81a0-c5fe-442e-b6a2-b299f2da6e6e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Zonoz FS-ONE converter is packed with features and accessories but lacks considerable format compatibility.
