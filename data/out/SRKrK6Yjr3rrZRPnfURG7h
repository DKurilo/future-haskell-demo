DeWALT DWE575SB is an impressive 7 1/4-inch <a href=\"/best-circular-saws\">circular saw</a> that has a great design, is easy to handle and comes with solid customer support. It is the one of the lightest tools in our review, which makes it easy to maneuver as you cut. It may not weigh much, but this DeWALT saw has little trouble ripping through 2x material and plywood quickly and effortlessly. It’s a great choice to take on the job site every day and real workhorse that you can count on.","This circular saw is one of the lightest in our review, weighing only 8.8 pounds. Its compact, light design makes it easy to handle and control as you rip through even the toughest materials. As with most sidewinder circular saws, the blade sits on the right-hand side, sacrificing some blade visibility for comfort and balance. Still, you can see enough of the blade to cut without having to lean over the tool.","One of the most frustrating problems when cutting with a circular saw is the sawdust that accumulates around the blade and the cutting line – it obscures your view and makes it difficult to cut in a clean, straight line. The DeWALT does an excellent job clearing sawdust from your work area so you don’t have to stop and remove it yourself in the middle of a cut.","This circular saw comes with a spindle lock – a helpful feature that locks the spindle in place, so you can use a single hex key to remove the blade. You have to use two wrenches to remove the blades on models that don’t have this feature.","The DeWALT DWE575SB comes with a soft carrying case to both protect the tool and make it easy to transport. The saw does not have a rip fence, a feature that helps you make uniform cuts quickly. However, you can purchase one separately on DeWALT&#39;s website. It has a 9-foot power cord, which is long enough to use when you don&#39;t have an extension cord readily available and you’re close to an outlet.","This tool can make cuts up to 2 9/16 inches deep at a 90-degree angle and 1 29/32 inches at a 45-degree angle. This is deep enough to cut through 2x material with ease. Its 57-degree bevel capacity is the highest in our review – you can make bevel cuts at angles anywhere between 0 and 57 degrees. The saw has two bevel stops, one at 22.5 degrees and the other at 45 degrees, which is convenient, as you will likely need to cut at these common angles at some point.","This 15-amp saw only spins the blade at up to 5200 rpm, which is one of the slowest max speeds in our review. The fastest was the <a href=\"/bosch-circular-saw-review\">Bosch CS5</a> at 6200 RPM. However, this saw still ripped through every material we put in its path with little or no difficulty. As with the other high-ranking circular saws in our review, this one runs on standard 120-volt electricity, and you can use a generator if you are working on a new site without grid power.","DeWALT offers an impressive three-year warranty, which protects your purchase against manufacturer defects. The saw comes with a paper copy of the user manual, but you can view and download a digital copy on the company’s website. The website also has a FAQs section where you can find answers to common questions, and you can contact the company through email or over the phone.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The DeWALT DWE575SB is one of the top circular saws in our review because of its compact design, cutting capacity and overall maneuverability. It’s a great choice for professionals looking for a solid tool for frequent use. It has a notably good dust chute that moves sawdust out of your cutting path, and although it only produces up to 5200 rpm, we had no trouble cutting tough materials quickly and smoothly during our hands-on testing."]},"id":"fe2bd45c-6c7d-486e-b102-6e9888c8a271","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64421","url":"/dewalt-dwe575sb-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
