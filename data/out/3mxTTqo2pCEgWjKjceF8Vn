Monoprice Select High-Speed <a href=\"/best-hdmi-cables\">HDMI cable</a> is certified by HDMI Licensing, LLC as a High-Speed HDMI Cable. This cable has everything you need for watching 1080p, 4K and 3D content. This is the best-value HDMI cable we looked at, thanks to its good build quality, strong feature list and affordable cost. This HDMI cable is a great option for most people. If you need to run an HDMI cable for distances more than 15 feet, then you may want to consider a cable with higher build quality like the <a href=\"/audioquest-high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable-review\">AudioQuest Pearl</a>.","This cable comes with Ethernet, as do many of the best HDMI cables. The technology provides an internet connection through the HDMI cable, which eliminates the need for a separate cable.","An HDMI cable with Ethernet only works with devices that are equipped to receive the technology. Although few devices are equipped with the technology at the time of this writing, we are confident that the technology will become the standard within the next few years.","The Monoprice Select gets points for being RoHS compliant, which indicates that it does not contain any harmful substances, such as lead. It also meets HDCP compliance standards, which means the cable includes a protocol that prevents the unauthorized duplication of copyrighted materials. This is required for viewing most high-definition content.","Monoprice&#39;s cable uses 24-karat gold plating on its connectors, which is common for the best HDMI cables on the market. It also includes triple shielding within the cable to prevent interference from electronic signals nearby. Noise on the line caused by interference can be an issue for long cables.","As a certified High-Speed HDMI Cable, the Monoprice Select has a bandwidth of at least 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second), which supports 1080p resolution. 1080p goes beyond yesterday&#39;s 8-bit RGB (red, green and blue) and displays the 16-bit deep color standards. The cable also supports 4K – four times the resolution of 1080p – and 3D. Beyond that, it has access to advanced color spaces, including sYCC601 and Adobe YCC601.","This cable has the capacity for surround-sound audio. It supports compressed formats that are represented by Dolby Digital and DTS, as well as the newer and more demanding lossless formats of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. The cable also keeps video and audio content in step for source material that uses HDMI Lip Sync technology.","The Monoprice Select isn&#39;t perfect. For example, it doesn&#39;t have a braided cable, which would increase its expected lifespan. In general, the Monoprice Select&#39;s build quality isn&#39;t as good as some of the other HDMI cables on our lineup, but it makes up for that with its value proposition. This HDMI cable has all of the functionality of more expensive cables and is backed by a lifetime warranty. Sacrificing some build quality for affordability is a good move if you don&#39;t need very long HDMI cables, as overpriced cables like the <a href=\"/monster-1000hd-review\">Monster 1000HD</a> are overkill at short lengths.","You can get the Monoprice Select in many different lengths, from as short as 1.5 feet to very long cables meant for in-wall installation. For any setup that uses cables less than 15 feet long, the Monoprice Select is an excellent choice. However, other manufacturers have cables that are better for long runs and in-wall installations.","Monoprice&#39;s website offers live chat for both customer service and technical support. It also offers support via form-driven email. Monoprice offers a lifetime warranty and a 21-day money-back guarantee. Lifetime warranties for HDMI cables aren&#39;t uncommon, but plenty of manufacturers limit their warranties to one year or even 30 days. With a lifetime warranty, you can have confidence in your purchase.","Should you have any questions about HDMI cables in general, you can reference Monoprice&#39;s FAQs and other support articles. If you can&#39;t find the answers you need, you can call Monoprice in addition to the live chat.","The Monoprice Select High-Speed HDMI cable is the best HDMI cable in terms of value. It doesn&#39;t have the best build quality, nor is it braided. However, it has access to all of the functionality that you expect from the latest HDMI cables, and at a fraction of the cost that some other companies ask you to pay. Though you may want to look elsewhere if you need very long cables, the Monoprice Select is an excellent HDMI in most situations."]},"id":"ed7602e8-8f24-4324-b9af-d1b943f40087","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49174","url":"/monoprice-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-05T13:30:00Z","datePublished":"2010-04-05T13:30:00Z","name":"Monoprice Select","synopsis":"The Monoprice Select High-Speed HDMI cable is certified by HDMI Licensing, LLC as a High-Speed HDMI Cable.
