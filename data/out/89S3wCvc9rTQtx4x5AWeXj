Most of the programs we tested have a speech recognition feature, but we found Rosetta Stone’s to be the most accurate. It uses the microphone in your mobile device or laptop, and if you are using a desktop computer, we suggest adding a USB microphone to your setup so you can take advantage of this feature.     <br />\n     <br />\nThe audio companion is a great feature if you want to take French lessons without using Wi-Fi or cellular data. You can download these audio-only lessons to a mobile device or music player, or if you prefer, you can burn the lessons onto a CD and play them in your car. Downloadable lessons are also a good option if you want to brush up on your vocabulary during a flight to a French-speaking country. If you are having trouble grasping some of the lesson concepts, Rosetta Stone offers live tutoring. You can converse in real time with a native French-speaking tutor. The live tutor service is an additional fee, but it’s a good way to perfect pronunciation and sentence structure.     <br />\n     <br />\nRosetta Stone recently moved to a subscription-based fee, which seems expensive if you plan on paying every month. However, you can cancel your subscription at any time, without penalty, which makes it cost-effective if you plan on learning basic terms and phrases before traveling to a French-speaking country for business or leisure.","<a href=\"/rosetta-stone-french-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"dcbb6811-b3cd-4ab7-9bf7-e3546c82f336","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"51853256-d510-4fe6-8332-e18e7d15cfe4","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/RnhYpmhor6obpxNvWta5UG.jpg","link":{"href":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/duolingo-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/V/I/791694/original/Learn-French-Software-Duolingo-2a.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RnhYpmhor6obpxNvWta5UG.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"RnhYpmhor6obpxNvWta5UG","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RnhYpmhor6obpxNvWta5UG.jpg","alt":"Duolingo"},"id":"0adcd4f9-b6b4-46bb-8c94-039aec1909eb","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Duolingo\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/duolingo-review\">Duolingo</a>","pros":["Free","Friendly daily reminders","Fun learning platform"],"cons":["Annoying ads","No live tutors","Short lessons"]},"id":"f77c6722-a35c-41a8-837d-407ee3caa411","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Duolingo delivers French lessons through a fun and easy-to-use interface.

I recently traveled to France, and spent more than a week navigating travel hubs and talking to locals about culturally significant events and day-to-day topics like how the local “football” teams were doing. I have some experience speaking and listening to a few languages besides English, but French isn’t one of them. Being fluent in a country’s native language can open opportunities to meet the people and find the places that make traveling fun and memorable.","This trip also helped me identify the important features of language software that make traveling and conversing easier. We recommend software that teaches important conversational topics about culturally relevant topics. Not only did we test the desktop applications, but we downloaded the companion mobile apps and took lessons on the mobile platform. I spoke to the VP of marketing for Rosetta Stone, Julia Randhawa, and asked her about the popularity of mobile learning platform and she suggested that learning a new language with an app on a phone or tablet has become more popular than the desktop app because the mobile app is updated more frequently to include new and relevant content and because the mobile app is a more familiar platform for the next generation of language students. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We began the testing process for French learning software by downloading and installing the software while taking note of how easy or difficult each product is to get working properly. Next, we took was a tour of the user interface and evaluated the help section in case we needed to ask the program for advice. We found all the programs we reviewed to be relatively simple to navigate, but there were a couple, including Easy French Platinum, that we had issues getting the software downloaded and installed. Most of the programs we reviewed have moved to an online platform which don’t require download or installation, and we prefer that interface option, especially if you have a temporary need for a language learning software. We awarded higher scores in our ease-of-use testing to programs that are easy to navigate and login to.","The last step in our testing process for French learning software was to take the prescribed beginner lessons, in the order suggested by the manufacturers. We took a few intermediate lessons, but most of our evaluation was based on the efficacy of beginner lessons because the more advanced lessons build on the learning base you get from beginning lessons. Our recommendations for the best overall, best value and best software for travelers are based on our impressions while testing these products side-by-side.","<strong>How Much Does French Learning Software Cost?</strong>","The programs we reviewed cost between $0 and $300. Much depends on whether you prefer a subscription or would rather download and keep the software on your computer. Subscription services tend to be cheaper, and you only pay for the program for as long as you need it. If you want the program long term and plan on attempting some degree of fluency, buying the software outright may be a better choice.","<strong>Important Things to Consider When Buying a French Learning Software </strong>","Ease of Use<br/>E-learning can be frustrating if you can’t quickly access the lessons or if the software crashes frequently. We issued a grade for each program we tested based on how easy each was to download and install, find lessons and continue on the path to fluency without needless searching of help menus. The best programs we tested were easy to login or download and lay out a clear learning path.","Purchasing Options<br/>After testing all the options, we believe the easiest and most flexible way to purchase a language learning software is through an online subscription. Those services don’t require any downloading and can give you the option of subscribing for a short or long period of time based on your needs. The other options are to purchase and permanently install a software from a CD or DVD ROM or download it from a trusted retailer or the manufacturer. Those are good options if you want to share learning software with other members of your family, or if you have a long-term goal for being fluent in another language.","Mobile App<br/>Programs like Rosetta Stone and Duolingo have companion apps that allow you to learn on the go. The mobile apps look a bit different than the desktop applications, but the manufacturers can update content more frequently with a mobile app and you can quickly take lessons in your spare time. Some of the programs we tested, like Fluenz, allow you to upload flash cards or lessons to your mobile device via the mobile app, which gives you access to them without using Wi-Fi or cellular data.","<strong>Classroom vs eLearning</strong>","I interviewed Shannon Kennedy, a language encourager for <a href=\"https://www.fluentin3months.com/\">Fluent in 3 Months</a>, about the advantages of using software to learn a language instead of face-to-face instruction. She told me eLearning lets you work at your own pace, without needing to coordinate two calendars to arrange a lesson or meetup. “With face-to-face instruction, there&#39;s the pressure of responding quickly. But with software, you have a little more time to reflect and respond.” Whether you’re learning a foreign language for business, travel or simply to expand your understanding of a different culture, learning in a comfortable environment at your own pace is a significant advantage. One disadvantage of eLearning compared to classroom instruction is the need for self-motivation.","Learning French for business travel comes with important motivating factors, such as avoiding awkward conversations with important colleagues, but it also requires you to learn specific topics quickly. I asked Kennedy which software features make it easier to learn quick and conversational topics for business travel. She didn’t single out one specific topic but suggested, “Lots of repetition, but done in a way that isn’t boring.” The best French learning programs we tested allow you to skip around in a curriculum to focus on the most common business travel topics and use timed, game-style exercises to help you attain conversational fluency."]},"id":"0b0f7872-5b39-4684-8036-4c22311f0fd2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_275","url":"/best-learn-french-software","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-04T20:44:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-04T20:44:00Z","name":"Best Learn French Software of 2019","synopsis":"French can be intimidating, but there are tricks to learning the language that help you understand and communicate before you are fluent.","review":{},"strapline":"French can be intimidating, but there are tricks to learning the language that help you understand and communicate before you are fluent.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-14T21:46:30Z","id":"89S3wCvc9rTQtx4x5AWeXj","meta":{"title":"Best French-Learning Software 2019 -
