You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Gear CD-RW is simple <a href=\"/best-cd-burning-software\">CD burning software</a> that does exactly what it says: burns CDs and DVDs. You can burn music and data files easily using the program&#39;s drag and drop functionality. Holding Gear CD from one of our top spots is its user friendliness. For an experienced use Gear CD will serve its purpose, but novice users might find the interface cumbersome. Gear CD-RW has the basic features we were looking for in a good CD burning software; however it is missing the bells and whistles of our higher ranked products. One feature we would like to see is the inclusion of a track player, some way to sample your selected music track before actually burning it to a disc. If you have prior experience with CD-burning software programs, you&#39;ll find this program is relatively easy to navigate. If you have no experience however, you will have to spend some time with the user manual to learn to operate the program smoothly. Gear CD-RW is a really small application and we didn&#39;t have any problems with installation. The help documentation contains all the information you’ll need to use Gear CD-RW, unfortunately, it is difficult to find what you are looking for. We suggest Gear CD make the help documentation easier to navigate. The only way to find what you want is to scroll through the pages and hunt for what you need."]},"id":"edd60a03-e7bf-4a12-b991-294af7c0e88c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"874072cc-c1c9-4312-a603-0489b2531022","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, Gear CD-RW is a good CD burning product."]},"id":"e3e820bc-80fa-4593-b9e5-fa4a56331489","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_202","url":"/gear-cd-rw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
