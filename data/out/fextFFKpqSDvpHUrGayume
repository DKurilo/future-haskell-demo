They are perhaps the most common and most recognized type. UPC codes, which are used to label and scan goods globally, are linear. You scan one-dimensional barcodes with a traditional laser scanner.","Two-Dimensional barcodes are becoming more popular. These labels use shapes and symbols to represent their data. They are designed to hold and relay more information than a one-dimensional barcode. Be aware that not all applications allow you to create this type of barcode.","<strong>Which Type of Barcode Should You Use?</strong>","Choosing the best barcode type for your needs involves more than deciding between one-dimensional and two-dimensional. There are dozens of codes types – often called symbologies – each one filling a different need. It&#39;s important to research the best symbologies for your particular industry.","A few common barcodes include:","UPC Code: This is used in the retail industry to send goods around the world. This type uses a 12-digit number on the barcode.","Code 39: This code is used in the automotive and defense industries. It uses both numbers and characters and allows you to ship goods globally.","Code 128: These are very compact barcodes used for ordering and distribution.","GS1 DataBar: This type of barcode is used to label products and perishables and items for healthcare companies.","QR Codes: You will often see this two-dimensional barcode on flyers, advertisements and other marketing items. These codes can be read by mobile devices.
