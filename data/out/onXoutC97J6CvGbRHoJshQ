The store is owned by Luxottica, the world&#39;s largest eyewear company, and is home to many name-brand frames, including those by Nike, Oakley, Coach, Eddie Bauer and ECO.","This online eyeglasses store has an extensive catalog of eyewear for men and women. With more than 20 designer brands to choose from, you are likely to find frames that complement your style and improve your vision. Still, Glasses.com’s selection doesn’t quite measure up to those on other sites, some of which like <a href=\"/eyeglasses-com-review\">Eyeglasses.com</a> carry hundreds of designer brands.","You can buy frames for adults and children, including half-rim and rimless ones, and Glasses.com offers a selection of sunglasses. Glasses come in good variety of styles, including retro and vintage, wrap, aviator, sporty, and classic styles, so there are options that fit most tastes. One product missing from Glasses.com’s inventory is ski goggles.","Each frame’s details page shows dimensions, sizing and color options as well as reviews from other customers. Glasses.com also has a 3D, virtual try-on application you can use with your iOS device. With this app, you can use a selfie to see how any pair of frames looks on you from any angle.","Glasses.com has a good selection of lens options. You can get bifocal or trifocal lenses, high-index lenses, specialty coating, and photochromic lenses. In addition, you can choose progressive lenses with some frames. Progressive lenses correct your vision at varying distances but lack the defined line between lens regions that bifocal and trifocal glasses have.","The lenses you get from this online glasses store are made from high-index and polycarbonate materials. You can request transition lens coatings, but you cannot add tints. Every pair of frames you purchase comes with CleanShield, which Glasses.com&#39;s anti-glare lens coating, and a 100-percent lens-quality guarantee.","This service offers free shipping on all glasses. All orders should arrive in five to seven days, but if you need your glasses sooner, you can opt for expedited shipping. International shipping is not available so if that&#39;s something you&#39;re looking for you&#39;re better off checking out a website like <a href=\"/coastal-com-review\">Coastal.com.</a>"]},"id":"89a0c603-5f72-4f54-b522-05ac0fcd5231","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f10b6d89-80e6-4c44-abcd-230394082861","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you need to return your glasses for any reason, Glasses.com has a 30-day money-back guarantee.
