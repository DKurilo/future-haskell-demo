In our battery test, we attached a fully-charged battery to the drill, taped the trigger down and timed how long it took for the battery to die. At the end of the test, Milwaukee was the last drill turning after an hour. By contrast, some drill batteries (like the <a href=\"/kobalt-review\">Kobalt 1424A-03</a>) gave out after only 20 minutes.","The flip side to this long-lasting battery is how long it takes to charge – which isn’t surprising given how long the battery lasts.

But since it comes with two batteries, you’ll probably never run out of power if you keep one of them on the charger."]},"id":"af16c011-d01f-44c3-b026-1a51bca0e9d5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Specifications"},"id":"37869b0d-b5f6-466e-bbff-34446c397558","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/S2YaSyYp4dXXiftnh9yxXA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The M18 has 24 clutch settings, the most of any cordless drill we reviewed.
