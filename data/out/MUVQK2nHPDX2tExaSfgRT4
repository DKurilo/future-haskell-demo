Phishing emails are messages that look like they were sent from someone you know or a company you do business with. When you click on links or provide personal information asked for in these messages, hackers have enough information to break into your bank accounts, steal your identity or send malicious viruses to attack your computer. This makes it important to have a good spam filter that blocks phishing schemes.","Email services come with filters that do a good job, and most internet security programs, such as <a href=\"/avast-review\">Avast</a> and <a href=\"/escan-review\">eScan</a>, include spam filters among their protection tools. However, there still is use for a standalone program. They cost less than an all-inclusive internet security programs and are dedicated to blocking spam, so they typically include extra tools for that purpose such a Bayesian filters and customizable settings","<strong>How does a spam filter work?</strong>","Antispam software integrates with your email program, and the spam blocker tools should appear alongside the regular toolbar in your email account so the features and filters are easy to find. The best antispam programs let you set custom filters and can connect with public databases that list email addresses known to send spam.","Programs with Bayesian filters learn which spam messages are created to specifically target you and quickly block them. A few programs have another important filter that blocks messages by their country of origin. Many spam messages are sent from a handful of countries or IP address, so having a program that tracks where emails are sent from is a good deterrent.","<strong>What other ways can I protect myself from spam?</strong>","No filter can stop every spam message. Many spam senders try to gather your personal information, and Stephens has some suggestions on how to be extra vigilant to avoid falling prey to phishing schemes.","His first suggestion: “Don’t open emails from unknown sources.” And if you do open an email that looks legitimate, double check any links before clicking on them to ensure they are trustworthy.","Often, there are red flags that identify email scams. For example, check the sender’s email address for funky symbols and look at the company logo to see if it’s clear, spelled correctly and grammatically correct. If the message asks for personal information, look up the company’s website and reach out to them using the customer service numbers listed there, rather than those listed in the email. Most companies don’t ask for personal information through emails, and government agencies, such as the IRS, only send notices through regular mail.","Stephens also recommends changing your passwords often and making them difficult to figure out by making them long with “at least eight characters, upper case and lowercase [letters], numbers and special characters.”","<strong>How much does spam filter software cost?</strong>","Standalone spam filtering software costs around $30 and includes several filters, including Bayesian filters, and uses non-intrusive learning patterns to recognize which messages you tend to read and those you delete. You can get spam filters with an antivirus program for about $50 that includes malware protection but skimps a little on the number of spam filters included.","id:139"]},"id":"1be5e5a5-264e-4b2b-9761-d3e1eef2789b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_241","url":"/best-spam-filter","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-11T17:10:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-11T17:10:00Z","name":"Best Spam Filters of 2019","synopsis":"The best spam filtering software has both black and white lists, sensitivity settings, community-based filtering and quarantine settings.","review":{},"strapline":"The best spam filtering software has both black and white lists, sensitivity settings, community-based filtering and quarantine settings.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-14T18:01:43Z","id":"MUVQK2nHPDX2tExaSfgRT4","meta":{"title":"Best E-Mail Spam Filter 2019 -
