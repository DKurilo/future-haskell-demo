You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Since Giant is one of the leading bicycle brands in the industry it&#39;s no surprise that they offer a <a href=\"/best-bike-trainers-review\">bike trainer</a> accessory. The Giant Cyclotron Mag II folds in half, so it’s easy to store. It&#39;s a sturdy magnetic resistance machine, and this basic model is a good value.","This magnetic trainer creates resistance by spinning repelling magnets past each other when you pedal. As with most magnetic models, the Cyclotron Mag II is not too noisy. The noise level starts at a moderate 18 dB but never gets above an acceptable rumble.","Giant provides a steel quick-release skewer to help mount your wheel and keep it stable. For those of you who favor a mountain bike, keep in mind that smooth tires are recommended for this trainer. Knobby tires might get stuck in the mechanism, might make the machine louder or might not even fit on the rotating cylinder. This particular model accommodates most 24-inch, 26-inch, 700C and 27-inch wheel sizes, and is it meant to work with a bike that uses a quick release to detach and attach the rear wheel. The frame is made completely out of steel and has a powder coating to resist rusting. It also has a 50 mm aluminum roller and a 1,500-gram flywheel.","With seven resistance levels and a handlebar-mounted thumb shifter, this machine is designed for both beginner-level and strenuous resistance training. The thumb shifter is small and does not have to be a permanent installment, it won’t take up space on your handlebars.","While this particular model does not come with any smart technology, it is definitely a great no-frills option to consider. Giant also offers accessories for its trainers, such as a training mat to keep your floor from getting scuffed, a chopping block that supports your front wheel to keep your bike level while mounted to the trainer, and a sweat guard to prevent any perspiration from falling to the floor. If you have any additional questions regarding this model, know that contacting Giant is easiest via phone call."]},"id":"d43aa818-c914-482a-9a78-9504950a7768","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68559","url":"/giant-cyclotron-mag-ii-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T15:40:37Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T15:40:37Z","name":"Giant Cyclotron Mag II","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-17T15:40:37Z","id":"Aon5dYMv5ssueheb8ZbF9k","meta":{"title":"Giant Cyclotron Mag II Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Giant Cyclotron Mag II is a basic magnetic bike trainer from a leading bicycle manufacturer.
