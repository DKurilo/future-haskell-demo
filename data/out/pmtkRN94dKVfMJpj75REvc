Trane added their ComfortLink Wi-Fi technology to the XL900, making it possible to program and set your thermometer using a mobile phone or tablet. This digital thermostat also more stages of heating and cooling than any other thermostat we reviewed. And while you may find Trane&#39;s customer service lacking, the XL900 plays well with newer and older air systems.","Initial programming of the XL900 is simple because it lays out each day of the week on the top of the home screen. There is no going back and forth between screens to set daily temperatures. There is also an automatic to manual mode as well as one-touch override to wipe out any schedules.","The 10-inch touchscreen allows you to set and navigate the thermometer screens and preview your current settings without fumbling around with small buttons. There is no built-in level, so you either have to eyeball it or use another level when installing the unit. Trane suggests you have it installed by a professional.","The XL900 works on four stages of heating and two stages of cooling, which is the most we have seen. This 4H/2C multistage thermostat also features a built-in humidity sensor as well as an outside temperature display. If your furnace and AC unit have a dehumidifier extension, you can adjust the humidity level in your home with this Trane thermostat.","The ComfortLink technology included with the Trane XL900 programmable thermostat gives you real-time updates as to how your system is performing. It will inform you if the AC or heater is malfunctioning or if it&#39;s time to change the air filter. If something does go wrong, the diagnostic alert light will come on. Remember though, this feature only works with certain units, so check to see that your furnace and air conditioner are compatible.","All Trane products have 10-year registered warranties. This is the best we could find. This covers all maintenance by a certified Trane technician. The Trane website is the only website to offer a live-chat option, but you may find it difficult to get an answer from them. Every time we asked a question to a representative, we were told to consult an HVAC technician in our area. They never answered our questions."]},"id":"71d06389-c0c8-4bc3-adff-5931eed56584","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3cbb4864-bcf1-4e46-ad06-1648efc50c09","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the XL900 from Trane is equipped with all the features to keep your home comfortable.
