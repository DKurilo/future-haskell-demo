You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","A <a href=\"/best-single-cup-coffee-makers\">single-cup coffee maker</a> should look as good on the counter as it does on the box, and the SunCana H701A pod brewer with deluxe triple coating does just that. This coffee brewing machine uses coffee pods to provide you with your daily cup of joe.","From the outside, the SunCana H701A pod brewer looks great, with a stylish and sleek design aesthetic. Its round lines ensure it attracts attention, and it has a nice metallic-looking exterior, even though it is actually plastic.","Naturally, this single-cup coffee brewer has a reasonable tank capacity at 40 ounces, which should keep you going for a while, and it also has an automatic shutoff to save energy. One thing it doesn&#39;t include is a removable drip tray, but you can upgrade to the next model if you prefer this convenience.","From a functional standpoint, this one-cup coffee maker only accepts pods, so it loses out a little to machines that can cope with almost any type of coffee. That said, it can (unofficially) take loose coffee in a standard 4-inch filter, which helps. It also has an adjustable volume between 5 ounces and 12 ounces, so if you really like ultra-strong coffee, you can make that happen. However, unlike many coffee-making machines, it can only take a single pod, so Turkish-style coffee is beyond this model.","This single-serve coffee maker can also brew tea and hot chocolate either via pods or through running hot water directly into the cup. It does take about two minutes to heat the water after you switch it on, so it&#39;s a little slower than other single-cup coffee makers. However, it&#39;s still quicker than waiting for many tea kettles to boil.","Cleaning is reasonably easy thanks to the one-press cleaning cycle and the removable pod holder, which can go in the dishwasher. You do need a 14-ounce cup or receptacle to use this feature, but a good jug will do the job just as easily.","Overall, the SunCana H701A pod brewer is a midrange coffee maker with a good number of options for its price, and it delivers your coffee at the press of a button. It&#39;s reasonably easy to clean thanks to the removable pod holder and reservoir, but the inability to remove the drip tray can prove to be a little annoying, so you may find it&#39;s worth paying a little extra to upgrade for that feature."]},"id":"eaed69ed-9e03-45c8-8db4-32c58daaf04e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61307","url":"/suncana-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-25T23:15:43Z","datePublished":"2014-11-25T23:15:43Z","name":"SunCana H701A Pod Brewer","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-25T23:15:43Z","id":"UinYhUHYhVeX9VN9QaxBVh","meta":{"title":"SunCana H701A Pod Brewer Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Brew cup after cup with little wait time with the SunCana H701A.
