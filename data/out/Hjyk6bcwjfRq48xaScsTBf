Storing medical imagery electronically requires a lot of storage space and reliable, high-quality solutions. PACS   the acronym stands for picture archiving and communication system software   is designed to handle high volume, large-sized electronic images and help with data storage and retrieval. Companies with software that can accomplish this for radiology practices include <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-electronic-medical-records-software/\">GE HealthCare</a>, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-electronic-medical-records-software/\">RamSoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-electronic-medical-records-software/\">Novarad</a>.","<strong>Picture Archiving &amp; Communication System Software: What to Look For</strong>","PACS is primarily used to store medical images and allow medical professionals quick access to those images. The systems can store X-rays, films, CT scans and MRIs. PACS systems are also able to store document files so you can store medical records along with imagery and data. Below are some issues you&#39;ll want to keep in mind as you compare PACS software.","<strong>Compatible Systems</strong><br/>PACS systems are supported by a DICOM transfer protocol, the standard in medical communications. Any PACS system should support all major imagery types as well as major software products, such as PDF documents and also security components. Good PACS systems should also be compatible with specialized imaging machines and software, including mammography machines and PET scanners. Be sure the PACS software you re looking at supports all the systems you use.","<strong>Functionality</strong><br/>Depending on what type of facility or facilities you run, you may want a PACS system that can to support wireless and remote access so that medical professionals can access files as needed. Keep in mind that you need to operate a fully secure network that s big enough to transfer large amounts of data used by the system. Most companies that offer PACS software have salespeople or consultants that can help you make sure your infrastructure can support the PACS system you want, and that the PACS system can support your office.","<strong>Workflow &amp; Patient Care</strong><br/>PACS software can assist with patient care in a number of ways. A good PACS system will contain software that helps with radiology workflow management to get patients in and out of radiology centers efficiently while maintaining the highest standard of care. Look for a system that has additional features that help with patient care, including records storage and retrieval.","Remote access to images can mean the difference between life and death for patients, and doctors should be able to retrieve images whether they re in another area of the hospital or in another area of the world.","<strong>Versatility</strong><br/>Consider all the various types of professionals who need to access PACS software to care for a single patient. From the clerk checking the patient in to the nurse who preps for the reader, and so on, a long chain of people will access the software from different workstations and need to see different views for completely different purposes. Consider all of the people in your chain, and make sure the system you select meets all of their needs.","A good PACS software package can help manage radiology images and allow access to the medical professionals who need to view them, all of which is essential for providing good patient care. Finding the best PACS software for your practice can be complicated, but there are a variety of options to fit a range of needs."]},"id":"5c19ddfc-7bdf-4fd1-aa18-aa1086cc7ed1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"c30b6961-5854-4bc7-879d-698e27d2ebe5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.cerner.com/solutions/\">Cerner ProVision</a>","<a href=\"http://www.fujifilm.com/products/medical/synapse/\">Fujifilm Synapse</a>","<a href=\"http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en/Products/Categories/Healthcare_IT/Medical_Imaging_Informatics_-_RIS-PACS-CVIS/Centricity_PACS\">GE</a>","<a href=\"http://www.mckesson.com/providers/health-systems/department-solutions/radiology/mckesson-enterprise-image-repository/\">McKesson</a>","<a href=\"http://www.medicorimaging.com/products/mipacs-html5-web-viewer\">Medicor</a>","<a href=\"http://ww1.novarad.net/novapacs\">Novarad</a>","<a href=\"http://www.onepacs.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAneujBRDcvL6f5uybhdABEiQA_ojMgpOOcu1_eUVt9-cLpHCta7FiB75Uxyiz_5Uzy7PC8WEaAsbM8P8HAQ\">OnePacs</a>","<a href=\"http://www.osirix-viewer.com/PACS.html\">OsiriX</a>","<a href=\"https://www.ramsoft.com/products/pacs-solutions/\">RamSoft</a>","<a href=\"http://www.sectra.com/medical/diagnostic_imaging/solutions/ris-pacs/index.html\">Sectra</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e6504ef7-b65f-4352-979a-8d5dbe6af445","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1425","url":"/best-pacs-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-03T15:57:31Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T16:46:41Z","name":"PACS Software Review","synopsis":"PACS software manages storage and transmission of radiology images.
