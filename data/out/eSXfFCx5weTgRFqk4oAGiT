It mitigates some of the vibrations and jolts a mower produces when it&#39;s in action. If you wear gloves when you mow, you will get even less vibration, but the foam handle provides decent comfort.","Like many mowers, this one has mulching capability, so the clippings you produce can be chopped up within the mower. There is also a bag to store grass clippings, which is handy but also means you will need to remove it and dispose of the clippings once you are done mowing.","You will find a couple of shortcomings in this otherwise great gas lawn mower. It presents a dual-lever wheel adjustment, which means you will have to spend a bit more time changing the wheel height than if this were equipped with a single lever. In addition, you cannot start this mower electrically. It needs to be turned on via pull-string each time, which is not a huge inconvenience but still requires more strength and strain than an electric starter."]},"id":"8194163b-10d5-4b98-8768-60382666ba01","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"71204ebf-7e3e-4e75-b5ef-bb5e659f4f48","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/RnS2AK8VST3uW3zKVPcMF5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Weighing in at 85.4 pounds, the Snapper is a lighter mower than usual, which makes it a good fit for users who can&#39;t push large amounts of weight.
