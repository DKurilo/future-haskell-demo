This is another software developer that operates mostly online, with no physical retail locations to speak of. By doing this, they cut down on maintenance costs and pass the savings to you by offering affordable software. ImTOO highly values their users, and aims to satisfy your technological needs in as many ways as possible, allowing for feedback and input from customers to improve the products. We admire their dedication to the end user and hope you will have a positive experience with ImTOO.","On the whole, ImTOO’s DVD to iPad converter performs respectably when compared to the other products on our lineup, but it lacks too many features and provides only slightly above-average conversion speeds. While it does sport an interface that is user-friendly and simple to navigate, it simply isn’t enough to boost this product to the top of our rankings. We would like to see some of the missing features added and the video quality and conversion speed improved to rank this product higher."]},"id":"9f83efc0-0a09-4e14-be47-d1dc823df848","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b17be2ce-c049-4aac-a50f-1ce5fe74ce28","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For a DVD to iPad converter that will port your videos over to an iPad-friendly format quickly and easily, ImTOO performs admirably.
