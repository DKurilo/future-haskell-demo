An HDMI port provides an easy connection to your digital TV. The Panasonic SC PT650 also upconverts standard DVDs to 1080p resolution. This allows your non Blu-ray movies to look better than they ever did with your standard DVD player.","The five disc DVD changer allows you to watch five movies without ever getting up off your couch. Now you truly can have a Lord of the Rings marathon. More practically speaking, it will also hold five CDs and allow you to shuffle through them. If you need more than 5 CDs worth of music at a time, an iPod dock is also included. Now you can listen to anything stored on your iPod, and control it with the system’s remote control.","The included five speakers are enough to recreate the movie going experience right in your own living room. The subwoofer features a 250 watt amplifier, enough to let you feel the deepest part of the explosions in Live Free or Die Hard.","The five satellite speakers are powered by a 1000 watt amplifier. Each speaker is silver in color to match the main unit, with black cloth grilles.","Overall, the Panasonic SC PT650 is a good value. It features good sound quality and a plethora of features that are sure to satisfy the most demanding critics.","<br/><strong>Summary of Reviews from across the Internet</strong>","<br/>The experts liked the overall performance of the Panasonic SC PT650.

The controls were also easy to use and intuitive.","<br/><strong>Summary</strong>","<br/>The Panasonic SC PT650 is a good value for those looking for a system with features to set it apart from the rest."," ","Love your Home Theater in a Box already?
