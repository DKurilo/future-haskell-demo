Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Worx Trivac leaf blower serves as a multipurpose machine that blows, vacuums and mulches leaves. This versatile machine is compact enough so you can use it with one hand, and it has an anti-vibration system that limits the amount of motion produced during operation. That feature can minimize the joint and muscle fatigue you experience after you’ve finished tidying up your yard.","This electric <a href=\"/best-leaf-blowers\">leaf blower</a> frees you from worrying about gas, oil or recharging batteries. You get a 14-inch cord that connects to outdoor extension cords so you are not restricted by a short cord, and you also get a powerful motor for completing big projects quickly. ","This machine is heavy at 9.7 pounds, but the accompanying shoulder strap on the collection bag is quite helpful and you can attach the Worx Trivac to a trash can to cut down on clean-up time. You get a powerful motor that generates 350 cubic feet of airflow per minute. With an airspeed of 210 miles per hour, this device offers a blow length we found of 17.4 feet, so you can clear away leaves and debris quickly and easily.","Unfortunately, this is a noisy machine. The Worx measures 97.4 decibels, which is typical for leaf blowers, but still loud. It is a good idea to wear ear protection when using this or any blower or piece of equipment that produces 85 or more decibels.","You get a number of helpful features with this leaf blower including variable speed control, so you can adjust the speed of the blower to fit the job you are working on; a soft-grip handle that makes it easy to carry and hold the blower; and an angled nose that makes the Worx Trivac comfortable to operate as well as reaching under objects like decks or patio furniture.","You get an unfortunately short three-year warranty, which is shorter than some other devices we reviewed.","The Worx Trivac leaf blower helps you effectively blow, vacuum and mulch leaves. It is easy to operate and the angled nozzle helps enormously for blowing leaves and debris out from hard-to-reach areas. With its high air speed and wide blowing range, you can get plenty of yardwork done in short order, and the anti-vibration design helps reduce muscle and joint aches after your yardwork chores are done."]},"id":"bb48654b-3107-4b56-b1f1-51a41725aa9c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56541","url":"/worx-trivac-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-29T19:02:49Z","datePublished":"2013-05-29T19:02:49Z","name":"Worx Trivac WG505","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":92,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-05-29T19:02:49Z","id":"kFoU69UgVPqMSBXWXe2UCj","meta":{"title":"Worx Trivac WG505 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Worx Trivac is an electric leaf blower that offers a powerful motor and the ability to vacuum and mulch leaves.
