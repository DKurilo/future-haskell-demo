You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro <a href=\"/best-weather-stations\">weather station</a> is one of the easiest to set up. It doesn’t require much assembly, though getting the indoor and outdoor sensors to connect takes more work than other stations. This station has decent accuracy and offers good value if you want to get rain and wind measurements in addition to the temperature.","Unlike other pro stations, the Oregon Scientific Bayard Pro comes with a separate thermometer, rain gauge and wind meter that you’ll need to install independently. Installation is as simple as finding a place to mount them, but each needs its own batteries. Fortunately, Oregon Scientific includes all the batteries you need. Another important thing to remember is that you’ll need to make sure that each of these is set to the same channel so your console can pick up their readings.","For a week, we took readings from this station and compared it to the others we reviewed as well as to weather reports from Weather Underground and Weather.com. We found that the Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro tended to overstate the temperature by a few degrees, no matter what time of day it was. It was still in the ballpark, but it was a noticeable deviation.","We found the display console to be lacking, both in features and in visual appeal, compared to the <a href=\"/acurite-review\">AcuRite 5-in-1</a>. It isn’t lit, so it can be hard to read, and it needs to have batteries – there’s no option for an external power source. These are small inconveniences, but they were noticeable when we compared this station’s display to others. This display is smaller than others we tested, so the information is crammed into a smaller area, making it harder to read.","The Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro does provide good value, costing less than the other complete stations. If you want to get a station that can give you rain and wind measurements in addition to temperature, but are cost conscious, this may be a good choice.","This weather station has some nice features, it’s easy to set up and it has a modular design that lets you put each measurement tool in the ideal spot. The console isn’t as nice as others we tested and we did find it to overstate the temperature by a few degrees."]},"id":"41bcc5a6-a1e8-468d-aef3-5c23bc83be7d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69587","url":"/oregon-scientific-backyard-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-08-28T17:35:17Z","datePublished":"2017-08-28T17:35:17Z","name":"Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":77,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","id":"T7EpqZFnzhYYcjJw7mqVef","meta":{"title":"Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro Weather Station Review","description":"The Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro weather station is easy to set up and comes with a separate thermometer, rain gauge and wind meter."},"products":[{"slug":"oregon-scientific-backyard-pro","url":"/product/oregon-scientific-backyard-pro","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","name":"Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","id":"owdXavBDRQuZjHuQxGX5yU","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/hpcwT2zwrDLkRu7boP4rNc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"435737454de9001a461e5693ca68ec34.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/435737454de9001a461e5693ca68ec34.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","id":"hpcwT2zwrDLkRu7boP4rNc","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hpcwT2zwrDLkRu7boP4rNc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro Weather Station Review","description":"The Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro weather station is easy to set up and comes with a separate thermometer, rain gauge and wind meter."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/hpcwT2zwrDLkRu7boP4rNc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"435737454de9001a461e5693ca68ec34.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/435737454de9001a461e5693ca68ec34.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","id":"hpcwT2zwrDLkRu7boP4rNc","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hpcwT2zwrDLkRu7boP4rNc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro Weather Station Review","description":"The Oregon Scientific Backyard Pro weather station is easy to set up and comes with a separate thermometer, rain gauge and wind meter."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/oregon-scientific-backyard-pro-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:02:52Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
