On Plenty of Fish, our accounts received an average of 40 matches, the second highest number of matches of any service we reviewed. On one hand, this large volume of matches is a bit of a confidence-booster and gives you numerous options. The downside of all those options is it might lead to users being more flippant about seriously dating a match because there are so many potential fish in the sea – and Plenty of Fish says you’re a match with all of them. Other sites, like eHarmony, only give users a certain number of daily matches to eliminate this problem, so you should choose the site that best fits your preferences. Of the matches our accounts got, 22 percent of them were considered “top prospects.” You can also see how many people have viewed your profile if you’re curious, free of charge."]},"id":"f5f32a52-f366-4769-a62d-4b9f7f9f4f18","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/qTqFX39BsLMgAtJHojvkSE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Plenty of Fish’s free messaging is a little hard to find on the website, but overall the function works well.
