We noticed it’s easy to find tickets in groups of two, three or four, making this a good place to shop if you’re going to a game with friends or family. In addition, the site displays the stadium or arena, and you can click on sections to see which seats are available – for some venues, you can see a point-of-view photo of the view from each seat so you know exactly what it’s like to watch from that chair. You can filter your ticket results by price or value based on location, or you can simply go for the \"best seats\" if you're OK with spending some big bucks.  <br />\nVivid Seats got an A in our price comparison, during which we looked at the price of tickets to three events on all the sports ticket platforms we reviewed. Vivid Seats’ fees on a $25 ticket were $14, which isn't the cheapest but also not the most expensive. You can have your tickets sent to you in the mail, over email, via your mobile device or through will call, though it depends on the event. There is also a rewards program called Vivid Values, where you get discounted gift cards, trips, discounted group rates and cheap tickets.<br />\nWe focused on sports tickets for this review but like most ticket websites, Vivid Seats also sells concert and event tickets. Since 2001, the company has processed more than $1 billion worth of ticket transactions. Every ticket is backed by a 100-percent Buyer Guarantee, which means the company doesn't give your personal information to sellers, you will get your tickets before the event, and they will be authentic. Like many ticket websites, Vivid Seats gives you a full refund, including delivery charges, if the event is canceled. There is a live chat feature on Vivid Seats’ website, so you can get answers to questions ASAP, or you can check out the company’s mobile app if you’re on the go.","<a href=\"/vivid-seats-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"19276e03-2ae3-4cf1-8335-473bc903a3d5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"b5c27d57-1a42-4e86-a873-202a787ee740","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/2kh83zhkNZgWTgTKgXSGBb.jpg","link":{"href":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/stubhub-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/P/U/800562/original/StubHub.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kh83zhkNZgWTgTKgXSGBb.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"2kh83zhkNZgWTgTKgXSGBb","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kh83zhkNZgWTgTKgXSGBb.jpg","alt":"StubHub"},"id":"1cd06815-f5ce-4bdc-9505-1aee928bb7b9","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"StubHub\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/stubhub-review\">StubHub</a>","pros":["Its fees are low.","There is a mobile app.","The website received an A+ in our price comparison test."],"cons":["There is no rewards program.","You only receive a refunded if your event is totally canceled.","There is a ticket resale fee."]},"id":"e194fde7-22d9-4a3f-b515-aca986316c7c","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["StubHub received an A+ in our price comparison test, where we compared and averaged the prices of tickets to three sporting events.","Also, like SeatGeek, the site only added $8 in shipping and handling fees to a $25 ticket – less than every other website we tested. This, paired with a mere 10-percent ticket resale fee, makes it the place to get the best value for sports tickets.       <br />\n       <br />\nWith StubHub – which is owned by eBay – you can search for events based on where you live, the sport you're interested or your favorite team. You see a little fire icon if tickets are particularly popular for any given event so you never miss out on getting seats. Once you select an event, you can see which seats are available in which sections of the stadium or arena, as well as the view from each spot, on the site’s interactive seating chart. You can also sort ticket results by price, best value or best seats. If you need to get a ticket right this minute, just download the free StubHub app.        <br />\n       <br />\nIf something comes up and you don’t need your tickets anymore, you can resell them right through StubHub. The website only takes 10-percent of the selling price, which is one of the lower resale fees we saw. Like on most sites, you’re guaranteed legitimate event tickets and will receive a full refund if the event is canceled. StubHub now owns Ticketbis as well, so you have access to tickets for more than 10 million sports and other entertainment events happening in over 40 countries.","<a href=\"/stubhub-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"4702b712-ef64-428e-bb73-c405141c8135","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Return Policy"},"id":"be765e12-53a3-4668-a041-5d86d49ea03a","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/zoo33tqWfPnkKeBvMvvDXg.jpg","link":{"href":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/ticketmaster-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/G/G/797632/original/Sports-Ticket-Websites-Ticketmaster.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zoo33tqWfPnkKeBvMvvDXg.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"zoo33tqWfPnkKeBvMvvDXg","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zoo33tqWfPnkKeBvMvvDXg.jpg","alt":"Ticketmaster"},"id":"cec9225e-8bad-43b8-bd78-b2fe21e379b2","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Ticketmaster\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/ticketmaster-review\">Ticketmaster</a>","pros":["You have three days after purchase to get a full refund on some tickets.","You can sign up for ticket availability and price alerts.","It has a mobile app."],"cons":["The seller fees vary by ticket.","You can’t see photos of the view from your seat.","The website has a clunky design."]},"id":"f72463ab-60b9-4b0b-ad9a-6273d1dbc2fa","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Most of the sports ticket websites we reviewed only give you a full refund if the event is totally canceled.","This doesn’t include rescheduled events, and one website also excludes events canceled due to weather.

And don’t worry; in the event of a total cancelation, you get a refund as well.  <br />\n  <br />\nThe website doesn’t have the cleanest design, but it’s obvious where to look for tickets to various sports, entertainment and music events. Once you select an event, you can view the venue and see exactly where the available seats are. However, it doesn’t have photos to show you what the view looks like from each seat.   <br />\nTicketmaster got a fairly impressive B+ in our price comparison test and only charged $9 in fees on a $25 ticket, so it’s pretty affordable. You can even resell your tickets if something comes up, but the resale fees the website charges vary based on the ticket and how much you sell it for.   <br />\n  <br />\nTicketmaster and Live Nation merged in 2010, becoming Live Nation Entertainment.

First, make sure you have the correct ticket method to get in the door. Some websites, such as Ticketmaster, require you to download an app to present an electronic ticket on your smartphone. If your confirmation email says this, a printed out receipt or paper ticket won’t work. Other venues may require you print a paper ticket, so it’s important to make sure you’ve done what’s required before you head to the game. Either way, the ticket purchase confirmation email will give you the information you need.","You should also look up information about security at the stadium you’re going to. Some have metal detectors and don’t allow anything inside that could be used as a weapon. Others don’t have such stringent rules. Either way, knowing ahead of time will make it easier when you arrive. This information most likely won’t be available on the ticket website, so you need to do the research separately.","One last thing to keep in mind is parking. For events at large stadiums, it will most likely be easiest to purchase a parking pass online alongside your ticket. That way, you’re guaranteed a spot. Depending on the location, there may be other parking options, though they could be expensive and not secure.
