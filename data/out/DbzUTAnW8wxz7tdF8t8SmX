We performed the same edits in each program to see which ones had the best abilities. Some programs can make images pixelated, grainy or unfocused after applying edits. For this reason, programs that maintained excellent image quality after an edit ranked higher in our image quality score. ","We wanted to see how well each program&#39;s organizational features worked, so we loaded the same set of photos into each system and assigned them to different categories. Programs with more arranging options were rated higher, since they were likely to be helpful to a wide user audience.","The number of file formats that a program uses is also very important. We wanted to make sure that the highest-ranked programs were compatible with the most common image files. These include RAW, JPEG, PSD, PDF, TIFF, GIF and PNG. Programs that supported all of these files scored higher, while programs that didn&#39;t scored lower.","<strong>How Much Does Photo Organizing Software Cost?</strong>","The best photo organizing programs can run anywhere from $25 to $50, though some might use subscriptions and will need to be renewed monthly or yearly. Typically, programs that cost more will provide more advanced editing tools in addition to the organizing options, so you&#39;ll be able to get your favorite images looking exactly the way you envision and manage them in the way you want.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We have tested photo organizing software for the last 11 years. In our most recent test, we spent more than 160 hours evaluating the organizing and editing features of each of the 10 programs we tested. We tested organizing capabilities by importing the same set of photos to each software. We checked for the ability to tag photos with keywords, color labels, number or star ratings, locations, face tagging, categories and calendar dates. Programs that offered more of these options scored higher, while programs with fewer offerings scored lower. Programs that allow you to find your photos quickly scored higher. Programs that included keyword searches made this especially helpful and scored higher.","We chose software that allows you to view and edit metadata, which can help you keep track of what settings your camera used to capture a specific effect. We also wanted to make sure the editing abilities were up to snuff. The programs that offered the most common basic and advanced editing tools also scored higher, and programs that best performed these edits scored higher still.","<strong>Things to Look For When Choosing a Photo Organizing Software</strong><strong></strong>","Pricing<br/>A few years ago, photo organizing software used to be really expensive, but now you can get a decent program for a reasonable price. The most basic photo organizers will cost as little as $25 and range to about $50. More professional versions will cost between $60 and $130 but they will also provide more tools for you to work with. Typically, as far as photo organizing goes, paying more will give you more advanced image editing tools, but will not give you more organizational tools. If you want a simple, basic organizer, you&#39;ll likely be happy getting an economical software, but if you want to be able to edit your photos you might want to consider spending a bit more. ","Features<br/>Photo organizing software should be easy to use and should provide you with several different organizing methods to choose from. Programs with search bars are incredibly helpful when finding a photo by its filename or keyword tags. You should also look for a program that comes with an online backup manager. That way your photos will be protected in case something happens to your computer. If you want to keep a clean photo collection, find a program that allows you to find and delete duplicate photos.","File Types<br/>Choose an organizing software that is compatible with the same image files that you most frequently work with. Some of the most common image files include JPEG, TIFF, GIF and PNG. More-advanced image file types, such as RAW and PSD, allow you to make more controlled and advanced edits to your images.","Editing Tools<br/>Editing tools can help you make your photos pop. When uploading large numbers of photos, the batch processing tool enables you to enhance all of your images at once. For example, if your photos all turned out dark, you can choose to have the program brighten all of them. If you plan on using your organizing software to make advanced edits, make sure it works in layers, saving versions as you go, as this allows you to make changes while protecting the original image.","Making slideshows can be a big reason to buy photo organizing software, but not all programs are built alike. Some simply cycle through your photos, while others allow you to add animated transitions, effects and music. If you want to <a href=\"/best-photo-slideshow-software\">make more elaborate slideshows</a>, look for a program that offers more than just the basics. Online galleries are a great place to back up your photos. Keep in mind that some programs come with a limited amount of online space and will require you to pay for more if you use it up.","<strong>Basic Photography Tips </strong>"]},"id":"3895baf6-aa52-4208-831c-1872da9db7a3","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Getting your lighting and camera settings right will reduce the amount of time you need to spend editing your photos.","Try to get as close to your subject matter as possible while still being in focus. This will give more detail to your photos.","Direct sunlight casts heavy shadows on your subject matter. Counteract it by shooting in the golden hours just after sunrise and just before sunset when lighting isn’t as harsh.","If you must shoot on a sunny midday, use your flash, light boxes, reflector panels, and natural shading to balance out the lighting.","Understand shutter speeds so you can take the pictures you want. For instance, when shooting fast-moving subjects, like at a sports game, you’ll want shutter speeds of over 1/500th, otherwise you’ll only get blurry images.","To make landscape photography more dynamic, try to include a foreground, middle ground and background. This adds depth to your images.","When taking family photos or individual portraits, try to make your subjects comfortable with jokes and conversation. This will help them loosen up so you can get genuine smiles and body language.","The only way to get better is to gain experience. Go out into the world and try new things. Experiment with aperture sizes, lenses and camera settings.","Never over-edit your photos. Making too many edits only makes your photos look amateurish and off. A simple trick is to walk away from the photo you&#39;re editing and then come back 10 minutes later. You’ll have a fresh set of eyes to see what needs to be edited or to evaluate whether your editing went too far.","Always keep a copy of the original image. You’ll be much happier if you ever realize that you don’t like your edits after all.","Jump online and read photography blogs, attend local photography classes, do anything you can to learn more tricks and tips from professionals.","You’ve probably noticed that photography equipment is very expensive.
