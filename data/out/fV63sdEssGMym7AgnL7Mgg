Previously known as the Health HP-STX, this <a href=\"/best-electric-toothbrushes\">toothbrush</a> is a practical, affordable pick.","The HP-STX comes with its handle and a charging dock that includes an enclosed storage case with room for four brush heads. Depending on the option you choose, you can buy it with either 10 or 20 refill heads, which are color-coded in red, blue, green and yellow to accommodate multiple users. If you’re the only one using the toothbrush, you won’t need to buy replacement brush heads for years.","Although the Health HP-STX doesn’t have a pressure sensor, it does notify you if you brush in the same spot for more than 30 seconds. This encourages you to reach all four quadrants of your mouth without focusing too much in one place. There’s also a two-minute timer, and the  auto-shutoff feature helps you prevent overbrushing.","The Wellness brush’s sonic wave cleaning technology vibrates at up to 38,000 brush strokes per minute, and its brush heads can also oscillate and pulsate. Its three cleaning modes include Power/Clean, Soft/Gentle and Massage, but we couldn’t discern much difference among them.","This toothbrush’s battery provides up to two weeks of brushing between charges. Only the Philips Sonicare brushes in our lineup rivaled its battery life. Although the Wellness HP-STX left us with clean-feeling teeth, we liked two other basic brushes – the <a href=\"/philips-sonicare-review\">Sonicare 2</a> and the <a href=\"/oral-b-deep-sweep-review\">Oral-B Pro 1000</a> – much better. Those top performers are also lower-priced than the HP-STX, and they have better warranties and better customer service. The HP-STX is protected for just one year to their two, and Wellness Oral Care’s customer service has limited access. Most of the other manufacturers we’ve researched offer support by phone, email and chat. The Wellness website provides only a web-based request form, and the toothbrush’s user guide isn’t available online."]},"id":"bf680ecb-6b93-45d4-9fa7-b686a0fe11e3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66670","url":"/health-hp-stx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-24T20:04:16Z","datePublished":"2015-08-24T20:04:16Z","name":"Wellness HP-STX","synopsis":"The Wellness HP-STX has undergone a name change and edged up a notch in our rankings since we last reviewed it.
