This means that, according to Sony’s website, by supporting both “internal decoding and bitstream output of these enhanced audio codecs” the result is uncompromised sound – apparently as good as the master recording would sound if you were in the recording studio. For the sound coming out of a home theater system to be compared to a professional recording studio sound is pretty awesome.
