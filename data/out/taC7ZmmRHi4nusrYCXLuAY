You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The TomTom GO 50 S is a <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> preloaded with maps of the United States, Mexico and Canada that are ready to use and not dependent on having a cell signal. With free map updates for life, you know your routes are always up to date. This model also includes 3D maps, which portray the approximate height of the landmarks surrounding your route. Three-dimensional maps make navigation, particularly in a city, much easier. However, it doesn’t have all of the features that would make it as helpful as the best GPS units.","The best feature of the GO 50 S is its lifetime traffic updates. This means the device regularly checks up on the traffic conditions ahead of you on your route. However, unlike some competing car GPS units, the GO 50 S does not have a built-in traffic receiver. Instead, it pairs with your smartphone and then uses your smartphone’s data connection to get traffic conditions. Unfortunately, this does eat up some of your monthly data allocation, but TomTom claims the usage is moderate.","This GPS system has built-in lane assistance, as does the <a href=\"/tomtom-go-500-review\">TomTom GO 500</a>, which tells you the best lane to be in during any point in your commute, and even guides you into the correct lane prior to an upcoming turn. It also has a handy automatic reroute function, so if you take a wrong turn, the device will automatically recalculate and change your route accordingly.","Unlike the best navigation GPS units, the GO 50 S does not have voice recognition. This means you can’t verbally command the unit, which is a strength of smartphone navigation apps as well as premium navigation GPS units.","TomTom has email and phone customer support available, as well as a social media presence and various informational resources on its website. It offers a one-year warranty on the GO 50 S, which is standard for a navigation GPS. Included in the box are an installation guide, an EasyPort mount, an adhesive disk, and a USB cable and car charger."]},"id":"fdc34a49-48a4-4d7c-a3e6-0b3af82e3f0d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"811b69f3-b4f9-4fa2-b4bb-73e71b626392","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TomTom GO 50 S is affordable and offers lifetime map and traffic updates.
