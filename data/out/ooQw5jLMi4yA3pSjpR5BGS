Through these tests, we&#39;ve gained valuable experience that helps us reach our conclusions concerning other heating and cooling equipment such as baseboard heaters. As we test, we hold ourselves to precise standards, mainly centering on value and convenience. We design our tests to match consumer expectations, not those of product designers.","When we can&#39;t physically test a product, as in the case with baseboard heaters, we use the same attention to detail to verify our research so our decisions echo the mission of Top Ten Reviews.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We looked at 10 baseboard heater brands and assessed the specifications and energy efficiency of 15 models. Due to installation requirements, we don&#39;t test baseboard heaters in-house at Top Ten Reviews. Instead, we award our highest scores to heaters that generate the most warmth while taking up the smallest space.","A baseboard heater’s size matters because putting the unit too close to furniture can lead to overheating, electrical dangers and poor airflow. Our top-rated unit, the <a href=\"/dimplex-review\">60-inch Dimplex</a>, produces twice the heat of the <a href=\"/qmark-review\">58-inch QMark HBB</a>, despite their similar sizes. This could affect your decision if floor space is an issue.","<strong>How Much do Baseboard Heaters Cost?</strong>","The two main types of baseboard heaters have different costs. For example, a typical electric baseboard heater costs between $35 and $200 while a typical hydronic baseboard heater costs between $200 and $450. Additionally, there is a direct link between a baseboard heater&#39;s size, power output and price, which means bigger, more powerful heaters cost more than smaller, less powerful units.","Be aware that buying multiple smaller units to heat a space may be more expensive than getting a single larger unit. For example, two 500-watt baseboard heaters may cost $70 compared to a 1,000-watt unit, which costs $50. However, multiple units provide better heat distribution in a space, so your final cost depends on your space and needs.","You should also factor in the cost of paying an electrician to install the heaters, unless you have the skills to do it on your own while meeting local electrical code requirements.","<strong>What To Look For</strong>","Electric Vs. Hydronic<br/>There are two types of baseboard heaters: electric and hydronic. Electric heaters use convection to circulate heat throughout a room. This heat often dissipates quickly after the heater shuts off, since the heating elements and steel case cool down rapidly. Hydronic systems warm up a liquid, which radiates heat more slowly and evenly. These units take longer to warm a room than electric ones, but they continue to produce heat after they turn off because they don&#39;t cool down as quickly. As such, they are more energy efficient. In general, electric baseboard heaters are more affordable and more durable than hydronic ones.","For our evaluation, we didn&#39;t look at whether hydronic or electric baseboard heaters are better. Ultimately, that decision comes down to your own heating preferences.<br/><br/>Room Size &amp; Wattage<br/>Prior to purchasing a baseboard radiator, factor in the size of the room you want to heat. To determine the ideal wattage for your room, multiply the square footage by 10. For example, a 100-square-foot room could use a 1,000-watt heater. This ensures you can heat a room quickly and keep it warm efficiently. A heater with too little wattage might heat a room eventually, but it could take hours.","Electric baseboard heaters are ideal for heating spaces between 50 and 200 square feet. If your target area is not in this range, another type of heater might be a better solution. For areas smaller than 50 square feet, <a href=\"/best-space-heaters\">space heaters</a> are a low-cost, portable option you can simply plug into a wall outlet.","Warranty<br/>Whereas some baseboards are covered for one, five or seven years, the best baseboard heaters have 10-year warranties or longer. Ideally, a warranty will cover the cost of replacement parts and shipping while in effect. Installing replacement parts falls on you; it might be smart to hire a technician to repair more costly units.","<strong>Installing Your Baseboard Heater</strong>","Although many people can reasonably install a baseboard heater without problems, it&#39;s usually best to hire an electrician. An electrician can help you run voltage-appropriate wiring to the heater&#39;s location, mount the heater and install the proper thermostats. Hiring a professional is more expensive than DIY installation, but it&#39;s safer and quicker to hire an electrician.","It&#39;s best to place a baseboard heater next to a doorway, directly under a window or along an external wall to help eliminate cold spots. Placement on carpet is acceptable, provided the air intake stays clear of obstructions. Likewise, leave 6 inches on either side, as well as 12 inches above the unit to further ensure it remains free of hazards.","When replacing baseboard heaters, you likely have the correct wiring in place, but new locations may need new wiring. Every model we reviewed requires 240-volt wiring, with two exceptions: the Cadet 2F500W heater, which supports only 120 volts, and the Dimplex PC6025W31, which supports both voltage options. Homes often have 240-volt wiring for heavy appliances, though it&#39;s not always accessible for baseboard heating.","Unlike our top pick from Dimplex, most baseboard heaters don&#39;t come with a built-in thermostat, instead relying on a wired or wireless thermostat for temperature control. Baseboard heaters don&#39;t work with your home&#39;s main thermostat, which controls your <a href=\"/best-gas-furnaces\">furnace</a> or <a href=\"/best-central-air-conditioning-units\">air conditioner</a>, so your best bet is to buy one from the heater&#39;s manufacturer. You&#39;ll likely need a thermostat in each room that has a baseboard heater.","<strong>Are Baseboard Heaters Energy Efficient?</strong>","Baseboard heaters are not as efficient as other types of heaters. They are a type of electrical-resistance heater, which convert 100 percent of incoming electricity into heat. While this sounds like a good thing, you need to consider that electricity is more expensive than other fuel sources used to heat homes. Put simply, it requires more energy and effort to burn fuels to create electricity for heating than to burn many of those same fuels directly for heating. Additionally, heat pumps, which also use electricity, are more efficient than resistance heating.","This doesn’t mean baseboard heaters are impractical in every case. In fact, Energy Star states in its <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/home-heating-systems/electric-resistance-heating\">guide on resistance heating</a> that resistance heaters can be good for the following situations:"]},"id":"7befed93-fa78-4a90-8a0b-e45a7a476a91","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Heating additions to your home where extending your current heating system may be too expensive","Dry climates with either hot or mixed (hot and cold) temperatures that have few heating days each year","Zone heating in different parts of your home, cabin or workshop"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b363a6e1-024e-4344-9a0f-3c240f50ac46","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Safety</strong>","As with any heating device, keeping yourself and your home safe from accidental fires and burns is important.
