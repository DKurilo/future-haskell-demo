This corded trimmer has an impressive 10-amp motor. It has a long shaft and an 18-inch cutting path with a dual-line head. For yards with wide open spaces this is a great trimmer that will let you weed a big area quickly. However, for yards with a lot of tight areas and nooks, this may not be the best choice.","This is a solidly built trimmer, the heaviest in our lineup, weighing just under 10 pounds. Unfortunately, this weed eater’s head doesn’t adjust for the detailed work of edging, but the shaft is adjustable to make edging easier. It lacks a wheel, which would be helpful for more refined edging. It also lacks a metal guide, which can help in the absence of a wheel. The shaft is quite long, so it will be best suited for tall or medium-sized users.","It is a corded trimmer, and while it’s a little harder to maneuver than a cordless trimmer, you don’t have to worry about recharging the battery or running out of power in the middle of a job. The wide 0.08-inch line operates on a bump feed system. This system smoothly feeds line into the head when you lightly bumping the trimmer’s head on the ground or press the button with your hand.","All Greenworks products, including this trimmer, are safe for the environment. It has a carbon footprint of zero and will not release any carbon emissions into the air.","The four-year warranty is good when compared to other weed eaters in our lineup. You can download a PDF user manual online which will answer many of your questions. If you have additional questions or concerns, you can contact customer service via email or phone.","This weed eater is a great budget pick. But if you want to spend a few more dollars and get the best weed eater you can, – we recommend the <a href=\"/black-decker-review\">Black &amp; Decker LST136</a>."]},"id":"497b0155-af9a-484a-86a7-77e9944bcad1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d4ade4bf-9dee-4d41-9769-608e44e72a0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GreenWorks 21142 is one of the most powerful trimmers we reviewed.
