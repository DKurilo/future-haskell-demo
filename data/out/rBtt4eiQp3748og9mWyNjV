That means that no adapter is required in order for you to be able to listen to high-definition radio signals. You will need an adapter, however, if you want to sync a Bluetooth device to the in-dash receiver. This trade-off may be appealing to some, but those who use Bluetooth-enabled devices more than HD radio may be disappointed. Nonetheless, this is one of the best car audio receivers we reviewed and it is another fine product from Kenwood."]},"id":"6df8dae1-3c79-42df-8cef-e4a2f1d7a086","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"7dcba46e-cab7-4c86-8f99-e25056f572ae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The CD deck on this car audio head unit can play WMA, MP3 and AAC files from CD, CD-R and CD-RW formats.
