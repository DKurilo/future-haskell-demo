First, understand that these are different from scientific calculators, which offer an easy way of finding answers to basic equations. Scientific calculators typically have smaller screens than graphing calculators do, and they perform basic scientific notation, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions.","While the biggest difference between a scientific and a graphing calculator is the screen size, other features, such as graphing capabilities, color displays, and the ability to write and store algorithms and programs set graphing options apart from scientific ones. Graphing calculators can also be used for drawing scatter plots, calculating probability and creating tables.","<strong>CAS vs. Non-CAS Models</strong>","There are two different kinds of graphing devices available: Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and non-CAS. Both CAS and non-CAS calculators include advanced features that let you manipulate variables and solve equations. Some non-CAS versions, however, are suitable for only basic math problems.","One of the biggest differences in using these two types of calculators is how they display an equation. CAS calculators let you enter variables and then simplify them into a format known as Pretty Print or Natural Display. The result is a mathematical equation similar to what you see in textbooks. Pretty Print often makes an equation easier to understand for both students and teachers. Calculators of this type are also capable of evaluating symbolic expressions, making them useful for scientists and professionals. The addition of this capability also increases the price of the calculator. Non-CAS graph calculators display expressions in syntax format but are usually less expensive.","<strong>RPN vs. Algebraic Modes</strong>","If you use your graphing calculator or scientific calculator for advanced calculations, you may want a choice when it comes to the type of mode you use to input equations and functions for electrical engineering, chemistry, physics and even astronomy. There are two basic modes: algebraic and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN.) Most calculators use the algebraic input method, which uses the order of operations in a way naturally taught to students by professors in school.","Some, like the HP 50g, give you the option of using RPN. RPN makes complex calculations easier by removing the parenthesis and brackets in the equation. It then places the calculation in the correct order of operation. This saves steps and reduces the amount of storage space each calculation uses."]},"id":"12532aac-6838-411a-b329-41bd931997c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Online Options"},"id":"43d4c591-b5c1-4383-bf45-b9940db00d79","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What About Online Graphing Calculators?</strong><br/>A cost-saving alternative to a hand-held calculator is an online version.
