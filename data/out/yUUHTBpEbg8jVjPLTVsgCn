It offers enough power for deeper muscle treatments, and the durable body handles long-term performance.","This handheld massager weighs about 3 pounds, including both the body and the head of the device. The unit&#39;s head features two spheres that pulse at various rates. These spheres massage the muscles up to a quarter inch beneath the surface of the skin, so you can enjoy deeper muscle massages at any time. You do not need any lubrication for these massagers to function. The spheres perform well on dry skin and over light clothing.","This body massager works with several different areas of the body, and it includes three different speed settings. With a single switch, you can choose 20, 30 or 40 pulses per second. The lower settings still pack significant power. At 1,200 pulses per minute, the slower setting gives enough power for relaxing back massages. With light pressure, it works on arms and legs, too. The highest speed setting features 2,400 pulses per minute, enough for many therapeutic massages. Unlike <a href=\"/homedics-review\">HoMedics</a>, this massager doesn&#39;t provide heated massages.","The Thumper Mini Pro 2 has a thick handle that mitigates vibrations so you can easily maintain a grip on it even when using it on your back. This added control helps with self-massaging and improves total control. If you like this, you might also like the <a href=\"/wahl-review\">Wahl 4120-600.</a>","You cannot change out the heads on this massager. Because the unit&#39;s dual spheres sometimes come in contact with the skin, their design greatly affects the feel of the device. The restriction does limit the performance of the massager, but only for the gentlest uses.","Deep back and shoulder massages ensure better relaxation, and you can use the massager&#39;s comfortable handle to maximize your reach. It gives you enough room for two-handed applications, but the weight of the device also allows single-handed control. The device is about 13 inches long.","This handheld body massager requires a DC plug for power. This ensures that the unit can reach its advertised speeds, and it gives you enough power for deeper muscle groups. This corded connection does limit the reach of the device, but it does not hinder the use in most home setups.","The Thumper Mini Pro 2 Handheld Body Massager has powerful speed settings, creating up to 2,400 pulses per minute. It has a durable body but no changeable heads. You can use this massager for relaxing back massages and deeper muscle therapy."]},"id":"bcfda1be-c638-4ae8-8347-f76c00f651a6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63210","url":"/thumper-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T21:14:13Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T21:14:13Z","name":"Thumper Mini Pro2","synopsis":"Editor's Note: There is a newer version of this product available, which we will consider in our next update of this site.
