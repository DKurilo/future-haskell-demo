To adjust these wheels, you must remove a pin and then choose which level to reset the wheel at. This isn&#39;t a problem if you know what height you want to mow your lawn at, but can present a hassle if you let your lawn go for a while or need to do a quick adjustment. Cub Cadet offers similar models to the SC 500 EZ like the <a href=\"/cub-cadet-review\">Cub Cadet 500 HW</a> that have standard wheels that lift with a single lever, so if you anticipate needing to adjust your deck height often, may want to consider the Cub Cadet 500 HW mower.","A feature the Cub Cadet includes that you don&#39;t see all the time is the wash port, which lets you clean the blade and the area beneath the deck by attaching a garden hose when you&#39;re done mowing. If you do this along with other maintenance, it keeps the mower running well for many years. One of the best conveniences the SC 500 EZ features is the rechargeable battery starter. With this, you can start the mower with a push of a button instead of potentially hurting your arm using the pull-string."]},"id":"d3b90a9d-1e19-41f2-9dc7-675b48790c61","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"145b6c9a-2173-41d6-a177-5180133c4b3c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/TByH6XNdEADPvMQGcg9dN9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The rear wheels are a modest 11 inches in diameter, and the unique, swiveling front tires are even smaller at 8 inches. This makes it easier to use than many mowers when it comes to traversing diverse terrain for yards as big as a half-acre. The front wheels also swivel, improving the maneuverability of the lawn mower so that you can turn with ease. The manufacturers state that it is suited for sloped terrain with obstacles. Given its extreme mobility and rear-wheel drive, it doesn&#39;t really need the variable wheel size that some mowers rely on. This walk-behind mower weighs in heavier than average at 100 pounds, but its nimble wheels make it seem lighter than it is.
