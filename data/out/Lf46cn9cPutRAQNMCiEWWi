BOLT XRT Pet 2-in-1 is lightweight and battery powered, and you can remove the integrated hand vacuum to clean pet hair and dirt on furniture. It did not have the best suction – struggling especially to remove flour during our testing – but having two <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaners</a> in one is pretty handy.","This machine has automatic height adjustment, suction control settings and the ability to shut off the brushroll. You can adjust the distance between the cleaning head and the floor to fit the floor type you are cleaning so cleaning can be optimized for bare floor or carpets.","You can also decrease or increase the suction of the vacuum with the buttons located on the handle of the vacuum. A lighter suction will ensure that you clean upholstery or drapes without damaging them. The vacuum also features a brushroll shut-off, so when you vacuum hardwood, you can turn off the brush and protect the floors.","The BOLT&#39;s handheld vacuum houses the dirt cup. As such, it only holds 13.5 ounces, which can translate into you emptying it multiple times during a vacuum session, which is annoying. For a cordless with a larger dust bin, consider the <a href=\"/hoover-react-review\">Hoover REACT</a>.","The BOLT comes equipped with rubber wheels that protect the floor from the vacuum&#39;s wheels. It weighs a little over 5 pounds, which saves wood floors from unnecessary pressure caused by a heavy vacuum.","The cordless vacuum has a 10-inch cleaning path with the floor tool, meaning you can cover more surface in a shorter amount of time. The handle bends both forward and backward, helping you clean and making it easy to store. It also features 180-degree swivel steering, which is helpful for maneuvering into tight areas.","BISSELL&#39;s BOLT XRT Pet 2-in-1 runs on a 14.4-volt nickel-metal hydride battery. The battery runs for up to 20 minutes, giving you enough time to clean an entire room. However, the brushroll and suction settings may decrease how long it runs. When the battery is run down, it takes at least eight hours to recharge on its charging base.","While this hardwood floor vacuum does not come with a hose, you can remove the hand vacuum and attach cleaning tools to it. You can attach either a dusting brush or a crevice tool to the handheld vacuum. The tools help you clean hard-to-reach areas and are specially designed to pick up pet hair.","The vacuum comes with a one-year warranty against defective or malfunctioning parts. If you need to contact BISSELL, the company&#39;s website lists both an email and a phone number. It also has a service center locator on its website. If you need help troubleshooting your vacuum, the site has online product manuals, a FAQs page and video tutorials."]},"id":"c7e2796a-5f09-45b7-8b7f-2e5f8b6820d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f223c617-59be-4677-8ebc-0498cbb5e0fd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The suction was not the best with the BISSELL BOLT XRT Pet and it takes a long time to recharge, but there is an undeniable convenience to this vacuum.
