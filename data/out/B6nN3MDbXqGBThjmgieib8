You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","A large-capacity model, the Thermos Vacuum Insulated 61 oz Stainless Steel Beverage Bottle, is a good choice for all-day hydration. While it does offer 24-hour temperature retention and a shoulder strap, it is bulky and heavy, and lacks some features you&#39;d expect at this price point.","With a capacity of 61 ounces, the Thermos Vacuum Insulated 61 oz Stainless Steel Beverage Bottle holds enough liquid to keep you hydrated for an extended period or to share with friends. Given the capacity, you&#39;d expect this <a href=\"/best-thermoses\">thermos</a> to have at least two cups, but it only has one, so if you plan to share your beverages, you need to purchase additional cups.","This model measures 5 x 4.6 x 14.1 inches, so is large and bulky, although will fit into a spacious backpack. To make the flask easier to comfortably transport, it has a detachable shoulder strap, although lacks a carry case. It is not dishwasher safe, nor can you safely use abrasive cleaning pads, so you need to clean it inside and out with a soft cloth and a mild detergent.","The flask has a double-walled stainless steel construction with vacuum insulation. This flask has a retractable handle that keeps it as compact as possible for transport while providing you with a handle for pouring. However, the handle has two hinge points, which could break, particularly with excessive use. The band of rubber around the base helps to prevent the thermos slipping off a flat surface. The rubber around the top of the flask body and the top of the lid make it easier to remove the top.","Maintaining temperature for 24 hours, the Thermos Vacuum Insulated 61 oz Stainless Steel Beverage Bottle also remains cool to the touch. It has a twist and pour stopper and is leak-proof. You cannot drink directly from the body of the thermos, and it is not suitable for storing dairy products.","For a large-capacity thermos that stands up to heavy use, the Thermos Vacuum Insulated 61 oz Stainless Steel Beverage Bottle is a good choice, as it offers reasonable value and has a solid construction. The flask is large enough to cater to multiple people, and it retains temperature for 24 hours. Unfortunately, it is not dishwasher-safe, lacks a carry case and is heavy and cumbersome, so is not the best thermos when you need something light and compact."]},"id":"a9e1a397-ed7c-43f4-991a-b6993c54160c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63305","url":"/thermos-61-ounce-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T17:59:19Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T17:59:19Z","name":"Thermos 61 Ounce with Folding Handle","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-09T17:59:19Z","id":"B6nN3MDbXqGBThjmgieib8","meta":{"title":"Thermos 61 Ounce with Folding Handle Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Thermos 61 Ounce.
