You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You don’t need any experience to use HGTV Home Design for Mac. Its user-friendly interface allows you to change your model by simply dragging and dropping items, which makes this program easy to use for novices of <a href=\"/best-home-and-interior-design-software-for-mac\">interior design</a>. It doesn&#39;t offer many custom tools, but HGTV&#39;s easy-to-use program has a detailed lighting simulator and an eco-friendly feature to reduce your footprint.","You can choose between creating your own custom floor plan or use one of the sample model templates the software provides. The 2D and 3D floor plans are designed to work seamlessly with one another. For example, if you change something in the 2D floor plan, the change will appear in the 3D model without you having to toggle back and forth.","You can choose to view the 2D floor plan, 3D model or both simultaneously by using the view buttons. When you complete your design, a 3D walkthrough gives you a virtual tour of your model. With HGTV Home Design Software for Mac, you can also create a custom QuickTime movie of your virtual walkthrough for presentations to share with your friends and family.","The lighting simulator within this Mac home design software is intuitive and powerful. You can simulate any time of day and change the lighting so it&#39;s closer or further way from the equator. This can help you decide where to place windows, doors and skylights on your model home.","Bathroom and kitchen design is an area where this floor plan design software for Mac excels. The inspector tool within this software helps you customize objects to your specifications. With the materials paintbrush, you can add tile and textures to your kitchen and bathroom to create sleek and modern designs.","The Go Green feature is unique compared to other home design software we reviewed. Go Green is a way that HGTV encourages you to become more environmentally savvy. It can help design your home to be energy efficient and have a small footprint on the environment. We are pleased to see this bonus feature within the home design software.","There aren’t as many objects offered in this software compared to other interior design software on our lineup. While 1,200 objects seems like a lot, other applications have object libraries nearly double in size. If you can’t find an object that you desire, you can log onto a compatible online library and download it.","This is one of the few products on our lineup that offers live chat support. You can email the manufacturer if you need help, but the company charges you for phone support. Email support, community forums and video tutorials are all available and free."]},"id":"0bf9613c-d9f0-49fe-a97a-614f46519373","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1ccb195b-f1c5-4a36-af99-e998486ee49f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["HGTV Home Design software is one of the simplest design software options on our lineup.
