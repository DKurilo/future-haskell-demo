The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 <a href=\"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters\">VHS to DVD Converters</a> here.</em>","The next product on our lineup is the Hauppauge Video Capture VHS to DVD converter. We tested the device with several operating systems, and it performed respectably under most circumstances. We did run into several problems when we installed the software associated with the device, and when we attempted to resolve the problems with customer support, the representatives we spoke with treated us poorly.","Like other converters, installing the required drivers took almost no effort at all. After less than a minute, we were able to go from plugging the device in to being ready to convert our VHS tapes to DVDs. As noted above, however, we had a great deal of trouble with the included WinTV software, so we elected to use Windows Movie Maker instead. This made the conversion process a great deal easier.","Initially, when we installed the included software, it had trouble recognizing that the converter had been connected. It seems odd that the software included with the device works less effectively than other third-party applications, but the converter remains functional, even if you decide to use other software.","After we uninstalled and reinstalled the entire application on both our XP and Vista machines, we were able to use the software without any problems. The recording was simple. We especially liked the screen capture option that the WinTV app has. We were not able to record directly from a VCR to DVD with the Hauppauge Video Capture device, however.","The Hauppauge Video Capture device worked great with the XP, Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. We were able to use the Hauppauge video capture device with all our favorite software. The Hauppauge Video Capture device also will record copyrighted material.","The Hauppauge Video Capture device comes with DVD MovieFactory SE, but don&#39;t be fooled, because this software is not intended to capture video with the Video Capture device. Even though there is an option in the software application to capture video, it does not work. Instead, use the WinTV software, which is also included with the product, or try any other video capture software. The inclusion of dual applications is confusing, and we wasted about an hour trying to make the included software capture our video before we called the support line, only to find that it wouldn’t work.","After you make it through the long installation process and possibly uninstall and reinstall the applications, you will be able to fly through transferring your VHS tapes to your PC.","There is a selection of drivers available on the manufacturer’s website. Along with the drivers are some detailed, and complicated, instructions. However, there are no FAQs, user forums or online chat. When we had no place left to turn for advice, we called the support phone lines. Our call was answered quickly, but the customer service representative was argumentative, sighed frequently and challenged us on the quality of the cables we had been using. When we hung up, rather disgusted, we called back, only to speak with another rude, impatient customer support representative. By the end of the phone call, we were able to get the software working by uninstalling and reinstalling it. Overall, we had a very unpleasant experience with the customer support from Hauppauge."]},"id":"50cc0392-c536-4610-b2b6-8fd2f00d35ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b23c0394-55b6-43c1-9e4e-1c3f0c03e97f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Hauppauge VHS to DVD converter can be useful, the failure to include proper software to capture your videos is discouraging.
