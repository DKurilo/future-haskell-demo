It has most of the features you’d expect to see, though it lacks some premium functionality and connectivity options. These shortcomings don’t affect the performance of the player, however, so if you’re only interested in a DVD player that literally does just that, this is a great option.","The player has a visually appealing design. Its slim black build lets it blend in with the other electronics in your home entertainment center. The power button on the front lets you know if the device is on, and all the buttons – power, start, stop and disc open – are clearly labeled and easy to press.","In our tests, the DVP-SR210P was easy to unpack, set up and use. It comes with a remote control and two AA batteries for the remote, and AV cables to connect it to your TV. However, unlike better DVD players, like the <a href=\"/panasonic-dvd-s700-review\">Panasonic DVD-S700</a>, it lacks a USB port and an HDMI output. This limits the player’s ability to connect to new TVs and take advantage of advanced functionality like upscaling, a process which improves the picture quality of old, low-resolution movies, sometimes up to 1080p full HD.","This Sony can handle foreign language audio tracks and subtitles. It also supports Dolby audio, so you can enjoy high-quality audio in your home theater while watching a DVD. The player also has a convenient automatic resume feature. This remembers right where you leave off in the most recent DVD you watched, say for a bathroom break, then it resumes playing your movie from that exact point whenever you’re ready to continue.","You can enjoy standard as well as rewriteable DVDs and CDs with the DVP-SR210P. It only supports region 1 DVDs, which only includes the United States and its territories, Canada and Bermuda. However, if you want to be able to watch movies from around the world, you’ll need a player that’s compatible with all regions. If you have questions or issues with the DVD player, you can contact Sony’s customer support representatives via chat, phone or email – whichever you prefer – or peruse the informational resources on their website. The product ships with a one-year warranty for parts and 90 days for labor."]},"id":"5056e28d-08d3-414e-8b3b-fae6a4159f05","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70211","url":"/sony-dvpsr210p-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-07T15:59:26Z","datePublished":"2018-09-07T15:59:26Z","name":"Sony DVPSR210P","synopsis":"With the Sony DVP-SR210P, you get a frills-free DVD player that is easy to set up and use.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The Sony DVP-SR210P is a basic, budget-friendly DVD player that works well, although it has limited features and connectivity options.","pros":["It has a solid warranty."],"cons":["It is slow to load and initiate disc playback."]},"strapline":"With the Sony DVP-SR210P, you get a frills-free DVD player that is easy to set up and use.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","id":"fVbkzyLD967DLMimUfYjwh","meta":{"title":"Sony DVPSR210P Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
