As a stationary printer, there is no battery power option. What it lacks in portability, it makes up for in versatility. To support the many specialty media options available, the printer comes with a detachable roll feeder and a detachable rear-feed tray. If you want to print onto disc labels, there is also an included tray for CDs and DVDs.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69031-epson-surecolor10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P79URTqC3HYfJevwCXSsmW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"P79URTqC3HYfJevwCXSsmW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P79URTqC3HYfJevwCXSsmW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b0bc815c-a659-40de-986d-46376e0ef0a0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One feature that would make the P400 easier to use is a display to go with its six control panel buttons. Since it doesn’t do standalone printing, it doesn’t need one for photo previews, but built-in displays usually double as control panels. With no display, using the P400’s physical controls feels like a bit of a guessing game, with only a few indicator LEDs providing feedback as you try to connect to Wi-Fi, change out ink cartridges, and switch the paper feed to roll paper and back."]},"id":"f00e19f5-c62f-4002-b6ed-b8a011a4f964","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"228e1cc6-73a4-4fb5-84f3-e39945d9787d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With so much focus on high-end photo printing, the SureColor P400 doesn’t have much support for casual users. While you can print from mobile devices over Wi-Fi using Epson’s iPrint app, there is no PictBridge support for printing from cameras directly and no support for external storage devices. Everything you print needs to be from a PC or mobile device. For photographers and designers who spend as much time editing images as they do shooting them, this is ideal, but the lack of standalone printing may be a hindrance for some."]},"id":"5d2c1bc8-349d-489a-ad67-c38bb500b766","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"12742c14-5ad7-4299-beb4-96abd02b415e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SureColor P400 is covered by Epson’s standard one-year warranty.
