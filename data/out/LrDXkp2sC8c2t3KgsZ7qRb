While it may seem like the software comes with a rather small number of included furnishings, in actuality the practically limitless resources of the 3D Warehouse guarantees you’ll be able to find the right styles and kinds of objects for your design scheme. You can even populate your rooms with 2D or 3D people, pets and autos for a more realistic experience.","A unique feature that is only found with Live Interior 3D is the Roofing Assistant. To access the Roofing Assistant, you must go through the Edit menu and choose the building option. Then, using Add AutoRoof to Current Storey, you can customize your roof. You have the ability to choose the height, angle, thickness and overhang of the roof. If you want to get really fancy, you can even change the height of the fascia. You will also find many roofing materials to choose from to get just the right look.","Once you have your home/room designed just the way you want, you can create a QuickTime movie walkthrough to show your spouse, architect, interior designer or client. No worries about moving too quickly or creating erratic camera movements. Live Interior 3D interior design software allows you to set up cameras along the route you want to take and tweak their placement until you’re happy with the results.","We’d really like to see the ability to generate basic electrical, HVAC and plumbing schemes especially in the Pro version since it’s geared towards the expert user who is likely using this product in a business."]},"id":"72a0d378-56c6-402e-af82-f935b3eb8b48","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"c801ffec-3db3-4df9-b241-d7321ebc276c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Live Interior 3D</strong> interior design software is remarkably easy to use. The developers have leveraged the Mac’s intuitive interface to create a polished software package that won’t intimidate even the most novice of users. If you click and drag a window or wall segment the software automatically adjusts and redraws the element to reflect the change. There are, however, still some tweaks that need to happen here in order to maintain structural integrity.","Minor drawbacks we found were the 3D navigation is a little tricky to get the hang of and we were unable to find a way to adjust the speed of walking other than changing the rendering speed which didn’t really help as much as we’d have liked. It wasn’t a big deal overall because after using the software for a while, the navigation became much easier to manage, however we would like to see click-and-drag control of the viewing aspect in 2D (floor plan) mode.
