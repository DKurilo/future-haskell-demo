The view screen outlines everything your little one captures in each photo, and then lets you view each of the pictures taken with the camera&#39;s playback mode. This <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">kids&#39; digital camera</a> lets your child take silent video, too. Your child can&#39;t move too quickly while recording, or the video will cut off when you play it back, but this is still a fun little feature that will impress young minds.","The resolution of the images this camera takes is rather low, but still impressive for a children&#39;s camera. It does come with a digital zoom for close-up shots, and a USB cable for easily uploading pictures and video to your computer. This camera lacks a flash, so pictures won&#39;t come out very bright unless there is adequate lighting. However, with too much light, the pictures look washed out.","This digital camera doesn&#39;t have as many features and functions as some other kids&#39; cameras. There are not any games programmed onto the camera. You can&#39;t edit photos on the camera, nor does it have photo effects. The camera does come in several different colors and styles, so each of your children can have one as individual as they are.","The Discovery Kids Digital Camera comes with a one-year warranty, which is impressive for a children&#39;s camera. However, other than a user guide that comes with the camera, there are not a lot of support options available. Customer service is provided by a third-party company whose website and contact number are on the bottom of the product box in very fine print."]},"id":"5d922c56-25b3-43f4-8e5f-9e4919bafbb7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3ffe430b-d780-4b9e-accb-02a4e200f85f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Discovery Kids Digital Camera is simple and a good value in spite of its limited number of features and functions.
