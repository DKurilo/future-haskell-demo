All of these channels were received with minimal breakup.","Where our downtown office simulated receiving TV signals in a city, our second location – a second-story apartment – simulates being in a suburban neighborhood. Outside of the apartment there are no structural obstacles that would disrupt the line of sight for the TV signal. Here we received 39 channels with the HDTV antenna.

It is a thicker piece of hard plastic that is meant to stand upright on a table top. The Micron comes with two small feet that stand the antenna upright on a table top. The feet slide into grooves on the back of the antenna. The problem is that they don’t latch on or grab on to the antenna. If you grab the antenna by the top and lift it up, the feet will fall off.

Amplified antennas require an additional power source, so the Micron will need to be plugged in to a wall.
