This rugged notebook has the typical MIL-STD 810G and IP65 certifications. It also has a Class 1 Div II certification. This is very useful for hazardous situations. It means that the device can be used in areas with dangerous gasses or particles and it won’t explode.","<strong>Rugged vs Semi-Rugged</strong>","Some manufacturers produce both rugged and semi-rugged laptops. A few laptops are called &#34;business rugged,&#34; which is not completely self-explanatory. Figuring out which rugged laptop is the best fit for you isn’t always easy. The terminology can be difficult to sift through, but each type has its own ideal use.","<strong>Rugged Laptops</strong>","These laptops are built to operate in any environment. Wind, rain, dust or even submersion won’t bring truly rugged laptops to their knees. They’re usually very expensive – but for good reason. Every part of the laptop is individually sealed and weatherproofed. This prevents any outside elements from interfering with the laptop’s ability to function. Usually, the screens are designed for outdoor use. They reduce glare and are viewable in direct sunlight. Fully rugged laptops function in extreme temperatures without any loss in performance.","<strong>Semi-Rugged Laptops</strong>","These durable laptops originally started out as a standard device that you could buy off of any shelf. However, they were adapted for adverse conditions through a ruggedization process. This process adds a sturdier case and puts any HDDs on a shock or gel mount to absorb impacts. While not as reliable or durable as fully rugged laptops, a semi-rugged laptop can still withstand very hot or cold environments; however, performance may suffer.","<strong>Business Rugged Laptops</strong>","The third type of rugged laptop is designed to handle extra wear and tear from travel. Generally, they don’t get any sort of weatherproofing treatment and should be used like a standard laptop. They aren’t suited to field work but are great for business people who travel often. Usually, HDDs have shock mounts, and business rugged laptop frames are sturdier than standard counterparts.","<strong>The Importance of Connectivity</strong>","In field work, connectivity is often an important feature. Connecting to other tools and devices is part of a normal day. The more ways you have to connect, the better. You never know when you might need to connect a new device to your laptop.","<strong>Wireless</strong>","Most rugged laptops have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities. Some come with cellular and GPS connectivity. All of them can be greatly beneficial in the right circumstances.","<strong>Ports</strong>","USB ports are standard on most laptops, including the rugged variety. However, there are a large number of other ports to consider. RJ-11, PCMCIA, IEEE, Serial and SD ports are some examples. Make sure your laptop has all of the ports you need now and might need in the future.","<strong>IP &amp; MIL-STD Ratings Explained</strong>","Exactly what do those durability ratings mean? How do they impact you and what you can expect from a durable laptop? These ratings can be confusing, so let’s break them down.","<strong>IP</strong>","The IP rating is not just for the United States; it is an international protection rating for most electronic devices. An IP rating lists two numbers. The first number refers to protection against solids and the second number pertains to liquids. Together, the IP rating signifies dust and water protection levels. The higher the number, the more rugged the product.","For example, an IP rating of 65 means that the laptop is dust tight and survived being doused by water from a nozzle. Bring that up to IP66 and the laptop can handle heavy seas and much more powerful streams of water. To reach complete protection from water for any length of time, you need a laptop with an IP rating of 68. This means it will continue to function normally while completely submersed in water.","<strong>MIL-STD</strong>","MIL-STD is the United States military standard for testing and certifying devices to meet military requirements. This is done by subjecting the device to various tests based on size, weight and use. The two main tests that apply to rugged laptops are 810F and 810G. The difference is the requirements for changing electromagnetic environments."]},"id":"cbadecc4-3e68-4235-bef5-2255fc0770b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"6e6c2f98-6be4-4717-8bdc-8eaae84ea05c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.handheldgroup.com/en/rugged-computer/tablets-notebooks/algiz-xrw/\">Algiz XRW</a>","<a href=\"http://us.getac.com/notebooks/b300/features.html\">Getac B Series</a>","<a href=\"http://us.getac.com/notebooks/S410/features.html\">Getac S Series</a>","<a href=\"http://us.getac.com/notebooks/V110/features.html\">Getac V Series</a>","<a href=\"http://geni.us/NEWRUGGEDLatitude12\">Latitude 12</a>","<a href=\"http://geni.us/DellRuggedLatitude14\">Latitude 14</a>","<a href=\"http://computers.amrel.com/rugged-computers/rugged-laptops-notebooks/rocky-rf10-rugged-laptop/\">ROCKY RF</a>","<a href=\"http://computers.amrel.com/rugged-computers/rugged-laptops-notebooks/rocky-rk10-rugged-laptop/\">ROCKY RK</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046TDY7C/?&tag=ttr_rugged_laptop-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|669[art|NA[pid|51032[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Toughbook 3 Series</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V8KG91A/?&tag=ttr_rugged_laptop-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|669[art|NA[pid|68555[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Toughbook 5 Series</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a2569c96-f788-4145-9114-684dfee63294","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_669","url":"/best-rugged-laptops","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-06T15:01:19Z","datePublished":"2016-11-08T23:04:11Z","name":"Rugged Laptop Review","synopsis":"When you work hard, you need a laptop that can keep up.
