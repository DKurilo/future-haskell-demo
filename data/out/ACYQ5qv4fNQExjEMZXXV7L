Because of this, they provide incredible clarity, good balance and crisp bass. These headphones work with a wide variety of music genres and are a favorite of DJs.","Although Beats are primarily made of plastic, the design is still tough and durable. The frame is reinforced with stainless steel, and the metal arms adjust for comfort while giving the headphones and overall minimalist appeal. Still, the fit is not that tight. The Beats EP will stay on your head while you walk around, but that extra space allows background noise to leak in.","The Beats EP comes in four different colors: red, blue, white and black. Beats are known for their style, and the EP models keep that iconic look with the logo prominently displayed on the ear. The cushions are comfortable, but the frame is rigid. The headphones don’t fold, which makes them harder to tote around.","A handy in-line mic and volume control means you can plug the headset into your phone and take calls without pulling it out of your pocket. Apple also provides integration with Siri, so you can press a button and get an answer from your iPhone.","The headphones come with a foldable carrying pouch and a 3.5mm audio plug. At over 4 feet, the cord is long enough to move around, though it’s not detachable, which makes it hard to store away. You may want to consider upgrading to a hard case to protect the frames when the headphones are not in use.","Beats by Dre is now a part of Apple, though consumer and product support is still provided through the main Beats website. The Beats EP headphones have their own page with troubleshooting guides and an online manual. Support is available through Apple phone customer service or email. The headphones come with a standard one-year warranty.","The Beats EP headphones are affordable compared to higher-end models by the company, but they still have the same cool styling and crisp sound. They aren’t the most portable pair of headphones, with a headset that doesn’t fold and a cord that can’t detach. Overall, this is a good starter set of stereo headphones if you want the Beats brand without paying an exorbitant price."]},"id":"3e10ff2f-b215-4653-9ad2-dde0ba0ee075","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68749","url":"/beats-ep-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-09T19:15:46Z","datePublished":"2016-11-09T19:15:46Z","name":"Beats EP","synopsis":"Beats EP stereo headphones have a frequency response of 20 to 20,000Hz, which is the range of normal human hearing.
