You can look for software that&#39;s Section 508 certified so you know it meets the government-mandated accessibility requirements right off the bat.","Even though voice recognition software is popular, it is still not built into laptops or desktop computers. Professionals will want to look for software that has an advanced vocabulary and is accurate in its voice dictation capabilities, but speech-to-text software has many specialties to choose from. There is software geared for professionals, software geared more toward home use, and software with apps on your phone. The more advanced the software is, the more interchangeable it is between those environments. Dragon Professional, for example, sets itself apart with its ability to implement professional terminology along with everyday language.","Voice recognition software, particularly the Dragon NaturallySpeaking series from Nuance, offers software that is legally certified as a professional tool for disabled workers. Dragon Professional 13 has the ability to look through your emails and Microsoft Word documents for terms associated with your professional life, and it incorporates them into its dictation so that it will comprehend your speech more accurately when you use uncommon words that are vital to your professional life.","Students with disabilities have also found speech recognition software useful. The University of New Hampshire released an article saying,  Students who have used speech-recognition tools to independently produce typed essays can complete assignments with results that are indistinguishable from the work of their non-disabled peers. ","Students and professionals can also use voice recognition software simply to take notes, whether they purchase advanced software or simpler, less expensive versions such as Voice Finger and Tazti. Commands are usually separate from dictation functions, so you can turn off the commands and just speak to the computer as it takes down your words.","Voice dictation tools are not limited to computers, which is good news for people who do not want to lug their laptops around to work or school. There are multiple apps for voice dictation, and many allow you to take notes on your phone and then transfer them to your computer later. ViaTalk, one type of voice recognition software like this, has the added benefit of transcribing a variety of languages.","These innovations have made it easier for disabled students and professionals to navigate folders, set up specialized commands and take simple notes. Even though voice recognition software might not become a built-in tool with laptops and desktop computers anytime soon, it is undeniably useful in the classroom and office as software."]},"id":"42a922de-c466-4fc4-8c8c-1922e81ec074","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8807","url":"/508-compliance-voice-recognition-software-for-people-with-disabilities","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"mikayla-beyer","url":"/author/mikayla-beyer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Mikayla Beyer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"XigrdqGY58xDgLYnenurpj","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-30T20:03:21Z","datePublished":"2014-09-30T20:03:21Z","name":"508 Compliance: Voice Recognition Software for People with Disabilities","synopsis":"With voice recognition software, some people find dictation software easy to use in school and at work.","review":{},"strapline":"With voice recognition software, some people find dictation software easy to use in school and at work.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-30T20:32:57Z","id":"aqXK8ApgaJiNjdx8mNMHvj","meta":{"title":"508 Compliance: Voice Recognition Software for People with Disabilities","description":"Voice recognition software can streamline projects at the office for people with disabilities.
