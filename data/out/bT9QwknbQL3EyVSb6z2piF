You get the basics to monitor and protect your home with a SimpliSafe starter kit. While we originally tested the company’s Economy Package, we’ve updated our review to reflect a kit called The Protect, which we tested after SimpliSafe released new hardware in early 2018. Initial setup is easy, and the step-by-step instructions ensure you don&#39;t miss anything. Using the system is simple, too, and unlike many of the kits we tested, SimpliSafe has a battery and internet connection backup in case your power goes out.","So many DIY security systems lack simple features that make self-monitoring your home easy. SimpliSafe covers some of these well, such as alerts when there&#39;s a lost connection or power. The app is as intuitive as it gets – you can quickly arm and disarm your system with a tap on your smartphone&#39;s touchscreen. You also get an overview of what&#39;s going on in your house if you have a smoke detector, thermometer and carbon monoxide detector set up with the system. You can also view the activity feed from the app, so you can see who has come or gone, whether your home is armed or if some event tripped an alarm."]},"id":"e1695a94-ef15-4bdc-91e1-4c0df8fb7ef2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/prUByUh8dx3LU8eALjmRHi.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58874-simplisafe10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/prUByUh8dx3LU8eALjmRHi.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"prUByUh8dx3LU8eALjmRHi","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/prUByUh8dx3LU8eALjmRHi.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e880ff52-80e7-4d37-8f9a-7b3f1afcb921","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SimpliSafe uses a cellular connection to operate in your home, and its backup connection is your home internet.

For example, text and email alerts as well as smartphone controls are only available with SimpliSafe&#39;s pricier professional monitoring plan, Interactive, which costs $24.99 a month. Likewise, this premium plan lets you set up secret alerts on specific areas, like a gun or liquor cabinet.","The company also offers a basic professional monitoring plan, Standard, that&#39;s less expensive, $14.99 a month, but it doesn&#39;t include these extras. SimpliSafe’s Standard plan is one of the best values for monitoring in our comparison.

While you can use the included instruction booklet to set up the system without an internet or cellular connection, you need to visit a website to activate your monitoring plan. The system has a 72-hour practice mode after you activate your account, so this lets you get used to using your home security system without accidentally setting off an alarm and dispatching emergency personnel.","The SimpliSafe&#39;s starter kit we tested includes a base station, wireless keypad, four door and window sensors, a motion detector, and decals to deter intruders. The basic kit even includes a large sign with a stake so you can place this in your yard. You can get this kit for around $270, which is a little more expensive than the average for DIY systems, but still quite affordable. We like that SimpliSafe’s latest hardware is more attractive than its older equipment. In particular, the keypad has a bright display that shows your system status and lets you change settings as needed."]},"id":"590f2866-d61d-4ac4-8e10-f9729bde250b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/UqGPHvrGzSt9Xjipc5G3WW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58874-simplisafe13.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UqGPHvrGzSt9Xjipc5G3WW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"UqGPHvrGzSt9Xjipc5G3WW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UqGPHvrGzSt9Xjipc5G3WW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"20086c58-be30-43ed-a475-7900ef1368d8","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SimpliSafe offers a variety of extra sensors you can purchase separately that work with the base station to let you know if a window breaks or a door opens.

The company also sells a security camera, SimpliCam, but its $4.99 monthly fee for video storage is separate from monitoring fees you already pay for the system.","One of the reasons we consider SimpliSafe one of the best DIY home security systems available is its three-year warranty.
