You will no longer need to remember to pack your game cartridges or discs because they are obsolete. Now you can download and store games on the PSP&#39;s 16GB hard drive and other removable memory devices. This portable gaming system also comes with Skype, video streaming and music options to make it another great pick for the best handheld video games and our <strong>TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award</strong> winner."]},"id":"ee8a46d6-d895-40e9-933a-1d08ec4c6c68","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"6209fe5d-484d-4787-aa77-16017e1a3a02","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The PSP Go is the lightest of all the handheld gaming devices we reviewed. Because it weighs only 5.57 ounces, it can easily fit in your pocket, making it simple to take with you while you are on the move. The Go model is quite a bit smaller than the original PSP device. Although its size is smaller than other devices we reviewed, it is just as powerful and offers a great selection of important features.","You can control the games with the analog stick on the left side of the device. If you are already familiar with the Sony PlayStation, you will be glad to find that they have kept the same setup on the new control panel. By using the already familiar triangle, circle, x and square buttons, you will not have to get used to new icons representing your choices. Considering the size of the device and its large screen, PlayStation has created a great model that is relatively easy to use.","The PSP Go is available for purchase in white and black, and its matte finish helps you avoid unsightly fingerprints. In addition, a built-in microphone and webcam enable a few different multimedia options such as Skype calls, internet browsing and internet radio. These features are sure to keep you entertained when you are on the go."]},"id":"acd21540-241b-43aa-bb5f-be6370b4cb61","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Physical Features"},"id":"a3e26240-8ee7-4cdd-bbab-ec49e45975c1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The handheld game console has built-in Wi-Fi that enables you to download the latest games, music, movies, TV shows and comics instantly. There is no need to wait in lines at the local Wal-Mart for the newest game, and you won’t ever have to worry about losing or breaking your games because everything is stored on the hard drive. This feature also helps the device be even more portable because you don’t have to remember to carry around the UMD discs or cartridges.","One of the more innovative features included with this handheld game console is a Skype feature. The Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and webcam capabilities enable an effortless connection to Skype. You can call your friends or chat online, all for free. To download the application, simply click on the Sony icon on the Skype homepage and follow the directions. The download process only takes a few minutes.","Browsing the internet with this portable game console is much like it is with a cell phone. The sites are slow to load and there is no Flash capability. That being said, the browsing is as fast on the PSP Go model as it is on any of its competitors. Internet browsing is especially fast and useful when you&#39;re visiting news sites and other websites without Flash widgets. You can also read and send emails using the device.","For all the parents considering purchasing one of these devices for their children, PlayStation offers an array of parental control features. These controls can be accessed under the options menu of the system. Use these to manage the type of games that your kids can download or play. You can stop games geared toward a mature audience from being played. You can also monitor the videos your kids play and the content they view online. PlayStation does its best to help keep your children safe and unexposed to adult and violent material.","This product has more internal memory than any of its competitors do, largely because there are no cartridges or discs to play handheld video games. There is 15GB of memory included with the device, but there is more external memory available that can increase the storage capacity to 32GB. You can use this storage to keep games, videos, music, photos and other digital files.","The screen is bright and can be seen in daytime or at night equally as well. The screen resolution is fantastic at 480 by 272 pixels. The 32-bit color support is also excellent. Overall, the graphics on this device are akin to the PlayStation 2, and the screen has outstanding picture quality."]},"id":"01a7bc41-f8e1-454f-a982-e3e55f1d68dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Multimedia"},"id":"0a7913ed-e6c8-42b6-93f3-1ce5ab0dc209","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This portable game console is a terrific multimedia device.

You can directly download video from the PlayStation Network. This process takes only a few minutes and there are thousands of movies and TV shows to choose from. You can also transfer the material from your computer. If you have a PS3, you can transfer content from it to your PSP Go system.
