The Viking Range VCFF136D is a small stainless steel french door refrigerator has a professional, industrial-grade look, but it is missing some of the amenities found in less expensive, but similar french door fridges. The fridge has a total capacity of 19.8 cubic feet – the fresh food compartment is 14.8 cubic feet and the freezer compartment is 5 cubic feet.","This fridge is on the small side, but still has five shelves in the fresh food compartment. These shelves consist of one stationary full-width shelf, three half-width shelves and one mini-shelf. All of these shelves are spillproof, so messes are easy to contain. You can adjust the humidity level in the two crisper bins to the best level for each type of produce. You can also change the temperature in the full-width drawer to suit food items like meats and cheeses or beverages. The doors of the fresh food compartment have seven bins on them, but these are not as spacious as you would think. One bin is a dairy compartment and two can hold gallon-sized bottles, but two bins are small and can only hold a single can of soda or condiment bottle.","The freezer compartment has two tiers and four bins for storing your frozen items. The top tier consists of two separately sliding drawers so that you don&#39;t have to pull out both drawers simultaneously. The ice dispenser is in the refrigeration compartment, which means if you want to store ice in the freezer, you have to dump the ice in one of the bins. This model does not have a portable ice bin, so the easiest way to get ice is through the external water and ice dispenser. Keep in mind that this dispenser only has cubed ice and won&#39;t make crushed ice.","Viking Range offers several warranties on this fridge, including a three-year warranty on parts and labor. The sealed cooling  system is covered by an impressive 12-year warranty. The stainless steel finish is covered by a lifetime warranty."]},"id":"0421bac7-2beb-4093-9edc-0c6971dfe9ef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"db5fbe73-bd9f-4f65-8ee1-119b2910e2d5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Viking Range is known for making professional-grade appliances, and while this fridge certainly fits the profile, it falls short in a few areas.
