Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top </em><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\"><em>3D Printers</em></a><em> here.</em>","From the Czech company be3D, the DeeGreen 3D printer is an ecological PLA printer. With both an SD card slot and a touchscreen monitor, this printer is easy to connect and control. A wide selection of PLA filament and a lengthy warranty ensure a long printing life for this 3D printer.","Like many consumer 3D printers, the build size of the DeeGreen is on the small side. A 6 x 6 x 6-inch print capacity is large enough for only a few 3D objects. The maximum print speed is 90 mm/s, which is only slightly above average for comparable 3D printers. Calibration features are one area that can help improve print quality, but this printer doesn’t have any manual calibration settings. Before 3D printing, the printer does check for print height during an auto-leveling process but allows for little else.","This easy-load 3D printer prints with PLA, an environmentally safe plastic. Replacement cartridges from the company are relatively inexpensive compared to those produced by other 3D printer manufacturers. The DeeGreen also accepts universal cartridges, so you can buy 3D printing materials from other sources. This printer only has one print head, so you can only print with one color at a time.","This solid metal printer is a good example of fully enclosed 3D printers. With three separate magnetic doors, heated parts are never exposed which minimizes your risk of getting burned. When open, the doors also pause printing automatically. Some of the doors on the model we tested wouldn’t shut right, but for the most part, the enclosed design was a nice feature. Also included in this 50 pound printer is a separate filament compartment, which is highly convenient and makes it especially easy to change out different colors. The magnetic build plate is glass and very easy to remove, which makes removing your 3D designs easy as well.","A touchscreen navigation system is mounted on the front of the printer, so you can control printing without plugging in your laptop. We found the touchscreen to be a bit fickle as it would frequently freeze up. The longer we had the printer on, however, the better the screen seemed to respond. Since this printer was manufactured outside of the U.S., the default language is Czech, but you can very easily switch to English or Slovak. Connecting your computer and your 3D files to the printer is pretty simple. You can either connect your computer via the USB cable or save files to the SD card and plug it into the printer for wireless printing. We found that the SD card slot was a little inconvenient to use as the card kept getting stuck. When it did work, it was a nice addition to be able to unplug our laptop during the duration of the printing process. The DeeGreen printer and the DeeControl software also work with both Windows and Mac operating systems, so they&#39;re compatible with nearly any computer.","Included with the DeeGreen printer is everything you need to start printing right away. The easy-to-use software is simple to install and requires little to no training. However, this means you aren’t free to modify 3D designs as much as you can with other powerful programs. A power cord, USB cable, maintenance tools, starter filament cartridge and other accessories are all supplied, so you don&#39;t need to purchase anything except for extra filament when you run out. During our review of the DeeGreen, we used the included red PLA and found that it was high-quality filament.","Although be3D is located in the Czech Republic, you still have many help and support resources. Phone numbers and email addresses are listed on the website. The user manual and website both come in English options as well. Also, this printer is available from many different U.S. suppliers, so you can always refer to U.S.-based customer support. A two-year warranty covers this printer from any defect and is much longer than the traditional one-year offered by other companies."]},"id":"0ab08714-4d7f-4f2c-a644-3b0c7b1416a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"12406034-b03e-479c-ba0a-21d68e00ff44","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The DeeGreen is a great desktop 3D printer for safely printing small objects.
