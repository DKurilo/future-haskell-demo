This feature lets people track your location for safety or to cheer you on in a race.","Another feature is Segments. These short distances – usually anywhere from a half mile up to 10 miles – are tracked for every cyclist who rides that specific route. Your time uploads to Garmin Connect through your smartphone. While riding a segment, the Edge 1000 tells you how far off the average pace you are, indicates how much distance remains, and displays a map of the segment. This feature is especially helpful if you’re competitive and want to compare yourself against other cyclists riding that segment.","This bike GPS also lets you see incoming text messages and calls right on its screen. This feature is limited to seeing who is trying to contact you; you can’t take a call or read a text.","A new feature on the Edge 1000 that will appeal to the serious cyclist is its ability to communicate with the Shimano Di2 gear platform.
