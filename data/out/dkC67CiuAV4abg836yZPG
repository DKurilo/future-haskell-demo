Hereâ€™s more on choosing a set to meet your needs, along with detail on how we arrived at our ranking of these 10 products.</em>","When a youngster shows an interest in science, it&#39;s always good to keep that idea alive. An age-appropriate chemistry set can enhance a student&#39;s understanding of chemistry, lab procedures and overall science education. You can find safe chemistry kits for young students, although you should always be around to supervise experiments. In addition, you can buy great chemistry sets with professional-quality supplies and materials for older students.","All three of our top-ranked chemistry sets are excellent products are made by Thames &amp; Kosmos, which enjoys the reputation of making first-rate chemistry sets and other educational materials.","To find out more regarding chemistry kits for kids, take a look at our <a href=\"/home-and-garden\">articles on chemistry sets</a>.","A good chemistry set enriches your child&#39;s curiosity about how materials interact, how everyday processes work and how to conduct an experiment using the scientific method and systematic procedures. A chemistry set for kids with excellent written instructions guides your child through experiments that can be enjoyable as well as educational.","When shopping for a chemistry set, be sure to note the recommended age for each kit. Some of the lower-ranked kits might not offer the comprehensiveness of the top-rated sets, but they would be appropriate for beginners. For other educational materials for youngsters, check our <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">Kids Microscopes</a> site.","<strong><strong>Chemistry Sets: What We Tested, What We Found</strong></strong>","<strong>Experiments</strong><br/>One of the first things we considered when examining chemistry sets for kids was the number and type of experiments. The best chemistry kits are multi-functional and offer numerous potential experiments that explore a number of scientific principles. Generally, older students gravitate toward the science kits that include the greatest number of experiments since many of these are more complex to conduct and more sophisticated to understand.","<strong>Supplies</strong><br/>The next major component we examined is what supplies come with a particular chemistry kit. The sets we reviewed include many common lab items such as beakers, measuring spoons and cups, safety glasses, and pipettes. Some of the specialized kits have custom supplies that are not standard lab equipment but are designed specifically for particular experiments.","Kits that emphasize safety are a real boon for you and your children. Good-quality kits come with safety glasses and are especially good if an included thermometer does not use mercury but red dye instead, which avoids any risks posed by mercury should a thermometer break.","<strong>Chemicals</strong><br/>We also examined the chemicals included in each science kit. Our highest-ranking products contain everything you need to conduct experiments. Generally, most kits come with some elements and solutions, but certain products also require you to purchase additional substances to complete or repeat certain experiments. Some kits do not include chemicals at all, and you have to provide your own from around the house or buy specialty chemicals.","For these kits, at least a few things require a trip to a grocery store, hardware store or shopping website. For specialty chemicals, Best Science Supplies is a good choice. If you live in an area where grocery shopping is scarce or you are pressed for time, a kit that comes closest to being all-inclusive is a better choice than one that requires you to supply additional supplies.","<strong>Learning Materials</strong><br/>Another key portion of the best science kits is the quality of the learning materials that are included. Without learning materials, these sets would not provide much more than mysterious concoctions. In order to really discover and retain ideas presented in a chemistry experiment, you have to perform it correctly and understand the underlying concepts.","Each kit presented here comes with an experiment procedure manual and some explanation of the scientific principles involved in each test. Other kits take it a step further and provide detailed background information about each experiment and, in some cases, general scientific information. Well-written manuals offer clear directions, address safety procedures and discuss proper disposal of chemicals once an experiment is finished.","<strong><strong>Our Verdict and Recommendations</strong></strong>","The best set in our product lineup, the CHEM C3000, is designed essentially for youngsters aged 12 and up, although it would be completely appropriate for high school students who already have a reasonably solid knowledge of science and can handle advanced experiments. With this chemistry set, you can conduct 333 experiments.","The second set in our lineup is the CHEM C2000, intended for students age 11 and up, which presents a generous 250 experiments in several key scientific fields.","Our third-ranked product, the CHEM C1000, is another well-equipped science kit for kids that offers 125 different experiments.","If you want your child exposed to concepts that include chemistry, but also emphasize other scientific ideas and experiments, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">Elements of Science</a>. If you are seeking a very basic chemistry project kit for a younger child that is budget-friendly, you might also check <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">Chemistry 60</a>.","Whether you have a child who is just getting started with a chemistry kit that contains only a few basic supplies or a teen who is determined to win first place at the state science fair, there is a great chemistry set for him or her. The information included here can help you decide which kids&#39; chemistry set is best for your aspiring scientist."]},"id":"8306b289-bdfe-4aca-8eda-e0756628fbbe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0b8ae7c8-ea26-4f22-be57-dfaf220d1ef6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UU3REC/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49703[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">CHEM C3000</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UU3RCY/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49704[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">CHEM C2000</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006YYOO?tag=ttr_chemistry_sets1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49705[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">CHEM C1000</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JZ8A1M/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49706[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Elements of Science</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UU3RFG/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|59991[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Spectacular Science</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BURAP2/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49707[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Mind Blowing Science</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X48HEY/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49708[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">CHEM C500</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thames-Kosmos-First-Chemistry-Science/dp/B00B9BFU5Y/?tag=ttr_chemistry_sets1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|57304[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Kids First Chemistry Set</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MR05HM/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49710[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Chemistry 60</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033UWMK0/?&tag=ttr_chemistry_sets-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|535[art|NA[pid|49712[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">CHEM C100 Test Lab</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"46c3690a-e9a3-4a52-978b-408f2c02473c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_535","url":"/best-chemistry-sets","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-07T20:42:59Z","datePublished":"2015-09-10T16:09:57Z","name":"Chemistry Sets Review","synopsis":"Your children can enjoy and learn from chemistry sets that range from those offering snazzy tricks to academically challenging activities.
