You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Honeywell <a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">room humidifier</a> provides warm humidity to the air in your home and offers relief from allergies, cold symptoms and dry, itchy skin. It emits 3 gallons of water every 24 hours on its low setting and is ideal for use in rooms up to 500 square feet. If you live in a cold climate, you will appreciate its soothing warm mist.","The Honeywell HWM-950 is an evaporative rather than an ultrasonic humidifier. It operates by pushing air through a wick that is submerged in water. The wick is made out of porous material that absorbs water from the tank, providing a larger surface area so that the water can easily evaporate. This allows the humidifier to distribute more moisture into the air.","Hot steam and water can burn a child if they get too close. Since this is a warm mist humidifier, it uses hot water to function. Use safety precautions when operating this unit, especially if there are children around.","This air humidifier has two output settings so you can adjust how much or how little mist you want the unit to dispense. The mist rises from the top of the unit and it passes by the medicine cup, which you can fill with inhalants to help relieve irritated nasal passages.","Although the manufacturer claims this unit has an operating time of 24 hours, it will not operate for that long on a high output setting because its small water tank only holds 0.7 gallons. However, if it does run out of water, it has an automatic shut-off mechanism that will engage to prevent the motor from overheating.","Even though this home humidifier has an indicator light that tells you when it is out of water, the tanks dark plastic construction makes it difficult to see when it needs a refill. It also makes it hard to see when it needs to be cleaned.","Be aware that some consumers have complained about water leaking from the tank. Always place this humidifier on a water-resistant or absorbent surface such as a towel. Do not place it on expensive furniture or hardwood flooring. It comes with a three-year guarantee so if there is excessive leaking, you can return it for a replacement."]},"id":"2b8e449a-0200-4ca1-8518-b7b631dd8051","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5ac3505a-cb58-4d62-89eb-3149d20b8dfd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you live in a cold climate and want, an affordable warm mist humidifier with a good steam output, this humidifier works well.
