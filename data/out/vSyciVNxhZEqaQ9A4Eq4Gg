You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Maxi-Cosi is one of the few international companies in our <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> lineup. The company operates out of 10 different locations worldwide, with its main offices in France and the Netherlands. However, you can purchase its products, including the <strong>Maxi-Cosi Pebble</strong> baby car seat, almost anywhere in the world. The company&#39;s website has a convenient tool for locating local retailers in its top navigation bar.","Because Maxi-Cosi doesn&#39;t have to comply with U.S. regulations, some of the safety features that are standard for popular car seats are not available in the Pebble. The maximum weight and height limit of this car seat is less than most car seats with a 28-pound and 30-inch height limit. There is no documentation on crash-testing results, and while the sides of the seat are cushy and soft, Maxi-Cosi doesn&#39;t indicate whether the sides offer specific side-impact protection.","The seat does, however, have LATCH connectors that secure the stay-in-car base, and the seat is compliant with FAA guidelines, meaning you&#39;re fine to take this car seat on a plane. Level indicators on the sides of the unit will show whether the seat is at the proper and safest angle.","The Maxi-Cosi Pebble excels in the user-friendly category of our review. The cushion covering is removable and machine washable for easy cleanup. Although there is almost no writing on the installation instructions, the step-by-step pictures are simple and straightforward, which was definitely done intentionally to avoid translating it into multiple languages.","The instructions clearly show how to adjust the harness to best fit your child, and the carry handle can adjust to three different positions. You&#39;ll know when the handle is locked when it makes an audible clicking sound. While it&#39;s intended to be used with the Maxi-Cosi baby travel systems, the seat is compatible with most other strollers as well.","Once your child is in the baby car seat and the seat is safely attached to the stay-in-car base, you can increase the snugness of the harness with a convenient center-pull adjustment strap at the bottom of the seat. You can also make the seat recline as though your child were chilling in an easy chair. Additional accessories, a canopy and a removable headrest are available as well.","Maxi-Cosi&#39;s website has a specific product page for the Pebble with a downloadable user manual and FAQs. There is no information on how to contact the company directly, so you have to work through one of its vendors. You can access a tool to locate a local retailer on its website to find the vendor closest to you. Maxi-Cosi also offers a two-year warranty for this product."]},"id":"44ba8677-1111-432e-92ac-57db7e134e84","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"64651a71-3c78-4a85-a918-2dd6384c0212","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Maxi-Cosi Pebble</strong> is a great solution for an easy-to-use baby travel system.
