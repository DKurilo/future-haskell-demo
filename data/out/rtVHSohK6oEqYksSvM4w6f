This <a href=\"/best-typing-for-kids-software\">kids typing program</a> also has five typing games to choose from, which will help keep your child interested in the learning process.","The typing for kids software application has 20 typing levels that teach your children the basic keyboard letters, as well as the numbers, and punctuation keys found at the top of the keyboard. Unfortunately, these are the only numbers that your student will learn how to type, as the typing for kids program doesn’t include typing lessons that cover the 10-key keypad.","As kids type using Roller Typing, they’ll learn about the importance of proper technique and gaining a typing rhythm. They will also learn where to place their fingers. With repeated practice, they’ll be able to train their fingers to find the keys automatically. This will help kids increase their typing speed and accuracy.","As they make their way through the kids typing program, you can track your child&#39;s improvements using the application&#39;s charts and stats section. As they increase in speed and accuracy, your children can make their way into Star Row or Z-Hall of Fame.","A huge downside to this typing for kids software application is the lack of typing tests or additional practice material, such as articles.","This typing software for kids allows them to navigate through orange cones, rollerblade off ramps and do flips over cows as they type the correct letters. Elementary school teachers designed this kids’ typing program to meet the interests and abilities of their students and to teach them effectively how to type.","Roller Typing includes a hand diagram that displays the keys each finger is responsible for pressing. In reports, you can see how accurately your student hits each key. This way you can know which keys they need to practice typing. It also gives you their accuracy per finger.","Kids can choose from five typing events, including sidewalk action, speed rollerblading, half pipe, cow jumping and dodging orange cones. They can also choose which level they want to work on. For instance, some of the levels children can select help them practice key groupings or complementary keys.","Roller Typing should be simple enough for an 8-year-old to use while keeping it fun and challenging for older audiences as well. The navigation buttons in this kids typing software are easy to understand. We also liked how they present typing statistics. You can see which fingers type which keys, and how accurately your kids found those keys.","This typing for kids program is lacking in the help and support area, but does include a few options, including FAQs for the PC and Mac versions. If you are unable to find the answers to your questions here, you can also send an email to support."]},"id":"05a5df27-c4e4-4273-86dc-048fb40b9f55","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cea8e63d-7786-48ca-b0c6-1ef4061e05d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This kids typing software is entertaining and can help children increase their typing speed and accuracy.
