This company is a law firm that has a web page that makes them look nothing like a law firm, but that is far from the most important fact about this company. The most important fact about this company is that they do debt settlement  without following the traditional model. This firm missed the top of the rankings because we don&#39;t feel this self-directed model is for everyone, but they still outrank most in our lineup for maintaining their excellent reputation in a business field with a bad reputation.","Instead of collecting the money you would have spent on barely keeping up with your monthly payments, NegotiateBills helps you set up your own savings account. You monitor your own savings and you keep control of your own savings. Meanwhile they work out deals with your creditors so that your savings will have somewhere to go.","Many settlement firms instruct you to send your savings to them. They handle everything from there. If they&#39;re trustworthy, that’s great. If they are not, that’s a problem. At the end of the day we prefer one that does all the work for you, that’s trustworthy. NegotiateBills.com appears to be trustworthy but they don’t do all the work for you.","They let you manage your own savings.","Many of the people in the market for debt negotiation are there as a result of their inability to manage their own money. In the NegotiateBills.com model, they are still mostly in charge of their situation, and that might not be the best idea. However, there are those who just had a few unplanned expenses that landed them in dire financial circumstances. Those candidates for debt settlement, along with reformed recreational spenders, may benefit from this type of system."]},"id":"698645c0-1f6b-4b8b-a126-4367feb318a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Cost &amp; Fees"},"id":"29bb7841-25d7-4099-b909-c70a522a3f44","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["NegotiateBills.com charges 10-15 percent of whatever debt amount they are settling for you.
