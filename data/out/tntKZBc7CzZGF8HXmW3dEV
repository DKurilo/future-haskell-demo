The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-Ray Player Reviews</a> here.</em>","Blu-ray players have become more affordable than ever. Since the official release of Blu-ray in 2006, the cost of Blu-ray players has dropped dramatically. Pioneer, unlike other Blu-ray manufactures, continues to give its   players expensive price tags.","The Pioneer BDP-150 has the quality and features to make our list with its ability to play 3D Blu-rays and multiple video formats including DivX. When you connect this player to the internet you can use apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Pandora and Picasa to watch videos, listen to music and view pictures.","Like the best Blu-ray players we reviewed, this player is DLNA certified. With this capability, you can create your own home network between your Blu-ray player and mobile devices that are also DLNA certified. With the Pioneer control app, you can control the basic functions of your Blu-ray player with your mobile device.","This player is Wi-Fi ready, but does not have built-in Wi-Fi. Unlike other top rated players we have reviewed, Pioneer makes you buy the AS-WL300 wireless connector separately. This is something that was disconcerting since other less costly players already make this available to you.","The BDP-150 plays video at full HD 1080p quality, yet it can’t upscale videos or DVDs of lower video quality to reach 1080p quality. This is a feature that almost all other Blu-ray players we reviewed had. Without the ability to upscale lower resolution videos, it is no surprise that this player doesn’t have Ultra 4K upscaling capabilities either, which raises the quality of your 1080p display by 4x.","The rear panel on this Pioneer Blu-ray player does boast a number of ways to connect with other devices. This is one of the few players we reviewed that features analog outputs. This can especially be nice if you have an older TV or receiver that you are hooking your Blu-ray up to, even though we don’t recommend playing your HD movies on a lower resolution television."]},"id":"f1ac1fc2-0b72-4a70-ac91-f304a3528650","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"98ba46a0-70cb-495f-93f4-9a5068e1e757","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are many less expensive Blu-ray players that can do as much or more than the Pioneer BDP-150.
