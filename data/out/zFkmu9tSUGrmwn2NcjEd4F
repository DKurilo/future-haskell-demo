It uses reverse osmosis to filter the water, and this water filter system features a one-year warranty.","You can reduce up to 25 contaminants with this water filter system, including impurities common inn unfiltered tap water such as sodium, arsenic and cysts. Additionally, the system can reduce chlorine that adds a poor taste and odor to your water.","However, this tap water system doesn&#39;t filter all the types of contaminants that the best systems do. It cannot remove mercury, herbicides or bacteria from your drinking water, while many similar products offer these capabilities.","This Kenmore water filtration system uses reverse osmosis to filter your water. Reverse osmosis works by using a semipermeable membrane. Only certain elements and components are able to pass through the membrane while others are filtered out. Furthermore, this system offers many of the performance features you will find in similar products. It can produce up to 14.5 gallons in 24 hours. Its water pressure ranges from 40 to 100 psi, and the water temperature ranges from 40 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. This filter produces a water flow of 0.5 gallons per minute.","There is a chrome faucet included with this faucet water system, but there are no options available for different designs of the faucet. This water system also includes a water tank that can store up to 4.0 gallons of water. The <a href=\"/waterchef-water-filter-review\">WaterChef U9000</a> comes with a variety of faucets to match your kitchen’s design.","This under-the-sink system features three cartridges. These cartridges have a lifespan of up to six months, which is on the low end for water filters. However, this system features a notification light directly on the included faucet that will tell you when to replace a filter. This allows you to keep an eye on this system&#39;s filters without any hassle.","This water filtration system can take up a lot of space under your sink. It is approximately 15 inches wide, 15 inches tall and 16 inches long. It weighs approximately 13 pounds. It is easy to install, and replacing filters is as easy as twisting them on and off.","The Kenmore Reverse Osmosis Drinking Water System is covered under a one-year warranty, which seems short for this advanced of a product. If you have any questions or concerns about this system, email and telephone support options are available. We were disappointed in the support we received from the company, as nobody responded to any of our multiple email inquiries there was no live chat support to help us easily answer questions while online."]},"id":"57e10da2-068c-41b9-9ffc-bde94f83d305","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"388f51c6-8ac9-4e17-acc0-827a699baee3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore Reverse Osmosis System provides clean and delicious-tasting water in your home.
