Features like registry repair, system advisor and uninstaller can remove problems and keep your PC working smoothly. One-click buttons and a colorful, easy-to-use interface make BoostSpeed fun to use too.","A one-click scan inside BoostSpeed will analyze your whole computer for errors and problems. On our test computer, we found over a thousand issues in a matter of minutes. Once BoostSpeed is finished analyzing your system, you can click the Repair All button, or fix each problem individually for more control. Like with the best utility software, each major trouble area is broken down on different tabs such as disk space, computer speed and privacy protection. From there, you can go directly to the source of your issues. Despite this easy scan-and-fix process, BoostSpeed is missing some helpful tools you usually find with this type of software, such as secure deletion, system backup and shortcut repair. If you don&#39;t need these features, however, BoostSpeed can still speed up your processes.","BoostSpeed only has a few diagnostic tools. The system health tab shows a diagnosis for disk space, computer speed and privacy protection. Along with system information like this, you can also find file settings, but that&#39;s it. There is no information for driver statistics, failure monitors or control of partition management. Although this utility software is missing some key diagnostic elements, you&#39;ll still be able to fix common problems with your PC.","Like the best utility optimizers, BoostSpeed has many optimization tools to get your PC running faster. With one button you can repair a hard drive, fix your registry, and optimize RAM all at the same time. BoostSpeed doesn&#39;t help with software updates or Windows, but it does have handy fixes for the other optimization needs of your system.","Auslogics has various support options available to help you use BoostSpeed. FAQs and email are both on the website to answer your questions. The license covers three of your computers so you won&#39;t have to buy the software multiple times."]},"id":"67d8d2cf-f086-4ec2-9d52-0b70957fadf9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fe5b0a74-45cc-4b81-8495-4f9df4641cd9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["BoostSpeed might not have all the features to keep your PC in the best shape, but it does what it says: boosts speed.
