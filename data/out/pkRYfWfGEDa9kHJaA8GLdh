Rather, we approached this as a buying guide for what you should look for in a walk-in tub and how you can find the best tub for your bathroom.","<strong>Size &amp; Fill Capacity</strong><br/>Walk-in tubs vary in size. Some are taller than they are wide. Others are wider than they are tall. The size you choose depends mostly on what fits in your bathroom. Most tubs are designed to fill the space of a traditionally sized bathtub. However, the fill capacity is typically much greater in a walk-in tub, often reaching up to 70 gallons, which is 20 to 25 gallons more than a traditional tub.   ","With so much water, we paid close attention to user reviews, especially with concern to the tub’s door seals. The last thing you want is a leaky tub.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>It will depend on your needs as to which features you should focus on. Some features are for convenience or comfort, such as water jets for massaging aching joints and muscles and multiple drains. Some features are for safety, such as grip bars and non-slip surfaces.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>A walk-in tub is a big investment, costing between $2,000 and $5,000. When you’re spending this much on something, you want to make sure it’s protected by a good warranty. The best walk-in tubs should have a warranty covering at least  5 years with a lifetime warranty on the doors and seals. However, it’s common for these warranties to have stipulations about being installed by certified installers.","<strong>Types of Walk-in Tubs to Consider</strong>","The first step to deciding on the best walk-in tub is to determine what you want out of your walk-in tub. For some, simply soaking in a deep pool of warm water, like the <a href=\"/safe-step-review\">Safe Step Walk-In Tub</a>, is all they need to relax and relieve pain. Others want a spa-like experience with their bathwater bubbling and different jewel-like colors blinking to brighten their moods. And still others just want a tub they can get in and out of safely. Although most walk-in tubs include a narrow door on the side that you must step over to enter, there are also specialized wheelchair-accessible tubs that are even easier to use for those with less mobility.","Here are the different kinds of walk-in tubs and why you may want to consider them:","<u>Standard Soaker</u><br/>This walk-in tub is a good example of a standard soaker. It&#39;s the perfect size to slide into your existing space for a bathtub, though it&#39;s a bit narrow at 30 inches. The tub is deep enough to hold 78 gallons of water without anyone in it. It includes a safety grab bar, so you can steady yourself as you climb in and out of the tub. Its built-in seat is contoured for comfort, and the floor is textured so you won&#39;t slip and slide when you step in or out.","<u>Reclined Soaker</u><br/>Unlike most soaker walk-in tubs, this bathtub lets you stretch your legs out as you bathe. The chair-height seat is easy to access whether you step into the tub or slide in from a seated position, and the design allows you to recline rather than sit straight up. The rising wall includes dual seals with a lifetime warranty, so you can rest assured you won&#39;t have any leaks – or, if you do, they can be fixed easily. The waterfall faucet fills the tub in just three to five minutes, and the tub drains quickly with the dual drains.","<u>Whirlpool</u><br/>Water-based therapy can relieve pain and increase mobility in those who suffer from injuries, arthritis and other conditions. Water jets provide a relaxing massage while tiny bubbles rise to the surface and promote a comforting and peaceful atmosphere. A walk-in tub that includes water jets also often includes an in-line heater to keep the water warm while you bathe.","One thing to keep in mind about a tub with water jets is that it needs special attention to keep the jets clean. Follow the guidelines in your walk-in tub&#39;s user manual to ensure you don&#39;t compromise the warranty. You are likely going to need to set time aside to clean and rinse the pipes thoroughly. Some owners even suggest using dental floss to get in the tiny crevices around the jets and wiping the jets dry after each use to prevent mold and mildew growth.","<u>Whirlpool Style</u><br/>This walk-in tub includes six water jets for massage. It has the safety options you&#39;d expect, such as textured floors and a built-in contoured seat, along with a grab bar to help you lower yourself onto the chair or lift yourself up from it. It fits inside a standard 60-inch bathtub opening, so you don&#39;t have to knock a wall out to install this tub. You can purchase other features separately, such as Safety Tubs&#39; quick draining system, an in-line heater, a waterproof pillow and a chromotherapy system.","<u>Bariatric</u><br/>Walk-in bathtubs are similar in size to standard bathtubs. Though deeper, they aren&#39;t wider. A narrow entrance and seat can be uncomfortable for some people, and standard walk-in tubs are made for people who weigh less than 300 pounds. A bariatric walk-in tub includes a wider opening and a larger seat to accommodate anyone of any size. These tubs include the same safety features of regular walk-in tubs, such as textured floors, grab bars and short thresholds.","<u>Bariatric Model</u><br/>The built-in seat on this tub model is 30.5 inches wide, and the tub can hold a person up to 600 pounds. It has all of the essentials, such as the textured floor and safety grab bar to prevent falls. Additionally, Ella offers options to make it even more luxurious; you can get the massage model, which includes air, hydro or dual therapy massage.","<u>Wheelchair Accessible</u><br/>The biggest difference between a wheelchair-accessible bathtub and a standard walk-in tub is the door opening. Standard walk-in tubs have a narrow door next to their built-in seat, which makes it nearly impossible for someone who cannot walk to get into the tub without help. Wheelchair-accessible tubs have large doors that open wide and provide clear access to the chair-height seat. This makes it easier to slide from a wheelchair into the tub.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"233dcc6e-dec4-4309-a8ce-975974b657f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How Much Does a Walk-In Tub Cost?</strong>","We couldn’t get specific prices for the walk-in tubs we reviewed, as they’re sold by third parties that give you a quote based on your personal needs, the options you want and your budget. Plus, several of them offer financing, and it&#39;s hard to nail down price per month since it relies heavily on your financial situation.","However, to give you a better idea of how much you can expect to spend, we looked at the models you can buy outright on Amazon.

That’s a pretty wide range, so it’s best to check the quotes the sellers give you before you decide to buy. After taxes, expect to pay anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000 for your walk-in tub.","<strong>How Much Does it Cost to Install a Walk-In Tub?</strong>","Once you’ve made your decision about which walk-in tub is best for you, you’ll need to find a contractor that will install it for you. If you go to a walk-in tub dealer that includes installation as part of the price, you’ll know exactly what to expect before you buy. However, if you buy a walk-in tub from a big-box store like Home Depot or Lowe’s, you’ll need to hire a contractor to remove your current tub and install your new one.","Depending on where you live, this can vary drastically. You should research your local contractors to get the best price. However, according to Fixr, the national average cost to install a walk-in tub is between $5,000 and $7,000.","<strong>Are Walk-In Tubs Covered by Medicare?</strong>","If you’re getting a walk-in tub because of a medical condition, it’s natural to wonder if the cost can be covered by your Medicare insurance. Unfortunately, the answer is no. It’s considered a luxury item by the federal government, even if you’re getting it for legitimate medical reasons.","However, if you are qualified for Medicaid, it’s possible to get your walk-in tub covered depending on what state you live in. This is because unlike Medicare, Medicaid is partially controlled by individual state governments. Each state has it own coverage options and policies on how funds are distributed. We recommend doing research on your state’s policies.","<strong>What Is a Tub-Cut?</strong>","There are times when you may not need to replace your current tub. There is an option to essentially convert your tub to something approximating a walk-in model. The process is known as a “tub-cut” or a “bathtub cutout.” It’s exactly what it sounds like: a contractor comes to your home and removes part of your tub’s wall and adds a small door in its place. You can generally have a tub-cut performed for under $1,000.","This is a good option for those on a budget or who can’t lift their leg over the tub wall. However, this merely transforms your tub into a step-in shower. And although you can take a bath once the door is closed, you’ll miss out on several of the great features that a proper walk-in tub provides: specialized seats, hydrotherapy jets and textured surfaces to prevent falls are a few of the benefits you’ll be missing out on.","Although your walk-in tub may not be covered by these programs, it’s possible to deduct the cost of materials and installation on your taxes if you’re purchasing it for medical safety reasons. Make sure to consult with a tax professional on whether you would be eligible for a deduction.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"2c2f0709-1a64-4016-9d7c-63394361a753","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have trouble standing to shower, a shower chair may work for you in place of a walk-in tub – and save you thousands of dollars and major remodeling to your home.","A shower chair is exactly what it sounds like: a waterproof chair you place in your tub so you can sit down while you shower.

This may seem like a small thing, but daily rinsing keeps grime from building up on the surfaces. You also need to do a more detailed cleaning once a week, where you wipe everything down with a non-abrasive cleaning solution. Most common household surface cleaners will work, but it’s worth taking a few minutes to see if the tub&#39;s manufacturer or dealer has recommendations on its website.","And you occasionally need to clean out the tub’s whirlpool and hydrotherapy jets, especially if you use special oils or soap in your bath water. Simply fill up your tub with water, add a cleaning solution and let the jets run for a few minutes. Drain the water, refill it with clean water and let the jets run again.

With both of these easily at your fingertips, you won’t have to struggle to get up or lose your comfortable position while you bathe. Additionally, it employs fast drain technology, so you don’t have to wait very long to open the door once your bath is finished.","<strong>How Many Gallons of Water Are in a Walk-In Tub?</strong>","According to <a href=\"http://www.dignifyed.com/walk-in-bathtubs-faqs-review-57.html\">Dignifyed</a>, traditional residential bathtubs hold between 25 and 45 gallons of water, and walk-in tubs hold 45 to 50 gallons. So, that’s potentially double your water usage and a much bigger drain on your water heater.","<a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/c/water_heater_buying_guide_HT_BG_PL\">Home Depot</a> states that a conventional water heater capacity falls between 20 and 80 gallons. So, you need to make sure your water heater holds enough to fully fill your tub. Furthermore, you should keep in mind that you’ll likely need wait a while before using other appliances that need hot water or before you draw another bath.","<strong>How Long Does it Take to Fill a Walk-In Tub?</strong>","While the door makes it convenient to easily get in and out of the tub, it also has its downsides. You must also be inside the tub as it fills up with water and as it drains. If you open the door before either has finished, you’ll spill water all over your bathroom floor. So, it’s important to know how long it will take to fill and drain.","Several factors go into how long it takes to fill up and drain your walk-in tub. How many gallons your tub holds, as well as the water pressure and drainage system. According to <a href=\"http://www.aquassure.com/things-to-consider-when-purchasing-a-walk-in-bathtub/2554/\">Aquassure</a>, a walk-in tub manufacturer, the best models will fill and drain in about six to eight minutes, while some discount tubs can take as long as 15 minutes. So, at most, you’ll be spending an extra half hour in your tub. Make sure to find out the average time it takes before you buy.","<strong>What Are the Benefits of Hydrotherapy?</strong>","The best walk-in tubs feature hydrotherapy jets that massage your muscles while you bathe. This has several benefits including stress relief, improved blood circulation as well as pain and stress reduction.","Hydrotherapy jets are also effective for reducing inflammation and joint pain, which can be particularly helpful if you have arthritis. Hydrotherapy also increases oxygen delivery throughout your body, so your immune system experiences a boost.","The hydrotherapy jets found in walk-in tubs have the same technology that spas and physio centers use every day to help customers relax and recover from injuries or medical conditions like strokes and heart attacks.","<strong>What Are the Benefits of Aromatherapy?</strong><br/><br/>"]},"id":"00335e14-ab8a-4325-8772-ccf5e2943d67","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["However, you should take walk-in tub manufacturers&#39; claims about the benefits of aromatherapy with a grain of salt.

In addition, a walk-in tub is a pragmatic decision, as it adds value to your home, especially in a senior community. However, just because walk-in tubs minimize your fall risk, it doesn’t mean there aren’t risks you still need to consider. Here are some safety tips for seniors:","<u>Consult With Doctor</u><br/>Before you buy a walk-in tub, you should consult with your physician to make sure you’re healthy enough to sit in hot water for extended periods. While hydrotherapy has many health benefits, it’s not for everyone.","<u>Temperature</u><br/>The most important safety tip is to pay attention to the temperature. As you age, your skin becomes more delicate, especially as it begins to prune from extended soaking. To avoid scalding yourself, start with a comfortably warm temperature as the tub fills up and then increase the heat slowly to avoid damaging skin. Too much heat for too long can also have detrimental effects on muscle recovery.  ","<u>Soaking Time</u><br/>Hydrotherapy with a walk-in tub is great, especially for seniors. But soaking in hot water for too long has risks, as it can cause nausea, dizziness and fainting, which could result in accidental drownings. Seniors should start with a 10 minute hydrotherapy session and increase to 20 minutes once you feel comfortable. You only need 15 to 20 minutes of hydrotherapy to gain benefits. Any session over 30 minutes has no additional benefit.","<u>Medications</u><br/>The hot water combined with hydrotherapy jets has been shown to amplify the side-effects of prescription medications. If you’re taking something that causes drowsiness or dizziness, you should avoid taking baths when the side-effects are the strongest. Wait to take the medications after your bath.","<em><strong>Contributing Reviewers:</strong></em> <em>Noel Case, Jeph Preece</em>"]},"id":"29fbffbc-bd51-4c25-a860-74407264f10b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"b34f3b8e-cb0e-4022-a215-01e32619e02d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/residential/walk-in-tubs/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">Safe Step</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/residential/walk-in-tubs/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Jacuzzi</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/residential/walk-in-tubs/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">AmeriGlide</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/residential/walk-in-tubs/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">Ariel</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/residential/walk-in-tubs/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">Ella Ultimate</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/residential/walk-in-tubs/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">Safety Tubs</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/residential/walk-in-tubs/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">Universal Tubs</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7f1166aa-0611-4bd8-ad68-d71339ae4fbd","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1286","url":"/best-walk-in-tubs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
