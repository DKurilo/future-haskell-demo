The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/payday-loan-service-review\">Payday Loans</a> here</em><em>.</em>","Castle Payday offers installment loans, which are similar to payday loans except that instead of paying the whole amount of your loan back all at once, you can pay it back in smaller segments over a longer time. With Castle Payday, you can extend the terms of your loan to up to 32 months. Be cautious, however; remember that the longer you pay on your loan, the more interest you accrue and the more money you end up paying to the lender. Fortunately, this lender does not penalize you if you decide to pay off your loan early.","You can borrow up to $1,000 from this direct payday lender, depending on things like your monthly income and other criteria. Your APR also varies based on your credit score and other factors. The maximum APR that Castle Payday can charge you is 788.62 percent. This does not vary by state because Castle Payday is tribally owned. This means that all transactions with Castle Payday follow the law of the tribe and not the laws of the state in which you reside. While it can be useful to work with a lender whose polices don&#39;t change from state to state, often those state laws are in place to protect you as a borrower.","After you fill out the online application for a payday loan, you receive a call from a Castle Payday representative within 15 minutes, as long as you apply within normal business hours. The representative will confirm the information with you and give you a decision on your loan application. You should receive the funds from your loan as soon as the next business day.","You must have valid income making a minimum of $700 a month in order to qualify for a cash advance with this lender. Bad credit does not disqualify you for this loan, and neither does bankruptcy; however, these factors may affect the amount you&#39;re able to borrow and the rate at which the loan is extended.","We reached out to Castle Payday at various times on various days to ask questions and evaluate its customer support. The representatives we spoke with on the phone were knowledgeable, able and willing to answer our questions. They did not try to push us into applying for a loan prior to answering our questions, which is somewhat rare in this industry. However, they were not responsive to email inquiries."]},"id":"551af715-e41a-4033-a97e-d40c0d37783c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"95ce2a23-886d-41fb-ba9f-423a70d71d23","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Castle Payday offers online installment loans rather than payday loans, which allows you to pay your loan back over a longer period of time.
