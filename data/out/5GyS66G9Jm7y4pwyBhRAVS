Winding the bobbin took twice as long as with most of the sewing machines we tested. Even with the pedal pressed all the way to the ground, the winding process took a little more than two minutes while most other machines took a minute or less. The built-in thread cutter on the left side is also incredibly dull. We had to pull the thread against it several times to get it to work, and then when it finally did, the thread would fray. This was particularly annoying when we were trying to put that thread through the eye of the needle. The stitch patterns are also located on a separate cardboard stitch key rather than on the machine.
