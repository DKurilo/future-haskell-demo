most cases, value is more important than anything else with <a href=\"/best-hdmi-cables\">HDMI cables</a>. Amazon understands this well, and its AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable is very popular, with over 30,000 reviews at the time of writing. So, why is the AmazonBasics cable so popular? Well, because it&#39;s affordable and it gives you just about everything that a more expensive HDMI cable would. In short, this cable just works â€“ and that&#39;s mostly what you want with HDMI.","It&#39;s difficult to find an HDMI cord that is more cost effective than the AmazonBasics cable. Its low price, decent build quality and the many available lengths make this a highly recommended product.","This cable has built in Ethernet, which means compatible devices can connect to the internet through your HDMI cable instead of needing a separate Ethernet cable. Fewer cables is generally better in a home theater setup. At the time of writing, there aren&#39;t many devices that can take advantage of HDMI with Ethernet yet; however, we believe it&#39;s merely a matter of time before it becomes common.","Amazon doesn&#39;t seem eager to divulge the AmazonBasics&#39; wire gauge, which is disappointing. Knowing how thick the cable is can help you make an informed decision about what length of cable you should buy. Still, with the official High Speed stamp of approval, any of the available lengths should be able to handle all of your viewing needs.","Not only can the AmazonBasics cable handle 1080p video signals, but also 3D and 4K resolutions. In fact, any HDMI cable made in the last five years that has the High Speed badge will be able to handle those video signals just fine.","Compared to other cables on our lineup, the AmazonBasics cable doesn&#39;t have as many strong design decisions. It&#39;s clear that Amazon wanted, as the name suggests, a very basic cable. As such, you won&#39;t find high-purity copper conductors or a braided cable here. And you definitely won&#39;t get the fancy gas injection that some more expensive cables like the <a href=\"/monster-1000hd-review\">Monster 1000HD</a> tout.","You can get the AmazonBasics cable in many different lengths. Generally, you want to get the shortest cable that works for your setup. That way, you don&#39;t have extra cable lying around. Whether you need a short, 3-foot cable, or a long 25-foot cable, Amazon has you covered. For very long cable runs, you may need to look at other products such as the <a href=\"/audioquest-high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable-review\">AudioQuest Pearl</a>. The longer your HDMI cable is, the more important build quality becomes. For any cables over 25 feet in length, you may want to consider paying a premium.","Amazon provides a lifetime warranty for the AmazonBasics cable against manufacturer or material defect. Should you have any questions about the AmazonBasics cable, you can look through the Questions &amp; Answers section on the product&#39;s page. You can also contact Amazon&#39;s support team through email, live chat or phone.","The AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable is one of the best deals you can get. Even though it doesn&#39;t have the visual appeal or design quality that&#39;s associated with more expensive cables, the AmazonBasics cable will do everything you need it to."]},"id":"b6e50d95-0545-4381-810f-cd061929567f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67118","url":"/amazonbasics-high-speed-hdmi-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-29T21:35:21Z","datePublished":"2015-09-29T21:35:21Z","name":"AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI","synopsis":"In most cases, value is more important than anything else with HDMI cables.
