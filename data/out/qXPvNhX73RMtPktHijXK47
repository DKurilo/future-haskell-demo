The brass key and ring we buried were picked up by our detectors as aluminum or zinc, but we decided to call that an accurate reading because the conductivity is close and brass wasn’t a readout option on any of the metal detectors we used. Using that data, we calculated how many times each detector got it right and assigned a corresponding grade. In general, most metal detectors picked up the fact that an object was buried in the dirt, but many of them lacked target ID accuracy and depth accuracy. ","<strong>What Key Features to Look for When Buying a Metal Detector</strong>","Coil Construction: Concentric vs. DD<br/>Metal detectors come with either a concentric coil or a DD coil, which is the flat mechanism on the bottom of the detector that finds metals. These coils can be either circular or oval shaped depending on the machine, and their size directly correlates to how deep they can search. For example, a 9-inch coil can search about 9 inches into the ground.","A concentric coil emits a cone-shaped search field, which means the search field narrows to a point. We scored metal detectors with DD search coils higher because their search fields are shaped like a blade. This means the field is about half to two-thirds the coil&#39;s diameter, making it more accurate deeper into the ground than a concentric coil.","Discrimination &amp; Notching<br/>Most metal detectors have discrimination and notching capabilities. Discrimination comes in handy because it allows you to filter out metals you don&#39;t want to find, like soda can pull tabs and other trash."]},"id":"c0704c09-836e-4a85-b3de-35f57d51a15b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/p3fkHoeatWhq92EQMcL7WW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/metal-detectors/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8zLzkvNzU4Mjc3L29yaWdpbmFsLzQuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3fkHoeatWhq92EQMcL7WW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"p3fkHoeatWhq92EQMcL7WW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3fkHoeatWhq92EQMcL7WW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c4679eec-98b8-42e0-9042-0ed22112d66e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Notching is a more specific kind of discrimination. Machines with this capability can isolate and ignore certain metals based on conductivity. For instance, if you kept finding nails and soda can pull-tabs that were reading at target IDs between 25 and 35, you can use notching to eliminate that range of numbers and only get readings for values below or above.","Etiquette<br/>Every metal detector we reviewed came with an explanation of metal detecting etiquette in the instruction manual. It’s very important to go treasure hunting legally, safely and respectfully. You should never go on private property without the landowner’s permission, and be cognizant of other people when on public land, like a beach. If you do find anything interesting buried underground, be sure to refill any holes you dig and never destroy any natural resources. ","<strong>How Much Do Metal Detectors Cost?</strong>","If you’re serious about metal detecting as a hobby, there are high-tech metal detectors for as much as $10,000. If you’re new to the field or just want to try it out we don’t recommend spending that much. The nine metal detectors we tested cost an average of $307, which is a relatively reasonable price. Children’s metal detectors, which tend to have small searchcoils, are an inexpensive option for youngsters and we found several available for $50 or less.","<strong>Laws</strong>","There aren&#39;t any blanket laws or regulations regarding the use of metal detectors in the United States, so it&#39;s important to research the rules for your specific location. There is, however, some legislation that limits metal detecting on federal land, Native American burial or holy sites, and historical sites. The American Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 made it illegal to use a metal detector in national parks, monuments, beaches, or Civil and Revolutionary War battlefields. These laws are usually enforced by park rangers. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 also protects many Native American holy sites. The <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/hoosier/learning/history-culture/?cid=stelprdb5406465\">U.S. Forest Service</a> also restricts metal detecting in order to protect historical remains, so if you find historically important buried treasure, you cannot dig or remove it from the land.","The restricted use of metal detectors has become a point of contention. According to <a href=\"http://www.mdhtalk.org/articles/endanagered/endanagered.htm\">Metal Detecting Hobby Talk,</a> a hobbyist website, there are many more barriers to recreational metal detecting than there were in the 1950s. The website says that, although there are numerous metal-detecting clubs throughout the United States, the lack of an all-encompassing organization makes it hard to advocate for more open laws. There are, however, three major U.S. metal-detecting associations: the <a href=\"http://www.wwats.org/\">World Wide Association of Treasure Seekers,</a> <a href=\"http://fmdac.org/\">The Federation of Metal Detector and Archaeology Clubs</a> and <a href=\"https://detectingrights.wordpress.com/\">The Task Force for Metal Detecting Rights Foundation.</a> These are great places to start networking and find useful information about metal detecting as a hobby in your area."]},"id":"c80f926e-79f0-4e71-81df-fe8b4c1a9923","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_149","url":"/best-metal-detectors","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-15T18:12:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-15T18:12:00Z","name":"Best Metal Detectors of 2019","synopsis":"We tested each metal detector’s performance finding iron nails, aluminum pull-tabs, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and precious metals.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested each metal detector’s performance finding iron nails, aluminum pull-tabs, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and precious metals.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-16T23:59:33Z","id":"qXPvNhX73RMtPktHijXK47","meta":{"title":"Best Metal Detectors of 2019 - Reviews, Comparisons, Test Results","description":"We tested each metal detector’s performance finding iron nails, aluminum pull-tabs, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and precious metals."},"products":[{"slug":"teknetics-delta-4000","url":"/product/teknetics-delta-4000","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","name":"Teknetics Delta 4000","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"Gaa5zNVcS8bm4SNyg6mM7Y","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"bounty-hunter-quick-draw-pro","url":"/product/bounty-hunter-quick-draw-pro","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","name":"Bounty Hunter Quick Draw Pro","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"FASDP9HxJPyxSzj9xHLeub","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"bounty-hunter-titanium-camo","url":"/product/bounty-hunter-titanium-camo","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","name":"Bounty Hunter Titanium Camo","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"sa9BpfGuvbvaubdDxg7HwJ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"tesoro-mojave","url":"/product/tesoro-mojave","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","name":"Tesoro Mojave","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"yhFB3EE2PKM4j2LtSH8w3g","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"garrett-ace-400","url":"/product/garrett-ace-400","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","name":"Garrett Ace 400","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"tn78sxNhtBQaczoPha3juh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/DsNaePYdKzpD9aM4rDFnqf.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Metal-Detectors-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/3/4/819184/original/_Hero-Metal-Detectors-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"DsNaePYdKzpD9aM4rDFnqf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsNaePYdKzpD9aM4rDFnqf.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Metal Detectors of 2019","description":"We tested each metal detector’s performance finding iron nails, aluminum pull-tabs, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and precious metals."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/DsNaePYdKzpD9aM4rDFnqf.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Metal-Detectors-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/3/4/819184/original/_Hero-Metal-Detectors-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"DsNaePYdKzpD9aM4rDFnqf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsNaePYdKzpD9aM4rDFnqf.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Metal Detectors of 2019","description":"We tested each metal detector’s performance finding iron nails, aluminum pull-tabs, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and precious metals."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:13:02Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
