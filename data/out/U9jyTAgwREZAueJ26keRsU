You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Vivitar brand is known for making affordable <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD video cameras</a>. However, the old adage of <em>you get what you pay for </em>holds true. The Vivitar DVR 790 is the top of the line for the DVR700 series of camcorders, and we are pleasantly surprised to find a budget-conscious camcorder that can shoot in HD and 3D. Aside from the 3D shooting feature on this camcorder, the rest of the specs and features are below average.","The Vivitar DVR 790 shoots in 720 HD, which is not as crisp as 1080 full HD. Nonetheless, it&#39;s still classified as high definition. Another  drawback for this HD video camera is the zoom capability. There is no optical zoom and, the digital zoom capabilities come in at a paltry 4x. If you&#39;re not looking for the best video quality though, this camcorder does do the basics in video recording.","The battery life on the DVR790 lasts only about 45 minutes. That is not the worst part though – the DVR790&#39;s battery is built-in. This is a major inconvenience because it means you cannot swap the old battery with a fully charged one if you run out in the middle of shooting video; you will have to find an outlet and charge your camcorder. Not quite the wireless freedom you would expect from an HD camcorder. The battery life on other camcorders in the DVR700 series vary because instead of using a lithium ion battery like the DRV700, they run off AAA batteries. Even with the best AAA batteries, recording is a major drain on alkaline batteries.","The 3D shooting capabilities may have piqued your interest in this camcorder. It did ours. The 3D function on this HD camcorder is more of an old-school 3D feature, meaning it shoots in a red/green double lens and you will need the old red and green 3D glasses to view your content in 3D. Even if you have a new 3D TV, you will need to view your home movies with the old-school 3D glasses.","The Vivitar customer support section needs a little work. Vivitar offers customer help through a toll free number, email or Facebook. However, Facebook support will usually lead you to phone or email support. We sent multiple emails to Vivitar with general questions, and the ones that were answered took about 24 to 48 hours. However, most of the emails we sent out were never answered at all. Your best bet will be to contact the company on the toll-free line. In our experience, we were able to get in touch with someone without a long wait time. This also comes with a caveat: Most of our general inquiry calls ended without our receiving a complete answer. The customer service representatives we spoke to  were more adept in handling defects and returns, but their ability to answer general questions about their products leaves something to be desired."]},"id":"905c95a9-0fa5-45aa-9682-bc841e0c7a2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7f665612-20c3-429b-b988-a766fe074ff8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Not many camcorders on the consumer market offer 3D shooting, and it is surprising to see the Vivitar DVR700 series have a 3D HD camcorder.
