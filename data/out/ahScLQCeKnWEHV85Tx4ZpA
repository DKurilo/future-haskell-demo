This hard drive camcorder comes with a 60GB hard drive, allowing for up to nearly 25 hours of HD footage. With SuperSteady Shot Optical Image Stabilization system and the Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonar T lens, all images, regardless of distance, are delivered in clear, stable HD. The Sony Handycam HDR-SR7 includes a wide screen 2.7 inch LCD screen for instant play back of recorded footage.","The SuperSteady Shot Optical Image Stabilization system achieves a degree of smoothness and stability that is only dreamt of in most hard drive camcorders. Even at 10x Optical or 20x Digital zoom, images remain still and smooth.","Experts like the Sony HDR-SR7 for the quality and consistency of its HD footage.  With its stock 3.2 megapixel Clearvid CMOS sensor, stunning clarity and definition become the rule, not the exception. Users like the Sony HDR-SR7 for its ease of use and compatibility with different computer programs and video interfaces. The Handycam Station is included with the camcorder, allowing for additional functions, like copying footage to a DVD.","The Sony HDR-SR7 is a very impressive, easy-to-use hard drive camcorder with loads of professional-grade features. All in all, this is hard bargain to pass up."]},"id":"ca32cbb6-ba2c-4226-957b-7b9060c80f20","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_13423","url":"/sony-hdrsr7-10618-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-06-09T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-06-09T06:00:00Z","name":"Sony Handycam Hdr-sr7 HDRSR7","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":53,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-06-09T17:22:17Z","id":"ahScLQCeKnWEHV85Tx4ZpA","meta":{"title":"Sony Handycam Hdr-sr7 HDRSR7 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
