Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Black &amp; Decker GH600 electric trimmer has all the power and speed you&#39;d expect in an <a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">electric string trimmer</a>. You may find it has trouble feeding line properly, however. The Black &amp; Decker GH600 has a large cutting area and weighs a little more than 5 pounds.","Although this is a light-duty trimmer, you&#39;re going to find that it has a lot of speed and power. It measures in at 9,500 rotations per minute (RPMs), making the Black &amp; Decker GH600 one of the fastest rotating electric string trimmers we reviewed. Even though it has a fast rotation speed, Black &amp; Decker didn&#39;t skimp on the power of this beast. Compared to the other electric weed whackers we reviewed, it boasts one of the highest amperes (amps) – 5 amps. The Black &amp; Decker electric trimmer combines incredible speed with the power, and it can blast through weeds and grass. Keep in mind, however, that even so, Black &amp; Decker has made this power tool to perform light duties.","This automatic-feed electric string trimmer uses standard 0.065-inch string. The Black &amp; Decker GH600 only uses one line, which cuts down on how frequently you&#39;ll have to replace the spool compared to a dual-line feed. The cutting swath on this electric weed trimmer is 14 inches. Depending on the job you need to do, this could be a great advantage or a drawback. However, even with this large cutting swath, it only weighs 5.3 pounds.","The pole extends on this electric string trimmer. The shaft is relatively straight, although it does have a little bit of a curve to it. It also allows you to rotate the head of the trimmer into four different positions. It comes with cord-retention clips, two handles and a power trigger.","The most common complaint you&#39;ll hear with this electric weed eater is that it has trouble feeding line. A problem you might find with this trimmer is that the white feed arm on the Black &amp; Decker GH600 wears out quickly. Black &amp; Decker suggests storing additional spools of line in a plastic bag with a tablespoon of water in it to keep the line from drying out. This may help avoid feed problems.","You can find a user manual online, as well as contact information for the product. The website offers multiple manuals for the same product. Even with the extended manual, each language only has about two pages of instructions and warnings on it. Black &amp; Decker covers this electric string trimmer with a two-year warranty that protects you against defects. The warranty only covers products in the U.S."]},"id":"9396828d-068f-4877-a76f-5c07119c23f5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"88ed4a65-af37-4300-bcec-6b54d2993c20","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Black &amp; Decker GH600 electric trimmer has power and speed.
