You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hello Kitty Digital Camera is a fun little camera that is, unfortunately, poorly built for a kids&#39; digital camera. Its body is made of flimsy, low-quality plastic that won&#39;t last long if it is continually dropped. The manufacturer recommends this camera for children 8 years and older.","Despite its low-quality build, this <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital camera for kids </a>includes some good features and functions. First, it comes with a digital zoom capability, like several of the other kids&#39; cameras we reviewed, and its image resolution is decent at 2.1 megapixels. It also has an automatic flash, so it looks and feels like a real, grown-up digital camera. It also has a camcorder mode for recording video. Since this camera doesn&#39;t have audio-recording ability, though, the videos are silent.","The best feature of this digital camera for kids is the interchangeable faceplates. Each camera comes with three faceplates that are unique in style and design, though all reflect the fashions of Hello Kitty. This gives kids an opportunity to personalize their camera.","While the Hello Kitty Digital Camera doesn&#39;t support an SD memory card, it has ample storage that can hold 200 images. However, these images will be lost if the camera runs out of batteries, so be sure to upload and save them to your computer often. This kids&#39; camera comes with a USB cable, so uploading is easy. Unfortunately, it is not a standard cable and is difficult to replace if it is ever lost or damaged.","This kids&#39; camera comes with a one-year warranty. It may be a challenge to return it, though. While you can find telephone and email contact information on the website, it&#39;s difficult to get a timely response. We found that when we did get a response, the manufacturer took a lot of time to follow through with its commitments."]},"id":"41bcafa2-58bd-4985-8948-8ade398a4fa6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ecb5021c-0bfe-4725-86d9-b549410eb922","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hello Kitty Digital Camera with interchanging faceplates is a good choice for a digital camera for kids who are older and more careful, since it isn&#39;t built very sturdily.

Your child will still get plenty of enjoyment out of this camera with the included camcorder and the three stylish faceplates, though."]},"id":"6ccb44e7-9123-4a91-af15-6dc054e8036c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57590","url":"/hello-kitty-digital-camera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-09-24T13:52:32Z","datePublished":"2013-09-24T13:52:32Z","name":"Sakar Hello Kitty","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":71,"verdict":"This camera isn&#039;t very durable, doesn&#039;t have the best controls, and lacks additional features.
