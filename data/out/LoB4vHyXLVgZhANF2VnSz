You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You get maximum benefit from minimum toil with the Cricut Mini. This is our favorite Cricut <a href=\"/best-die-cutting-machines\">die cutting machine</a> because it offers more flexibility and portability compared to the others. With this compact unit, you can add to your crafting capabilities and manipulate the designs on your Cricut cartridges in addition to cutting those designs as is. You can cut different materials such as cardstock, vinyl, chipboard, felt, magnet material and more.","The Mini loses out on some versatility in terms of special tools, though. You cannot do much beyond cutting with this unit. Do not expect to pierce, engrave or emboss. The cuts this die cutter creates will be of good quality, though, and this is one of the least expensive die cutters we reviewed.","You will be hampered somewhat in terms of design with the Cricut Mini, though not as much as you are with hand-crank die cutters or cartridge-only cutters. At least with the Mini, you can use Craft Room, an online design application, to manipulate the patterns. Ultimately, you can only cut from patterns you own.","We love the fact that Craft Room is available anywhere with an internet connection. If design inspiration strikes, simply log in and move some shapes (Cricut shapes you own) around. Cut your final creation out when you are back by your Cricut Mini.","Cartridges are not all bad. They have their place. For some people, they are still the easiest and best way to get great designs. It can be nice to just plug a cartridge into your die cutting machine, push a button and have the finished cut come out quickly. We don&#39;t like the idea of being tied down to them, though.","If you are a longtime Cricut devotee and have invested in some cartridges already, you can still use them with the Mini. Just plug them into your machine and cut. You will have much more freedom if you use Craft Room, though. Once you link the patterns in your cartridges to Craft Room, you will be able to resize, weld text together, manipulate color and texture, and fit objects to a path.","This die cut machine measures just 3.69 inches high but still manages to offer a very respectable cutting bed. It can cut shapes and fonts up to 11.5 inches long on a relatively wide range of materials. It would make a lot of sense for such a tiny machine to have a carrying handle, but it doesn&#39;t. However, since it weighs only 5.5 pounds, you should not have any problems with portability. This machine also makes it easy to adjust factors such as blade depth and pressure for different materials.","Cricut&#39;s customer support is good overall. We especially like all of the video tutorials online for this die cutting machine. The customer service representatives we spoke with were all very helpful and friendly. Responses to emails were slow in coming and practically useless, though."]},"id":"3e588720-8e00-44ab-a0cf-3c00caaa53b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0b5209f0-6e72-4eff-a61d-be7c2b6b4525","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cricut Mini will not help you do anything beyond cutting, and it will not cut every material, but we think you will like the way this tiny dynamo precisely cuts paper and fabrics.
