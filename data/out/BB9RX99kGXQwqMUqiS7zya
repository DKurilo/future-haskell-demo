Online tax software services will not have access to those forms until the release date. While you may be able to prepare your return in advance, you cannot e-file until the forms are released and the IRS is accepting returns. While we have performed our preliminary tests, we cannot fully test the services and rank the products until all services are available for testing. We will update our reviews through the tax season as the newest versions are released.</em>","TaxPoint operates out of Southlake Texas and can help you file simple tax returns or those that need to claim business, investment or 1099 income. As with most online tax services, you can start preparing your return for free and only pay when you are ready to submit your returns.","This online tax software is rather simple to use and we were able to create accurate returns using TaxPoint. This tax preparation tool does not include a life-events feature, as in it won&#39;t ask you about significant life changes that happened in the previous year that may affect your tax status. But it is pretty easy to figure out what portions of the software you need to fill out to prepare your return correctly. For example we were easily able to add things like the amount of daycare paid, monies given to charity and our real estate interest paid.","TaxPoint supports a variety of disbursement options. You can request that the IRS send you a paper check by mail or you can have your refund deposited to your bank account by direct deposit. If you do not have a traditional bank account, you can request that the refund be sent to a pre-paid debit card. You also have the option of having your filing fees using your part of your refund so you do not have to pay upfront.","You can contact TaxPoint with your questions in a variety of ways. You can contact the support team by email or telephone or you can initiate a chat conversation online. You can also search the support documentation. Tax filers can also read about helpful tax topics on the TaxPoint blog; however, this blog is rather new and does not cover a wide range of subjects yet. Since this product is rather new as well, it does not yet include import features."]},"id":"f4ad0c09-f592-489f-a064-82114e9d5478","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2f2feaab-6671-4a6e-bb48-2aa0341e5449","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TaxPoint is a newer product to hit the market and does not yet have tools for importing tax information from other services or from previous years.
