It makes for an average wheel that will work for PC, PS3 and PS2 gamers. However, this medium-grade wheel doesn&#39;t excel in any particular area, so it won&#39;t stand out in the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1338-best-racing-wheels.html\">game steering wheel</a> crowd. If you are new to using a racing wheel with your racing sims, the TopDrive GT will be a good fit because it is meant for casual use and not for racing game aficionados.","The TopDrive GT is easy to use. The stick shift is easy to use, and the pedals give great feedback and are very responsive; however, as tends to happen in gaming pedals, the gas and brake have the same level of tension. If the gas had more slack, it would give the device a more realistic driving feel.","TopDrive GT gives you plenty of options as it focuses on programmable buttons. Each of its 14 buttons can be reprogrammed to your preferences. You get a rear window mode, and you can change your perspective from first to third person and use turbos easily, pushing whatever button you choose. This device does provide adjustable steering sensitivity as well as adjustable pedal placement to give your foot the highest level of comfort while you are stepping on the gas and passing virtual drivers.","Help and support options are limited. There is a user guide, but it is complicated to understand. Logic3 also offers FAQs on its site, but there are only a few questions to choose from. And because they&#39;re a German company, reaching them by phone is difficult."]},"id":"b48b4e9b-992c-43f8-a270-24f53d87275e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"908a312e-3e20-46dd-ae58-1e1e4adb5aab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TopDrive GT works great with PS3 and PS2 games but can be unresponsive occasionally on a PC.
