The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews about</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-wall-air-conditioners\">Wall Air Conditioners</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The GE AJCQ12ACF wall air conditioner offers an ideal number of British thermal units (Btu) for cooling a medium-sized room. You can control the air-flow direction, speed and other features, and it comes with a remote control. It removes moisture from the air, and you can use the programmable timer to customize when it runs.","Since this in-wall AC unit has 12,000 Btu, you can cool a room of up to 550 square feet, which covers most bedrooms and living rooms. It has a maximum air flow of 290 cubic feet per minute, which will cool a room quickly. The three fan speeds let you easily control the air speed in your room as needed.","This system uses R-410A refrigerant, which is environmentally friendly. If you live in a humid climate, this product helps dehumidify your room to a more comfortable level, removing up to 3.4 pints of moisture from the air per hour, the second most of the units in our wall air conditioner reviews. However, it lacks a dehumidify-only mode, so you can&#39;t remove humidity without also running the cool air. There is no sleep mode either, which can be a nice energy saver.","This air conditioning unit has an estimated annual cost of $105.41, which is the approximate cost if you were to use it eight hours per day over the three-month summertime period. It has certification from Energy Star and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. It is also UL listed, which means it passes public safety standards. It has a high energy-efficiency ratio of 9.8.","You can make any necessary adjustments on the device interface or with the included remote. The 24-hour programmable timer lets you set when you want your air conditioner on. It is also helpful while you&#39;re sleeping, as it keeps the system running so you aren&#39;t woken up by it cycling on and off.","The fan-only mode allows you to run the fan without using refrigerant. This mode is also handy if it is not hot enough to warrant turning on the compressor.","This through-the-wall air conditioner is 15-5/8 inches tall, 21-13/16 inches deep and 26 inches wide. It weighs 77 pounds, which is on par with our lineup&#39;s average. Its built-in air filter automatically helps remove dust and allergens before blowing air into your room. Convenient four-way direction louvers give you the option to control where the air flows in your room.","GE gives this device a one-year appliance warranty and a five-year compressor warranty, and the company has customer service available via phone and email. You can also consult GE&#39;s online system manual or the FAQs section of its website."]},"id":"3cabe31a-3a95-4eb2-b291-c78eb0fb06d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"99860b93-112d-4903-b750-5be6583c9508","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE AJCQ12ACF is an energy-efficient wall air conditioner with a moderate amount of cooling power that is ideal for rooms of about 400 square feet.
