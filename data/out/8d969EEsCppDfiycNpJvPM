Both these reasons make it a good choice for purchasing <a href=\"/best-eyeglasses-online\">eyeglasses online</a>.","There are far fewer name-brand frames in GlassesUSA.com’s online store than its competitors’ – the company carries glasses by only 46 designers. However, these 46 are well-known and widely trusted brands like B&amp;K, Diesel, Giorgio Armani, Tommy Hilfiger and Elizabeth Arden. In addition to these designer frames, Glasses USA boasts a good selection of generic-brand eyeglasses for men and women as well as sunglasses and multipurpose goggles. The company also offers some frames for kids, but the selection there is limited. Ski goggles for adults or kids aren&#39;t available either.","Finding the frames you want can be daunting with so many styles and choices, so GlassesUSA.com has a virtual-optician frame wizard to help you narrow down your options. It asks you a series of questions about your lifestyle and favorite activities and then presents you with a selection of frames to get you started. Though some stores have bigger selections, GlassesUSA.com is still competitive and carries glasses to suit all tastes, including full-rim, half-rim and rimless frames. There is also a separate section for prescription sunglasses. You can pair your frames with single-vision, progressive and bifocal lenses, and several of its frames can be used for reading glasses and fashion, non-prescription glasses. You can also purchase photochromatic lenses and add anti-scratch, anti-glare and UV-protection coatings.","For many, the main drawback to using an online eyeglass retailer over going into a shop is that you can’t try on any of the glasses. Fortunately, GlassesUSA.com has a clever solution to that. If you are curious to see how you would look wearing a certain pair of frames, you can use the Try-It Mirror. This tool lets you upload a headshot and virtually try on the glasses. It works well in action, the frames are placed pretty realistically on your face, which will give you a good indication as to whether your selection will suit you as well as you hope they will.","Just like Eyeglasses.com and Coastal.com, the service offers free shipping in the United States on all orders, and you can track your order. Standard shipping takes between three and 14 days, which can be a bit of a wait. International shipping is also available, but will understandably take longer than domestic shipping.","GlassesUSA.com prides itself on great customer service and tries to hire college graduates who wear glasses because they understand customer needs. In addition, our research showed that the company’s claim that phone response was generally less than 10 seconds was true. You can get in touch with the company by phone, email or live chat if you cannot find answers to your questions on the website. Also, you have 14 days to return your glasses for a full refund, no questions asked, if there are any problems. Online customer reviews are generally positive, with GlassesUSA.com having a “Great” rating on TrustPilot. The company responds in a professional manner to almost every review left on TrustPilot, good or bad, reacting proactively to resolve any issues raised in customer reviews.","Each pair comes with a standard one-year warranty, so you should have plenty of time to discover whether the frame you have is defective or not."]},"id":"e09881c4-785d-4fc2-b9a6-6370a7904e87","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53999","url":"/glassesusa-com-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-11-30T18:40:34Z","datePublished":"2011-11-30T18:40:34Z","name":"GlassesUSA.com","synopsis":"GlassesUSA.com carries a large selection of non-designer frames and makes all the lenses it uses in its own laboratory to ensure they are of the highest quality.
