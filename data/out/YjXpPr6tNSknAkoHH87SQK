A tray beneath the baby sound machine swivels out to reveal a plug that connects to your MP3 player&#39;s headphone jack. The tray is quite small and may fit a small iPod or MP3 player, but most likely you&#39;ll need to pull the plug out and through the machine to safely stow your player and swivel the bottom back into place. Once your player is plugged in, you can use it to play your baby&#39;s favorite sounds to soothe him to sleep.","The built-in nightlight is another convenient feature and is easy to activate. When it&#39;s on, a soft blue glow emanates from the middle section between the top of the machine and the base.
