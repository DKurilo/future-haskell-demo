This gas-powered heater, however, is not portable. Instead, this unit is designed to be installed either through an existing wall, rooftop or under the roof to deliver heat to a specific area.","A large, durable steel body makes the Cambridge Engineering S-Series suitable for industrial use in large warehouses, distribution centers and industrial areas, such as manufacturing plants. Because it runs on gas, it needs to be located next to a nearby gas hookup, which makes it incompatible with many warehouses. However, in areas where natural gas is affordable, this industrial heater may be a good choice for heating a warehouse or factory. Because of its size, this industrial heater is not suited for portable use.","The S-Series heater installs through walls or in ventilated areas, simultaneously heating air and venting gas fumes and cold air. This works well in closed-off buildings because it circulates air while heating it. The large industrial space heater has a capacity of up to 3,400 MBH or 3,400,000 BTU, making it a good fit for very large warehouses and spaces like aircraft hangars.","A low-fire start thermostat improves the overall energy efficiency of this industrial heater. In addition, it is energy efficient, with a 100 percent combustion efficiency rating, meaning that it does not lose heat through the exchanger or flue. It has a 92 percent AFUE thermal efficiency rating for ensuring heat retention. Blow-through technology means that it heats air from outdoors and directs it inwards, which improves air circulation and reduces the risks of carbon monoxide buildup, especially in industrial areas.","A steel design and steel thermostat ensure durability. The pre-piped and prewired module helps to streamline installation so that once it&#39;s connected to a gas line, it&#39;s ready to immediately begin working. The unit also includes multiple access doors to help you easily access the internal unit. It also features service and test switches for testing leaks and installation before you turn on the heater.","The Cambridge Engineering S-Series industrial space heater is suitable for installing in large buildings where long-term gas heating is necessary. With energy efficiency, high heating capacity and an air system for improving fresh air, the space heater has a lot to offer for a permanent installation but is not portable."]},"id":"66e882fa-b3ba-4712-b26b-4499f3c5130e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66816","url":"/cambridge-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-04T20:59:07Z","datePublished":"2015-09-04T20:59:07Z","name":"Cambridge Engineering S-Series","synopsis":"The Cambridge Engineering S-Series industrial space heater installs into large warehouses and buildings to raise temperatures up to 160 degrees Fahrenheit from 0 degrees Fahrenheit.
