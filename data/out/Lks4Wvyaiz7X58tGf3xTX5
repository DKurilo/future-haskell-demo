Your team has to identify, track, fix and test hundreds of bugs and issues. Bug tracking software organizes bugs, helps teams collaborate, and helps you manage your project to ensure that quality versions ship on time. Common bug tracking software applications include <a href=\"#Bugzilla\">Bugzilla</a>, <a href=\"#Lighthouse\">Lighthouse Entp</a> and <a href=\"#Bontq\">Bontq</a>.","Whether you work as a team leader, coder, tester or quality assurance editor, bug tracking software helps you identify, track and fix bugs in less time. Bug tracking systems don&#39;t just log issues, either. They allow your team to see who&#39;s working on specific issues and to communicate and move bugs through the process with less back-and-forth. For administrators, bug tracking tools also help identify where issues are coming from, who&#39;s addressing them and how much progress has been made toward a deadline.","<strong>Bug Tracking Software: What to Look For</strong>","<a href=\"/best-personal-firewall-software\">Defect-tracking software</a> goes beyond the nuts and bolts of resolving issues. You can use these platforms to manage workflow, communicate among team members and learn about issues in real time. These tools help your team find and resolve bugs earlier in the development process, which saves time and money down the road.","<strong>Reporting Software Bugs &amp; Issues<br/></strong> Look for a bug tracker that offers customizable bug report templates. Adjusting bug report fields ensures that your team has relevant information and documentation to track and fix bugs. Some platforms allow you to log bug reports via email, and others automatically detect and report issues. Also, some platforms automatically detect and merge duplicate bugs so your team doesn’t waste time on multiple reports. Consider what bug-reporting features benefit your software development team when looking at software options.","<strong>Team Management<br/></strong> Your team needs a dashboard that displays bug and issue reports in a clear, functional way. Look for dashboards that allow team members to filter them in terms of what issues they&#39;re assigned to help prioritize tasks. Dashboards with advanced search functions allow you to search the entire body of a bug report to identify and link common issues. Finally, dashboards help administrators evaluate the workflow of individual team members so tasks are assigned accordingly. That also helps to monitor project milestones.","<strong>Team Communication<br/></strong> Some software development teams keep track of bugs in spreadsheets and email chains. Look for bug tracking software that eliminates that step. Team members should be able to upload notes, screenshots, documents or videos directly into bug report fields. They should also be able to see who completed tasks by simply opening a ticket. Also, look for an application that sends automatic notifications to groups of users once specific tasks are completed, or that emails regular progress reports to team members.","<strong>Price Plans<br/></strong> Bug tracking software offers flexible price points for development teams of all sizes. Open-source bug tracking tools are free of charge, but third-party plugins may require an additional charge. Other platforms charge monthly rates based on the number of active users or active projects your team has. Look for a tiered pricing system that allows the platform to grow and contract with your team&#39;s current needs. Many platforms offer flexible price points to accomplish that.","Bug tracking software can help you identify and resolve issues at every stage of the development process. It allows your team to visualize workflow, progress and individual tasks. Ultimately, it helps your team ship quality software on time.","<strong>Axosoft Review</strong>"]},"id":"da4bdcdb-facf-4c7b-b265-4a329f2640b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/5ycU5CmdfGbRkyX6rnijEQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Axosoft bug tracking software evolves with your project management needs.

The system also sends daily email summaries to team members that detail the previous day&#39;s activity to help plan future tasks.","Sifter&#39;s price structure is not like other bug trackers&#39; price structures. Its price is based on the number of active projects you have at a given time, not the number of users. Plans support anywhere from 10 to 150 active projects at one time, which makes it a viable bug tracker and project management tool for teams of all sizes.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Zoho Review</strong>"]},"id":"650e0e18-33a1-491c-a55f-7e7cc7d04f09","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/T2nGDyNWcHkfENXGWNKtH7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Zoho Projects Bug Tracker is designed to meet the needs of growing businesses.

Bug report templates are recorded in a virtual dashboard. It provides an overview of current issues and more detailed information about the status of specific defects.","The platform allows you to assign and review tasks in a customizable workflow that you can adjust to match your company&#39;s internal processes. You can establish project milestones and measure the progress of projects with status reports, notifications for next steps and links to relevant information. These custom workflow features provide defect-tracking tools, as well as tools to manage your development team.","This software can also improve communication among your development team. The platform sends automatic alerts when the status of a bug has changed, when next steps are amended or when a bug has been resolved. That cuts down on the need for back-and-forth communication while ensuring your team members are on the same page.","Also, individual team members can view an itemized list of bugs that have been assigned to them or that they reported. That prevents tasks from slipping through the cracks and enables your team members to prioritize their most important tasks. The bug tracking software allows administrators to classify the severity of bugs and to categorize defects in terms of issues like security, crashes and data loss. You can also customize permissions for each level of severity so that only specific team members can alter, move or delete high-importance bugs.","Zoho Projects offers flexible price options to reflect the needs of growing development teams. You can use a free version of the software to track bugs in one project. Other versions of the software enable your development team to track bugs on anywhere from 20 to an unlimited number of projects. That enables you to base your subscription level on your team&#39;s current needs.","The Zoho Projects Bug Tracker is a versatile, customizable platform that your growing business can use to establish a bug tracking process or to meet changing needs. The platform&#39;s flexible price points make it an option for teams of all sizes.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"70519f5d-1a89-4cfc-83cd-b3a83fc6a0de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10355","url":"/best-bug-tracking-software-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-12-22T18:52:01Z","datePublished":"2016-12-22T18:52:01Z","name":"Best Bug Tracking Software Review","synopsis":"Software development is a messy business.
