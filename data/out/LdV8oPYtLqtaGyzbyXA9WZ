Our testers overwhelmingly preferred curling irons with the more traditional clip design, but this is one of the best curling wands out there. Also, it scored better than all but one of the curling irons we reviewed for curl longevity – our testers’ hair still looked pretty good after eight hours and an aerobics class, which is impressive. The <a href=\"http://staging.toptenreviews.com/xtava-review?status=InProgress\">Xtava Satin Wave</a> is another option with a different clamp design, but provides long lasting curls. ","Wand-style curling irons are hard to get used to. Because of their design, you need to wear a glove so you can wind your hair close enough to the barrel and not burn your fingers. Most of our testers found the glove annoying, and those with short hair were frustrated they could only produce waves with this Remington model, not actual curls. Some of this comes down to personal preference, but it is safe to say that curling wands like this one are just harder to use than traditional curling irons. The strengths of the wand design – no creases or split ends from the clamp – outweigh the learning curve for some.","This is a good wand curling iron because it features a ceramic barrel. The barrel is also infused with real pearls, which are meant to help your hair slide up and down it and also help create smooth, no-frizz curls. Also, ceramic barrels generally heat more evenly and quickly than other types. This is especially important on a curling iron that gets as hot as this one – over 400 degrees. High temperatures are great for thick hair and quick styling, but you definitely want that heat distributed as evenly as possible to protect against damage.","The T-Studio Pearl Ceramic Styling Wand has good safety features, including automatic shut-off. This means it turns off on its own after a period of time with no use. It also includes a heat-resistant glove, which keeps you from burning your fingers on the hot barrel. When you use a curling wand instead of a traditional curling iron, you are more likely to burn your hand because of how close it gets to the barrel, so it is good you don’t need to purchase a glove separately. The wand doesn’t come with a protective heat shield, which would be a nice addition because they protect you and the other items on your counter from the barrel as it cools off.","Another one of this curling wand’s advantages is its digital display, which allows you to see the temperature setting clearly. This Remington model fell in the middle of the pack for temperature accuracy. When we compared its actual temperature to the one on displayed on the screen, it was within 40 degrees. That&#39;s great compared to a lot of the competition.","The T-Studio Pearl has a disappointingly short cord – it is only 5.7 feet long. This is one of the shortest power cords we saw on this type of device, and the best cords are around 8 or 9 feet long. When your curling iron has a long cord, you have more flexibility with how and where you curl your hair. However, the power cord swivels, which makes it easier to curl the hair on the back of your head. The curling wand has an overall ergonomic design, and we found it to be very easy to hold.","This hair wand comes with a four-year manufacturer warranty, which is one of the longer warranties for this type of device – many of its competitors are only covered for one or two years. If you have any issues or concerns, you can reach a Remington support representative via email or telephone."]},"id":"8b0e00f1-dfd2-419f-aaf4-3831e49a5772","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f87c931a-7bcc-45a2-a0f8-9a95ef1ad01a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Remington T-Studio Pearl Ceramic Professional Styling Wand is easily one of the best curling wands available.
