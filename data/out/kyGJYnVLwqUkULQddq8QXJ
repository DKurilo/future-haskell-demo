This program has more than 40 drum kits, along with pianos, saxophones and bass sounds. We did notice that some of the drum kits sound artificial, even for electronic drums. We love the 16-track layout and how easy it is to navigate the software. This simple beat maker is easy to learn and is perfect if you want to break into beat making.","DUBturbo has revamped the newest version of its beat making program by adding additional tracks to create beats on. The 16-track layout has a linear feel to it, and by clicking on an individual track, you can open it up and create any sound you want on up to 48 different tracks. The system automatically quantizes your recordings and snaps the notes to the right spots. This is an effective tool to have with any beat creating software because your ear may miss the tempo on some occasions.","There is no drag-and-drop system with DUBturbo, but all you have to do is click to add sounds. Once a sound is in a certain spot, if you don&#39;t like it, you can drag notes to new positions. All of the 2,400 sounds are arranged on the left side of the interface. Scrolling up and down is the only way to find what you are looking for since there is no search function.","Of the 2,400 sounds on DUBturbo, more than 40 of them are drum kits. Many sound authentic, but we found more that sound fake and simulated. You also have access to other sounds like pianos, guitar amps, bass sounds and even brass instruments. What we like most about the sounds are the custom vocals that give more depth to your creations. The program also has a four-octave virtual keyboard, but you can only control it with your computer&#39;s keyboard. The system doesn&#39;t allow you to hook up a MIDI keyboard.","DUBturbo comes with full video training courses that help you learn the beat making software in detail. We love to see this, especially since DUBturbo representatives are hard to reach. The videos go over such things as how to build bass lines, drum patterns and create a solid intro and outro to your song."]},"id":"6e5d87a4-cd83-4640-bfa8-2b60bce41774","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"90753298-0770-4a46-94f9-34f2de58db8a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["DUBturbo isn&#39;t the best beat software on the market, but it is great if you want a cheap introduction to custom beat making.
