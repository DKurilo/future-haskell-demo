Unlike the displays in our review with more thoughtful designs, which are light and easy to adjust, the monitor has a stiff neck and a heavy base. ","While its height is adjustable – the monitor easily slides up and down – the HP EliteDisplay has one of the most limited tilt ranges of the models we compared: 30 to -5 degrees. Adjusting the tilt requires two hands and a good deal of force, which disrupts workflow. However, the touchscreen display can rotate 90 degrees, so it is one of the only vertical-capable displays in our review. The monitor can also be hung on the wall, but you need to remove the stand before attaching it via the standard VESA mounting system.","This HP model has the same projective capacitive touch technology as the other monitors in our comparison, which means you don’t need any special tools, such as a stylus, for it to register your touch. Instead, the monitor responds to the electromagnetic field around your finger. The touch function was reliable and easy to use during our testing.","On average, the monitor consumes more energy than some of the large touchscreen displays, like the <a href=\"/acer-t232hl-review\">Acer T232HL</a>. Because of this, it costs more to keep the HP Elite Display running month to month than some of its more impressive competitors.","The display’s smooth glass screen surface gave it a little bit of an edge, but the speaker placement and wider bezels keep it from being very touch-friendly. Images appear slightly sharper on this model than its competitors because it has as smaller screen. In addition, it has a response time of 8 milliseconds, which is average compared to the other monitors in our review.","This display is equipped with a cable organizer, but its ports are very difficult to reach. Also, because the stand was difficult to maneuver, it took us a while to find the easiest way to access the connections when changing out cables.","The HP EliteDisplay isn’t equipped with an HDMI connection or a DVI connection. We found the absence of an HDMI port to be an oversight, and it caused difficulties during our testing process. The display has two USB 3.0 ports: one upstream for touch functionality and one standard port. The DisplayPort on our test model was not functioning at the time of testing, so we were unable to conduct some of the color display tests we put the other monitors through.","HP includes a three-year warranty, which is standard for a touchscreen monitor. The company’s technical support system is lacking; while the website has a lot of forums and troubleshooting walkthroughs, there isn’t an easy-to-find technical support phone number. "]},"id":"09bdf1b6-c719-4cba-b0bf-0f32f5382778","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3196bc3b-5262-4bb8-9ca7-f8461878667c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As we evaluated touchscreens, we looked for monitors that can replace a standard display on a desktop and are comfortable to use for extended periods of time.
