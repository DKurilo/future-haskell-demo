You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hoover SteamVac PowerMax Extractor is one of the few <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaners</a> we found that does not run with the use of a belt. Additionally, this is one of the carpet cleaners we reviewed that offers two different tanks that keep your cleaning solution and dirty water separate. Add to that the heated dry function, and this is a good little machine to keep in your household for cleaning up messes.","The Hoover SteamVac PowerMax Extractor carpet cleaning machine has several features that will help you to keep your carpet cleaning time to a minimum while still getting the job done well. This is one of the few carpet cleaners we found that offers SpinScrub technology. This technology allows the brushes to spin around, cleaning each fiber of your carpet in a 360-degree pattern. We also like that the handheld stair tool also uses this technology.","This rug cleaner also comes with a ready-to-use hose. This means that when you get to scrubbing those stairs, you don’t have to mess with hooking up a hose. You can simply turn the dial to the tools setting and use your handheld brush to begin scrubbing the carpet on your stairs. By not having to stop and add a hose to your machine, you will save precious time and energy.","Among carpet cleaners, this unit is easier to move from floor to floor in your house because it only weighs 20 pounds. However, along with a reduction in weight comes a reduction in the cleaning width that this unit provides. While you will have the luxury of using a lighter carpet cleaning machine, you will have to make a few more strokes to ensure that your entire carpet has been thoroughly cleaned.","Out of all of the carpet cleaners we reviewed, this is one of the few models that is not driven by a belt. This will save you the frustration of being in the middle of a cleaning job when a belt breaks, forcing you to stop partway through the job. Surprisingly, the fact that it isn&#39;t belt driven doesn’t seem to affect the efficiency of this cleaning machine.","Because Hoover is a brand that has been around for generations, it is also a name you can count on when researching carpet cleaners. This carpet cleaner comes with a user manual that will walk you through the initial assembly of your machine and teach you how to clean certain stains. The manufacturer&#39;s website is full of FAQs and tutorials. If you still have questions, they offer a telephone number and email address for contacting their customer support team."]},"id":"40e7eb67-1658-46aa-a7f4-f3d62ba3610b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3073e3be-d17e-441d-a75a-c65f3a061d1d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although the Hoover SteamVac PowerMax Extractor is one of the few carpet cleaners in this review that is not belt driven, it is a good little machine.
