You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Bosch Ascenta DLX SHX5AL05UC is a <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> with a long name and an equally long list of features. From a sleek design to a concealed heating element to a delay start timer, the Ascenta DLX makes washing dishes seem less like a chore. We liked Bosch’s SHE6AP05UC better in price and features, hence the SHX5AL05UC was pushed to the bottom of the pack.","One of the quietest dishwashers on the market, the Bosch Ascenta records at 53dB, approximately the same noise level of a normal conversation. This is quite a feat when, at capacity, the washer can hold 14, 5-piece, place settings. You could host a dinner party, load the dishes and continue your conversation with little interruption. It surprises you still with two options that go with five different wash cycles. You also wouldn’t think that with all of the potential water and power being used, that this dishwasher would be energy efficient, but it is actually Energy Star Qualified and only costs an estimated $32 a year to operate.","One such Energy Star approved feature it the optimum wash sensor. This sensor determines the soil intensity of the dishes you load and adjusts the water level to be more efficient. The stainless steel interior also increases efficiency by trapping in heat and sanitizing the dishes. Although the Bosch Ascenta doesn’t have a heated dry option, it does have a special drying function called SaniDry that dries via hygienic condensation. But by far our favorite feature is the concealed heating element. While standard dishwashers have a visible coil that burns misplaced plastic items, a concealed heating element avoids such a situation entirely. We wonder why this feature wasn’t thought of before now!","Esthetically, the Bosch Ascenta DLX is beautiful. This is the kind of appliance that would fit perfectly in the most modern kitchen or add a sleek touch to a contemporary one. Stainless steel with clean lines, it even has hidden controls to enhance the simplistic feel. And with standard dimensions for an under-the-counter dishwasher, it can be installed as seamlessly as it’s designed.","If you aren’t impressed by its appearance, you will be by the warranty. Bosch truly knows how to take care of their customers. The Bosch Ascenta DLX comes with a one-year parts and two-year labor warranty as well as a five-year warranty on the dish racks and electronic controls. To top things off, they include a lifetime warranty on the tub and door liner. For additional information, Bosch has an “additional documents” link on their website which leads you to downloadable user manuals."]},"id":"b5c86e2a-02e9-4f3a-9dd6-0ea6ebd79250","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0e99fefc-4e37-4513-9b9f-1dc8d97919c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch Ascenta DLX SHX5AL05UC made its way into our top ten products for a reason: it has a top-notch warranty and features that blow the average dishwasher out of the water. The competition is stiff though and even a few lacking features like a hard food disposer, nylon racks and a heated dry option knocks it out of the top three. However, we are in love with this dishwasher’s streamlined design. It would make a gorgeous accessory to any kitchen.
