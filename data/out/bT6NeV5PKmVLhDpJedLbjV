The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Whirlpool Smart WFL98HEBU front-load washer fits right into today’s advanced technology. Whirlpool’s Smart Assistant technology with 6th Sense Live features  allow you to monitor and control certain functions on your washer via your smartphone even when you’re away from your home.","This washing machine with its tub capacity of 4.3 cubic feet has 14 wash cycles, seven options, three soil levels, and five wash and rinse temperatures for each load of laundry that you do.","As an Energy Star qualified front-loader washer, you can expect it to cost you an estimated $16 annually to run. It also consumes an estimated 155-kilowatt hours of energy every year. These figures are found in the appliance’s EnergyGuide.","You can save even more energy by using the EcoBoost option that is included in the washer. This feature lowers the temperature of the water and uses more tumbling to decrease the amount of energy used during the cycle while still providing you with the wash performance you want.","We were impressed to see this Whirlpool Smart front-load washer offer not only the standard wash cycles that you would expect on a washer, but also an allergen wash cycle, jeans wash cycle and a clean-washer cycle. Its allergen wash cycle can help to remove up to 95 percent of common household allergens that are often found on laundry.","We are disappointed to see that this Whirlpool Smart front-load washer is not available in any color variety; however, we do like the slick look of the brushed silver color. This washer doesn’t come standard with the pedestal drawer, but it is an option you can add for an additional cost.","This front-loader washer is fairly standard in size, as it sits 38-1/2 inches in height without the optional pedestal drawer, 27 inches wide and is 32-3/4 inches deep.","Whirlpool doesn’t provide more than a slim one-year warranty for this front-loader washing machine. We were specifically disappointed to see that the appliance motor and washtub don’t have lengthier coverage like many other manufacturers provide.","If you need any help and support with this Whirlpool front-load washer, you can contact the manufacturer by phone, email and even a live chat function on its website. Additionally, Whirlpool provides a handful of FAQs and the product user manual online for your reference."]},"id":"21904deb-3c25-4c81-a036-8d838942db8c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d17c0895-e694-4637-b225-c9d4c559341f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Smart WFL98HEBU front-loading washer comes with neat high-tech features, a plethora of wash cycles and a sufficient amount of options for doing your laundry.
