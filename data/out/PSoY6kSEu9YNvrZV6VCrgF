This solar cover measures 12 feet across and is the smallest solar pool cover in Amerimerc&#39;s product lineup. Its material is a heavy-duty polyethylene, a plastic polymer commonly used for pool covers. The solar cover has a thickness of 8 mils. This makes the solar cover considerably thinner than most pool covers, but it also means that it is lightweight enough for one person to deploy and roll up. For small pools, the blanket is thick enough to trap heat enough to warm up the pool.","The polyethylene material of the solar cover has a top layer made of ultraviolet-protective film. Therefore, it is highly resistant to ultraviolet rays and can easily survive ultraviolet-induced damage that causes polyethylene covers to shrivel and split. AmeriMerc backs this pool blanket with a three-year warranty.","There are rows of raised air pockets on the underside of the solar cover. These serve as an insulation layer that prevents convectional heat loss caused by the flow of air over the surface of the water in a pool. The air bubbles also warm up the pool by other means. They act as tiny prisms for spreading sunlight across the surface and deep into the water in the pool. In addition, they trap heat underneath the solar pool cover and prevent water evaporation from the pool. Through these means, they harvest thermal heat from sunlight during the day and retain the heat at night and during cool, cloudy days. Overall, the solar cover can help raise the water temperature of your swimming pool by 15 degrees Fahrenheit.","The solar cover has a transparent blue color that permits sunlight to reach a pool for optimal heating. However, it is not as efficient at this as a clear pool blanket. Although the blue color of the solar cover looks good on a swimming pool, it still blocks some amount of solar rays like every other colored pool cover. Unlike clear pool covers, the Blue Solar Cover will absorb the blue part of the visible light spectrum and, therefore, deliver less thermal energy than a clear cover. However, it is significantly better than a black cover that blocks the passage of sunlight or a silver cover that reflects sunlight. The <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Poolcenter 16 Mil</a> is a nice solar blanket that has a variety of color options.","The Amerimerc Blue Solar Cover is a relatively thin and small solar blanket. However, it is quite lightweight and durable, thanks to its UV-resistant layer. It has the blue color that most people love on their pools but that color also slightly diminishes its performance."]},"id":"e84e050f-1d63-40d0-a93e-d962ef4338c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63261","url":"/amerimerc-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:56:12Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:56:12Z","name":"Amerimerc Blue Solar Cover R8-1212","synopsis":"The Amerimerc Blue Solar Cover is a round solar blanket made for above-ground swimming pools.
