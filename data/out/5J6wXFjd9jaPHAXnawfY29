You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frigidaire FPUS2698LF may not have all the advanced features found in some of its competitors, but this <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a> has great storage capacity and will store all of your family&#39;s favorite foods.","The Frigidaire FPUS2698LF has some great storage space in the refrigerator and freezer areas. The refrigerator has 16.5 cubic feet of space, which is typical for a side-by-side refrigerator, and the freezer has 9.5 cubic feet – for a grand total of 26 cubic feet.","The outside of the stainless steel side-by-side refrigerator is simple and plain. We do like the tall water dispenser with one paddle for ice and water. You are able to lock the water dispenser, which is perfect if you have children.","To maintain the appearance of your side-by-side refrigerator, we recommend referencing the Care &amp; Cleaning tips section in the Complete Owner&#39;s Guide and watching the Care &amp; Cleaning video guide.","The refrigerator area of this Frigidaire side by side has a great layout, with three shelves, one meat keeper, two crispers, one diary compartment and four door bins. We are disappointed the crispers do not have humidity controls, but are pleased that the option is available for the rest of the appliance.","All of the shelves in the Frigidaire FPUS2698LF are spill-proof with lipped edges to keep liquids from spilling over. The shelves are also adjustable and clean easily.","Frigidaire is cognizant of religious traditions and has supplied this model with the Sabbath mode, which is Star-K certified and perfect for Orthodox Jewish holidays and Sabbath observance. To ensure that your food remains at safe temperatures during this time, the High Temperature alarm is still activated.","The ice dispenser in this refrigerator, compared to those in top-rated refrigerators, is underwhelming, but it still serves its purpose. The ice dispenser is located in the top, left corner of the freezer. To begin generating ice, you will flip the wire signal arm down and place the ice container underneath. This Frigidaire side-by-side refrigerator will begin producing ice within 24 hours. To stop the ice from dispensing, flip that same wire signal arm up. The dispenser will also automatically shut off when the ice container is full. The water and ice dispensers use the PureSource Ultra filter system.","This side-by-side refrigerator is Energy Star Certified by the U.S. government. According to the official Energy Guide report, this side-by-side refrigerator has an estimated yearly operating cost of $54 and uses 509 kilowatts of electricity.","You have access to a variety of help and support options, including five different PDF guides. You can view these guides online or print them off for your convenience. The Complete Owner&#39;s Guide is terrific, with well-written content and easy-to-understand instructions. The problem is, the guide is not model-specific, so you will need to know what your side-by-side refrigerator model offers before you read the manual.","The Video Guides section nears perfection and offers instructional clips covering topics such as:"]},"id":"baaa744e-e1d5-4fb6-a4a0-6fa9ecdb9f8c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Care &amp; Cleaning","General Installation","Ice Services","Control Features"],"type":"ul"},"id":"08b5c1ea-d978-4f80-9dd6-38a0d209ee6a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can contact Frigidaire by completing an online email form or calling customer support Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST.
