The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-free-email-services\">Free Email Services</a> here.</em>","Dora Mail is a simple and efficient free email provider. With your account, you get 10 MB of inbox storage. You can create 12 custom filters, set sorting rules, restrict access with black/ white lists, search your mail and import your address book from another email account. Dora Mail includes a plain text and HTML composer with spell check.","Additionally, you can check POP3 accounts, chat with other members in chat rooms or forums and send ecards. If you do not want images from being visible in your mailbox you need to manually configure it in your preferences.","Dora Mail offers few practical extras. They have a calendar feature, but they do not include a notepad, a notifier, online storage or mobile access. Additionally, they do not warn users about emails that maybe possible phishing attempts.","Our biggest complaint with Dora Mail is pop–ups. Although they are not overbearing, a few pop–ups slipped through. We don’t mind a few advertisements, after all this is a free service; however, pop–ups are annoying and unprofessional. We know the average, everyday user doesn’t like accidentally clicking on and being redirected by a pop–up ad.","Dora Mail never returned our emails. If your account goes inactive for 60 days it will be deactivated.","For a free email service with just as much space, but no pop–ups and more practical extras see the <a href=\"/msn-hotmail-review\">#2 service, Windows Live</a>."]},"id":"ac67a32d-a4b9-4456-b87b-28524f8d9f2d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2049","url":"/dora-mail-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-04-01T17:46:06Z","name":"Dora Mail","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":60,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-04-01T17:46:06Z","id":"RLBa5EanK8ggP4uKJn2xDi","meta":{"title":"Dora Mail Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":" Dora Mail is a simple and efficient free email provider.
