As a busy person you need something to help you keep pace with your fast-paced life, and the HTC Droid Incredible does just that.  With a simple design, amazing screen and a good camera, the Droid Incredible is giving other Smartphones, such as the Nexus One and the Apple iPhone, a run for their money. It places near the top when considering a new smartphone.

HTC has been producing very solid phones for a few years now. With a design similar to other smartphones, this HTC device is an attractive phone. With a 480 x 800-pixel display, the colors will pop and bring a whole new world to the palm of your hand.  Designed with a 3.7 inch screen, the Incredible has a much larger display than the Apple iPhone and is the same size as Google’s Nexus One. However, when comparing the Incredible to the Google smartphone, the Droid is chunkier and more difficult to hold in one’s hand. They are similar with very little difference, but the Nexus One contains a more sleek and fluid design.","This HTC phone has an optical joystick which is used to navigate on the phone instead of a trackball. Four small buttons, home, menu, back and search, are found on the front of the phone but these are so small that the touch screen is used for almost everything."]},"id":"5b4ec7ce-2068-4559-b443-6a0284b9b9dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"de60370f-3a85-431b-bb0c-2e1cf30ae6c7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Outdoing most other smartphones, the Droid Incredible features an 8MP camera and dual LED flash. For a phone camera, that&#39;s impressive. And this camera doesn’t stop there. The camera features built-in editing so you can edit your photos directly on your phone. The photo gallery is new and unique on the Incredible and can be opened in either a timeline or a grid. Even video can be captured at 640 x 480 pixels, which means it will look sharp and you will be proud to call the video footage your own.","The music player on the Incredible has some strong improvements when compared to other HTC products, such as the Droid, but it still does not top the list of media features. It offers the basic music functions and even comes with an FM radio, but headphones must be used to hear anything from those FM frequencies and sometimes that causes an inconvenience.","If social networking is more what you are looking for, the Incredible offers Friend Stream. Facebook, Twitter and Flickr updates are all brought together in one single place through this social networking feature. It saves you the hassle of signing into three different accounts and you get all your friendly gossip in one place quickly and efficiently."]},"id":"9169576f-099b-4c82-aa5c-3d80172aef54","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Camera"},"id":"40ca1377-41f6-49b2-91f1-b66f10f7e5c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Droid Incredible provides more than five hours of continuous talk time on a single charge.

The phone runs a newer version of HTC Sense, a  user interface which gives it quite the advantage over other phones, including the Nexus One, which uses Standard Android UI. HTC Sense gives a more user-friendly interface and the primary functions are improved and well-organized. This new version includes a widget that allows you to view all your email instead of just one message at a time, helping you be more productive at a quicker pace.","The Leap Screen is another huge advantage for the Incredible. By pinching your home screen, the phone brings up a thumbnail view of all your home screen panels. This way you can leap easily from one screen to another and access widgets easier.  This phone’s main goal is to make your life easier, and that is exactly what happens.","Of course Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS are included in the features, along with the other Google must-haves such as Gmail, Google Talk, YouTube, QuickOffice and the Android Market."]},"id":"6d4f7140-9b60-4762-9684-00da8405a821","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"63b93384-8129-450e-ac7c-d26b7f23cc77","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HTC Droid Incredible is rightly named.
