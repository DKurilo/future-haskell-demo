It takes a different approach from some other firewalls in that it works by applying rules to the applications you run rather than forcing you to identify the port the application is running on. This makes for an easier configuration, and much more intuitive management panel.","The management panel takes things a bit further though by allowing you to set configurations by using a slider instead of finding specific options in a sea of checkboxes."]},"id":"b2d59ca2-0c79-473d-8479-98523fc0734b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Test Results"},"id":"6e0457f5-915e-41ea-aa6e-9a7c8b327fbb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Webroot Desktop Firewall makes firewall configuration easy. After it finishes its installation process, you are presented with a simple and intuitive management panel that has all the major settings you will ever need to use right at your fingertips.","It includes a 7 day training period where the firewall software learns what your computer does, what you do, and how you interact with your computer and programs. While it learns, it adjusts its settings to adapt to how you work. This makes for a VERY simple configuration because it does much of it on its own.","Another nice thing it has going for it is the sliders it uses for configuration. These are used for quick configuration of your Internet Security level, your Network Security Level, and your Process Monitoring level. If you find that the slider doesn’t do exactly what you want, there are more advanced options available at the touch of a button.","Webroot Desktop Firewall also includes several logging options that may be important if you are attacked at any time. These logs include data that can be forwarded to authorities to assist in tracking down the bad men and women of the world that want to steal or damage your data.","It has the standard options to either kill all network traffic or open your system up to any network traffic. This is in the form of a stop light that is turned sideways. Click on red and everything stops. Click on green and you are wide open to everything. Click the yellow light and you will go back to your normal configuration.","The downfall of Webroot Desktop Firewall is the features it doesn’t include. It performs great for a standalone firewall, but doesn’t have options such as Ad-Blocking, Email Scanning, Virus Scanner Integration, and many others that come with some of the more popular firewall packages."]},"id":"13886d57-860e-44a7-9c81-a037e3e0da41","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"User Experience"},"id":"351b52b1-14f7-425d-a36e-b540e329fedc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With the use of sliders to handle much of the configuration process, Webroot Desktop Firewall gets an A on the easy factor.
