Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison of the <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">best wine coolers</a> because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information</em>","The EdgeStar CWF340DZ is a sturdy <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">wine cooler</a> that has two cooling zones so you can chill both red and white wines at the same time. The temperatures range between 64 and 41 degrees Fahrenheit, which means it’s also good for sweet and sparkling wines that need to be chilled at a much colder temperature than other drinks. During our in-house tests, the EdgeStar maintained its temperatures throughout our entire test so well that we ended up moving bottles from the units that did not perform as well into it to rescue them from inconsistent temperatures. This cooler also recovered to the proper temperatures relatively quickly after we added the new bottles.","The reason the EdgeStar CWF340DZ gets colder than other wine fridges in our comparison is because it uses a compressor system. This is the same cooling system used in standard refrigerators. Now, there are a couple downfalls to a compressor system. For one it uses a lot more energy than thermoelectric coolers. It also is louder when it runs. However, while it was running in our test lab it didn’t seem much louder than the thermoelectric models. If you would prefer a thermoelectric cooled wine fridge, the <a href=\"/koldfront-review\">Koldfront TWR181ES</a> is a decent choice that still gets fairly cold and is also a dual-zone model.","We placed 36 standard-size wine bottles into the EdgeStar CWF340DZ wine cooler, the number the manufacturer advertises. We could also fit taller bottles of gewürztraminer that would not fit into some of the other coolers we tested. There is one shelf per zone that can accommodate wider bottles. The slide-out shelves seem sturdy enough for regular use, and the wood trim makes the shelves more attractive than simple metal shelves. Also, the door is reversible to accommodate the space where you put the unit. This wine cooler does have a lock, but the simple key is a common hex shape that could easily be mimicked by a wily teenager.","This dual-zone wine chiller is freestanding, so it needs enough room around it to properly ventilate. It also isn’t built to sit in a garage or other area where temperatures fluctuate. The EdgeStar wine cooler comes with a one-year warranty, but using it outside, in a garage or as a built-in could invalidate the warranty.","The EdgeStar CWF340DZ dual-zone, freestanding wine fridge tested well in our lab, and it can fit 36 bottles. If you are looking for a unit for your merlots and chardonnay, this wine cooler can accommodate your needs. Or if you enjoy some bubbly, it can chill sparkling wines to the proper temperature as well."]},"id":"f71b9a7a-e358-4881-b0a8-7cb47fe6e023","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50572","url":"/edgestar-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-30T16:11:44Z","datePublished":"2010-08-30T16:11:44Z","name":"EdgeStar CWF340DZ 34 Bottle","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison of the best wine coolers because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":86,"verdict":"The EdgeStar CWF340DZ is ideal for those who want to maintain a modest collection of mixed varieties of wine.","pros":["This dual-zone wine cooler maintains consistent temperatures for both red and white wines."],"cons":["Its compressor cooling system uses more energy than thermoelectric systems."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison of the best wine coolers because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","id":"6RUGP8vvCnQHXVCNEAtCeX","meta":{"title":"EdgeStar CWF340DZ Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The EdgeStar CWF340DZ is ideal for those who want to maintain a modest collection of mixed varieties of wine."},"products":[{"slug":"edgestar-cwf340dz-34-bottle","url":"/product/edgestar-cwf340dz-34-bottle","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","name":"EdgeStar CWF340DZ 34 Bottle","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","id":"LthDi5B9KxGGdpswvoaNkA","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/VehefMwvqGH4rYmbuByGuY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"e6a89ebd4f19dc7ee84747534feb09d3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/e6a89ebd4f19dc7ee84747534feb09d3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","id":"VehefMwvqGH4rYmbuByGuY","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VehefMwvqGH4rYmbuByGuY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"EdgeStar CWF340DZ Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The EdgeStar CWF340DZ is ideal for those who want to maintain a modest collection of mixed varieties of wine."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/VehefMwvqGH4rYmbuByGuY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"e6a89ebd4f19dc7ee84747534feb09d3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/e6a89ebd4f19dc7ee84747534feb09d3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","id":"VehefMwvqGH4rYmbuByGuY","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VehefMwvqGH4rYmbuByGuY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"EdgeStar CWF340DZ Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The EdgeStar CWF340DZ is ideal for those who want to maintain a modest collection of mixed varieties of wine."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/edgestar-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"refrigerators","url":"/kitchen/refrigerators","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","name":"Refrigerators","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","id":"hGnCzHoUh2aAKgnXsQGcFg","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"product-tenancy-edgestar-cwf340dz-34-bottle","url":"/product-tenancy-edgestar-cwf340dz-34-bottle","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","name":"Product Tenancy EdgeStar CWF340DZ 34 Bottle","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:36:22Z","id":"YArVjZRewqHm6vW3JfEWWd","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"control","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
