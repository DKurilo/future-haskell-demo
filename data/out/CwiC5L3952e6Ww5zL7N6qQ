Nonetheless, the resulting “panini” sandwich tasted good, even while lacking its identifying calling card. <br />\n <br />\nThe flat cooking surface cooks evenly, and this sandwich maker got perfect scores when we tested the evenness of heat distribution with two slices of white bread. The slices showed uniform browning from edge to edge. The cooking surface for this sandwich maker is small, so you can make only two regular-size sandwiches at a time. If you opt for larger bread slices, you’ll end up making one sandwich at a time.  <br />\n <br />\nWe found that a grilled cheese turned out nicely, but we had some trouble getting the sandwich off the cooking area. Otherwise, we encountered no problems with stickiness. As far as cleaning, this machine takes little time and effort. If you wipe or wash it down, it takes about two minutes. This also comes with a clip lock so you can snap it shut and store it standing upright, which is a great space-saver. You also can wrap the 24-inch electrical cord around a cord wrap area, saving even more storage space. <br />\n","<a href=\"/proctor-silex-sandwich-maker-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"0dc56269-7374-44b1-8598-7b933f21e8a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Most Versatile"},"id":"e2e69d2c-27a3-43f7-84bb-9ed52b62fc4c","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/x3hWjvXxSnicJuNKKqZhzE.jpg","link":{"href":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/breville-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/A/770302/original/Sandwich-Makers-Breville-Panini-Duo-BSG520XL-001.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x3hWjvXxSnicJuNKKqZhzE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"x3hWjvXxSnicJuNKKqZhzE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x3hWjvXxSnicJuNKKqZhzE.jpg","alt":"Breville Panini Duo BSG520XL"},"id":"dbe3a5de-628f-4d4d-a77f-55a5ba6fdfdd","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Breville Panini Duo BSG520XL\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/breville-review\">Breville Panini Duo BSG520XL</a>","pros":["Makes fine sandwiches","Can cook foods like pancakes, eggs and steak","Can adjust the height of the cooking surface"],"cons":["No grill ridges on the bottom cooking surface","Must flip a panini to get grill marks on both sides","Paninis can sometimes turn out too flat"]},"id":"4fb709b2-6eed-438e-a7a4-a18cd3b70d1b","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Breville Panini Duo BSG520XL sandwich and panini maker lets you prepare excellent sandwiches and more, providing a flat cooking surface for foods such as pancakes, eggs, steak or hamburgers.","You can adjust the floating hinge that connects the two cooking surfaces to four heights, which offers considerable cooking flexibility.

We read manufacturers’ websites, examined consumer reviews, looked at warranties and conditions, and then put each of the models we selected through a series of hands-on tests.","Among our tests, we measured how much space each unit would occupy on your countertop. While ideal size can depend on the number of people you cook for, we considered medium and small units to be better in terms of cleanup and storage. We deducted points from the scores of the largest units.","We also measured the total cooking area of each sandwich and panini maker. Again, while ideal size can depend on the number in your household, we considered medium and larger units to be better for getting the most use out of an appliance. This time, we docked points from the scores of the smallest units.","In addition, we looked at how easy each was to clean, whether you could put parts in the dishwasher, how easy it was to store (clip locks to hold a model shut and onboard cord storage earned extra points), and in general examined each sandwich maker&#39;s overall convenience, as well as cooking performance and design.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We tested each unit&#39;s cooking performance on grilled cheese sandwiches, along with turkey and panini sandwiches. The overall score, out of 100 percent, showed how effectively each sandwich maker could melt cheese and toast bread evenly for the grilled cheeses. We assigned lower scores to models that over-toasted parts of the bread or squashed the bread too flat and let melted cheese ooze out. We used the same scoring method with the paninis, with highest marks given to models that grilled a panini evenly from edge to edge without overly flattening the panini or crushing ingredients so they leaked out.","We determined how evenly each sandwich maker’s cooking surface distributed heat by lining it with slices of bread, giving high scores for even toasting. We gave lower scores for poor heat distribution that resulted in blotchy bread that was either toasted overly dark and dry in spots, or underdone and pasty.","In addition, we timed how long it took to take each machine out of the box and assemble it, as well as how long it took for each model to reach cook-ready temperatures after being plugged in.","For cleaning, we did two tests. We checked to see how easy it was to get the finished sandwich and any leaked ingredients off the surface after cooking several sandwiches in succession – and found dramatic differences among models. Some needed heavy scraping, while others let the bread and leaked cheese come off with almost no work on our part. Once we were done cooking, we timed how long it took to thoroughly clean each sandwich maker.","<strong>How Much Do Sandwich Makers Cost?</strong>","Sandwich makers are a great convenience in the kitchen but spending more doesn’t always result in better paninis or grilled sandwiches. In our tests we found that some of our cheaper panini presses like the Cuisinart Griddler made better sandwiches than some high-end models. Sandwich makers range in price from less than $20 to just under $100, with the average being about $50 for a quality model. Our advice is to purchase a sandwich maker that is $50 or less as the models we tested in this price range made excellent sandwiches and were easy to clean.","<strong>What to Look for in a Sandwich Maker</strong>","Performance<br/>The reason you&#39;d buy a sandwich and panini maker in the first place is because you want good food, so we looked for models that cooked these items without undercooking or overcooking. We looked for even heating, not-too-heavy compression for the bread, and rated for flavor and how appealing its texture was once we had cooked our test sandwiches and paninis.","Versatility<br/>It&#39;s always helpful to have small kitchen appliances that you can put to several uses. We noted and gave extra points to sandwich and panini makers you can use to cook other foods. Some have heating surfaces that open up, so you end up with countertop griddles for cooking meats and breakfast items.","Ease of Use<br/>There&#39;s no point in buying an extra appliance in the kitchen if it is complicated to use and creates extra work. We looked for sandwich and panini makers that release food easily, so your hot sandwich is intact and no messy melted cheese or other ingredients cling stubbornly to the cooking surface. We also checked to see which were the easiest to assemble, clean and store."]},"id":"b2f231c0-f0da-4fbb-9d61-8d7481cde3fc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_302","url":"/best-sandwich-makers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-18T13:26:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-18T13:26:00Z","name":"Best Sandwich Makers of 2019","synopsis":"We wanted a level playing field, so we tested each panini press with a sandwich that all the machines should handle well: grilled cheese.","review":{},"strapline":"We wanted a level playing field, so we tested each panini press with a sandwich that all the machines should handle well: grilled cheese.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-21T21:07:34Z","id":"CwiC5L3952e6Ww5zL7N6qQ","meta":{"title":"Best Sandwich Maker 2019 - Sandwich Maker Reviews, Comparison","description":"We wanted a level playing field, so we tested each panini press with a sandwich that all the machines should handle well: grilled cheese.
