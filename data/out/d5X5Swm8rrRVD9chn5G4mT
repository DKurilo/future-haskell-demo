In the case of the GWS Pico J-3 Stick, you will need your own transmitter. This <a href=\"/best-remote-control-airplanes\">remote control airplane</a> comes with all the necessary pieces to assemble it. Even a beginner pilot can put this plane together. The GWS Pico J-3 Stick can be ready to fly in under two hours and will give you up to 13 minutes of flight time – the longest of any of the RC planes we looked at. The ARF RC plane kits can add an extra level of difficulty when building and flying, but the GWS Pico J-3 Stick is a great introduction to the hobby for beginners who are looking for an added challenge.","The GWS Pico J-3 Stick has foam wings, as well as a foam tail and rudder. The fuselage rod is spruce and holds all the electronics for the plane. The GWS Pico J-3 Stick has a small electric motor, and the plane itself is very lightweight at 7.5  ounces. This beginner RC plane is best in indoor environments, but can still perform well on a calm day outside. You&#39;ll want to be careful with this micro flyer, though, because it won&#39;t take a beating like some other beginner RC planes. The overall wingspan is 41 inches and the length is around 26 inches, allowing you to fly in some tight places. You can fly the GWS Pico J-3 Stick in open spaces such as a gymnasium, or in smaller spaces like offices and apartments. You can even buy some streamers and start a dogfight in your office building.","Since the GWS Pico J-3 Stick is an ARF system, you will need to purchase a micro transmitter, as well as a speed control unit and a battery pack. The recommendation for a battery pack is one that puts out 270mAh of power – this is what will get you flight times closer to 13 minutes. GWS has two different flight packs that you can choose from. Both of these flight packs include the rest of the equipment you need to get your RC plane in the air. You also have the freedom to customize the plane with your own battery pack or transmitter. You can visit your local hobby shop if you have questions about which flight pack would be best for you and the GWS Pico J-3 Stick."]},"id":"1b8f5e14-af30-4977-811e-f0a5e314422b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"04197ce7-1712-4baf-8004-efbaf01e923b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for a little more of a challenge than your basic beginner RC plane, the GWS Pico J-3 Stick will give you a few more customization options to fulfill that need.
