While it&#39;s compact, it makes good use of space. It has an unusual amount of depth for a small grill. Our testing revealed that you can fit 16 hamburger patties on its primary cooking surface. The warming tray can fit up to six buns.","There are two fold-out side tables on either end of the cooking area, which is a great place for salads, condiments and other barbeque items. The fact that the tables easily fold for storage is a nice feature, making this small BBQ gas grill a good option for people with limited deck space.","Like other Char-Broil gas grills, this grill heats up fast. The SureFire electronic igniter lit the burners quickly. The grill heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit in under two minutes and was the fastest heating grill in our gas grill reviews. Unfortunately, it didn’t retain heat as well as we would have liked. It cooks meat fast, if somewhat unevenly. You can regulate heat better by grilling at low temperatures. The meat has less of a tendency to stick to the grates at low temperatures as well. The stainless-steel grates will have longevity, but they take scrubbing to get them clean, and they don’t cook as evenly as their cast-iron counterparts. With that said, it still cooks effectively and is a more affordable grill than the majority of cast-iron grills out there. This is one of the most affordable gas grills in our lineup.","The propane tank fits snuggly in the solidly constructed stainless-steel stand. You have to load it from the back, as the door in front isn’t big enough to accommodate installation. But you can, of course, turn the valve on and off from the front.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"931974e7-29e7-4a17-bade-992c16d28e27","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d3f917c7-3e23-4f60-adc4-44fd56d6e0b4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Char-Broil Stainless 2-Burner gas grill is a compact grill that is a great option for people with limited deck space who need a grill that will tuck nicely away after use.
