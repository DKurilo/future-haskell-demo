You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Fisher-Price Kid-Tough Digital Camera is built to survive drop after drop and hours of rough play with your child. This <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">child&#39;s digital camera</a> weighs more than 14 ounces and is recommended for children as young as 3 years old. It holds together well and will continue working after the hundredth bounce down the stairs.","This tough digital camera comes with two viewfinders, so your children can keep both eyes open while they focus on their subjects. Afterward, they can use the 1.4-inch view screen to see the fun memories they have captured. If you invest in a USB cable, you can connect the camera to your computer and upload your child&#39;s pictures to share. This child&#39;s camera comes with instructions for downloading special software that lets your child add photo effects and edit images before sharing them.","The Fisher-Price Kid-Tough Digital Camera has an amazing internal photo storage capacity. With 64GB of space, this child&#39;s camera can hold up to 2,000 images. The zoom buttons let your child get nice close-ups, or zoom out to get more into their snapshots. The included automatic flash is pretty powerful for a kids&#39; camera. It works for pictures taken up to 10 feet away.","You need to purchase four AAA batteries for this kids&#39; digital camera to work. The battery case is securely closed with screws, so your little one won&#39;t be tempted to take out and play with the batteries. This camera has an automatic shut-off feature to extend the battery life, so you don&#39;t have to worry about changing them so often.","Fisher-Price has some good support options. A user guide for the Kid-Tough Digital Camera comes in the package, but it&#39;s also available to download online. You can find telephone numbers and email addresses on the Fisher-Price website for one-on-one support. A FAQs section is also available online."]},"id":"7eff3c79-9cdd-4ff6-94e9-87ce2510ed10","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b2f826da-479a-4d67-b79c-870552ad3a75","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Fisher-Price Kid-Tough Digital Camera helps children fine-tune their motor skills and develop eye-hand coordination while promoting creativity.
