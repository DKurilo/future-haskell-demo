With just three buttons, Power (Bluetooth), Noise-Cancelling and Ambient Sound, they are crazy easy to use. Each one has its own LED light to indicate whether it is on, off or in pairing mode. Connecting the headphones to your Bluetooth device is also a breeze – you just hold down the power button and touch your NFC-enabled device and the headphones together. It took us all of 10 seconds to do in most cases. A voice prompt gives you information too. It calmly says things such as “power on,” “battery high,” and “noise-cancelling on” when you push each button.","During playback, you can control the volume and pause your song on the outside of the earcup. It works like a touchscreen, so you swipe up to increase the volume and tap to pause. We happened to test the cream-color pair of the Sony MDR-1000X, but they also come in a nice black depending on your style preferences."]},"id":"b71da8a6-12e6-4f70-bfc1-6c6850a4435c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"cef2e378-b21c-46fa-8b85-35ef112ffd8c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A one-year warranty protects these headphones from defects and damage.
