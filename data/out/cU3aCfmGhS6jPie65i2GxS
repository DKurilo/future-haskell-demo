However, Quicken doesn&#39;t use yellow. This can be a bonus if you know you have a set limit for a specific bill or expense each month and don&#39;t want to see a visual warning when you know you won&#39;t be going over budget.

Rather than simply having the color warnings in the program, this personal accounting software sends you an alert. This way, if you&#39;re out shopping and are nearing a limit, when Quicken receives that information from your bank, it alerts you via email or text, depending on your preferences. That heads up can help you stay within your established budget.","If a category is under budget, you can choose either to keep the same limit for the next month or roll the money over, increasing the total amount allotted to that category for the next month.<br/>Another option is to set saving goals, taking that amount you didn&#39;t spend and putting it toward a large purchase or vacation.
