You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For a complete picture of your daily health, the Band <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness tracker</a> records and analyzes your exercise and activity. With the accompanying app, the Band helps you make better choices to up your exercise routine.","The Striiv Band activity tracker monitors your steps taken, calories burned, distance traveled and more. You can also track your sleep habits to make sure you&#39;re getting enough sleep every night.","Out of all the fitness tracker reviews on our lineup, the best devices are those with small, compact designs. Similar to the Band, the Touch is another fitness tracker from Striiv with the same design and features. The Striiv Band and Touch both have thin, silicone straps that adjust to the size of your wrist. Also, this comfortable device itself doesn’t stick out too far so it doesn&#39;t catch on your clothes. Although the Band has a maximum seven-day battery life, we found it didn&#39;t last quite that long. The screen is easy to read in the sun, but fingerprints are distracting and the screen smudges easily.","When you complete daily activity and exercise, the Band lights up to indicate you&#39;ve reached your goals. There are seven light &#34;bands&#34; on the Band&#39;s screen and all seven are lit when you meet your daily exercise. These bands also show you charging progress and more. With the Striiv Band fitness tracker, you can also set custom goals and input personal information, like your step length, for more accurate readings.","This fitness device is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. However, only a few Android devices and operating systems are compatible with the app, so be sure to check Striiv&#39;s website for a complete listing. You also can&#39;t check your progress from a computer as there is no online account system. With the Band, you can play fitness games with your friends and run other apps like My Fitness Pal and Run Keeper for added support. The Touch is similar to the Band in every way, except it has some additional smartphone controls so you can check your email and answer phone calls on the run.","Striiv provides adequate help and support for the Band and the Touch fitness trackers. You can find support tickets and FAQs on the website if you have questions about your device. Although there isn&#39;t an accompanying manual, the app walks you through all aspects of how to set up and use your device."]},"id":"6b330e4e-322a-4a3d-8c96-c2d8e3a870f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b844263f-6abb-4bab-ad99-44517ed4021e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Band is a personal fitness device that tracks your exercise throughout the day.
