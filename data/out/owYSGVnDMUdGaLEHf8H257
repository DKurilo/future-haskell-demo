You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information</em>.","The Pioneer VSX-1024K is an <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receiver</a> with wireless functionality and excellent connectivity. It can power up to seven speakers and two subwoofers, though it lacks HDCP 2.2 capability.","An AV receiver serves two functions in your house: It is a switch and an amplifier. Instead of connecting your gaming system, DVD player, Blu-ray player and online media player directly to your television, you connect all of those inputs to your receiver and then connect the receiver to the television.","This AV receiver does an excellent job as an input switch. It has six HDMI inputs and one optical input. It also has three analog audio inputs so you can easily connect your legacy devices to it. This unit also has Wi-Fi capabilities, so can send audio to it from your smartphone or tablet over your home Wi-Fi network via AirPlay or DLNA.","Unlike some of the best AV receivers, the VSX-1024K lacks integrated Bluetooth functionality. However, you can purchase a Bluetooth adapter separately to add this capability, which is the most convenient way to wirelessly stream music with the receiver.","This home theater receiver is able to pass through 4K video signals. This is crucial for its switch functionality, as it allows you to run even a 4K video input source through it and into a television without downscaling the resolution to 1080p.","It also supports HDMI 2.0, which allows you to play future 4K content that has frame rates above 24 fps. Right now, almost all 4K content has frame rates of 24 fps, but in the next few years, frame rates will rise, and the VSX-1024K&#39;s HDMI 2.0 capability ensures you&#39;ll be able to play that future content.","However, this receiver doesn&#39;t offer HDCP 2.2 capabilities. HDCP 2.2 is the new encryption standard that will soon be used for 4K Blu-rays. This means that if you purchase a 4K television, you can&#39;t send HDCP 2.2-protected media to it through this receiver. Obviously, that restriction is not ideal, but you can still send a good deal of 4K media through the receiver, and all 1080p media is able to pass through."]},"id":"86da5b07-137f-4546-94d0-59c6e9cdcc9f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cd6b8b6e-d96e-43c4-9096-2be40573ef7f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pioneer VSX-1024-K is an excellent receiver overall, but its functionality is hampered by a lack of HDCP 2.2 support.
