You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LG G Flex is a new animal. It&#39;s not the first <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> to offer a rounded screen, but it&#39;s the first one you can buy here in the U.S., and it brings a lot to the table. Its swooping curves and semi-flexible chassis turn heads, while its impressive processor and battery help it beat most contenders in a specs war. It may be clunky to hold, and its display is pretty terrible, but the Flex remains a fun window into the future.","If you buy the Flex, it won&#39;t be because its battery lasts for days or its processor will power through your favorite games – although it does, and it will. Those are nice features, but you can enjoy them on much cheaper phones. The Flex stands apart from other top smartphones for its design: a chassis with a banana-like curve from top to bottom. This curve is possible thanks to the phone&#39;s flexible plastic OLED screen. On its own, the screen is as bendable as a playing card; built into the LG G Flex, it&#39;s attached to a semi-rigid chassis that you can, with some effort, flatten out without hurting the device. There&#39;s no particular reason to do this other than to impress your friends, but it&#39;s a nifty party trick.","Unfortunately, the Flex&#39;s display is utterly disappointing. Curved though it may be, its pixels don&#39;t produce color evenly and are prone to ghosting. If an app or screen shows black, you&#39;ll see echoes of whatever was on the screen beforehand, much like old plasma TVs. The uneven lighting and color, meanwhile, gives the effect of a constant, persistent noise across the screen, as though there&#39;s a grainy layer of digital grime between the phone&#39;s surface and the display itself. These negative effects are only heightened on the Flex&#39;s comparatively low 720p resolution. On a smaller phone, 720p is a perfectly respectable – if not necessarily impressive – spec. Spread out over the Flex&#39;s massive 6-inch phablet display, however, 720p resolution nets you a pixel density of only 245ppi. That is, by far, the lowest-density smartphone screen we reviewed and will seem surprisingly pixelated if you&#39;re used to modern displays.","Granted, if you can get past the underwhelming screen and the phone&#39;s overall bulk, it packs plenty to keep you busy. The Flex&#39;s 3500mAh battery is the best we&#39;ve reviewed, offering up over 24 hours of continuous talk time or 20 hours of video. Plug in your phone every night and you&#39;ll never have to think about your battery again. If you forget one night, it&#39;s not a problem; the device will power through the following day, and might even make it to a third. In our testing, not once did we have to worry ourselves over whether we had enough juice to pull through a day.","Alongside the battery is a powerful 2.26GHz quad-core processor that will sail through the most intense games you can download from the Google Play store. Likewise, the phone&#39;s 2GB of RAM can handle multitasking with ease – a helpful addition, as the Flex offers split-screen multitasking and drag-and-drop from one application to another."]},"id":"2f56ba86-3d47-40a3-9467-8bf6e53ffd9d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5216131d-d40f-4c6b-839f-99b8885daead","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Is the LG G Flex worth it? If you love big screens and don&#39;t care about the quality of its display, its value skyrockets. Other manufacturers will be hard-pressed to match the Flex&#39;s battery capacity in even their best smartphones, and there&#39;s more than enough power under its hood to take on whatever apps you want to download. Plus, the phone&#39;s bendability is pure fun.","If, on the other hand, you care about your visuals, the LG G Flex is a huge disappointment. Curved and bendable though it may be, LG&#39;s new screen technology isn&#39;t ready to contend with the high-resolution IPS and AMOLED screens boasted by competing smartphones. It&#39;s grainy, pixelated and prone to ghosting. Future curved-screen phones will remedy these issues, but in the meantime, the Flex is best suited to those who want to impress friends or multitask on a giant phablet."]},"id":"6359d51d-bd63-447b-9a5b-dd8485a39249","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58794","url":"/lg-g-flex-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-06T19:25:03Z","datePublished":"2014-02-06T19:25:03Z","name":"LG G Flex","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":51,"verdict":"Having a big curved screen in your pocket might not be the most comfortable thing in the world, but if you&#039;re itching to be on the cutting edge, the LG G Flex will get you there.","pros":["LG&#039;s latest phone has an incredible battery and great processing power, but its coolest feature is unquestionably its physical curve."],"cons":["Without optical image stabilization, its camera isn&#039;t as impressive as we&#039;ve come to expect from flagship phones, while its unappealing POLED screen leaves us in a funk."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-02-06T19:25:03Z","id":"y7gfTXvLjTpA4LM6z9qi7d","meta":{"title":"LG G Flex Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"With a brand-new form factor unlike anything else in the world, is the LG G Flex a contender among the very best smartphones?
