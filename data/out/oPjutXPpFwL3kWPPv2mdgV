You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","Clean, colorful and patriotic are just a few words we used to describe our initial feeling when reviewing Contacts America. When comparing it to our other list of online <a href=\"/home/beauty/best-contact-lens/\">contact lens</a> retailers, it ranked near the middle. For the most part, everything about the site, including product selection, ease of use and customer service, ranked as average. They do, however, do an excellent job of securing their site.","Contacts America is loaded with a variety of contact lens types, such as daily, weekly and monthly disposable along with bifocal, color, gas permeable, novelty, silicone and several other store brands. They carry a selection of the more popular contact lenses like Acuvue, Biomedics, Focus, Frequency, FreshLook, Softlens and a handful of others. The side menu under most popular brands is deceiving. While most sites list the brand names, this site begins by listing five from the same brand and only lists about four other brands. This may cause the consumer to question whether or not they carry a larger assortment of name brands.","The use of design, color and picture of the smiling customer gives the site a warm, homey feeling that will give the consumers a feeling of comfort and trust. The site is effortlessly designed to give the consumer several ways to search for their specific contact lens. There is a side menu bar that lists the contact lenses by type, popularity and manufacturer. The top menu lists the contacts by a sample of popular brands and types. You can also search by name in the dropdown menu located near the top. If you’d rather search the site, there is that option as well. Finally, they also provide a more thorough list of top name brand contact lenses at the bottom of the site, giving the consumer yet another way to search for their contact lenses.","Another handy feature is a chart on the homepage that gives a comparison of the cost of contact lenses through Contacts America and two other companies. This helps give the consumers a quick view to compare prices and make sure they are getting the lowest price available without having to take a bunch of time searching other sites.","Getting help and questions answered is very easy on Contacts America. There is a contact button located near the bottom of the site and a Help button at the top. Both of these buttons take you to a FAQ page that is conveniently put together in sections by category, such as company information, order information, shipping and handling, company policies, pricing and billing, prescriptions and several more. Each section lists several commonly asked questions to help detail and question or concern a consumer might have. This is also helpful so consumers can quickly and efficiently place an order without having to be put on hold, wait for a reply to an email or call the company directly.
