While it&#39;s not the most energy-efficient model, it only costs around $90 to operate annually. Its short vent hose limits its adaptability to the space you have available, but this indoor air conditioner can effectively keep a 450-square-foot room comfortably cool.","It circulates air at low, medium and high speeds to provide cooling against different levels of heat. Although its airflow of 174 cubic feet per minute were the lowest in our comparison, you should feel a noticeable difference within the first half hour of turning on the unit. It has a cooling power of 10,000 Btu.","The Honeywell MN10CESBB’s dehumidifier continues to remove moisture whether this mode is selected or not. In the cooling mode alone, it removes up to 2.8 pints per hour from the air. It dispels water through the window vent using an automatic evaporation system, so there&#39;s no drip pan or water tank to empty.","Our estimated annual operating cost for this portable AC is $90.79, less than many larger units. Compared to the average energy efficiency among those reviewed, which was EER 9.7, the Honeywell&#39;s score of 9.5 EER is good but slightly below average. On the plus side, this machine has the UL seal, signifying it meets industry standards for health and safety.","The remote control is rather straightforward: a power button, arrow controls, speed buttons, a timer setting and mode change. Like the remote, the control panel&#39;s digital display is minimal but easy to understand. Some downsides to this cooler is the lack of a sleep mode or auto-restart option. This means the AC doesn&#39;t have the ability to adjust the temperature to a comfortable level while you sleep, and because it can&#39;t restart on its own, your room may become uncomfortably warm after a power outage. You can find these missing features on the <a href=\"/frigidaire-gallery-review\">Frigidaire Gallery</a> and other units we assessed to be the best portable AC units.","Since its vent hose is a short 3.9 feet, you&#39;ll need to place this model close to the window so it can release excess air and moisture.","It comes with a generous five-year compressor warranty and a standard one-year appliance warranty. At the time of writing this review, the Honeywell MN10CESBB costs $399, slightly more affordable than the industry average of $427."]},"id":"168bd830-6dc1-4da2-a104-a37f19dff00d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58320","url":"/honeywell-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-04T23:12:22Z","datePublished":"2013-12-04T23:12:22Z","name":"Honeywell MN10CESBB","synopsis":"The three-speed fan, dehumidifier and cooling modes make the Honeywell MN10CESBB a good portable AC unit, especially for a humid climate.
