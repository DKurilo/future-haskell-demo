There’s something so satisfying about holding the camera out and taking a picture of yourself and your surroundings. The Polaroid iS085 is a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof camera</a> that gives you a front-facing LCD monitor in order to help you capture the best moments on your adventures. Unfortunately, it lacks the durability and quality of other underwater cameras, and the ability to take an accurate selfie is hardly reason to buy a camera with a lackluster feature set.","The Polaroid iS085 may be a waterproof camera, but it is only useful in the pool. With a maximum depth of 10 feet for 30 minutes, this camera is not ready for many of the adventures in open waters. On one hand, the camera can take splashes and will capture good images under the water, but on the other hand, you’ll want to avoid diving with the camera or taking too many pictures and video underwater. The camera is not freezeproof, and its lowest operating temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, it cannot handle drops or crushing pressures. Finally, it is also dustproof, so you can take it with you to the desert.","The camera has a 16MP CMOS sensor, which is fairly average for a point-and-shoot camera. Unfortunately, its other image settings are weak. It has a lower range of ISO settings than most other compact cameras. On top of that, you cannot adjust the shutter speed. The camera does not come with an optical zoom, but its digital zoom can expand an image five times.","Also, the camera lacks many additional features. While it can shoot video at 720p, it cannot record audio. It does not have any picture effects or a panoramic mode. You cannot edit pictures within the camera or upload images wirelessly. In fact, about the only additional features it has are face detection and a self-timer.","About the only thing that really stands out with this camera is its front-facing viewfinder. In addition to a standard 2.7-inch rear viewfinder, you can use a 1.8-inch LCD screen to help you line up the perfect selfies and capture all of your best vacation moments. Still, a selfie screen is hardly reason to buy a camera."]},"id":"bbfaeeeb-d213-4aa4-b549-fc3228e6038f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d4a92e1f-dfad-437f-b0a5-5991361b4a3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Polaroid iS085 is a waterproof camera with excellent selfie capabilities, but its overall durability, quality and features leave much to be desired.
