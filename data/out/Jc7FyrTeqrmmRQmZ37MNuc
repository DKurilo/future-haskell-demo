Nothing about the camera feels cheap. It is very easy to grip, and the overall build feels well-balanced and comfortable even during one-handed use. The rugged camera can withstand being submerged in water down to 46 feet and dropped from 5.2 feet. It also functions in temperatures as low as 14 degrees Fahrenheit and has an IP6X dustproof rating. These are fairly standard ratings as far as these types of cameras go, but it’s enough to keep up with most adventures.","This <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">underwater camera</a> has a 2.7-inch display which, although it’s not as large as that of the <a href=\"/fujifilm-finepix-review\">Fujifilm FinePix XP120</a>, is big enough to easily review the photos you took and navigate the camera’s menu options. Multiple drive modes, including burst shooting, auto bracketing, one shot, self-timer and continuous shooting, give you good flexibility.","The WG-50 comes with 24 different scene modes – including Sport, Night Scene, Portrait and Fireworks, among others – which automatically adjust your camera’s parameters in order to take the optimal photo in a particular setting. These are easy to set in a pinch and are helpful for beginner photographers who don’t yet know how to manually balance ISO, aperture and shutter speeds.","This Ricoh device comes with a 16-megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor, which is excellent. The ISO can be adjusted from 125 up to 6400 on auto. You can also manually adjust the shutter speed, which ranges from 1/4000 of a second up to 1/4 of a second, giving you plenty of range for taking action shots as well as those in dimly lit scenarios. And should you need to zoom in, the WG-50 offers 7.2x digital zoom and 5x optical zoom.","The Ricoh WG-50 has 68MB of internal storage, though you can add more whenever you need with a microSD, microSDHC, or microSDXC card. It also comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, and it takes a little over two hours to gain a full charge. However, once it’s charged, Ricoh estimates you can take about 300 shots, or record 260 minutes of video, which is outstanding for this type of camera."]},"id":"a228fa38-66c2-4e65-889e-e1cad594423d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70134","url":"/ricoh-wg-50-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-08T15:34:44Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T15:34:44Z","name":"Ricoh WG-50","synopsis":"When you hold the Ricoh WG-50 in your hands, the first thing you’ll notice is its high-quality, rugged construction.
