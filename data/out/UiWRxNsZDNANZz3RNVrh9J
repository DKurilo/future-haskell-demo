Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The Nook Tablet is not just your average tablet, nor is it your average <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader</a>. Barnes &amp; Noble has put together this unit that will function as both a tablet and eBook reader in one device. This unit will allow you to read books and magazines; however, it will allow you to do much more. For those who are on the go, you now have the option of reading your email on this device. You can also download and play games to pass the time. Additionally, this eBook reader offers exceptional battery life so you will not have to worry about carrying around a charger all of the time.","The Nook Tablet is 8.1 inches tall and 5 inches wide. This is slightly larger than most of the eBook readers in this review; however, it is still small enough that it will fit easily into a purse or bag for carrying. It also weighs in at 14.1 ounces, which is a bit heavier than other eBook readers, but it is still lighter than carrying around a netbook or laptop computer and you can do almost as many things with it.","One of the features we appreciate about the Nook Tablet is the screen type is not the standard E-ink that comes with most eBook readers. The Nook Tablet uses an LCD screen, which allows for more crisp images that are great when you are reading and also playing games or watching videos. However, it can make it a bit more difficult for reading books. The fact that the screen resolution is 1024 x 600, which is better than most eReaders on the market, is also a great feature. The screen is created with IPS lamination, which allows for extreme clarity of images and also allows you to share your screen with other people without having to worry about glare distorting images.","Because this device comes from Barnes &amp; Noble, you will have the opportunity to get the latest books and magazines. With your choice of over 2.5 million books, you will never be left without something to read. Additionally, you can watch HD videos and download several apps such as games and a drawing pad. One feature we like about this device is that it allows you to play several audio formats such as the popular MP4. Barnes &amp; Noble has also beefed up their image format capabilities by allowing you to view GIF, PNG, BMP and JPEG files.","The Nook Tablet is pre-loaded with Netflix and Hulu Plus, which will allow you to stream your favorite television shows and movies. This will offer you great entertainment wherever you find yourself. Additionally, you can download your children&#39;s favorite movies to your Nook Tablet and give them some entertainment when you are in a place that requires them to be quiet. This can be especially helpful if you are out to dinner with your family and the kids are getting a bit rambunctious.","With the Nook Tablet, you can download a host of children&#39;s books your kids will love. Barnes &amp; Noble has added an extra element to make your child&#39;s reading experience even more engaging. This eReader brings stories to life and makes them interactive with AliveTouch. With this feature, the characters of books spring into action and actually move on the pages while kids are reading. For example, in the book &#34;A Charlie Brown Christmas,&#34; with the press of a button, the kids actually skate on the pond while snow softly falls around them.","Another feature of the Nook Tablet that we like is it comes equipped with a built-in microphone. This allows you to record your voice using the Read To Me feature so your familiar voice can read the kids their favorite books even when you aren&#39;t there with them. This is a great feature for those grandparents who are far away but still have the desire to read their grandchildren their favorite stories.","One of the best features that the Nook Tablet offers is ad-free reading. Many other eReaders on the market have ads that appear on search bars, which can get annoying to some people. However, with the Nook Tablet you will not be bothered by pop-ups that interrupt your reading time.","The Nook Tablet comes with a battery life of 11.5 hours if you are reading or nine hours if you are watching videos. This is good considering that it only takes three hours to recharge a dead battery. In addition, this eBook reader offers 16GB of internal storage space. However, if you feel that is not enough, you can increase that by 32GB with an SD card. However, because Barnes &amp; Noble offers you free storage in their cloud, you will probably not have to worry about running out of storage space.","One of the features we really like about the Nook Tablet is that Barnes &amp; Noble offers free support for these devices at any store. It is much easier to go into a local store than it is to send your eBook reader to another destination for help. Additionally, by going into their store, you can learn more about the features your Nook Tablet offers.","The Nook Tablet also offers Wi-Fi, which will allow you to connect to the web to download music, videos or check your email. In the event that you do not have Wi-Fi at your home, you can head into a local Barnes &amp; Noble store where they offer free Wi-Fi for your use. Once you have downloaded your files, you are free to leave and enjoy them on your own time."]},"id":"aca43402-2087-4731-b646-f64b4b80f6bc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"df7f6d44-a173-404f-a6e4-d963d0b02746","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nook Tablet offers some great features such as 16MB of internal memory and 11.5 hours of battery life.
