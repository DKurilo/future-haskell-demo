This time they have tried their hand at creating the <strong>Bosch Universal Kitchen Machin</strong><strong>e</strong> <a href=\"/best-mixers\">stand mixer</a> that does everything from mixing ingredients to juicing citrus fruit.","This kitchen mixer comes with 800 watts of power and a 6-quart bowl capacity. While this powerful motor will make quick work of your bread dough, it&#39;s not great for whipping up a few egg whites for meringue. The 6-quart bowl capacity will allow you to make up to three loaves of bread at one time, so this mixer is great for someone who cooks for larger crowds of people. We found that this device tends to &#34;walk&#34; across the counter when you mix a smaller batch of ingredients, so make sure to keep it away from the edge of your counter.","While we were pleased to find that this stand mixer has a direct drive transmission and all-metal gears – both marks of a quality, durable stand mixer – we were disappointed to find that it only offers four different mixing speeds. However, this stand mixer does come with the auto-shutoff feature. This helps prevent the motor from burning itself out when mixing heavy dough.","We were happy to find that the balloon whisk and the dough hook are made out of long-lasting stainless steel. However, we were surprised to find out that the mixing paddles are made out of plastic. While it is a strong plastic, stainless-steel parts are stronger and typically last longer.","One of the highlights of this dough mixer is that you can purchase several different attachments that will allow you to do a variety of tasks in the kitchen. Some of these attachments include a food processor, slicing and grating blade, citrus juicer, blender and a meat grinder, just to name a few.","If you are searching for a dough mixer that will come in different colors to accent your kitchen décor, you are out of luck with the Bosch. However, the one color option is a white finish that will go with practically anything.","This food mixer is easy to use and is cleverly designed, with the mixing beaters placed on the bottom of the bowl, so that you can look right into it to see how well your ingredients are being mixed. This is a big difference from the stand mixers that have mixing heads that sit down in the bowl. However, we found that cleanup with this food mixer is a bit difficult. There tend to be more cracks for food to slip into, and the food tends to get under the bowl. This creates more work for those who are used to using the traditional overhead design stand mixer."]},"id":"786d0361-4cb7-4470-bb0a-1e8d1ae86b3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8d4f60a2-05a2-403e-aabf-2e87ee83c5ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Because of the powerful motor and large bowl capacity, the <strong>Bosch Universal Kitchen Machine</strong> tends to work best for those who tend to cook for larger gatherings of people.
