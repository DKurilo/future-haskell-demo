offers four payment plans in addition to warranties and solar panel performance monitoring. This <a href=\"/best-solar-companies\">solar contractor</a> can help you save money on your utility bill while decreasing your impact on the environment. With operations in 16 states, it has the third largest coverage in the United States.","In addition to solar panel installations, Vivint Solar does offer backup battery storage. Since this is a relatively new service, it is only offered in select areas. You will need to contact Vivint to see if this service is available to you. This companyâ€™s solar power warranties include a 25-year performance warranty. The inverter is also covered by a 20-year workmanship warranty. When we contacted Vivint the company told us that it will fix or pay for any damage it might cause to your property or belongings. You will need to contact the company to see just how much Vivint Solar installation will cost for your home.","After you have set up a consultation with Vivint Solar, they will set up a time to meet with you. At this meeting Vivint will go over how solar works where you live and explain the benefits of using solar panels. After that comes an on-site survey, where they will look around your home for about an hour to evaluate your home&#39;s solar eligibility. Designs will be drawn that best accommodate your house.","When you have approved the design of the energy system, Vivint will work on getting permit approval from your city and will also send notification to your utility. Next comes installation day. Depending on the size of the system, installation will take about four to eight hours between the installation crew and the electrical crew. You will not be able to immediately use the power. Activation time depends on how long the paperwork takes to get completed; this timeframe will depend on your city leaders and your utility provider. Once all of the paperwork is complete your solar energy will be activated and will be ready to go. Vivint will continue to monitor the system and provide warranty and customer support for up to 20 years.","This company offers four different payment plans: Solar Purchase, Solar Loan, Solar PPA, and Solar Lease. Regardless of which plan you choose, Vivint Solar will maintain and monitor your solar panels. These plans are also transferrable, should you decide to sell your home. Some of these plans also include product and power output warranties. Should the system fail to function or if it functions inefficiently Vivint Solar will take care of it.","The company website explains how solar energy works. The FAQs page is relatively small but does answer some good questions. Should you need to contact a customer representative, they can be reached via email and telephone. The customer representative we contacted answered all of our questions in a quick and pleasant manner.","Companies like Vivint Solar make the switch to solar easier and more affordable. This accredited solar installer provides four payment plans, strong warranties and support options to help you make the switch easier."]},"id":"cfe873cd-8fe5-489d-a110-9a99b32c83fc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69385","url":"/vivint-solar-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-26T13:40:39Z","datePublished":"2017-05-26T13:40:39Z","name":"Vivint Solar","synopsis":"Vivint Solar offers four payment plans in addition to warranties and solar panel performance monitoring.
