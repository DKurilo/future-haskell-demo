You can capture video and photos, and communicate with visitors through a speaker. You can adjust the volume as well as sound through an equalizer.","This video doorbell integrates telephone landlines with video doorbell technology. It comes with three cordless handsets. The video intercom doorbell takes photos of visitors and sends the images to all handsets once the doorbell has been pressed. At that point you can use the 1.8-inch color LCD handset screens to stream just video, or both video and audio simultaneously. If a visitor comes to your house when you’re not there, the video doorbell will still capture a photo of them and send it to the handsets, which can save up to 100 images for you to review. The screens will also let you zoom, if needed.","Because the handsets are cordless, you’ll be able to hear when a visitor rings the doorbell and see who they are no matter what room you’re in. The system works regardless of whether or not you have a landline. It also features an automatic night-vision mode. Additionally, you can adjust video contrast to optimize the feed.","You can adjust talking volume on any handset, and you can listen to your visitor via speakerphone. You can also toggle the microphone on or off. The system has an equalizer, so you can adjust the sound quality according to your needs. The doorbell plays a standard doorbell sound.","The camera&#39;s capture angle can be adjusted up, down, left or right by using the small joystick which is located on the interior of the doorbell housing. This video door phone intercom system has the option to be wireless or run on an adapter. Unlike most other doorbell options, this one is not advertised as being weatherproof, so it may not be ideal for areas with extreme climates.","The VTech IS7121-2 video doorbell lets you see photo and video images of visitors to your home or business. Because the doorbell is integrated with telephone handsets, you can take them with you throughout your property so you won&#39;t miss a visitor. You can adjust various sound aspects and the camera capture angle, ensuring quality sound and video, whether you&#39;re on a phone call or communicating with a guest."]},"id":"23c32caf-baba-4eea-ae8b-ef90644c5275","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64440","url":"/vtech-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-27T20:47:49Z","datePublished":"2015-04-27T20:47:49Z","name":"VTech IS7121-2","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
