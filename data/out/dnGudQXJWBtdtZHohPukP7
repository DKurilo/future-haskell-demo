That’s considerably smaller than the birds most machines can cook, but it might be precisely the right size for your family.","This Masterbuilt turkey fryer has an 8-quart capacity. Its heat capacity is 5,630 Btu (1,650 watts), which is normal for a turkey fryer this size. The fryer should heat up quickly, especially since you need only 2 gallons of oil when you use the maximum amount to cook your turkey. You can also use this machine to boil water or steam foods like big batches of vegetables or seafood. This electric turkey fryer is a good fit for a small family, but if you make bigger batches of food often, you might consider the <a href=\"/masterbuilt-butterball-xl-review\">Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618</a>.","We were disappointed to see that this fryer doesn&#39;t have a vented lid, which would allow steam to escape to keep the machine from overheating. A vented lid also lowers the risk of steam burns when you open the fryer.","However, this Masterbuilt turkey fryer includes plenty of other great safety features. For example, its temperature controls let you set the cooking oil’s temperature, and you can regulate the temperature as your food cooks using the control knob. The lifter and cooking basket work as one unit and help you slowly and safely lower and lift the turkey in and out of the basin. You can also pull the turkey out of the oil and hook the basket onto the inside of the pot to let excess oil drain off before you take the bird out of the pot and put it on a platter.","One of the most important safety features is the auto shut-off, which ensures the appliance doesn’t overheat. If it gets too hot, the machine turns off, and you have to wait until it cools to use it again. This fryer also has a magnetic break-away electrical cord in case you need to quickly cut the power.","This machine doesn’t have a built-in timer, something most indoor electric fryers include. The fryer has two indicator lights: A red one that tells you when the appliance is on and a green one that tells you when the oil is hot enough to begin cooking.","There is also a drain valve, which is incredibly helpful when it’s time to drain and clean the machine. In addition, the fryer comes with a spout to attach to the valve that guides oil into the container you plan to store it in. As such, you don’t have to tip the pot to pour oil out, which can create a slick, hard-to-clean mess if you spill. There’s even an internal storage area for the spout so you don’t lose it. The spout, basket, lid and pot are all dishwasher safe, which also helps make cleanup easy.","Masterbuilt offers a one-year warranty on this turkey fryer, which is typical of the industry."]},"id":"cc1521b4-a1b9-4012-82d0-c97fe9b786c6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60080","url":"/masterbuilt-butterball-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-29T17:00:37Z","datePublished":"2014-07-29T17:00:37Z","name":"Masterbuilt Butterball MB23010118","synopsis":"The Masterbuilt Butterball Electric Fryer MB23010118 is a good indoor turkey fryer to consider if you plan to fry turkeys under 14 pounds.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"The Masterbuilt Butterball Electric Fryer MB23010118 is a powerful turkey fryer that&#8217;s suitable for small families.
