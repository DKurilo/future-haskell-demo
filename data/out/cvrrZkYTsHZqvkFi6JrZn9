Though the buttons look like they came straight out of a 1995 word processing application, many of them are labeled with icons that are distinctively different from the icons used almost universally by other applications. This can make this word processing software hard to learn and use if you are used to using Word, WordPerfect or Corel Write.","Another major drawback for this software is that it has no online help, tutorials or forums, unlike Microsoft Word and WordPerfect X5. In fact, you will be hard-pressed to find any information on this software at all. The E-Press website has very little information about the software and its support page lists only an email address. This lack of support is another reason why new word processing software users should avoid EasyWord.","One upside is that EasyWord can be used in 30 different languages, so it is great for multilingual environments like offices or schools. Those who are learning a new language may also find this function helpful."]},"id":"3f8cc240-e2ec-43f0-8a0f-db3dad864eaa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Basic Features"},"id":"1f64c940-d8a5-45c6-b51e-59d5859166a2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite EasyWord&#39;s lack of aesthetic appeal, it does offer a wide range of features that will meet the needs of most users.

All of the features aren&#39;t easy to find though, and they certainly aren&#39;t intuitive.
