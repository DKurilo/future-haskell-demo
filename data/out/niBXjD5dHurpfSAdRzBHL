The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-bike-gps\">Bike GPS’s</a> here.</em>","The CatEye Stealth Evo is a bike GPS with basic functionality and an affordable price tag. It lacks any ANT+ compatibility that would allow it to be paired with sensors, but it can perform all the essential GPS-enabled functions that a bike computer should.","Its GPS receiver enables it to display your speed, distance traveled and altitude. It has three sections on the screen that you can customize to display the metric of your choice. In contrast to premium bike computers, which have color touchscreens, the Stealth Evo has a monochromatic screen that uses a button-pushing interface.","Its biggest weakness is its lack of compatibility with ANT+ wireless sensors. This means you can&#39;t connect it to a wireless heart rate sensor or a wireless pedal cadence sensor. Most of the cycle computers we reviewed have ANT+ capability.","This bike computer is waterproof to IPX7 standards, which means it can withstand submersion in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. Its battery life is rated for 10 hours, which is among the lowest battery life ratings that we&#39;ve seen in a bike GPS. If you&#39;re a cyclist who goes on half-day rides, this won&#39;t be an issue for you, but if you enjoy all-day rides, you might want a device with a better battery. Like all bike GPS units, the Stealth Evo&#39;s battery is built in, so you can&#39;t carry replacement batteries.","The main benefit of this cycle computer is that it enables you to track your process as a cyclist. The easiest way to do that is to upload the ride data from the Stealth Evo to an online training program, such as Strava. These programs superimpose your ride over a map, so you can analyze your performance using metrics such as your average speed, distance traveled and altitude gained."]},"id":"08744895-7f46-43eb-b4b6-b48c2fc0d131","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0ff88b46-b66c-4826-9ff3-b92232455693","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Its lack of ANT+ integration means it&#39;s not as versatile as some other cycle computers, but the CatEye Stealth Evo does cover all the essentials.
