Were traditional piano lessons so agonizing for you as a child that you quit but as an adult wish you could play? Allegro Multimedia Inc., under the direction of CEO Chris Salter with Don and Delayna Beattie, has created Piano Wizard Academy. With their product, you start out playing songs with exciting video games and end up playing real sheet music, including some classics by Bach and Beethoven, before you are finished.

They have forums, tutorials, updates, more games, teleseminars/webinars, and a support section on their website, but the most exciting feature is Wizard Tunes. With Wizard Tunes, you can download thousands of songs covering classical, pop, contemporary, children’s and jazz. If you are not sure whether to learn the Beatles or Bach, you can listen to samples before you purchase the downloads. You may either pay a small fee for individual songs or buy a membership. iLife’s GarageBand also offers a similar feature.","Searching for the right keyboard that works with your software or online program can be frustrating and confusing if you are not an expert. Piano Wizard supplies you with a 49-key MIDI with the necessary hardware. Put on the provided colored stickers, and you’re ready to start making music.","When choosing your package, you have options depending on how you plan to use Piano Wizard. If you only want to play games as a supplement to other studies, the Premier package is for you. If you also want the video lessons and books with instructions from the Beatties, purchase the Academy package. You will also have the option to advance from Easy mode to Premier mode where compositions from classical composers, like Bach, Beethoven and Mozart are included.","At first glance, Piano Wizard can appear costly, but so can a year of private piano instruction. The Premier package includes the complete game system with Piano Wizard’s four step program.
