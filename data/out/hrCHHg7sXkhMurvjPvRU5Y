The FLIR E6 doesn&#39;t include extra features such as Wi-Fi connectivity, but it performs the core imaging tasks many users are looking for.","The E6 maintains the build quality of more expensive devices â€“ the splash protections and drop ratings are all the same. The differences are all on the inside. There just aren&#39;t any additional features to speak of. Wi-Fi, note-taking options and video recording are just a few examples of features you&#39;ll be forgoing in favor of a lower price.","Despite being stripped down in the features department, however, the E6 is actually a decent camera. With a resolution of 160 x 120, it effectively splits the difference between the best infrared cameras and the cheapest ones. Its resolution still manages to exceed the RESNET resolution standard, which is important to home energy auditors. For most uses, this resolution will be adequate. Those working with intricate subjects that require more detail may prefer the performance of the FLIR E8.","As is typical of infrared cameras, the E6 offers four hours of shooting on a single charge. Unlike costlier models, however, the E6 comes with neither an additional battery nor an external charger, though you can purchase these separately.","As far as support goes, FLIR offers some of the best coverage available. The detector itself is covered for 10 years, the battery for five, and parts and labor for two years after your purchase.","In addition to warranty support, FLIR offers paid calibration services. Most manufacturers recommend yearly calibration to keep your camera functioning properly. For more information on your camera, you can consult your included manual or FLIR representatives by phone or email."]},"id":"d41c094c-ae3e-48f4-b1f5-7919cf4643ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"87ab888c-2cad-47c4-ab69-bc8030a3e852","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The E6 is an infrared camera that, despite lacking the best features and resolution, might hit the sweet spot for many users.
