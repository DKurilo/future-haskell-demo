You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The Navigon 7100 is one of the few GPS units that won’t look tacky sitting on your dashboard. It has a sleek, glossy black design that will look stylish anywhere. But its value goes far beyond looks. It also has all the important features you expect in a GPS in order to get you from Point A to Point B.","The Navigon 7100 offers some great navigational features, including the useful text-to-speech capability which will help you understand directions better. But one of the greatest features in the Navigon 7100 is the traffic updates. Many GPS units offer traffic updates but charge a subscription fee for the service. The Navigon 7100, on the other hand, does not.","The experts found the Bluetooth capabilities in the Navigon 7100 useful for creating a safer, hands-free environment in the car. While they mentioned that the 3.5 inch display screen was a little smaller than the competition’s, they didn’t have problems seeing directions or menu options.","The Navigon 7100 is one of the best navigational GPS units you can find. If you need directions, make the Navigon 7100 your copilot and you’ll be sure to find your destination."]},"id":"f69247ac-36c3-42ec-9b7d-a8dc9dcec2d5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_23165","url":"/smc-networks-10000140-20519-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-04-18T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-04-18T06:00:00Z","name":"Navigon 7100 10000140","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":58,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-04-18T17:55:29Z","id":"9NZvTAhS87EREDmNUDdAuS","meta":{"title":"SMC Networks 10000140 Review 2017 | Specs","description":"Don&#039;t want to get lost on that long road trip?
