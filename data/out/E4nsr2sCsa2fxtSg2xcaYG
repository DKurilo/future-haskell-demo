Its products look good and come in a variety of styles. You can choose from standing, tabletop, hanging and mounted models that run on either propane or electricity – the company doesn’t make natural gas heaters. However, you need to invest in a cover to protect your <a href=\"/best-patio-heaters\">patio heater</a> from the elements when it’s not in use.","Fire Sense has a wider selection of outdoor heaters than most of the other brands in our review. Its standing patio heaters come in several shapes and sizes, including tapered, square flame and pyramid. There are also a variety of colors to choose from like bronze, black powder, aqua blue and copper – you can even buy a wicker model.","There is also a healthy selection of tabletop, mounted and hanging heaters. The tabletop heaters are the most portable and aren’t limited to use in your backyard. It’s easy to pack them up and take them camping, on picnics or to other outdoor activities.","The company’s mounted outdoor heaters are easy to assemble and install. In addition, their mounting brackets are moveable, so your heater isn’t permanently attached to one spot on your wall or ceiling. You can even buy a special pole for your mounted heater so you can move it wherever you want.","Hanging patio heaters are the easiest type to install – you just hang yours a safe distance off the ground and plug it into a regular power outlet. For example, you can hang one above a patio dining table to keep you warm during a late-summer meal.","Fire Sense sells propane and electric patio heaters. Propane models are great if you want to heat places in your yard that don’t have nearby electrical outlets. You can generally expect to get about 10 hours of warming power from a full 20-pound propane tank. Electric models are good if you plan to place the heater close to your house. Fire Sense doesn’t sell natural gas models, which would be convenient for people with access to this type of fuel in their homes. Of the propane patio heaters we looked at, Fire Sense is most comparable to our value pick from <a href=\"/az-outdoor-review\">AZ Patio Heaters</a>.","These outdoor heaters don’t come with protective covers, so you need to buy one separately to shield yours from rain, wind and snow. Left open to the elements, they can rust quickly.","Fire Sense offers a good selection of outdoor patio heaters. You can choose from a wide variety of styles that use either propane fuel or electricity. Be sure to buy a protective cover if you plan to leave your heater outdoors when it’s not in use."]},"id":"fa9420dd-402f-429d-bb0c-3388fff154ac","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61427","url":"/fire-sense-commercial-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
