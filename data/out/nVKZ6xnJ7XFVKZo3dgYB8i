You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With the MovieNite Plus, D-Link has a stripped-down the feature package compared with their more loaded <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-streaming-players,review-2140.html\">home media servers</a> the company offers. While it&#39;s a solid enough product, with a lot going for it, it still comes up short when compared to top-rated media streaming players that offer more versatility. However, this device performs well without any major glitches or bugs.","MovieNite Plus provides simple media streaming stripped down to the essentials. This digital media streamer is limited to streaming and it won’t allow you to play back your personal media files from your computer. It has an Ethernet port to connect to the network, an HDMI output and analog A/V with an adapter D-Link provides. There is no USB or SD card slot, so play back of personal media files is not an option with this device.","It is easy to set up and use. You simply turn it on, connect to the network and go through a step-by-step process to run the MovieNite Plus on your system. You&#39;ll get instant access to a decent array of apps and channel options, but not as impressive as some of its competitors higher on our list. Once you&#39;re setup, navigating through the apps menu couldn&#39;t be easier. The interface is attractive and easy to scroll through.","You can access Vudu, Netflix, Pandora and YouTube instantly from dedicated buttons on the D-Link remote. This unit also includes apps for Picasa, AccuWeather, Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. Additionally, you have D-Link&#39;s own MovieNite apps and mydlink (about 30 apps in all). There are well over 100 channels including TV Guide, TMZ, CNET and CrunchyRoll, to name a few.","Hulu Plus was allegedly slated to come on board when the MovieNite Plus came on the market in 2012, but there is still no date for when that might happen. It is missing a number of other sought after apps, like Amazon Instant Video, Spotify, Vimeo and HBO Go. It&#39;s also missing several sports apps including MLB.TV. Further, there is not an apps store for customizing your lineup of channels. Since there are some significant omissions, that would be a nice feature.","D-Link takes pride in design and MovieNite Plus is no exception. It is a simple yet attractive device that won&#39;t detract from the look of your entertainment center.","D-Link&#39;s customer support can be difficult to reach. It does provide what is called an &#34;intelligent chat&#34; which is basically a knowledgebase information through a virtual agent, which in many instances may answer your questions, but there is no guarantee.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"8ef9f66f-bd81-4e74-8d6b-843a2e71b2f5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a4fa3f32-a980-4957-a255-61607f9a1060","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In terms of performance, the D-Link MovieNite Plus is a quality home media player.
