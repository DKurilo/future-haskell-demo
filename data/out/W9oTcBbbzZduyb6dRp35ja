You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","In business since 1983, ThermoSpas entered the consumer market in 1995 and has since received a number of awards for its line of <a href=\"/best-swim-spas\">swim spas</a>. In particular, it has been recognized by the Association of Pool &amp; Spa Professionals, the National Spa &amp; Pool Institute and the Better Business Bureau.","Most notably, this company has been awarded the Ease-of-Use Commendation by the National Arthritis Foundation. This recognition results from the simplicity its products provide to those with arthritis and other physical restrictions. ThermoSpas is the only spa manufacturer to have been awarded this commendation, according to information available through the manufacturer.","Of the qualifying features that have factored into its awards, one of the most outstanding is the standard inclusion of an adjustable seat on certain models. This enables comfortable repositioning and customization for any user, easily adjusting the seat for the most effective workout or spa session by targeting specific muscle groups.","<strong>Swim Spa Models</strong><br/>ThermoSpas splits its product line into three different types of swim spas, referred to as the Fitness Series. Incorporating design recommendations from a combination of physical therapists, doctors and focus group feedback, its spas tend to focus more on low-impact exercise and full-body fitness training. In fact, two of the three models this company offers are limited only to resistance-based exercise.","Here’s a summary of each model, some of their primary features and benefits.","<strong>Spa Trainer</strong><br/>The largest of the three models and the only one that allows swimming in place, the Spa Trainer measures 174 inches in length by 88 inches wide and holds up to 1,200 gallons of water. Depending on your preference, it may include 21 to 85 jets that provide a smooth, open-water feel during swimming then convert the tub to a luxury spa for entertaining. Seating accommodates up to 12 adults and includes built-in cushioned pillows.","The Spa Trainer from ThermoSpas also comes with a number of standard features and equipment that add to its functionality and overall value, including three built-in structural bars for strength training and exercise attachment mounts. Easily customized to fit in with any décor, Spa Trainers are available with designer cabinetry as well as removable and reversible wall panels.","<strong>The Olympian</strong><br/>Compressing the size of the Spa Trainer into a more compact model, ThermoSpas Olympian model has been engineered to provide ample room for an endless range of resistance exercise. It has many of the same fitness-based features as the larger model, including built-in attachment mounts that can easily be equipped with exercise bands or a rowing machine. It also comes with acrylic side grab bars for safe, easy entry and exit of the tub.","Unique to this model is the adjustable seat, briefly mentioned in the introduction. Offering up to 360 degrees of customizable positioning, the seat is vertically adjustable and provides an assortment of massage options by rotating the user’s body toward a specific bank of spa jets.","Available with 35 to 75 jets and capable of holding up to 425 gallons of water, the Olympian measures 93 inches in length by 88 inches wide and provides seating for up to six people. It’s also available in a number of different designer cabinets, features movable and reversible wall panels, and includes a top rail that’s designed to offer protection and a decorative accent.","<strong>Aquacisor</strong><br/>The second of two models built for underwater resistance exercise, the Aquacisor from ThermoSpas is also the deepest tub this company offers. It measures the same in terms of width and depth as The Olympian (93” L x 88” W) but adds another 10 inches in depth for a total of 53 inches. This added depth is designed to provide extra legroom.","The Aquacisor has been engineered to allow you to comfortably jog or walk in place by moving against the current produced by the spa jets. It provides low-impact aerobic exercise that burns extra calories through added resistance – a feature that is good for those with limited mobility. This function also allows you to warm up before an actual run or massage tired muscles after the fact.","Capable of accommodating up to six exercise attachments, this model includes three grab bars for upper-body strength training and can be coupled with optional tension bands to further supplement an exercise routine. Plus, similar to both of the other models, the Aquacisor offers the same décor options.","With seating for up to seven people, including two captain-style chairs, the tub itself may be equipped with 38 to 67 jets and holds up to 650 gallons of water.","<strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>ThermoSpas offers high-quality swim spas and exercise tubs directly to the public with a free site inspection to help choose the best model for your needs and available space. Unlike generic swim spas that include a standard set of features, each ThermoSpas tub can be customized specifically, enabling you to purchase only the features and accessories you want. With particular care given to the needs of those with physical limitations, this personalized approach may provide a more tailored solution while saving a good chunk of money upfront."]},"id":"157cd9b2-36c3-4fcc-9dcf-30d19d3ac2c9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64251","url":"/thermospas-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T16:23:47Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T16:23:47Z","name":"ThermoSpas Swim Spa","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"W9oTcBbbzZduyb6dRp35ja","meta":{"title":"ThermoSpa Swim Spas Review","description":"ThermoSpas offers high-quality swim spas with a free site inspection to help choose the best model for your needs and available space."},"products":[{"slug":"thermospas-swim-spa","url":"/product/thermospas-swim-spa","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","name":"ThermoSpas Swim Spa","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","id":"bF5ksUQXjn7g3Q3qGoxwD8","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/yDVniwpZ8gp7ec4mgw4RuM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"e50ca54fc2ee857d2be29ead431d4c89.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/e50ca54fc2ee857d2be29ead431d4c89.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","id":"yDVniwpZ8gp7ec4mgw4RuM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yDVniwpZ8gp7ec4mgw4RuM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"ThermoSpa Swim Spas Review","description":"ThermoSpas offers high-quality swim spas with a free site inspection to help choose the best model for your needs and available space."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/yDVniwpZ8gp7ec4mgw4RuM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"e50ca54fc2ee857d2be29ead431d4c89.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/e50ca54fc2ee857d2be29ead431d4c89.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","id":"yDVniwpZ8gp7ec4mgw4RuM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yDVniwpZ8gp7ec4mgw4RuM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"ThermoSpa Swim Spas Review","description":"ThermoSpas offers high-quality swim spas with a free site inspection to help choose the best model for your needs and available space."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/thermospas-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:18:52Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
