Companies use the cloud to share data, connect with vendors, investors, clients and employees, and to manage finances. In fact, more and more developers are transitioning traditional accounting and <a href=\"/best-billing-and-invoice-software\">check printing software</a> to cloud computing applications that make it easier to pay bills, compute income and complete payroll. Many applications, including QuickBooks and Quicken, connect to your online banking website and share data. This means when you schedule a bill in your accounting program, it automatically sends that information to your bank&#39;s bill pay program, so you don t have to enter it twice. Additionally, if you transfer funds or send a payment from your bank&#39;s website, the information will automatically be recorded in your cloud-based accounting program. While there is still some measure of security having check writing software installed directly on your own computer, there are many advantages to cloud computing."," <strong>Quick Implementation &amp; Utilization</strong><br/>Cloud-based accounting software doesn&#39;t need to be downloaded, installed, uploaded, filed, found or pinned to your desktop before running. All you need is a user name and password and you can access all of your information instantly, eliminating a lot of headache. Most of these applications are streamlined to your financial institution so you don&#39;t have to continually toggle between programs when you want to pay a bill, run payroll, manage accounts or finish other budgeting projects.","One advantage to cloud computing instead of traditional check printing software is the ability to connect to your account from any web-enabled device. This means if an unexpected expense or a last minute bill creeps up you can instantly get the payment out and on time, avoiding high penalty costs and late fees.","<strong>Multiple Users</strong><br/>With cloud-based accounting and check writing software you can easily allow multiple users access. Everyone that needs to can see the books and be on the same page rather than going through the process of generating, printing and sending paper reports that will be outdated the minute they leave your hands. You also don&#39;t have to fumble around with USB drives trying to transfer info from one device to another. Both of these scenarios bring along added security risks as sensitive information is moved from hand to hand, place to place.","With cloud computing, all of your information is password protected and encrypted on one device with the best available security personnel and measures taken to ensure it doesn&#39;t accidentally fall into the wrong hands.","<strong>Maintenance</strong><br/>Whenever you install software onto your computer, you open the door for IT help. Computers crash, data needs to be backed up and eventually the software will need to be patched, updated or replaced. Each one of these costs time and money as you try to keep up with the banking and computing standards. You also know that no matter what you need to accomplish    transferring funds, adding employees to the payroll or calculating vendor payouts    your cloud-based application will be current. Cloud computing automatically updates its applications to include the latest trends and standards of the financial industry. And since it isn&#39;t bogging down your system, cloud-based software runs fast. All information is automatically backed up, so you can be confident that you won&#39;t lose sensitive information.","There are still a few traditional check writing applications available for the few businesses that may need that type of software. However, the majority of accounting software is moving to the convenience of the cloud. It won&#39;t be long before check printing software will become obsolete."]},"id":"63e6b8e4-e057-4f25-920b-ed3da93e2040","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8494","url":"/cloud-computing-and-check-printing-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-30T19:46:57Z","datePublished":"2014-05-30T19:46:57Z","name":"Cloud Computing and Check Printing Software","synopsis":"The cloud is quickly becoming the way to do business.
