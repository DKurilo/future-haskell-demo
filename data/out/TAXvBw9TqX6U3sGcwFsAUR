You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Samsung’s AV products, including its Blu-ray and <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD players</a>, have won multiple awards for their quality, performance and design. They are packed with a lot of features, and many include smart technology. These products fit well in homes that have made or are making the switch to smart entertainment.","While some Samsung DVD and Blu-ray players may be region-free, many are restricted to one or two regions. Therefore, it’s important to check the regions with which any model is compatible. You’ll find both the Blu-ray and DVD region codes on the underside of the player. Many models also allow you to stream TV and movies from popular services such as Netflix, Hulu and YouTube, along with TV catch-up services like BBC iPlayer.","Samsung DVD players connect to your television or home theater system via an HDMI cable. Some models allow you to connect to the internet wirelessly, while others have a wired internet connection via an Ethernet cable. Some high-end Samsung Blu-ray and DVD players also features Samsung’s Smart Hub that uses Samsung AllShare. Using this feature, you can create a wireless home or local network that allows you to connect to compatible devices like PCs, cameras, smartphones and tablets, sharing content easily between devices and viewing it on the television your DVD player is connected to. You can also find some models with a USB port so you can connect USB storage devices or USB-compatible peripherals to retrieve and view files.","Most Samsung DVD and Blu-ray players offer at least 1080p Full HD quality, although some older or more budget-friendly models only offer 720p HD. Some high-end players support 4K or Ultra HD, and some can handle 3D playback. If you’ve got a large library of old or low-resolution DVDs, you should consider a Samsung player with upscaling capabilities to improve the image quality and deliver near-HD resolution. Some models also upscale 720p and 1080p to near Ultra HD.","Native apps are available on a considerable number of Samsung Blu-ray DVD players. These can include catch-up TV services, streaming services, news and social media. Some of the high-end DVD players provide features such as web browsing and screen mirroring along with multi-room linking. You can find DVD players from this brand with standard universal remote controls and others that you operate with an app on your smartphone or tablet."]},"id":"2b700c17-69de-47bc-bedd-590b6aa18a93","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48428","url":"/samsung-dvd-h1080-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-01-06T17:21:16Z","datePublished":"2010-01-06T17:21:16Z","name":"Samsung Standard DVD Players","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-01-06T17:21:16Z","id":"TAXvBw9TqX6U3sGcwFsAUR","meta":{"title":"Samsung DVD Players Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Samsung DVD players fit seamlessly into smart entertainment setups and offer a range of advanced features.
