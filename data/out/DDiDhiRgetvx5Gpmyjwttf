You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.You can also rcheck out our other reviews of the <a href=\"/best-vacuum-food-sealers\">best vacuum food sealers</a>.</em>","Our favorite <a href=\"/best-vacuum-food-sealers\">vacuum food sealer</a> for delicate items, as well as general-purpose preservation, is the highly popular FoodSaver V2244 Vacuum Sealer. This compact machine seals food with FoodSaver’s CrushFree air-tight sealing mechanism, and then shuts off automatically. If you want to prevent any smashing of soft items, you can also press the seal-only button to stop the vacuum prematurely. Once the air is safely out of the bag, this device then uses heat upon a double-wide sealing strip so the bag is tightly closed and its contents will stay fresh.","With this option before freezing, your fresh strawberries, baked-ahead-for-the-holiday cookies and banana bread muffins will be safe from air spoilage, but still looking like their original shape. They also will taste just as fresh as the day you sealed them. Of course, this vacuum food saver can do much more. It can also pull the air out of bags that hold heftier items such as cuts of beef, chicken or lamb, and preserve sturdy non-fresh foods such as dried beans or lentils.","Even if you are a novice at food sealing, you can follow FoodSaver’s easy instructions and get good results. It takes just three steps: add your food to a FoodSaver bag and put the bag’s edges into the vacuum sealing channel, close and lock the lid, and then press a button. The V2244 food vacuum sealer includes two convenient options for preserving food: “seal” or “vacuum/seal.”","The V2244 is equipped with an accessory port and comes with a hose that you can operate as a handheld device to remove the air from all types of FoodSaver containers, which are optional extras you must buy. Although buying these is an additional expense, the BHA-free plastic containers can be reused and will give you more storage options.","For example, if you opt to preserve foods with the V2244 and some of its containers, you now have the opportunity to protect foods in containers that are easy to open and can simply be stored on a shelf or in the refrigerator once you do open them. You can also use the port and hose to marinate food in minutes.","The V2244 food vacuum sealer comes with a starter kit so you have everything you’ll need to seal your food in one package, including pre-cut, heat-seal quart-sized and gallon-sized bags; one heat-seal roll of plastic material so you can cut custom-sized bags to hold whatever you need to preserve; and a user manual. Along with these items, the starter kit also gives you a removable, dishwasher-safe drip tray to catch liquids from food, which helps you keep things clean and sanitary so you can reduce the risk of bacteria in the area where you’re handling food and that helps avoid food-borne illnesses. This food vacuum sealer is covered by a five-year warranty, which is excellent in this industry.","The FoodSaver V2244 Vacuum Sealer is relatively inexpensive, and it helps preserve your food and avoid freezer burn in the process. It’s compact so you don’t need much space to store it, and the unit is easy to use. Overall, the FoodSaver V2244 is a good method for vacuum sealing your food."]},"id":"24f3fbef-4ce4-4847-88fd-43a3209169fc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61766","url":"/foodsaver-v2244-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-22T16:53:17Z","datePublished":"2014-12-22T16:53:17Z","name":"FoodSaver V2244","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer a top pick.","review":{"rating":97,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer a top pick.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-22T16:53:17Z","id":"DDiDhiRgetvx5Gpmyjwttf","meta":{"title":"FoodSaver V2244 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The FoodSaver V2244 Vacuum Sealer works well with delicate foods, but also is a compact and handy device that can preserve hardier items such as meats.
