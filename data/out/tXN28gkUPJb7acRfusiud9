Despite the fact it isn&#39;t equipped out of the box to directly play back your personal media (movies, music and photos), it has considerable strengths. The Roku is a great home media server for streaming Netflix and other internet content.","The Roku&#39;s interface includes a channel grid and a menu bar. This setup allows many channel and app options to be displayed per page, so scrolling through the pages is quick and easy.","The Roku box has some heft that can prevent it from being pulled over the edge of your media center by heavy HDMI cables, and the rounded-corner design looks good (even if it slightly resembles a hockey puck). The glossy finish is a nice touch.","Unfortunately, out of the box, the Roku player doesn&#39;t support direct playback of digital media content stored on your computer, such as home movies, music and photos. However, there is an app that  allows you to access those files through this media player. The download and installation process is  straightforward, and in the end, you have an app that allows you to play back content from your computer.","The remote has a headphone jack, and the Roku comes with a pair of earbuds. Whether you want to listen to music without disturbing others in the room, watch a movie when your kids are in bed or get true stereo surround sound when you&#39;re playing a game, it&#39;s nice to have that headphone port. You can even control the volume of the headphones with the rocker on the side. The remote is designed with gaming in mind, and the Roku 3 also comes with a free Angry Birds game, so you can give the remote a test drive right out of the box.","The Roku also has HDMI, Ethernet and USB ports. The USB ports allow you to access local media files from a jump drive.","Roku customer service can be reached by email, phone or live chat should you have any questions or concerns.","The Roku is a terrific media player that allows you to stream a huge selection of channels and apps. You can also access personal media through this home media server. The user interface is extremely easy to navigate, making this device worth your time."]},"id":"8358e036-a8df-43ed-b14d-e1413166aafc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49783","url":"/roku-hd-xr-player-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-14T19:44:34Z","datePublished":"2010-06-14T19:44:34Z","name":"Roku","synopsis":"The Roku is a capable home media server for watching movies from your Netflix queue.
