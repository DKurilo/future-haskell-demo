It offers all the typical equipment and has <a href=\"/best-security-cameras\">security cameras</a> as add-ons. We found that the cameras are the same models sold by many of its competitors that we&#39;ve ranked. The industry has become standardized in terms of equipment and cost. That consistency is a good thing when it comes to making shopping comparisons. The important thing is that each company has a unique selling factor above others in the surveillance field.","Pinnacle is great because it has six security packages to choose from. The equipment you get depends on whether you go for the lower-scale Essential Package or the Security Guru Package. You can always add equipment based on your needs as well. The only package that comes readymade with CCTV cameras is the Frequent Traveler Package. With this kit, you will receive a pan-and-tilt camera. This home security camera allows you to move the camera&#39;s viewing angle from any mobile device. You can set it to only record if something sets off its motion detector or choose to view live video at any time. The other camera Pinnacle offers is a fixed-point camera that you would typically set in the corner of the room to capture as much area as possible. You can only get this surveillance cam if you order it as an add-on.","As with many of its competitors, Pinnacle is an authorized dealer for Alarm.com. They make great detectors and cameras with home automation and interactive features. We were surprised that Pinnacle doesn&#39;t take advantage of outdoor bullet or dome-style cameras. Alarm.com allows you to access your equipment directly with a smartphone or tablet. You have the power to arm and disarm the system, turn lights on and off, and adjust the thermostat in your home.","In addition to the selection of security camera options, Pinnacle also offers detectors that can protect your home or business from fire, intrusion and environmental threats. Depending on the plan you choose, you will receive glass-break sensors, smoke detectors, door and window sensors, carbon-monoxide detectors and much more. Each device is linked. If a smoke detector goes off, for example, you will be notified, and you can check the status on live video from the security cameras.","Pinnacle Security gives tutorials for its equipment and service with FAQs and a number of online videos. There isn&#39;t a live chat option, but if you have a question that is not addressed in the FAQs, you can call the company or send an email to its prompt support team. The biggest positive for Pinnacle is its lifetime equipment warranty. We wish that feature were standard among the other security companies."]},"id":"118317e7-820d-457c-92cd-dbd5b3f265ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"926a3ac5-f8a5-4a81-9a5e-9d06d7962ebd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pinnacle Security is a standard security company with a selection of standard equipment, though consistency is not exactly a bad thing.
