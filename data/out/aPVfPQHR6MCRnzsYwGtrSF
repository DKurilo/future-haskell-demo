This Nikon waterproof camera is a great mix of both worlds. We performed image quality testing both above and below water. In a controlled environment, each camera captured images of our test scene under the same lighting and positioning. We examined the photos for sharpness, color saturation and accuracy. The Nikon AW130 is one of the best dry-land cameras in our comparison. The images it produced have accurate color representation. It shaded all of the black, white, light and dark gray boxes accurately. The colored checkered boxes displayed vibrantly colored squares. After zooming in, the light purple and green box at the top of the test pattern began to bleed into one another, but this camera produced impressive photos compared to the rest of the pack.

Each camera was placed on a tripod and submerged to take pictures of an underwater scene. The test images were taken using the underwater setting on the AW130. This camera&#39;s underwater photo wasn&#39;t the best in our comparison, but it was close. Only two other cameras took slightly better underwater pictures than this Nikon. This was mostly due to some color deterioration – where colors were not as vibrant as other test images. The picture was also a little darker than the best test images. However, the sharpness of the test scene was outstanding. The floral underwater test scene has groupings of green, red and light-violet leaves. Even when zoomed in, the leaves are distinct and sharp. Although two other cameras slightly outperformed the AW130, the quality of the underwater image is still very high.","Beyond producing exceptional image quality, this camera is also easy to use. It doesn&#39;t bombard you with confusing menus that are difficult to navigate. Changing image parameters such as adjusting the ISO is as simple as pressing the menu button on the back of the camera, scrolling down to ISO sensitivity and pressing the OK button. Changing all other camera parameters are equally as simple. Even though this Nikon underwater camera has so many features, they are easy to use.","The Nikon has adjustable shutter speed that ranges from one second to 1/4000 of a second on continuous shooting mode. This mode allows you to take still pictures of fast-moving objects such as a bird or waterfall. You can also adjust the ISO from between 125-6400 to capture pictures in different lighting scenarios."]},"id":"2c6152ce-0c60-4be4-983f-10bf8cebad23","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"ca9ba2ca-eebe-488b-a762-ca94ce2afa69","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/nrFYLKCrW5dJsRLTy68zWg.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Nikon has an array of features built into the camera.
