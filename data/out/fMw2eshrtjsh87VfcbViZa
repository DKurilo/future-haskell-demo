The wash cycles include steam power, steam dual, steam delicate, normal, quick and dry, rinse only, and a quick cycle. The various steam wash cycles reduce the prewashing and scrubbing you have to do, as they use steam to tackle heavily soiled dishes. The steam delicate feature is gentle enough to clean stemware and other treasured items that you might not normally trust to a dishwasher, while the steam dual option adjusts the steam strength for the different racks so that small or delicate items in the upper rack don&#39;t get as intense a clean. The quick and rinse-only cycles can save you time. You can rinse a big mess and then wait until the washer is full to run a whole load, or, for a small mess, you can just run it through one of the quick cycles and go on with your day.","With each wash cycle, you can add wash options, which include extra dry, rinse, sanitary, extra rinse, spray intensity, half load and eco wash. The extra dry option means you don&#39;t have to use the dishtowel to get that last bit of water off dishes after a cycle. Adding an extra rinse can increase the energy use, but it also adds peace of mind, since you know new water is introduced for a rinse instead of the water that is recirculated during a cycle.","When you are washing the dog&#39;s water bowl or anything that may need a little extra treatment, the sanitary wash option offers a little extra cleaning. Half load and eco wash both make it possible to clean dishes in a lighter, more energy-efficient way. However, some wash options are only available with certain cycles. For instance, you can only pair the quick wash cycle with the delay-start wash option.","This LG dishwasher comes with both an eco-friendly wash and dry option. When you select the wash option, the dishwasher automatically uses less water and energy. However, you can only use this eco-friendly wash option with lightly soiled dishes.","The dishwasher&#39;s Hybrid Drying System uses both the heating element and a fan to dry your dishes, which decreases energy consumption during the dry time of the wash cycle. However, you don&#39;t have the standard heated dry option in case you want to dry the dishes using only the heating element."]},"id":"9aeb6afd-78aa-43d9-82ad-773f45c4af75","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Load Flexibility"},"id":"bb5443b1-25e7-4c3d-bf99-8957eef047b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/y3Uk7DmEXeskztoNVu5cZZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58683-lg-studio3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y3Uk7DmEXeskztoNVu5cZZ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"y3Uk7DmEXeskztoNVu5cZZ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y3Uk7DmEXeskztoNVu5cZZ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"44b068c9-8869-4948-85c9-27815c4cc590","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The dishwasher has several wash cycles and options, as well as several convenience features.

The touch-sensitive controls are dark when not in use and light up when you touch them.
