It is designed for use with a water source that has a hardness of 24 to 60 gpg and 1 to 10 parts per million clear-water iron. The KS15HE has two main components, a resin media tank and a salt reservoir. This two-part layout minimizes the chance of salt blocking brine flow during the regeneration cycle. It&#39;s a bit bulky because it does not place the resin tank inside the salt reservoir.","The unit has a high peak flow rate of 17.5 gpm and a service flow rate of 12.8 gpm. It includes bypass valves and plumbing fittings, but additional connectors may be required to finalize installation.","The water softener&#39;s resin bed removes about 50,000 grains of hardness from your water supply before requiring a regeneration cycle. The unit does not provide any additional water conditioning. The salt reservoir holds 150 pounds, and each pound of salt removes about 5,000 grains of hardness from the resin bed during regeneration. The total regeneration cycle lasts 80 to 120 minutes, depending on the hardness load in the resin media. The manufacturer does not provide water usage figures for the regeneration cycle.","Krystal Pure offers a one-year warranty on all parts, plus a 15-year warranty on the water softener&#39;s resin media. The softener tank, brine storage and value body are covered by a 20-year warranty. If you choose factory installation, the softener media, tank, brine storage and valve body warranties are extended to 25 years.","As a salt water softener, it requires a wastewater drain for the brine used in the regeneration cycle and an electrical connection for a control unit. The control unit allows you to set the time of day and the regeneration start time, which should be a time when the household is not using water. You can also set the hardness level of your water source. The water softener uses the hardness settings and measured water flow to determine when the resin bed has reached capacity and schedule a regeneration cycle at the next start time. It also has controls to adjust salt per cycle and regeneration capacity, plus an option to force an immediate regeneration cycle.","The Krystal Pure KS15HE Water Softener combines a high 12.8 gpm service flow rate and a high-capacity resin bed with a large salt reservoir. This water softener system can handle high water usage in most sizes of homes."]},"id":"cf58d97c-a542-4229-aa29-6fd1930695b0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63252","url":"/krystal-pure-h2o-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:21:37Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:21:37Z","name":"Krystal Pure H2O 50000","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
