They combine most of the high-end audio experience offered by the flagship TSi500 but at a price that is more likely to fit into a budget. The speakers are an outstanding choice for the primary front left-right channels in a surround sound home theater setup, especially for those who like to choose each element of a setup and match components individually to each other. Perhaps more significantly, they offer the fidelity and power handling capability to make them a good choice for serious musical enjoyment as standalone stereo speakers. To see how they compare to other highly rated products in this category, check out our <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">floor standing speakers</a> review site."]},"id":"86ee544f-c81a-4f36-8c7c-8f25cbbeb7a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"ea144510-08bd-4229-b471-9e8bae77a235","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The human ear is a remarkable instrument capable of hearing sounds in a very wide range of frequencies, or pitches. Though individuals vary, people can typically hear very low tones down to 20Hz (hertz) or cycles per second, and up to very high pitches of around 20,000Hz which is often written as 20kHz. Top quality floor standing speakers need to be able to reproduce this entire range seamlessly in order to present a lifelike listening experience.","The TSi400s do an admirable job of accomplishing this feat. Their range is effectively 44Hz – 24kHz. Though our hearing capabilities don’t extend to 24kHz, the speakers ability to go beyond the audible range is important in that it creates an ambiance that is an important feature of live musical performances. Sonic material known as overtones can occupy this higher frequency range. They are not actually heard by the human ear, but rather, are discerned. These overtones add to the overall spectral qualities of any audio experience, enhancing those frequencies we actually can hear.","While generally adequate for most applications, and all but the most demanding audiophile requirements, these speakers fall a bit short on the low end. Extending down to 44Hz captures the vast majority of musical information but drops off the very bottom. As a reference, the low E note on a bass guitar produces 41Hz. Coupling the TSi400s with a good subwoofer will remedy the shortfall."]},"id":"b44ef5ce-5e97-4f3d-a29c-d3c20dba94e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Peformance"},"id":"a60c1184-f90e-4d18-868f-45038c5df328","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The sensitivity of a set of speakers refers to the amount of sound energy that is produced with a given amount of electrical input. It also refers to how quiet they are when they are not being driven. Polk’s TSi400 speakers are rather efficient producing 91dB of sound with 1 watt of input at a distance of 1 meter.","That figure essentially means that you can expect a lot of sound without requiring a very powerful amplifier or receiver. And conversely, you can expect them to be virtually without noise when they are not conducting signal. These floor standing speakers are rated to work with as little as 20W of input but are tough enough to handle up to 200W for exceptional audio clarity."]},"id":"ff3e2f50-1596-495b-8f2c-f9efc05b3023","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Speaker Design"},"id":"6f14aee2-1d7f-4949-bb1a-929e0bb9af50","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A single speaker isn’t capable of accurately reproducing the wide frequency ranges necessary for quality sound reproduction. As a result, floor standing speaker enclosures typically contain two or more individual speakers, or drivers, that can specialize in more narrow ranges. The Polk Audio TSi400 contains four such drivers, including three identical woofer/mid-range drivers and a tweeter for high frequencies.","Using three 5¼ inch drivers allows for rich and precise mid-range sounds. This is critical in that it’s where most musical information resides, and an underpowered mid-range will result in muddy and loose sound reproduction. It also allows for some pretty impressive bass response when the rather small size of the drivers is considered. Though the bass produced by the drivers is extremely accurate, the diminutive diameter is also responsible for their inability to get quite down to the bottom we’d like to hear.","The single one-inch dome tweeter does a remarkable job of creating the highest tones. It’s fast, accurate and exceptionally clear in its performance."]},"id":"4cfd1972-350b-4396-be64-df59c9e634cf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7792df82-a71c-43b5-9d09-2b1a42ccc2be","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Polk Audio TSi 400</strong> audio speakers offer high enough audio fidelity that they can be at home in all but the highest-end audiophile music systems.
