You will have to manage and maintain the sensitive data for all your customers. This includes a variety of ethical and business obligations. You have to prevent that data from being stolen by other people. This can include maintaining current records without losing any data and protecting yourself and your customers from hacks and other computer attacks. Also, it is important to avoid chargebacks by providing a quality product or service and not making mistakes in the billing process.","When a customer purchases something from your merchant account, he or she is authorizing you to use that information for that single purchase. Whether it is for a service or a product, the <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> agreement between you and your customer is a binding contract. If you use that information, such as a credit card number or bank account number, for any other purchases, it is a crime and could be prosecuted. If convicted, you could face steep fines and even serious jail time. Do not use your customerÂ s data for anything other than the agreed purchase.","When managing a merchant account and all the responsibilities that come with the credit card processing capacity, it is also important to protect your customers against other virus and hack attacks that could possibly happen. Do this by maintaining all security software and ensuring all applications are up-to-date. Also, investigate any possible security threat. Disconnect from the internet and check to ensure that all your data is secure.","Another responsibility and savvy business practice is to prevent chargebacks. A chargeback occurs when a purchase made through the merchant account is returned or a refund is made, for whatever reason. Some of the most common reasons include a returned product, a mistake in billing or faulty services offered. When a chargeback occurs, in most cases, you will still have to pay a processing fee. These fees might seem small; however, they can add up and can be very destructive to your business. Chargebacks can be especially devastating if your company offers a quality guarantee on the service or product. Before making any guarantees, consider the possible costs that can accrue with a chargeback.","The responsibilities that come with managing a merchant account are numerous. Perhaps the most important responsibility is to never use the information obtained from these accounts to commit fraud. When you process a credit card, it is important to only charge the agreed-upon amount. Also, it is important to protect all the information you collect from customers against outside attackers and hackers. Keep all your security software and firewalls current. In order to stay in business and make the merchant account profitable, put into place practices that will stop your account from making chargebacks. This is especially true if you are going to offer a guarantee on your product or service. The process may be difficult, but for most online businesses, a merchant account is absolutely necessary."]},"id":"64cecbed-46b3-4520-9726-c414d269261f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5681","url":"/responsibilities-that-come-with-the-credit-card-processing-capacity","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"seth-bracken","url":"/author/seth-bracken","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Seth Bracken","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"GEMXumKVXecmu7NVigQsKZ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-30T20:25:25Z","datePublished":"2011-03-30T20:25:25Z","name":"Responsibilities That Come With the Credit Card Processing Capacity","synopsis":"When managing a merchant account you have all the responsibilities that come with the credit card processing capacity.
