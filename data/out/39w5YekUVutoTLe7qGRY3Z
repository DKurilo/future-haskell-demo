Still, the real story here is Sprint&#39;s bragging rights over its well-designed, improved smartphone. The HTC Evo 3D is newsworthy for its user-friendly interface, which should prove undefeatable by even the most technophobic user. Sprint understands the importance of a thinner, slimmer footprint too, and this phone has it. The sound quality functions well, but there some reports of receptivity issues. Upload and download speeds are sufficient, and the HTC Evo 3D also performs well in its class, both in responsiveness and battery capacity.","The HTC Evo 3D has a substantial feel to it. In terms of battery power, this phone holds its own among competitors, with 10 or more hours of battery life during intensive use. Its pre-installed software is easy to remove, but one downside is its lack of an HDMI port. Some previous EVO users aren&#39;t happy that the kickstand on the previous model has disappeared, but there was no room for it with the addition of the 3D camera.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"a6d1dd7d-0f3d-4714-acb5-e8e5c3fe06a3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c7094abf-7222-42fa-8871-bbb8c34dd3e3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Evaluated on its solid performance and design, the HTC Evo 3D deserves the high reviews it has garnered.
