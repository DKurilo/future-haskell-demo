Installation is plug-and-play, and the drive is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.","We were impressed with some aspects of the JetFlash&#39;s performance, like its exemplary 193MBps sequential read speed. The JetFlash is among the best flash drives when it comes to sequential read performance. However, its 4k and 512K random write performance leaves a lot to be desired. This isn&#39;t a good drive to run an operating system or even a regular application off of. The 4K write speed maxed out at 0.17MBps in our extensive testing. This is simply not fast enough for applications that are installed on the drive.","Purchase of the JetFlash includes a free download of Transcend&#39;s Elite data management software. Elite includes several applications to help you manage and protect data while also increasing your work productivity. One of the apps helps you organize files by type and schedule regular backups of your hard drive. Another app helps you restore lost or damaged files from one of your previous backup points.","The data management software includes the option to create a password-protected folder and to lock your computer when you unplug the memory stick. This security measure prevents unwanted access to private files if you step away from your desk.","On the Transcend website, you can find FAQs and downloads for the Elite software and the product manual. The USB flash drive is covered by a limited lifetime warranty. If you need to contact the company for technical support purposes, you can fill out an online form and a representative will respond to your inquiry."]},"id":"947b2844-b1f4-48f1-9391-a43fec53d107","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b6020ebd-7d79-43f5-8baa-f1f1584cccb3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Transcend JetFlash 780 is a quick thumb drive with some nice security features.
