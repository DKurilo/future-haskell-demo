It is aimed at the consumer who wants a simple way to get videos and pictures off a camera and on to a disc that will play well and look good.  It offers video theme templates that add polish to any video and slideshow.  The authoring tools feature professional-looking menu templates that are easy to personalize.  DVD MovieFactory 6 makes it easy to turn video and pictures into standard-definition DVDs.","Burning DVDs is the just the beginning of capabilities you get with MovieFactory6. It’s not the fanciest interface we’ve seen, but its user-friendliness is reminiscent of Corel’s DVD Copy 6. And, after all, Corel is the parent company of Ulead.","You can create and edit your own video or photo movie disc creations or burn unencrypted DVD movies. You can also add soundtracks to your creations using the many audio functions, more on that later. All your digital media will come out looking sleek and professional after you take it through the MovieFactory paces. Titles, menus and HD are all features here.","Burning features include the ability to burn data, pictures or documents to CD, or single- and double-layer DVD and Blu-ray Disc. This program also lets you add data files to audio CDs, create password-protected data discs and boasts a full-featured disc-copy function for all formats: CD, DVD and Blu-ray Disc. ISO, DVD (VOB) files can be copied to and from the hard drive to your choice of output.","Ulead Movie Factory 6 has a clean and easy to read interface – large, blue text on a white background. The main menu of available formats appears on the left-hand side. As you choose a format (Video/Slideshow Disc, Audio Disc, Data Disc, Import/Capture, Edit/Append Disc, Copy Disc, Disc Tools) the task menu on the right changes to reveal the possibilities within each category. As you hover over a potential task, a permanent info bar across the bottom explains each section in detail. For example, when you choose “Copy Disc,” your menu options become “Copy Disc,” “Burn From Disc Image,” and “Burn DVD Folders to Disc.”","Utility functions are located at the bottom of the interface, below the info bar, with the options to view preferences, get disc information, get drive information, or design and print your personalized disc labels.","We loved this interface: easy to use, easy to read, easy to understand.","The music functions are also a big part of this software. MovieFactory 6 will help you create high quality audio DVDs. Music DVD-Video capabilities create excellent audio DVDs using MPEG, LPCM or AC-3 formats. Convert audio CDs to MP3 files, or make your own CD compilations to burn to disc using drag-and-drop technology. You can also make MP3 discs. A “Click and Hiss Removal” element helps you purify recordings from tape or vinyl.","The download version of MovieFactory 6 arrives in the email with six files, which is at first a little confusing. But only the first file is the exe file – it needs all the other files to be present but you only have to run the exe. The install wizard will guide you the rest of the way."]},"id":"cb5c946e-d1b0-43e7-8da9-d90ca41e394a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"11b5d860-eb7d-4f7b-bd8d-987df019dfa7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ulead MovieFactory 6 is a well-organized program offering authoring and burning capabilities.
