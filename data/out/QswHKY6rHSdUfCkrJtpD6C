You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","At first glance, the Troy-Bilt Curved Shaft Gas String Trimmer is an able contestant in the weed whacker market. It comes with a 31 cubic centimeter engine, weighs only 13 pounds and can accept attachments such as brush cutters and pole saws. However, the product has earned a bad reputation for breaking down easily and being almost impossible to repair. Although the Troy-Bilt trimmer is priced among the least expensive <a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">weed whackers</a> we reviewed, we can’t recommend buying it.","Despite the high number of dissatisfied owners we found, we also found yard work warriors who say the machine is powerful for its weight and a good investment for people with small to mid-sized properties.","The Troy-Bilt trimmer has a full set of features for its low price. It comes with dual line exit at the head, trigger control, bump feed and an adjustable handle. It was one of only two weed whackers we reviewed that have customization ability. The Troy-Bilt trimmer also has a rotating head that helps you get into tight spaces. That feature, too, we found in only one other product, and it could prove to be the deciding factor in your weed whacker purchase if you have a small city lot or weeds to clear underneath fences.","Like its feature set, the design of the Troy-Bilt trimmer is great, judging on first impressions. The tool features a 31cc, two-cycle engine – the second largest on our lineup. It weighs only 13 pounds and has a harness and curved shaft to help balance that weight.","When you get your Troy-Bilt trimmer running, you can use its hefty 31cc engine for all kinds of yard tasks by switching out the line spool for an attachment. Attachments for this weed whacker can edge around sidewalks, cut brush, trim hedges, cultivate your garden, trim tree branches and help you blow away the mess when you’re done.","Unfortunately, you must mix gas and oil in the fuel tank to keep the Troy-Bilt trimmer&#39;s engine lubricated. This can be a hassle because you can only use this fuel mixture in the trimmer. However, its other usability problems give this weed whacker model a poor reputation. Often, it only runs once before the engine seizes. This can also happen if weeds become caught between the brush blade and debris shield. If you purchase this model, we strongly recommend reading and following the instructions very carefully.","Troy-Bilt provides an online user manual for just that purpose. However, the company outsources its customer service calls and has a reputation for being non-responsive whether you call, email or take your weed whacker to a service center."]},"id":"1e88c780-5ca7-454c-a648-8fa9cb7bae03","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0a540e8c-1ebe-4fa5-ad8f-f6b41b09e3ca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Troy-Bilt trimmer has many of the features we look for in a quality trimmer. You can use it like other weed whackers with which you’re already familiar by tapping the head to get more spool, pulling the spring-assisted cord to ignite the engine and holding down a trigger to open the throttle. Regrettably, these features won’t help you if you can’t get the machine to run.
