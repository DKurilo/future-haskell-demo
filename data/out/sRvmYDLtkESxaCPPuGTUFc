It does an excellent job at not only measuring temperature, but also of keeping track of the time when you’re grilling. This <a href=\"/best-digital-grill-thermometers\">digital grilling thermometer</a> has a display similar to that of a smart watch. It has large numbers that you can read from a distance, during the day that is. The display isn’t illuminated, making it hard or impossible to read at night without a light source.","Many digital grill thermometers displays are designed to sit on a stand, but Polder made its display flexible – it can bend 180 degrees. If you don’t want to mount the unit to your grill with its two strong magnets on the back, you can bend the screen to its original 90-degree viewing angle and set it on a nearby surface.","Polder says its thermometer is accurate within 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which we found to be true. When grilling four steaks, we had no trouble setting timers and maximum temperatures in order to grill a rare, medium-rare, medium and medium-well steak to the correct degree of doneness.","Some BBQ thermometers have built-in presets of the ideal temperatures for grilling certain meats. With this thermometer, though, there are none, so you’ll have to do your research beforehand to get the perfect doneness.","The cord for this thermometer measures 43 inches long, which is above average, and the probe is 3.75 inches long. Unfortunately, this thermometer only supports a single probe, so if you&#39;re cooking for a large group, you’ll have to keep reading the temperature for each piece of meat individually.","This thermometer doesn&#39;t have an auto-shutoff feature, so you&#39;ll have to be sure either to power it off once you&#39;re done using it or have plenty of fresh batteries on hand. An additional disadvantage is that the thermometer is not water resistant. Very few thermometers are entirely waterproof, but most are splash proof and can handle the rain.","Polder offers a one-year warranty, which is standard in the industry, and provides email and phone support if you run into difficulties. There is a FAQs page on the Polder website as well as a downloadable user manual."]},"id":"470016fa-c9a5-48ba-8f0c-54481eb85898","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60143","url":"/polder-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-05T16:31:00Z","datePublished":"2014-08-05T16:31:00Z","name":"Polder Classic","synopsis":"Polder’s Classic Digital Thermometer and Timer is an easy-to-use BBQ thermometer that anyone can operate.","review":{"rating":67,"verdict":"This digital grill thermometer is accurate and easy to use, but it doesn&#039;t have any built-in presets to help you monitor temperature.","pros":["The cord for the included probe is 43 inches long, which is longer than most.
