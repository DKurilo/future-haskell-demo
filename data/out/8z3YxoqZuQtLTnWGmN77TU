You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Shoprider Dasher 9 <a href=\"/best-power-scooters\">power scooter</a> has a 300-pound weight limit, which is standard for scooters of its size. Most people can ride this scooter and also carry items with them, making it a good transportation option for groceries and other small items. While this scooter maxes out at 3.8 mph, it has a long-lasting battery that takes you 11.2 miles on a single charge. This scooter may go slower than most in our review, but it is well-balanced and safe.","To charge this mobility scooter, you simply plug the battery into a wall outlet. You do not have to remove the battery from the scooter to do so. The manufacturer projects that the battery takes anywhere from a couple hours to an entire night to regain a full charge.","This three-wheel scooter maneuvers with ease. With a 31.5-inch turning radius, you can steer between obstacles and around tight corners, which is very useful when using the scooter indoors. Its low ground clearance also makes it best for indoor use. Since it sits only 1.5 inches off the ground, you should drive this scooter on flat surfaces to avoid damage.","While its low ground clearance prohibits you from driving on rough terrain, this scooter has features that make it a good option for outdoor use. Most ADA compliant ramps are built with 5- or 10-degree inclines, and this scooter easily climbs 12-degree inclines. You can use this scooter to climb steep hills or ramps. The medical scooter has three solid wheels that are flat-free and require little maintenance. The scooter’s heavy weight and the solid tires mean the scooter may harm indoor flooring that scratches easily.","If you need a portable scooter you can easily transport, this scooter is not the best option. When completely assembled, the unit weighs 110 pounds. This weight makes it difficult for users with disabilities to assemble and transport the scooter. Even the individual components are heavy. Its heaviest component weighs 35 pounds, and the battery also weighs 35 pounds.  You cannot fold the unit to make it more compact.","This medical scooter has a deep seat cushion that is comfortable and provides proper support for long drives. You can adjust the armrests and tiller for the most comfortable fit, as well. It has a standard handle that requires upper arm strength to steer, but overall, this scooter’s design provides the support you need for daily use. You can purchase additional parts online from Shoprider.","The company offers a competitive warranty on this unit. The frame is covered by a lifetime warranty. The drive train and electronic components feature one-year warranties, and the battery has a six-month warranty."]},"id":"3387b3c7-f22e-481c-abf1-d8ed900afb3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7f68b50c-2df2-4114-ad65-407438b0ec8f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its superior turning capabilities and ability to climb steep inclines, the Shoprider Dasher 9 can be used indoors and outdoors.
