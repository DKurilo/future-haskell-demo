The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\"><em>Espresso Machines</em></a><em> here.</em>","The DeLonghi EC5 espresso machine will make a robust and flavorful cup of espresso, cappuccino or latte. This member of the DeLonghi Steam series will also dispense either one or two cups of your favorite beverage at the same time without requiring you to add any special equipment or tools. With this espresso machine, it&#39;s easy to enjoy a morning latte before you head off to work.","This espresso maker is steam driven and will produce up to 4 ounces, or shots, of espresso at one time. Because two different nozzles will deliver your espresso, you can use two mugs side by side to create two steaming cups of cappuccino simultaneously. However, if you are hoping to have one larger cup, the two nozzles are close enough together that you will be able to catch all the espresso in one mug and have it all to yourself.","This espresso maker is equipped with 800 watts of power. With this many watts, it will take only a few minutes to heat up the water to the point of making cappuccino. While there are other brands that have a higher wattage, in practical terms there is only a difference of a couple of minutes in wait time for the machine to heat up.","The frothing wand that comes with this DeLonghi unit works well, but it is a little shorter than the standard wand that comes with most of the cappuccino makers we reviewed. The shorter length means it may take a little practice before you&#39;re used to it and frothing up milk like pro.","One of the features that we really like about the EC5 espresso maker is that it offers a cool-to-touch handle on the carafe. This will allow you to carry the carafe to other parts of your kitchen to fill empty mugs with hot cappuccino. This handle is also helpful when removing the carafe from the cappuccino maker. This carafe is also dishwasher safe, which will help you to keep your kitchen neat and tidy.","This cappuccino maker has an illuminated on/off switch, allowing you and others in your home to easily see if the machine is on and warming up or not. You can even teach young children to use extra caution around the cappuccino maker when they see the light is on.","DeLonghi wants to make sure you are a satisfied customer. Because of this, it offers several ways to get in touch with its customer service department. You can access telephone customer service during standard business hours. You also have the option of emailing the company or using the physical address to send correspondence. The DeLonghi website also offers FAQs, product registration, user manuals and care guides for its products. You can also connect with service personal and other EC5 espresso machine users through the DeLonghi Facebook page."]},"id":"94e9d7c2-65b6-406a-9612-a9af549723b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"02a6d1d5-c83e-40d2-b2ee-3670e5ec69b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The DeLonghi EC5 espresso machine will brew you a great tasting cup of cappuccino or latte any time of the day or night.
