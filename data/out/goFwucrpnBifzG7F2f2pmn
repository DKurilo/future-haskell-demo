Very often, either people are consulting their phones to compare products while in the store, or they are choosing to come to your online store via their smartphone or tablet when they&#39;ve already made the decision to buy. For those reasons, you need a website that not only caters to smaller size of the screen, which many <a href=\"/money/small-business\">shopping cart software</a> packages will do, but you also need to adjust your content and approach to suit the needs of the mobile consumer. Fortunately, it&#39;s not hard. Just keep these principles in mind.","<strong>KISS   Keep it Simple, Supportive:</strong> When on the go, people are looking for fast information that is easy to read.

Put the most important aspects on your home page. People are going there to shop or get products, so save the company mission for your About page and put in large icons that link to your major product categories instead. On your individual pages, limit the number of products or categories per page.","Make fonts large enough to read easily and use different fonts for portrait and landscape modes. Often people move to landscape mode in order to better read the information.","Don&#39;t make your customer type in a lot of information. We all know how frustrating typos can be; and one mistake too many, even when it s not your site&#39;s fault, could cause a customer to quit your site before completing their purchase. Offer menu choices for features instead of text questions, and ask for the minimal amount of information. Also, eliminate unneeded forms, surveys and anything needing extensive typing. Save those for your online store, or e-mail them to the customer after the sale.","Make it easy to navigate with breadcrumb links at the top of the page.

Keep your buttons large and well-spaced. Do not have menus that hover, and limit dropdown menus and the number of tabs on the site.","<strong>Speed It Up: </strong>Anything you can do to speed up your store is going to win you points with your customers, especially when they re shopping on a mobile device. Choose smaller images with lower resolution. If you want high-resolution images, make them an option for the customer to click and download after seeing a smaller thumbnail. Keep descriptions short and catchy. Use bullet lists, but don&#39;t forget the screen size.","<strong>Search Smart: </strong>Make your store easy to search by putting important keywords first in the product titles. Also, think in terms of your customer. A good thing to do is think of 10 questions a potential customer might ask while away from home, and then answer them on your website.
