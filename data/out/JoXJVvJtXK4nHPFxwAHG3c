Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.

You can extend the length of the pole to help you find a comfortable fit. Moreover, it has three positions in which you can tilt the head of this <a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">electric string trimmer</a> so you can be sure to get the best cutting job.","At one of the higher speeds, the Worx electric grass trimmer spins at 8,800 rotations per minute (RPMs). This, combined with the 4.5 amperes (amps) of power, makes it a great lawn tool for light grass and weed trimming. This electric string trimmer doesn&#39;t come with a safety switch because the manufacturer says you can simply unplug the machine to avoid it starting before you&#39;re ready.","At 7 pounds, this trimmer is heavier than many of the other electric string trimmers we reviewed. It has a 12-inch cutting swath and two trimming lines. The line feeds automatically. This electric weed trimmer uses standard 0.065-inch string.","The pole on this electric weed whacker is straight and can extend up to 45 inches. As you&#39;re working on various trimming jobs, you can adjust the tilt of the head in three different directions to help you get tasks done easily and efficiently. The Worx trimmer also has two handles to help you keep control of where your machine is going.","To protect your flowers, preserve string and assist you in getting a precise cut, you can use the edge guard, which helps you keep track of where the line ends. Another nice yet standard feature on this trimmer is the cord-retention clip that keeps your extension cord plugged into the trimmer. In addition to these other features, the Worx electric grass trimmer comes with a spool of string that is already installed.","You&#39;ll need a screwdriver to assemble the Worx electric trimmer. Assembly is easy and only takes a few minutes. Once you&#39;ve been using your electric string trimmer and you&#39;ve used all the string on the spool, you can replace the spool without using any tools. The cover that sits over the spool simply lifts off when you press the tabs on the sides.","If you need tech support, you can email, chat online or call Worx. Although our hold time was a little long, Worx played popular classical music while we were waiting, and the company provided quality customer support. This electric weed eater comes with a two-year warranty that covers defective parts."]},"id":"230d54ca-7036-44be-a673-ad056a3d3785","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"faa00dce-dd6d-42f6-b9ef-7fbcbccfe40b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This electric weed trimmer has an extendable shaft and the option to adjust the angle of the head on the trimmer.
