We narrowed down the features that mattered most and created charts to document the features of each vacuum — and this was all before we even started to test. We then bought vacuum cleaners that cost around $100 or less and offer a strong feature set. We were looking for well-regarded models that can fit into any budget. The average price of the most popular vacuum cleaners on Amazon, Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s is about $70. The models we tested averaged $78.","Most industry pros we interviewed about vacuum cleaners during our research are very opposed to cheaper models. Keith Quimby is a Utah-based vacuum dealer and repairman with more than 30 years of experience. He strongly recommends investing more money to get better quality.","&#34;Unfortunately, our customer base thinks cheaper is better,&#34; Quimby said.","He said with vacuum cleaners you get what you pay for, generally speaking. That has also proven to be true in our testing. Even within our budget category – anything under $150 – we found that investing just $50 more resulted in a machine with better suction. And, not surprisingly, once you get out of the budget range – over $150 – you get more suction and better features in general. If you really want to stay in the budget range, though, we found some decent options as we researched and tested.","No matter what price range you choose, certain tips apply for getting the cleanest floors possible. The <a href=\"https://www.carpet-rug.org/vacuuming-home.html\">Carpet and Rug Institute</a> recommends vacuuming daily in high traffic areas and pet areas, twice weekly in medium traffic areas and weekly everywhere else. Other tips include going over carpets slowly and using a top-down method – dust everything up high first, including blinds, then vacuum furniture and then the floors in order to capture the dust from all previous cleaning tasks.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Once we had a strong set of contenders, we tested them on low- and medium-pile carpet on a range of messes. We used flour to simulate fine dust and kitty litter to simulate large debris. We also used dog hair, grinding it into the test carpets. The vacuum cleaners that could clear away the dirt in the fewest passes scored better. We focused on different types of carpeting, but we did not include hard flooring in our tests. Some of the budget vacuum cleaners are adjustable to work on those surfaces, but others are not, and we wanted to keep an even playing field.<strong><br/></strong>","We also took each vacuum cleaner through an obstacle course to gauge how easy each is to maneuver around table legs, under furniture and around corners. We performed basic maintenance with each vacuum cleaner, too, emptying bags and replacing them to score for user-friendliness. We made note of the hoses and attachments that come with each unit, and we measured the sound each one produced."]},"id":"bc080a35-6007-474f-b69a-d1ad7e4e625c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/wSehV5dy2qXtphyX5eFD6e.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/home-cheap-vacuum/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9VL08vNzkyOTYwL29yaWdpbmFsL0NoZWFwLVZhY3V1bXMtQmxhY2stRGVja2VyLUFpci1Td2l2ZWwtVGVzdGluZy0wMDIuanBlZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wSehV5dy2qXtphyX5eFD6e.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"wSehV5dy2qXtphyX5eFD6e","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wSehV5dy2qXtphyX5eFD6e.jpg","alt":""},"id":"03e75bfd-9f7f-428e-9f2d-b5f5410aa552","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What to Look for When Buying a Cheap Vacuum Cleaner</strong>","Vacuuming Performance<br/>Suction is important, and while you can’t test vacuums in the store, you can look at our test results to see how some of the best inexpensive vacuums perform. We tested the best budget vacuum cleaners on different types of debris and scored them according to how fast they picked up the mess – the fewer passes it took to clean, the better the score.","Convenience &amp; Design<br/>Vacuum cleaners at every price range should be easy to transport and maintain. The process of emptying and cleaning should be quick and the overall weight low. Also, check our test results to see how much noise each vacuum generates.","Design Extras<br/>Look for vacuum cleaners that allow you to clean more than just flooring. The ones that come with a long hose and lots of brushes and other tools allow you to clean furniture and draperies, in addition to flooring.","<strong>Are Bagged Vacuums Better Than Bagless?</strong>","If you have allergies, the answer is yes. Even the best bagless vacuums tend to create a terrible dust cloud when you empty them. There are ways to minimize the impact of that dust cloud – for example, by emptying the vacuum cleaner outside. However, bagged vacuums are still best for people who suffer from allergies and asthma. ","Still, bagless vacuums definitely have their pros. First and foremost, they cost less to maintain because you don&#39;t have to buy replacement bags. In addition, they are also fun in some ways. Leo Steinys, director of product management with Kenmore, pointed out that you get to see everything you collect from your floors with a bagless model, which can be pretty satisfying.","Bagless vacuums have gotten better and better at containing dust.
