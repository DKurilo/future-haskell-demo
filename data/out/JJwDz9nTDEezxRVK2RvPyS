The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-smart-locks\">Smart Locks</a> here.</em>","RemoteLock is a decent smart lock with average convenience, design and support features. The lock&#39;s built-in Wi-Fi requires a subscription, but it gives the lock remote access capability. If you manage multiple rental properties, this is a good option, but a higher-ranked smart lock is a better if you&#39;re a homeowner.","A couple features help RemoteLock improve your home’s security: It tracks keypad users and has an audible alert to tell you when the lock fails to engage. However, there are some missing security features. RemoteLock doesn&#39;t have a tamper alarm or a siren to deter potential intruders. The lock also doesn&#39;t list an ANSI/BHMA grade, which means it likely only minimally increases the physical security of your home compared to Grade 1 and Grade 2 smart locks.","This is the only Wi-Fi door lock in our review, and you can connect it to the internet to customize guest access and add codes remotely. Wi-Fi connectivity requires a small monthly fee through the LockState Connect service to function. The lock is compatible with Airbnb, a service that lets you rent out properties for cash. The lock also has property management tools, which is helpful if you manage multiple rental properties. You can use the web portal to activate the lock&#39;s auto-lock function so it relocks 10 seconds after someone unlocks the door.","To maintain battery life for as long as possible, you can set the lock to connect to Wi-Fi at set intervals. For example, if you choose an always-on connection, the batteries only last a couple days, but larger intervals of a few hours can extend battery life past 12 months. Since the Wi-Fi isn’t always on, the lock doesn&#39;t immediately receive new codes and locking commands when you set them in the web portal or mobile app. This is only a minor inconvenience since you can manually activate the lock&#39;s Wi-Fi connection in between intervals by touching any key on the keypad.","RemoteLock is compatible with the LockState Connect home automation platform and other LockState products, as well as few select third-party products such as the Ring video doorbell. The mobile app is only compatible with iOS smartphones and tablets, not those that use Android.","LockState&#39;s support website offers a small selection of FAQs and video tutorials, but it&#39;s not as extensive as those of other smart door locks, such as the <a href=\"/kwikset-kevo-review\">Kwikset Kevo</a>. The lock has a one-year warranty on both its electronic and mechanical components. You can get personalized customer support by email, telephone and live chat."]},"id":"6718c87f-6d70-45b0-8786-0e36f9a78d53","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67610","url":"/remotelock-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-01-25T21:50:13Z","datePublished":"2016-01-25T21:50:13Z","name":"RemoteLock LS-500i-DB","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
