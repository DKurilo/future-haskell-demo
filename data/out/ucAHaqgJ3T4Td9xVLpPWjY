Maybe you’re doing energy audits at home to find inefficiencies or maybe you need one for home inspections to find leaks or water damage. Engineers use them to find overheating components and an electrician could use one to find overloaded circuits.","More in-depth work requires a broad thermal image spectrum, so we made sure to include at least a couple with that capability in our analysis. High-resolution photos and sometimes videos are important regardless of what type of work you’re doing, so we favored those with a clearer, brighter picture.","Whatever you plan on using your thermal imaging camera for, our evaluations included reading user reviews, analyzing product specifications and other research to find the best products available. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We evaluated every aspect of these thermal imaging cameras, particularly how well the camera captured images and then how clearly it displayed them for viewing. We watched videos, read consumer reviews and analyzed product descriptions to find out which cameras on the market are worth their rather expensive price tags.","Infrared resolution is the number of pixels captured by the infrared sensor and usually ranges from .0005 to .08 megapixels. This might sound small, but it works for infrared imaging. Standard resolution measures the clarity with which your images are displayed and while we realized we&#39;ve been spoiled by our high-quality smart phone cameras, infrared cameras have yet to catch up. Instead, our research showed us most thermal imaging cameras have a standard resolution of 5 megapixels or less.","We also researched which image formats are the easiest to use and found cameras come with a variety of image outputs, so make sure you read the product description and know exactly what it is you&#39;re getting. Don&#39;t assume it will always give you a standard JPEG.","<strong>What Should You Look for When Buying an infrared Camera?</strong><br/> <br/>Image Quality<br/>We’ve been spoiled by high megapixel cameras on our smart phones, but the best thermal imaging camera tops out at 0.08 megapixels, or 320 x 240 pixels. Higher resolution cameras can give you clearer images and measure smaller targets. This can be especially helpful when taking readings from distance due to high temperatures or other hazards.","The cameras we researched offer fixed or manual focus. A fixed focus thermal camera offers less flexibility than one with adjustable focus. With an adjustable focus, you will be able to get more precise images of objects that might be out of the range of a fixed focus camera.","File formats might seem like an afterthought, but having to deal with a proprietary format can cause some headaches. The FLIR and Keysight cameras we reviewed use a radiometric JPEG format with embedded temperature analysis. The Fluke products use a proprietary .is2 file format, but you can also download standard JPEGs without any imbedded temperature analysis.<br/><br/>Thermal Precision<br/>Our primary concern when researching thermal precision specs was the temperature range and sensitivity of these IR cameras. Sensitivity is the ability of the camera to record finer distinctions in temperature. The lower the number, the better the camera is at spotting subtle temperature changes. The infrared cameras we reviewed range from &lt;.05 degrees to &lt;.15 degrees. This is a small difference to be sure, but when dealing with intricate electronics, having a lower sensitivity can make a big difference.","The temperature ranges these cameras can detect range from -20 degrees Celsius to 1,200 degrees Celsius at the high end. Realistically, you’re probably only going to need to detect from -20 to 250 degrees for most home inspections.<br/><br/>Auxiliary Features and Battery<br/>You can get a perfectly functional infrared camera without additional features but they can prove useful. A Wi-Fi enabled camera lets you immediately download images and email them to clients. Laser pointers and illuminator lamps let you target specific areas, which is helpful in dark areas like attics or crawlspaces. Voice or text annotations can be useful for giving notes to clients.","The standard battery life for these infrared cameras is four hours, though charge time varies between four and 2.5 hours, with 2.5 hours being the standard. Thermal imaging cameras are durable, able to withstand being dropped from up to 6.6 feet. Some models include a spare battery, which can help if you have jobs in multiple locations and don’t have time to stop and recharge.","Weight &amp; Dimensions. It’s essential to find an infrared camera that balances features, power and size. If your camera is too bulky or heavy, it may be difficult for you to store or maneuver, especially if you work in tight quarters. Weight is a bigger deal if you’ll be manually maneuvering the camera than if it is fix mounted.","Spectral Band. As you look for an infrared camera, it’s important to keep in mind what you plan to film because different types of cameras detect different wavelength ranges. There are three wavelength categories: short, mid and long.","Short-wavelength infrared cameras detect from approximately 0.9 to 1.7 microns. Of the three ranges, this is the closest to visible light. As such, short-wave infrared cameras need to be high resolution to capture details properly.","Mid-wavelength cameras detect from roughly 2 or 3 microns up to 5 microns. While they don’t capture as much detail as long-wavelength cameras, this is the best type to buy if you plan to use your camera in places with severe temperatures. It’s important to ensure your mid-wavelength camera is built of the proper heat- or cold-resistant materials so you know it will work no matter what environment you use it in.","Lastly, long-wavelength infrared cameras detect wavelengths between 7 and 12 microns – and in some cases, up to 14 microns. Unlike mid-wavelength cameras, long-wavelength cameras can capture a good amount of detail due to their decreased atmospheric absorption.","Image Storage. It’s good to know how your thermal imaging camera stores the images you take. Most use an SD or microSD card. We recommend always keeping one or two backup cards with you, in case you fill up the one inside the camera. Check the camera’s user manual to find the maximum compatible SD card size. You should use the maximum size possible so you don’t have to constantly delete old files to make room for new ones.","Also, find out what kinds of file formats your camera works with, as some types take up more space than others. This can help you keep mental tabs on how much storage space you have left so you don’t run out while you use the camera.","Warranty. Considering these cameras are often used in extreme temperatures, it’s important to consider how long they are under warranty. It’s comforting to know your expensive device is covered, no matter what.","Repairs. Similar to the warranty, it’s good to know ahead of time what your options are for getting your infrared camera repaired. Some manufacturers have their own repair and calibration centers. Typically, you need to take your camera in to be re-calibrated every two to three years. Because this process can take weeks if not months, working with the manufacturer directly often means you have access to a loaner unit in the meantime.","<strong>How Much Do Infrared Cameras Cost?</strong>","The infrared cameras we tested all cost an average of $4,266. Some cameras come with additional accessories like a carrying case and batteries. Thermal imaging cameras for under $1,000 often lack a lot of useful features.
