Do you want to increase your marketability in order to get a promotion or that dream job? If you do, now may be the perfect time to go back to school. If you are like most people, you can t afford to quit your job or be able to fit a class into your busy schedule. An online education<strong> </strong>program may be just the answer you have been seeking.","<strong>What to Look for in Online Education Services</strong>","Online schools offer flexibility with schedules as well as payment plans, but like any major decision, choosing an online degree program and an online school requires a little research and asking the right questions. Is the school accredited? What credentials do they offer? What programs are available?","<strong>Accreditation</strong><br/>When it comes to choosing an online education program, it is important to make sure the online college or online university you choose is accredited. Accreditation is given on the regional and national levels by both non-governmental and governmental agencies. These accrediting agencies are private educational associations that develop evaluation criteria and conduct peer evaluations to ensure that these criteria are being met. Finally, make sure that the degree program itself is accredited or approved by the appropriate agencies. A degree from an accredited institution, as well as an approved program, is usually required for most state licenses for many fields, such as nursing and education.","<strong>Credentials Offered<br/></strong>Your goals determine what credentials you will need. Once you have decided whether you need a degree or just a certificate, you can narrow down your choice by seeing what each institution offers.","<strong>Programs</strong><br/>The first step is to set your goals and decide your area of interest. Once you know what credentials your goals require, you should look for an online degree program that will help you meet those goals. Depending on your goals, you may only need certification in an area such as IT; however, if your goal is to teach in higher education, then you will need to look at graduate school. Once you have decided on a degree program, look for online schools that specialize in your field.","<strong>Institution Features<br/></strong>Another important issue is what each institution offers. Do they have a physical campus with options for traditional classes and face-to-face interaction? Is that important to you? Are you comfortable with an approach that is entirely online learning? You decide what environment will be best for your personality and needs and then find a school that meets those needs.","<strong>Tuition and Financial Aid</strong><br/>One of the biggest questions facing most potential students is:  Can I afford to go back to school?  Before choosing an online education program, research the cost of tuition and fees as well as payment options. Some schools have resource fees as well as the cost of materials and textbooks which are not included in the tuition. On the other hand, some schools may cost slightly more but textbooks and other materials are included in the price of tuition. There are also several forms of financial aid, including Pell Grants, loans, veterans  benefits and scholarships. Many online colleges and universities also have special payment plans and course scheduling specifically designed to help students pay as they go if they wish to avoid going into debt. An education is an investment, so choose the school that will bring you the best returns possible.","Choosing an online university is a major decision, so be sure to ask the right questions. Is the school accredited? Does it offer the right credentials and degree programs? How am I going to pay for it? Once you get the answers to these questions, you can make an informed decision about your future. On this site, we have chosen and reviewed different schools with <a href=\"/kaplan-university-review\">Kaplan University</a>, <a href=\"/walden-university-review\">Walden University</a> and the <a href=\"/university-of-phoenix-review\">University of Phoenix </a>ranked as the top three.
