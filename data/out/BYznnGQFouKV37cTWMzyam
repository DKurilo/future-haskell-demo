For light use, this printer is a sleek device with great functionality.","This capable device offers great printing quality for documents and photos. The printing speed is not bad, but not exceptional either at a rate of 12.5 pages per minute for black and white prints and 11 pages a minute for color prints.","The Canon Pixma MX892 scans and copies as well as the average all-in-one printer, if slower than the best. It copies at a rate of 12.5 copies per minute for black and white and 7.5 copies per minute for color copies.","In addition, this multifunctional printer allows for dual-scanned documents, so when you feed a piece of paper through the automatic document feeder, it will scan both sides rather than forcing you to flip and scan two pages separately. If you need to get several copies ready for an important class or meeting, the slow copy speed makes this the bane of the procrastinator.","The Canon Pixma MX892 prints, scans, copies and faxes as well as many other all-in-one inkjet printers, but it doesn&#39;t offer much to set it apart. The design and interface are fine, but nothing about the printer feels unique.","Fortunately, Canon offers plenty of support for all of its products, so you&#39;ll be able to browse FAQs, download drivers or print new user manuals. Customer support representatives are available through phone or email, and both methods offer fast and thorough help. As you work with this all-in-one inkjet printer, you can count on Canon to always have your back."]},"id":"6fe270c6-fd44-4db4-a479-c3711cdb4ed9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cbdc47cf-b0a8-4005-bdca-c736fe33a98a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon Pixma MX892 works just fine, which turns out to be its biggest fault.
