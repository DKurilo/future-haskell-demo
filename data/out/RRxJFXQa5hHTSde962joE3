These elements will determine how you can use the technology and what benefits it will give you and your staff. The right system should help you collaborate more effectively, get work done and build relationships with your employees.","<strong>Screen Resolution</strong><br/>The screen resolution of your telepresence equipment is an important factor due to the experience it provides. A negative experience caused by low-quality screen resolution can affect how often the solution is used and how effective it is. Many conferencing systems use at least a 1080p resolution so that a large monitor may be used so that it resembles a face-to-face meeting.","<strong>Mobile Avatar</strong><br/>Mobile telepresence through avatars lets you interact with the remote environment without having to be physically present. Many of these avatars let you move about in the meeting area, navigating to different locations or even turning to face those who are speaking to you in real time. This puts you in control of conversations and collaborations with co-workers and employees.","<strong>Tablet Compatibility</strong><br/>While some telepresence video conferencing systems come equipped with built-in screens that let you see and speak to remote workers, others act as only a base and are compatible with your tablets. They may work with Android, iPad or Windows tablets, but they may require additional applications before they can be used.","<strong>Headset Compatibility</strong><br/>Headsets are a vital part of communicating through advanced video conference technology. Headsets can let you multitask as you participate in meetings and can provide a high-quality experience. Using the right headset can ensure your voice is heard in crystal-clear sound with minimal feedback and chatter. They also improve comfort, especially during long periods of use. Many telepresence systems are compatible with headsets to offer these benefits.","Communicating effectively even when you&#39;re in a remote location is possible with telepresence technology. You will want to be sure to consider each of the solutions features prior to making any purchasing decision to ensure it is the right one for your company.","<strong>BeamPro by Suitable Technology Review</strong>"]},"id":"1c894743-ea7e-428a-9447-d1a06f1944c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/FDr4C2d72hqRXTHgDBfgJn.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The BeamPro lets you walk and talk with anyone, even if you aren&#39;t present at that location with a mobile avatar.

Built in to the monitor are speakers and a headset-input port. The monitor can double as your desktop screen when you&#39;re not using it for video conferencing.","A key pad is located at the base of the monitor to assist you in controlling every action you want to take with the system. You can use this system to dial specific phone numbers and extensions. You&#39;ll also be able to control the volume and display options while in a video conference.","If you want to share content from your laptop or computer to the telepresence system, you can connect a VGA cable between the two. You&#39;ll be able to upload your data with this cord and preview it before sharing it with other users. Whether sharing content or making a video call, the LCD screen will deliver HD-quality 1080p screen resolution.","When not using this telepresence option for video conferencing or as your desktop monitor, you can tell the timer to go to sleep by setting a timer on the monitor. After this time has elapsed, the system will sleep until you need to use it again.","This telepresence technology is not designed to be used with your tablet or phone, as it comes with a large 20- to 24-inch display screen and is big enough to require a desk for use. It is not able to pan or tilt, either, and is intended for personal use by one individual speaking to others using the same type of technology. It does give you the ability to share and collaborate on projects, however.","This telepresence avatar and software gives you the ability to speak to individuals in remote areas without having to be present with them. It features a large display screen that offers 1080p screen resolution and can double as a computer monitor. The avatar isn&#39;t mobile and cannot tilt or pan, but the system has built-in speakers, a headset-input port and a key pad for controlling the software.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>VGo Review</strong>"]},"id":"024677f0-5067-4892-b278-373ad172a24a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/YogpYoMh5VrxHgaunWCit.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The VGo system uses your Mac or PC and a specially designed avatar to allow you to communicate with individuals who are not directly in your presence.
