StaySharp Max Reel Mower has an advanced design; wide cutting path; and the ability to cut your grass to a nice, even level with ease. You also have more control over the length of the cut than with any other lawnmower we tested. The blades on this machine are made of tempered steel, and they do not make contact with the reel. This greatly reduces metal-on-metal friction and makes the mower much more effective. It also increases the life of the mower.","Another benefit of this <a href=\"/best-lawnmowers-review\">push lawnmower’s</a> design is that it eliminates the regular maintenance other mowers require to keep the blades sharp. Normally, a well-maintained reel mower needs a special oil that’s applied to the blades by hand. The Fiskars StaySharp Max requires no such thing, and the blades are designed to stay sharp throughout the mower&#39;s lifetime.","There are four wheels on this machine. This is not a unique feature on its own. However, unlike other machines, the front wheels are inset, which means they don’t get in the way of the blades cutting the grass. This design feature greatly reduces or even eliminates those strips of lawn that require you to retrace your path to get a consistent cut.","The handle on this mower is ergonomically designed and padded to make mowing as comfortable as possible, and since it can handle even large yards, this is very important. Mowers that have non-ergonomic, non-padded or even T-shaped handlebars are uncomfortable and can cause soreness or even blisters after prolonged use.","There isn’t a grass-clipping catcher included with this machine. This mower has a reversible grass chute that can discharge clippings out of the front and away from your feet or out the back and downward. This keeps your shoes clean and your feet free of green film if you happen to be mowing barefoot. If you want a catcher for your grass clippings, you can purchase one from the Fiskars website, but we found it to be unnecessary.","This is the only reel lawnmower in our reviews that can cut more than just grass. Almost all the other machines we tested stopped dead in their tracks when they encountered even the smallest twig, wood chip or even clumps of already-cut grass. The StaySharp Max has no such problems. In fact, in our tests, this lawnmower did not jam a single time. However, this doesn’t mean you can be irresponsible about what you push it over. It’s always best to clear your yard of sticks, debris and rocks before you mow. If you happen to run across a large, hard object, stop mowing immediately and inspect your blades for damage.","Adjusting the cutting height on this machine is simple: There is a lever at the base of the mowing unit that allows you to slide the blades to the height you want. Most mowers have this feature, but what makes the StaySharp Max so great is it has a very wide range – you can cut your grass as short as 1 inch or as tall as 4 inches, the biggest range on our side-by-side comparison chart. But even this isn’t unique to Fiskars; what is unique is you can adjust the level all the way down to its lowest setting using only the adjustment lever. The other product we tested that has a 4-inch cutting range requires you to use a special tool to cut your grass shorter than 2 inches.","Assembling this mower is quite simple. The instructions in the owner’s manual are easy to follow, and no tools are required. There are six components, including the fully assembled mower unit, that are held together by only four bolts, which are fasted together by hand-tightened wing nuts. In our assembly test, it took 16 minutes from opening the box to having a fully functioning, ready-to-use push lawnmower.","At 52 pounds, this is the heaviest push mower in our lineup – yet oddly enough, it is among the easiest to push. This is a result of the mower’s drivetrain design, as well as the design of the handles, which adjust up and down depending on whether you’re moving straight or turning.","Fiskars calls this method “floating,” which means you can move the handle between 6 and 10 inches while mowing. This flexibility keeps the front wheels from rising off the ground while turning, which not only makes it easier to push, but also ensures an even cut, even on the edges of the grass.","We subjected each of the mowers on our lineup to a series of tests. Those tests included cutting a 10 x 10-foot area of well-maintained grass. We tracked the number of passes each lawnmower required to achieve an even cut. In our review, the average number of passes needed to accomplish this was 13; some machines even got up to 20. The Fiskars StaySharp Max created a level cut in only eight passes.","The user’s manual is the most detailed and useful document we encountered in our evaluation of the best push mowers. It explains how the machine works and how it’s different than any other reel mower on the market. It also contains an exhaustive list of troubleshooting methods to help you through any mechanical difficulties you may encounter using this mower.","In short, this is a reel lawnmower designed for the 21st century. The other products in our lineup are rehashes of antiquated and nearly obsolete technology. The Fiskars StaySharp Max’s design not only makes it an effective mower that can hold its own against gas-powered mowers, but it’s also easy to push and maneuver. In addition, it yields a cut that’s even and doesn’t require you to retrace your steps nearly as often as the other products in our lineup."]},"id":"83331e41-3195-4ca1-8cf6-2e144716a6d2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64518","url":"/fiskars-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
