With its 11.6-inch screen, it is slightly larger than many other <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">portable DVD players</a> we reviewed, but it is not so large that it becomes an inconvenience. Unfortunately, the viewing angle is narrow, and the sound quality through headphones is muted when compared to other players. Also, Ematic offers very few help options and unresponsive customer support. Still, based on the player’s overall quality, the Ematic EPD105 earns our Top Ten Reviews Bronze Award."]},"id":"bf38d379-637f-4d60-9048-61f47c21e4af","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Video &amp; Audio Performance"},"id":"c1120623-d20c-4cff-a0aa-91b84daea80e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/NBzAPmzQxy3kDuRz8ELfEH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The unit has excellent resolution at 1366 x 768 pixels. We tested this quality with a favorite DVD, one we’ve watched hundreds of times. The colors were vibrant, and the screen was clear on all of its default settings. We tested the viewing angle with a protractor and thread, and we noticed distortion at 25 degrees off center. This is particularly narrow, as 45 degrees is usually best for multiple people. If you have two or more kids in the back seat, only the one looking head-on will have a good viewing experience, while the others will argue about turning the screen.
