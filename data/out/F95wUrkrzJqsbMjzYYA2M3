The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktops\">Electric Cooktops</a> here.</em>","The Bosch 800 NET8068UC 30-inch electric cooktop has a variety of cook settings. The ceramic face is sleek and easy to clean, and the touch controls are simple and uncluttered. Among its features is a bridge element that spans two burners so you can put an extra-large pot, a grill or a roasting pan on top and cook a big meal with ease.","This ceramic cooktop has an easy-to-read digital display and attractive stainless steel accents. You get four burners on the Bosch, including a double burner that offers a high power option with an output of 3,100 watts to bring a pot of water to a rolling boil quickly. This burner starts at 6 inches and can go up to 9 inches. The cooktop also includes two 7-inch burners and one 6-inch burner.","The burners have two buttons with easy-to-understand graphics. A range of numbers on a small control box on the ceramic glass allows you to quickly choose from up to 17 different power settings so you get the precise heat level you want. The control buttons for keeping food warm and the child lock are separate, which means you do not have to memorize any complicated commands.","The child lock is easy to find and operate. You simply push the button for three seconds to lock the appliance, protecting children from messing with it. The ceramic cooktop has two different heat indicators and warns you if the surface is still hot so you can avoid getting burned after the device has been turned off. There&#39;s also a separate clean-lock feature you can activate in the middle of cooking. For example, if there is a spill near the control panel, you can turn on the clean lock and wipe up the spill without changing your other settings.","The Bosch 800 NET8068UC has a simplicity to its attractive design. Stainless steel runners come standard and give it aesthetic appeal, and the minimalistic look means this electric cooktop would add to the decor of any kitchen. In addition, it has easy-to-use functions and a good range of configurations on its four burners."]},"id":"7f9cfa8a-6705-4376-8736-9a06b2ba7902","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63498","url":"/bosch-800-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-16T19:14:31Z","datePublished":"2015-03-16T19:14:31Z","name":"Bosch 800 Series NET8066UC","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
