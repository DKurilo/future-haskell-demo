You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Rosewill RME 313R <a href=\"/best-hdmi-switchers\">HDMI switcher</a> works much like a power strip, but for HDMI cables. For example, if you have more than one device that uses an HDMI port, such as a Blu-ray player or DVD player and your TV only has one port available, the HDMI switch will allow you to connect all the different devices. The Rosewill HDMI switch will automatically switch between the media sources as they power on and off.  The manufacturer also provides a variety of customer support options. However, the customer service options offered are not as extensive as some other manufacturers.<em><br/></em>"]},"id":"a7b561a5-45e5-4c42-99bd-20613f5958e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Switching Capabilities"},"id":"60b7eece-dc0c-492a-a6a2-68020f480566","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are no standards for exactly how many HDMI ports your TV will have. Many older models only have one or two ports. However, HDMI cables are quickly becoming the standard for all digital inputs and devices. Using HDMI cables will reduce the number of cords and cables you’ll need. Many different devices such as Blu-ray players, Roku, DVD players and video game consoles all use HDMI cables.","The Rosewill HDMI switcher is compatible with all different HDMI cables, including versions 1.3 and 1.4. However, the HDMI selector does not have the Ethernet capabilities that are included with the version 1.4. And while there are few 1.4 cables with Ethernet in use, the option is not available with any of the HDMI switchers we reviewed.","The HDMI switcher also doesn&#39;t have audio return capabilities. The version 1.4 HDMI cables have audio return channel options. This is used to send sound from your TV back to your surround sound system. TVs can receive multi-channel audio and the TV is positioned “downstream” from the HDMI sources. However, the 1.4 HDMI cables enable you to send audio to an AV receiver with one cable. This feature would eliminate the need for a separate S/PDIF connection. In order to use this audio feature, you also need devices that feature Audio Return Channel options.","The Rosewill HDMI switch is a plug-and-play device. Simply attach all the HDMI cables from your different devices to the switcher box and then attach the box to the TV. The box does not require an external power source – the TV will power it. Some media devices such as a Blu-ray player require more power than others. However, all the devices are supported easily by the power output from the TV or other projector.","When you turn a device on, the HDMI selector will recognize the change and switch the inputs. If this feature is not functioning properly, we suggest looking at the different settings on your DVD player or other device. Often times, the media sources are only placed into a sleep mode and the entire power isn&#39;t shut off. This can confuse the settings on the HDMI switcher, but most players have the ability to change the power settings.","Should you need a remote, the Rosewill HDMI switcher has a small plastic remote. There are only a few buttons that will allow you to switch through each channel. The switcher box is compatible with universal remotes. But most often, after getting the settings on your devices correct, you won’t need a remote. The navigation of each different device is simple.","HDMI cables support almost every sound format. Dolby Digital and DTS aren&#39;t as common as they used to be. Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio are becoming the standard formats. The HDMI selector will work with all of these sound settings and many more types. The HDMI switchers support every sound and display format the HDMI cables support.","The Rosewill HDMI switch is well-built and dependable. The HDMI switch box is made of plastic, but appears to be able to handle the everyday wear-and-tear that it might be subjected to. We also like the design and look of the HDMI switcher.","The Rosewill HDMI selector we reviewed has three ports. And unlike other similar manufacturers, Rosewill doesn&#39;t have a switch box with more ports. The amount of ports you need depends on how many different HDMI-capable devices you use."]},"id":"d2012dfe-7ab2-46ba-aee6-6d2bf075aec5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Compatibility"},"id":"b585f0cc-f1dd-429a-9791-7a4abd252301","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Using the Rosewill HDMI switcher is extremely simple.
