A completely wireless system, the Tattletale appeals to renters, owners of small homes and even college students in dorms.","The maker of the Tattletale claims the system is so easy to use, you can have it up and running in less than a minute. Most users of the system support this claim, reporting a simple and hassle-free installation process. You plug the small plastic box into a standard wall outlet and enter some basic information to activate the system. Programming additional sensors takes a little more time but doing so is just as effortless.","As is the case with many of the best DIY home security systems, this system can be upgraded and customized to fit your security needs. You begin with the portable control unit and from there, you can choose the additional security devices you want. These devices include smoke, motion, window and door sensors. Every Tattletale also comes with a key fob that allows you to arm and disarm the system, and set off the panic mode.","This security device enables you to receive email and text message notifications if the system is triggered. Customers seem to especially like that you can choose up to five different people to also receive notifications. This feature is particularly beneficial in situations where you may be incapacitated.","Another apparent standout feature of this DIY alarm system is its supplementary help and support. The manufacturer provides a wide range of support resources that can help you take full advantage of this system. For instance, the Tattletale website hosts programming instructions, installation guides and user forums. It also has a variety of video tutorials that provide visual instruction on how to set up your system. Customers who ran into installation and technical issues with the system report customer service agents that were responsive and helpful in addressing and rectifying these problems.","If you are looking for a DIY security system but are overwhelmed with the sheer number of options out there, the Tattletale DIY security system is a good place to start. Its plug-and-play operation, flexible sensor integration and system notifications are all hallmarks of an effective do-it-yourself alarm system."]},"id":"e252fe7f-2178-4c90-b713-8a30596fb49f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58905","url":"/tattletale-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-24T21:41:15Z","datePublished":"2014-02-24T21:41:15Z","name":"Tattletale","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
