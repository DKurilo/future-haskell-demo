This printer has a relatively small and light design compared to the best home printers, and if you don’t need the most portable printer scanner combo, it also offers some of the best print quality in our review.","The MG6821 is compact for a desktop printer, measuring just 18.0 x 14.6 x 5.9 inches, but weighing 14 pounds, it’s also by far the heaviest of the mini printers we reviewed. Our top pick, the <a href=\"/hp-officejet-all-in-one-review\">HP OfficeJet All-in-One 250</a>, weighs just over 6 pounds. That said, the MG6821 is still small enough to fit on most desks and large enough to include full-size features like a flatbed scanner and automatic two-sided printing.","Its print quality is the best of the bunch, and it produced better-than-average documents and excellent photos. In our testing, document prints were mostly error free and photo prints were very, very good. Black-and-white documents printed at a rate of 12 pages per minute, while color documents took longer at 7.14 pages per minute.","The Pixma MG6821 uses a five-cartridge system, with regular cyan, magenta, yellow and black inks, along with a pigment black cartridge that creates better blacks and more detail in photos. The cost of printing with standard ink cartridges averages out to 18 cents per page, and when you use high-capacity cartridges, the price falls to 14 cents a page.","Because it’s larger than other compact printers, the Pixma has room for a flatbed scanner, and it produced high-quality scanned and copied documents during our testing. In addition, you can use it to scan from books and stapled documents, both of which are impossible to do with a scrolling page-fed scanner.","The printer’s large size also makes it better at handling paper than most compact models, and it includes a 100-page input tray, a secondary tray that holds 20 sheets of photo paper and a comfortably large output tray. It also has automatic two-sided printing, which is a common feature for standard desktop printers but virtually nonexistent in compact printers.","It also has a complete set of connectivity options, including both USB and Wi-Fi. You can connect smartphones and tablets through Apple AirPrint or Google Cloud Print, and Canon also offers its own app. Wireless PictBridge support lets you print directly from compatible cameras, and the built-in card slots let you print from SD cards, including SD, SDHC and SDXC formats. In addition, it supports Sony’s standard Memory Stick Duo and Memory Stick Pro Duo.","The Canon Pixma MG6821 is backed with a one-year warranty, which is standard for compact printers. Canon offers support via phone and email, with additional materials on its website, including an online manual, troubleshooting guide and FAQs."]},"id":"861a6270-269a-47d5-ad48-d04bd640af6a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0fb3f861-1af6-488b-bffa-ea7a42356d8a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon Pixma MG6821 is considered a compact printer because of its dimensions and sub-15-pound weight, but it’s too big for most people looking for a mini printer.
