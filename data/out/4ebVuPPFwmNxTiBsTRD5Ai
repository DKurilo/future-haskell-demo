Click here to read our current reviews on </em><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-drones,review-2412.html\"><em>RC Drones</em></a><em>.</em>","The rugged and dependable Turbo Ace X830-D RTF is designed for professional and recreational use. It’s fun to fly and fast, and it&#39;s robust enough for search and rescue missions. This aerial drone&#39;s components are made of aluminum and carbon instead of the plastic you find on less expensive models.","At 36 inches across, the X830-D is a relatively large drone. Without a camera or camera mount, the drone weighs 2.4 pounds, leaving lots of room for a larger camera or multiple batteries that would extend its flying time. The custom carrying case measures 32 x 20 x 9 inches, so before you decide on this plane, be sure you have room in your vehicle to transport a 32-inch suitcase.","The Turbo Ace X830-D RTF is a ready-to-fly aerial drone. It’s customized to your specifications, assembled, calibrated and test flown in California before being shipped to you. If you&#39;d prefer, you can pick up your unmanned aerial vehicle in California and they’ll test fly it while you are there. If your X830-D is shipped, that same test flight will be recorded to video and saved, along with instructions, to a flash card. If the drone is shipped, you will only need to remount the propellers before it is ready to fly.","The quadcopter-style drone has an included transmitter and controller (which you can upgrade, of course) with a screen from which you fly the machine. An included 8GB flash card fits into a slot on this transmitter, and this is where you’ll save your images. The X830-D can stay airborne for six to eight minutes with a standard battery. You can purchase a heavier, more robust battery that can keep it in the air for up to 30 minutes. It’s a balancing act between a lighter camera and a heavier battery or a heavier camera and a lighter battery. If you approach the maximum 5-pound load, the X830-D does fly, but at slower speeds.","Support and sales are handled by experts at Wow Hobbies in California. Complimentary support is available by phone or email for 10 days after your quadcopter is delivered, but by email only thereafter.","Be aware that to get the most out of this unmanned drone, you&#39;ll end up adding extras like a camera or a better transmitter However, this large and durable drone allows you to fly longer and with heavier loads than you can with other models. The Turbo Ace X830-D RTF is well-suited for serious hobby flying as well as for serious business pursuits."]},"id":"a7d984b5-ad96-42e9-bb03-0b014a126a4a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59811","url":"/turbo-ace-quadcopter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brandon-carte","url":"/author/brandon-carte","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Brandon Carte","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"Y2ioFDbnwaDrRNArHcGhXX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-20T19:58:26Z","datePublished":"2014-06-20T19:58:26Z","name":"Turbo Ace Quadcopter X830-D RTF","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
