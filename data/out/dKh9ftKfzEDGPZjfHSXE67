You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are tired of replacing cheap <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaners</a> every couple of years, consider the Oreck Forever Series Gold. This bagged upright cleaner comes with a limited lifetime warranty so you will never have to buy another vacuum.","This machine uses direct suction to remove debris from your floors. While many upright vacuum cleaners make dirt travel through bends and twists to get to the bag, straight suction moves the dirt straight up into the bag. This reduces the disruption in airflow, which means you pick up more dirt.","This vacuum cleaner has a unique roller brush design. The roller brushes have a patented crimped brush and roller design that helps pick up hair and other objects. It also comes with small side brushes that can catch cobwebs under counters. Although the roller brush has two speeds, you can&#39;t turn off the roller to clean hardwood floors.","With a long 35-foot power cord, this upright vacuum can cover a large space quickly because you do not have to switch outlets frequently. It is also one of the lightest cleaners we reviewed. Since it weighs only 10 pounds, it is easy to lift. You can carry it up and down stairs with one hand. The design includes an ergonomic handle, and the vacuum lies down flat, making it easy to clean under your bed. It also comes with twin LED headlights to illuminate your cleaning path.","The downside of this machine is that it does not clean high-pile rugs. In testing, when we transitioned from a hard surface to a tall carpet, instead of the machine adjusting to the new height, the long carpet blocked the airflow causing loss of suction. However, on short-pile carpet and hard surfaces it performs well. It also lacks accessories and cleaning tools. If wands, upholstery tools and cleaning brushes are important to you, this machine will not be a good fit.","Although we do not recommend dropping this vacuum cleaner down the stairs, if you do, chances are it will still work. Equipped with a commercial-grade base plate, this machine is durable.","With Oreck&#39;s impressive warranty, the company will replace any parts (excluding brushes and disposable inner bags) for the lifetime of the machine. The vacuum cleaner belt is made of Kevlar and has a lifespan of seven to 10 years.","Oreck has service centers in almost every major city. The company is easy to contact by email and telephone. We were pleased with how quickly customer service representatives answered the phones, and we were impressed with the helpful information on the product website. Additionally, if you need help with technical issues, you can contact an Oreck dealer in your area."]},"id":"9e4c4249-f7bc-4e5b-af41-34b4e682fcbf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"88e3bb97-7f3e-419e-a9ab-470b0925020f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Oreck Forever Series Gold is a great lightweight vacuum for cleaning hard surfaces and low-pile carpets.
