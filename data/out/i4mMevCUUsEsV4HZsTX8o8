Consider setting aside at least one day per month to perform the following tasks.","<strong>Virus Scanning</strong>","Downloading a virus scanner that runs in the background is a good idea regardless of the operating system you are using. Even though virus infection is more common with Microsoft Windows machines, a Mac OS X system may still be infected with a virus. Consider using a virus scanner from a reputable company and make sure that it is updated on a regular basis, since many new viruses are created every day.","<strong>Data Backup</strong>","Back up your data on a regular basis. While you do not have to backup all of your files on a regular basis, you should at least back up files that are important and difficult to replace. Consider backing up your files on a weekly basis.","<strong>Updates</strong>","Check to see if any of your applications or your operating system require updates and install the updates on a regular basis. If you are unsure what the purpose of the update is, you can check with the software developer s website, or for Mac OS X, Apple s website to discover what the purpose of the upgrade is.","<strong>Passwords</strong>","Consider changing your Administrative passwords at least every 3 to 6 months. Your passwords should include at least one number, a special character such as an exclamation point, and not be easily identifiable.","<strong>Disk Maintenance</strong>","Run a disk defragmenter and scanner on at least a monthly basis. This will help identify any problem areas with your hard disk and also improve performance.","Keeping your computer updated and maintained doesn&#39;t have to be a chore, and can help keep your data safe and computer running like new.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"3cbfdeda-c13e-41a5-8722-a74cea67f8ed","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4014","url":"/regular-maintenance","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"matt-knouff","url":"/author/matt-knouff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Matt Knouff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"FseCdH67F5piBzXes3hD6B","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-02-26T20:34:02Z","datePublished":"2010-02-26T20:34:02Z","name":"Regular Maintenance","synopsis":"Completing regular maintenance tasks can help prevent the need to perform data recovery in the future.
