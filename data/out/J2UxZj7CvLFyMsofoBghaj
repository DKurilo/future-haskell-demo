You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Weed Eater Gas FeatherLite Trimmer is inexpensive and only weighs about 10 pounds, which is much lighter than most competing <a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">weed whackers</a> we reviewed. However, it lacks some of the bells and whistles that our top weed eaters have. Similarly, its reputation for being flimsy and easy to break is a significant concern.","Nevertheless, this machine has been popular enough that its brand, Weed Eater, has slipped into common usage as a generic term for all grass trimmers. Like many of its competitors, this Weed Eater grass trimmer has a dual line exit at the head so that you can decimate weeds at twice the speed of a single-exit machine. It also features a trigger-control mechanism, a plastic debris shield and bump feed. We urge you to be cautious while getting used to this semi-automatic bump-feed feature because it has a reputation for being touchy.","Perhaps the best feature of this Weed Eater is spelled out in its name – FeatherLite. The machine weighs just less than 10 pounds, which is about half the weight of its heaviest competitors. Making the deal even sweeter, the FeatherLite machine comes with a harness to help you distribute that weight safely across your back and shoulders.","Despite its light weight, the Weed Eater grass trimmer has a 25cc engine. That means plenty of torque to chop tall residential weeds and long grass in a single pass. The efficient machine’s straight shaft is almost five feet long, which means you can use it to trim underneath any porches, swing sets or other obstacles in your yard. However, its straight shaft also means that the machine is less well balanced than its curved-shafted competitors are.","The Weed Eater fares less well in terms of usability. You can replace the spool without tools, although you might find the task difficult because the string tangles easily. The machine is fitted with easy-start technology, but you still might have to pull the start cord several times to fire up its two-cycle engine. You will also have to mix oil and gas to fuel that engine, and you won’t have the benefit of anti-vibration technology.","Unfortunately, you may also have to deal with bent or broken parts – even when you use the machine delicately. For example, many users report receiving their new Weed Eaters with bent shafts right out of the box. Others report eroded fuel lines after leaving the FeatherLite Weed Eater in the garage for only one winter.","The FeatherLite grass trimmer is much more powerful than competing electric models. However, it may not be powerful enough to decimate particularly stubborn weeds such as thistles or berry bushes with spinning nylon line alone. To eliminate these plants, you can attach the Weed Eater&#39;s included brush blade that is designed to handle the job."]},"id":"c4796461-b7cf-4962-a411-1494195c34a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fe6a144d-00d6-412b-b907-ed5725ec88c5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Weedeater Gas FeatherLite Trimmer is the least expensive grass trimmer we reviewed, but you may get just what you paid for with this model because it is hard to start, breaks easily and the nylon trimming line becomes tangled often.
