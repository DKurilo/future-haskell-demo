All of the low-quality paper samples were printed on flimsier stock, but some stood out for being sturdier or making the photo look crisper and closer to the original."]},"id":"68e41c10-4531-4f1c-ac29-90acea8e8cc4","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/rh68cnomMJj88E4nJCprEE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/photo-card-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS81LzQvODA3NTkyL29yaWdpbmFsL1Bob3RvLUNhcmRzLVRlc3RpbmctMDA1LmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rh68cnomMJj88E4nJCprEE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"rh68cnomMJj88E4nJCprEE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rh68cnomMJj88E4nJCprEE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e2538b1c-3a1f-4965-b481-4ad070241208","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Photo Cards<br/>","One easy way to create and customize cards for holidays and other occasions is to use photo card services, which often also make <a href=\"/best-photo-books\">photo books</a> and other gifts. You can make unforgettable cards in minutes by simply clicking and dragging on a web-based interface, without downloading anything new onto your computer. Most layouts do not allow for much text, but some allow quite a bit. Photo card pricing usually includes envelopes too, so you can slip a note into any card before mailing it. The price of photo cards varies greatly from company to company, as does the minimum number of cards per order. Photo card services often offer a lot less customization than photo books because you usually cannot rearrange the graphics and artwork as much.","Lisa Mariko, a professional photographer with four years of experience, told us that it’s best to edit your photos at 300 dots per inch (dpi) because it helps them look crisp. When we asked her what improvements she’d like to see in photo card services, she said it would be more convenient if these services allowed you to create your own designs and graphics. This is definitely a great option for creative people. She also warned that many of these sites don&#39;t allow you to use foreign characters in your cards, which can be frustrating when you’re writing locations or names.","<strong>Mother’s Day Photo Cards</strong>","One of the best ways to greet your Mom on her special day is with a personalized Mother’s Day card.","<a href=\"/mixbook-review\">Mixbook</a> and <a href=\"/shutterfly-review\">Shutterfly</a> both have plenty of “Mother” themes to choose from, which is nice since many photo card services do not have specific pre-made Mother’s Day themes. If you end up using a service that doesn’t have Mother’s Day themes, keep in mind that you can always choose a card that you like the look of and change the text to make it Mother’s Day oriented.","Once you have your background, fill the card with pictures of grandchildren, siblings or other family members. We recommend choosing a card that allows you to add text to the backside so that you can add a personalized message for your Mother or Mother-like figure. Choosing a foil stamped card can also give it a special touch.","<strong>When Should I Order Christmas Cards?</strong>","If you’ve ever ordered your greeting cards late in the season, you know that prices may go up and processing times may be longer than usual. To get a more in-depth answer as to when we should order our holiday cards, we reached out to Shutterfly and Mixbook. Representatives at both services said that the peak of the season is between Nov. 10 and Dec. 31. Therefore, it’s best to order your photo cards before Nov. 10. If you want to include a big family photo, you need to factor in how long it will take to get your family together for a photo shoot. Many photographers are busy during the holiday season, so we recommend getting family photos done by late October or early November. This gives the photographer time to touch up any photos before sending them to you. ","There is always the possibility of a printing mistake, whether that be the fault of the printer or the user. As such, try to order your cards with plenty of extra time in case you need to get replacements. Outside of the busy season, it usually takes about three to seven business days for a standard-shipping order to arrive. During the peak season, however, it will probably take longer.","Also consider that, unless you choose a service that can print addresses or mail your cards for you, you need to spend time writing out recipients’ addresses and placing stamps. Depending on how many cards you need to send, this can be very time-consuming, which can be especially inconvenient during the busy holiday season. Then there’s the mailing period before your recipients receive the cards. Considering all of these factors, we suggest ordering your photo cards no later than Dec. 5. To be safe, we advise you to mail your cards no later than Dec. 10. We determined that <a href=\"/shutterfly-review\">Shutterfly</a> has the most affordable mailing service of any photo card company we tested, and we suggest having Shutterfly mail your cards for you if you&#39;re in a pinch.","<strong>How Many Christmas Cards Are Bought Each Year?</strong>","Because young people tend to keep in touch with friends on social media rather than through the mail, fewer people are sending traditional greeting cards. But that doesn’t mean the greeting-card industry is dead. According to <a href=\"https://www.southernliving.com/culture/greeting-card-industry-worth\">Southern Living</a>, about 7 billion greeting cards are sold each year. That’s an estimated $7.5 billion in annual retail sales. However, Christmas is not the No. 1 event for card sales; that honor goes to birthdays, which account for 50 percent of all cards sold. In comparison, only a little over 2 billion Christmas cards are sold each year.","According to the <a href=\"https://www.courant.com/data-desk/hc-whos-sending-christmas-cards-20141215-htmlstory.html\">Hartford Courant</a>, U.S. households sent an average of 15 holiday cards in 2012. This was the most recent information we could find, and the number has likely fallen since then. The same article says 80 percent of all card purchases are made by women, and most are bought by women over 40. Even though younger generations may not be buying as many cards, they are a beautiful way to celebrate the holidays. Greeting cards make great holiday decorations and let people know you’re thinking about them.","<strong>Photo Cards for Weddings &amp; Formal Occasions</strong>","The type of paper and envelopes you use affect the look and feel of your cards. Many services offer more than one paper type; glossy and matte photo paper don’t really fit the feel of a formal event, however. According to <a href=\"http://www.pipkinpapercompany.com/ultimate-guide-cardstock/\">Pipkin Paper Co.</a>, 120-pound cardstock is the gold standard for wedding invitations. Most photo card printing companies feature gold foil cards, which are perfect for save-the-date notices, graduation cards, Christmas cards and party invitations. Some services let you choose the color of the envelopes; the best services offer at least five color options, allowing you to match the cards with your party or wedding colors. The best services also let you select the color of an envelope’s inner lining, which adds a tasteful touch to your invitations. <br/><strong><br/>Digital Photo Cards</strong>","Although sending out physical Christmas cards is still a common practice, many people prefer to send electronic greeting cards. <a href=\"https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=5f97d6947584dea7e4afd9ac5c4d5419&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paperlesspost.com%2F&amp;cuid=PhotoCards&amp;opt=true\">Paperless Post</a> and other digital photo card companies offer beautiful selections of designs that look just as nice as those offered by printed photo card services. After you create your card, you simply email it out to your loved ones.","You still pay to use the design. However, sending your card electronically saves money, because you don’t have to pay for paper, shipping or stamps. You also save time because you don’t have to write out the names and addresses on a bunch of envelopes. In addition, you don’t have to run to the mailbox or stand in line at the post office. If you really like Paperless Post’s designs, you can have them printed through <a href=\"/best-photo-cardspaper-source-review/\">Paper Source</a>; the companies partnered to create physical cards. Just be warned that Paper Source is a bit pricey.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Digital Party Invites</strong><strong><br/></strong>","Keeping in line with digital invitations, Paperless Post has created <a href=\"https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=5f97d6947584dea7e4afd9ac5c4d5419&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paperlesspost.com%2Fflyer&amp;cuid=PhotoCards&amp;opt=true\">Flyer</a>, which allows you to create invitations for casual events such as barbecues, birthday parties and friend get-togethers. The designs range from playful and kitschy to elegant and refined, so you can find graphics and fonts that match the feel of your party. You can choose from multiple backgrounds and stickers to customize your digital cards. ","You can share these invitations via email or text. You can also copy and paste a link to the invite on social media sites. Another advantage of this service is the RSVP feature: When your friends and family members open the link, they can view the time, date and location of your party and RSVP right then and there. As the creator of the invite, you can keep tabs on who is coming, thus helping you plan your food and party needs.","<strong>For the DIY-er</strong>","If using a service seems a bit pricey, you might be interested in printing your own cards with a <a href=\"/best-photo-only-printers\">photo printer</a>. It’s definitely cheaper, but keep in mind the expense includes the cardstock or photo paper, the envelopes, the stamps and the <a href=\"/best-discount-ink-cartridges-stores\">ink cartridges</a>.","Also, if you want to design your own cards, we recommend using <a href=\"/print-artist-platinum-review\">Print Artist Platinum 25</a> or <a href=\"/hallmark-card-studio-deluxe-review\">Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2018</a>, both of which received high scores in our <a href=\"/best-greeting-card-software\">greeting card software tests</a>. You can also design your greeting cards online; for this, we suggest using <a href=\"/canva-review\">Canva</a>. Canva&#39;s graphics and designs are modern and stylish. The most basic plan is free and gives you access to plenty of fonts and art. The software itself is free, but you will likely want to pay for cloud storage because the basic plan includes only 1GB.","<strong>Costco Photo Center vs. Sam’s Club Photo</strong>","We chose order test cards from Costco Photo Center and Sam’s Club Photo because they are membership-only services. But we have taken the time to compare them side by side to determine the pros and cons of both companies. The companies are comparable, but certain aspects might make you prefer one service to the other. Sam’s Club Photo offers same-day pickup on select products, some of which can be ready within an hour. This option applies mainly to calendar cards, posters, canvases and prints. Photo cards aren’t available for same-day pickup, but they can be purchased for next-day pickup, which is faster than many other services. Costco does not offer same-day orders, so it might not be the best choice if you need your cards in a hurry.","Costco has hundreds of themes and premade designs to choose from. Christmas is the only holiday it covers, but it has wedding-, party- and baby-themed cards. It also has two paper options: premium 120-pound cardstock and photo paper. The cardstock cards are double-sided, which is a nice touch. Costco includes envelopes with printed return addresses with its cardstock cards. Photo-paper cards come with foil-lined envelopes, which look classy. You must order at least 50 cards; it would be better if the service had a lower minimum-order requirement. Fifty photo-paper cards cost only $13.99 before tax, while an order of 50 cardstock cards costs $34.50.","Sam’s Club Photo has designs for many holidays, as well as graduation announcements, wedding announcements and save-the-date cards. Just like Costco, Sam’s Club Photo lets you choose between cardstock and photo-paper cards. The minimum order is 30 photo-paper cards for $10.50 or 25 cardstock cards for $17. This is much better than Costco’s minimum-order requirement. We found the service&#39;s online design interface intuitive, so you should be able to create your cards quickly. The cardstock cards are double-sided, with beautiful patterns and designs on the backsides. Like at Costco, photo-paper cards include lined envelopes. Cardstock cards don’t come with lined envelopes, but you can have the return address printed on the envelope flap.","<strong>Chatbook Photo Cards</strong>","The popular subscription photo book company <a href=\"https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=7a233b490633faabf15758a2356fb65a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fchatbooks.com%2F\">Chatbooks</a> also allows you to order and purchase photo cards. This service doesn’t cover as many holidays or offer as many features, so it didn’t really compare with the services we tested. However, it is still a great option for many people. You will find plenty of Christmas, birthday and New Year&#39;s cards, as well as wedding and party invitations, with this service. The designs are stylish and usually come in a variety of colors. Cards cost as little as $1 per card and come with free return address printed on the envelopes. Just like with its photo books, Chatbooks ships your photo card orders for free. You’re bound to save money using this service compared with many others on the market. However, note that the Chatbooks logo is printed on the back of the cards.","<strong>How Much Do Photo Cards Cost?</strong>","Photo cards can be expensive, but some companies offer inexpensive options or deals. Most companies require a minimum order of 10 to 25 cards. A pack of 25 cards on cardstock cost us between $18.75 and $73, depending on the company, before tax. Some companies allow you to purchase a minimum of one or two cards at a time, which can cost between $2.68 and $5 per card."]},"id":"da1227fd-3332-4478-ab77-186d68d36d72","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/mEBpHLY4JPhXrEm2R3o9pD.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/photo-card-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS81LzIvODA3NTkwL29yaWdpbmFsL1Bob3RvLUNhcmRzLVRlc3RpbmctMDAyLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mEBpHLY4JPhXrEm2R3o9pD.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"mEBpHLY4JPhXrEm2R3o9pD","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mEBpHLY4JPhXrEm2R3o9pD.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8904e4a8-b554-4da7-a7a9-2b4d300c8f10","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In addition to the number of cards, the final price is determined by the type of design, cut, paper and envelope you select and whether you choose to have the company stamp, address and ship your cards for you. Most companies charge $2.50 to $10 for shipping, and some can charge up to $10 in taxes. To get the best deal, be sure to use any coupons or specials the manufacturer is offering. During busy holiday seasons, you need to purchase your cards early to avoid paying additional money for expedited shipping. The printers will have plenty of orders coming in, which can make your cards take longer to process and ship.","To compare the prices of each service, we created a photo card, choosing the least expensive paper on each site. Without completing the purchase, we looked to see how many cards we could add to our cart without exceeding $35. The total price had to include shipping and tax. Because many services only let you order cards in packs – often packs of 15 to 25 – the number of cards we could purchase varied. Services that allowed us to purchase more cards with this amount of money scored higher in our testing.

With so many amateur and professional photographers out there, it’s hard to know what you should expect to pay for family photos. According to <a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-much-do-professional-family-portraits-cost.htm\">Angie’s List</a>, beginning photographers are more likely to charge $50 to $100 per session, while professional photographers charge between $350 and $500. Just remember that you get what you pay for. An amateur photographer may be cheaper, but the images they take might not come out as well. Also, keep in mind that established or elite photographers can charge anywhere from $500 to $10,000 for their services. Prices vary depending on where you want the session, how long you want the session to last and how busy photographers in your area are. For instance, getting pictures taken close to a busy season, like graduation, could raise the price because photographers will be more in demand. <br/><strong><br/>Why Do Family Photo Sessions Cost so Much?</strong>","It takes much more than the click of a shutter button to get beautiful family pictures. For one thing, photographers need professional-grade software and camera equipment, and these tools are not cheap. In fact, your photographer may still be paying off the camera, lenses, and lights that captured your favorite photos.","Also, after your 1-hour photo session, the photographer spends hours touching up your pictures on a computer to get the coloring and contrast just right. In total, your photographer will spend several hours working on your photos to create the finished product.","Finally, being a freelance photographer isn’t easy. These professionals have bills to pay and mouths to feed, regardless of whether they’re booked. We recommend you read this insightful article by <a href=\"https://www.pixsy.com/why-professional-photographers-are-so-expensive/\">Graham</a> to help you understand the costs.","That said, you still want to get a fair price. Shop around before settling on a photographer, and check how their previous work and pricing compare to their competitors&#39;.","<strong>Questions to Ask Your Photographer</strong>","To make sure you are satisfied with your pictures, you should ask plenty of questions before scheduling a session with a photographer. For example, you may want to ask the following questions:"]},"id":"4a8b055d-582a-475e-b7c7-d2ad3d3b3588","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["May I see a recent sample of your work? You may not like the photographer&#39;s style, and it’s best to find out if that&#39;s the case before you make an appointment. Fortunately, most photographers keep an online gallery or blog to showcase their work. Make sure your photographer has been keeping up their craft. Photography, like any other skill, must be maintained. It’s OK to ask when their photos were taken; the more recent, the better.","What does a photography session include? Knowing ahead of time exactly what your session covers and includes can prevent unpleasant surprises later on. For example, you’ll want to know how long a session lasts and how many final pictures you will receive.","How will I receive the pictures? Some artists post their work directly onto their website for you to download. Others give you a CD, DVD or USB drive. Most photographers are pretty flexible, so be sure to discuss the storage format with your photographer before the shoot so that you get your photos in your preferred format.","How much do you charge? Ah, the big question. You’ll definitely be happier if you know beforehand how much money you’ll be putting down. If you think the price is too much, politely ask the photographer to break down the costs. If you aren’t happy with the breakdown, look elsewhere. Just make sure you don’t burn that bridge; you might realize later that the photographer offers the best price.","Can you make the photos look like this? If there’s a specific style of photography you’d like to emulate, bring a sample to show your prospective photographer. Your idea may differ from what he or she was planning to do.

In 2013, Walmart shut down most of its in-store portrait studios, and Sears closed all of its studios. These closures make it harder to find an affordable in-store location near you. However, <a href=\"https://www.jcpportraits.com/portrait-offers-9?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl-r088OG3wIViuDICh1LpA9eEAAYASAAEgIAp_D_BwE\">JCPenney Portraits</a> is still alive, and a photo session costs roughly $50 to $100. Use the store locator to see where you can schedule your session. These department-store photo shoots are inexpensive because the companies usually don’t hire professional photographers, and the types of backgrounds and lighting are limited. You probably won’t be able to do outdoor photos, either. But if you’re looking for a nice family photo to add to your Christmas card (or other holiday cards), this is a great inexpensive option. In fact, in-store locations usually have holiday themes and backgrounds to match the look and sentiment of your card.","<strong>Addressing &amp; Mailing</strong><br/>","If you plan to send cards to a lot of people, consider finding a photo card service that allows you to print your return address and the recipients’ addresses directly on the cards. This costs extra, but it will save you time because you won’t have to write out the addresses by hand; once they arrive, all you have to do is stamp and mail them. Some services, like Shutterfly and Simply to Impress, even address and mail the cards for you (for an additional charge). Some photo card printing companies even let you create your own stamps, which add some flair for special occasions. Outside of busy seasons, such as the winter holidays and graduation, it usually takes only three to seven days for an order to be processed and printed. Allow for extra shipping time around major holidays.","Personalized Photo Cards for Every Occasion<br/>Many people use photo card services for Christmas cards, but these companies also have card designs for other holidays and events.
