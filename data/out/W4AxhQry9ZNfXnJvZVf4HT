With every purchase you make, you earn one point, which you can use toward a number of things. You also have the option to earn double points on certain purchases you make that are travel related, including hotel rooms and car rentals. You can even earn double points from purchases at restaurants in the United States.","This frequent flyer miles card falls short in the travel benefits area because it doesn&#39;t include many of the perks that are included with other travel rewards cards, like free bag check or in-flight purchase discounts. However, it offers you an annual airline allowance up to $100 that you can use on a number of flight incidental fees, such as baggage fees, legroom upgrades within the same seat class and in-flight purchases. Like the best airline credit cards, your travel plans won’t be hampered by blackout dates, and you can redeem points for international flights. Unlike many credit cards, this air miles card doesn&#39;t come with a sign-up bonus or an introductory offer.","When you use your card for certain purchases, you automatically receive some extra perks. For instance, you get travel accident insurance and rental car insurance when you use your card to buy a flight or rent a car, but lost luggage reimbursement isn&#39;t a benefit of this air miles card. Additionally, this card includes consumer coverage like extended product warranty, purchase protection and return protection.","The APR for purchases and balance transfers is higher than that of many of the other cards we reviewed at 17.24% to 22.24% Variable. For cash advance transactions, the APR is 25.24%. This card has a 27.24% penalty APR attached to it.","This card doesn’t offer an introductory annual fee, and it costs $75 a year. Aside from that fee, the other fees are in line with what you would expect from a credit card. If you use this card for cash advance transactions or to transfer a balance, a minimum charge of $5 or 3% is attached to each one of those transactions. Additionally, if you travel overseas and use this card for purchases, a 2.7% fee per transaction is tacked on to everything you buy.","American Express is known for its excellent customer service. You are able to contact the company for member support 24/7 by phone, and you can seek member support via its live chat function on its website. Additionally, you can reference a plethora of frequently asked questions on its website for many of the questions you may have about your account."]},"id":"6383d447-4b12-4135-b0d6-991e363b626e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"afd34a7c-4214-401f-ae0a-f418932a56ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Blue Sky Preferred® Card from American Express includes several nice features, including the Air Allowance and ability to earn double points on a variety of purchases.
