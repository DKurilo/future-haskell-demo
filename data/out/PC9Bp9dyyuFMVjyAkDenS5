It has a control panel on the top that has the basic options. The CST/berger 58-ILMXL gives you the option to display a vertical line, a horizontal line or both. This is perfect for setting up cabinets, laying tile and other layout work. The cross-line laser level comes with a tripod that will allow you to ensure that everything is perfectly even. The 30-foot range will offer a full 180-degree view of the laser. This means you can fill half a room with the laser crosshairs or a single laser. This helps move along projects much quicker.","The line laser level requires two AA batteries. It will last approximately 12 hours if you use both lasers. If you only use one laser, you can count on nearly double the battery life. This is about average for line laser levels."]},"id":"af5d6cd2-39a6-4753-b6a0-4a2e618825d0","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/oHbDLCtNDRaqXdsdrhCkzb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56558-cst-berger4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHbDLCtNDRaqXdsdrhCkzb.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"oHbDLCtNDRaqXdsdrhCkzb","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHbDLCtNDRaqXdsdrhCkzb.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5b57dbb1-bd06-4a72-ad0d-6e4429c4b00f","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This line laser level is covered by a one-year warranty.
