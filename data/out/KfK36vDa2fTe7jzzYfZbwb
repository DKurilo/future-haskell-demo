For edgers, we compared each model’s design, fuel type, weight, durability, power and unique qualities. ","<strong>How We Picked the Best </strong>","Our team of expert reviewers spent more than 100 hours researching and evaluating the best edgers available. We considered a wide selection of brands, models and designs and picked models that best fit specific needs, such as edgers for people with large yards and those who live in residential areas. The models we considered span a wide range of prices, so we also noted which models yield the most value for your dollar.","Our reviewers weighed the pros and cons of attributes such as weight, manner of propulsion, type of ignition, fuel and power requirements, ease-of-use, reliability, durability, and more. In the end, we concluded that the best edger for you depends on what you need it for. If you have a small yard or only need to do yard work occasionally, an inexpensive, low-powered edger is sufficient. On the other hand, if you need heavy-duty equipment for more intense tasks, you’ll want a gas-fueled edger with a powerful engine.","We named the Ariens 986103 as the overall best edger because it performs well and is the most durable and versatile machine we reviewed. It’s expensive and may be overkill for most users, but if you want the best of the best, this is it.","<strong>How Much Does an Edger Cost?</strong>","As with other yard tools, there is a big price difference between electric and gas edgers – when you buy a gas-powered edger, you pay more for its steel construction and extra power. However, you can cut a nice edge with either type of tool. Many electric edgers cost less than $100, while a good gas edger can cost $200 or more. You can spend more than $500, but there is no need pay that much for a solid edger. ","<strong>Weed Whacker vs. Edger: When to Use Which</strong>","It’s rather self-evident, but true: the best tool to use depends on the job you need to do.","Weed whackers can be used to trim grass around walls, posts, stumps and all kinds of obstacles. Many have a rotating head that also lets you comfortably edge your lawn. Trimmers are made to get in hard-to-reach places edgers aren’t designed to reach.","Edgers are designed for one job, and they do it better than any other tool can, including weed whackers. An edger’s vertical spinning blade is built to cut through all kinds of grass and even roots to create a straight, clean edge. Gas edgers, while more pricey, have all the power and heft needed to cut a near-perfect line. An edger can give your lawn a pristine, finished look, unlike any other tool can.","However, a weed whacker, also called a string trimmer, is more versatile than an edger. So if you can only afford one or the other, your best bet is probably a string trimmer.","<strong>Most Important Things to Consider When Buying an Edger</strong>  ","Design<br/>The first decision you have to make is if you want an edger you walk behind like a lawn mower or a stick model you hold like a weed eater. If maneuverability is important for you or you will only use your edger occasionally, a stick model is probably your best bet. The walk behind models are more precise and cover more area than the stick models, so they are an excellent choice if you need lots of power.","Weight<br/>The edgers we reviewed weigh as little as 13 pounds to as much as 65 pounds. The extra weight on the heavier models is usually due to the size of the engine and the machine’s body. Heavier models are harder to push and may wear you out quickly, and they are more difficult to maneuver. However, they also tend to me more powerful, durable and have more advanced features than simple, lightweight edgers.","Fuel Type<br/>When choosing between a gas, electric or battery-powered edgers, you should consider how far away from your house you plan to use it. Electric edgers rely on an extension cord for power, which is fine if you have a long extension cord or will be using it very close to your house. But if you need to use it farther out than an extension cord can reach, you’ll want a gas or battery-powered model. Battery-powered edgers are convenient because you can take them anywhere, but you’re limited by the life of the battery and how long it takes to recharge. Gas models are excellent for tough tasks that require a lot of power. The downside is that for some models, you have to mix gasoil and oil yourself to power it.","Power<br/>The amount of power you need depends on what jobs you plan to tackle with your edger. If you plan to regularly use the edger as part of a landscaping business, then you want the most powerful one you can get. For regular, suburban lawn maintenance, a medium-powered one would suffice. If your yard is exceptionally small, you don’t need much power at all. "]},"id":"0ce7ee1e-d478-4a1a-804c-f661477e7fab","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_96","url":"/best-edgers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
