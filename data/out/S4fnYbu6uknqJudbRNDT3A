The Kidde 442057 <a href=\"/best-mold-test-kits\">mold detection kit</a> allows you to quickly sample surfaces in your home for these types of toxic molds. Collecting samples is accomplished using adhesive strips or by collecting physical samples into bags. However, unlike other mold test kits, the Kidde mold detection kit is not designed to test your air quality.","With the Kidde 442057 mold testing kit, you can collect and send up to six mold samples for professional lab analysis. To collect mold using the included adhesive strips, you simply bring the strips into contact with the surface you want to sample. Then place the strips on the sample submission cards and send them off for analysis. The lab will be able to determine the exact kind of mold you have in your home.","If you would like to send in physical samples for analysis, such as a small piece of carpet or home furnishing fabric, you may bag samples no bigger than 2 x 2 x 0.5 inches. Results of tests on your mold samples are completed within three days of receipt at the laboratory and are sent to you via email or regular mail. You also have the option of viewing your test results on the Kidde website. Keep in mind Kidde applies a lab analysis fee beyond the cost of the test kit.","Customer support is helpful and friendly with a team of customer support representatives able and eager to answer any questions you may have. You may contact representatives via email or telephone. You will also find helpful FAQs available on the Kidde website."]},"id":"cbce9f32-cfda-4274-8171-3a9a8d75efb3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"35beaf63-1f41-4a3a-b11a-76452d26101b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kidde 442057 is a very capable mold detection kit, particularly if you are simply looking to analyze various surface samples or physical samples, such as carpet, wood, wall, etc. This mold detection kit is unable to test for air quality, so you won&#39;t be able to test your air for mold and bacteria.
