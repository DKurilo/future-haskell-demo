This connection enables same-day printing options and free shipping to the store. This <a href=\"/best-digital-photo-printing-services\">digital photo printing</a> site is well-designed and has an easy-to-navigate user interface. We are impressed with some of its offerings, including holiday gifts and prints, as well as the ability to print photos directly from your Facebook account.","This digital photo printing site has one of the best uploading services. The site lets you upload photos from your computer, Facebook or Instagram. You can arrange your photos from oldest to newest, newest to oldest and how recently the images were modified.","Once you have the images uploaded into your cart, you can do several things. First, you can perform edits, including rotating the image, adding an effect like black and white or sepia. If you have previously edited your images in a photo editor, such as Photoshop, then you can skip this step and move on to putting together a slideshow, ordering prints or creating photo gifts.","CVS photo gives you the option of viewing a slideshow of your images. This slideshow is very minimal in that the only thing you can control is whether or not the photo&#39;s title and upload date are showing. You cannot add music, choose the amount of time a photo displays or even put the slideshow on repeat.","The gift shop has a variety of gifts perfect for all occasions, including the everyday or the special. Some of our favorite print options and photo gifts include <a href=\"/best-photo-books\">photo books</a>, poster-sized prints, a wall clock and a wall tapestry option.","While we would all love to be prepared in advance for holidays and special occasions, it just doesn&#39;t happen sometimes. But that&#39;s OK because this digital photo printing service has an Express Pick Up option. Simply order select prints, collages, cards, calendars and photo books online and pick them up at your local CVS pharmacy the same day.","CVS Photo lets you easily order photos directly from your Facebook account. You then choose the size and quantity of your photos, which will update your shopping cart. Once you have all of your images in the shopping cart, simply enter in your CVS Photo store information for pickup. You can also download the CVS/Pharmacy app and order prints whenever you want.","Keep in mind that many of the photos on Facebook are low resolution. In order to post high-resolution photos on Facebook, you need to mark the High Quality button when making a new album. From then on any high resolution photos placed in that album will not be as heavily reduced.","The entire process – from uploading images for creating gifts, prints and slideshows to the ordering and checkout – is easy to figure out. The CVS Photo website is well designed, which makes navigation a breeze.","The CVS Photo Center help page offers all the standard support features, but it lacks a live chat option. A FAQs section is available and has well-written answers, but compared to the massive database of other online photo printing services, this page is easy to navigate and full of answers."]},"id":"e2fd1cec-06cc-4614-891d-1cbcc60d3894","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"193b6482-9ecc-49a1-9113-5fdb1cf437f8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We are quite pleased with CVS Photo.
