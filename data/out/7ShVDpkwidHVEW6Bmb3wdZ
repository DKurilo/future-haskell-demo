The original review is below, but check out our current lineup about <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","With a low tolerance, high quality and fast print speeds, the MBot Cube II 3D printer performs well in a competitive market. Printing multicolor objects is easy with the free software, and an LCD screen makes it easy for you to control your printer.","3D designs print quickly and efficiently in the MBot Cube II. Print speeds can reach up to 100 mm per second and resolution or layer height typically is between 0.1 and 0.3 mm, or the width of a single piece of paper.","ABS and PLA 3D printing materials are both supported by the MBot Cube II, and Magicfirm sells replacement 1.75 mm filament cartridges starting at $24 each, which is a great price. There is a dual-head version of this printer, so you can either print with one color or two at the same time.","This 40-pound metal and steel printer is based off the open-source design of the unaffiliated Replicator by MakerBot. It adds an LCD screen for easy navigation and access to modes and settings. If you like to build things, the MBot Cube II might not be the best option for you. There is no 3D printer kit you can assemble yourself; you can only order a pre-assembled version. If you want to print with ABS plastic, you&#39;ll need to purchase an additional heated platform, which isn&#39;t provided with the standard MBot Cube II.","During our 3D printing comparison, we&#39;ve found that dual or multiple connection methods make printing easier. The MBot Cube II has two methods: USB cable connection and a SD card slot for simple printing. You can even use any Windows, Mac or Linux computer to create, save and print your 3D print files.","Based in China, Magicfirm LLC offers many different support options for you and your 3D printer. U.S. email and international phone support are available on the website, and we found that representatives responded quicker and answered questions more thoroughly than some U.S.-based companies. There is some lead time, about two to three days, before the printer will ship, but this is again less than many U.S.-based companies. You can also access online tutorials, manuals, blogs, FAQs and forums for some extra community support if you have any questions about your printer. A one-year warranty covers the MBot Cube II from defects, one of the longest warranty periods we&#39;ve seen on a 3D printer.","Everything you need to get started is in the box: USB cable, power supply, maintenance tools and a sample filament cartridge. MBot Cube II recommends you download the ReplicatorG software from MakerBot, which you&#39;ll need to do own your own, but the good news is that it&#39;s free.Â "]},"id":"6bd3bc3e-07c1-4123-a480-9db863984063","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f2c4d100-3f19-4277-85fd-b384b2d09113","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In the world of 3D printing, connectivity is important.
