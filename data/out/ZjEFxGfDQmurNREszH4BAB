You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Garmin Astro 320 bundle is one of the most expensive <a href=\"/best-pet-tracking-devices\">pet tracking</a> systems available, but it is rugged and works efficiently. It comes in a bundle with the Astro 320 and a T5 dog device, as well as other extras.","The Astro 320 hand-held GPS locator weighs 9.2 ounces with the batteries, a bit more than the 6.5-ounce <a href=\"/roameo-review\">RoamEO</a>. The Astro 320 display screen has a diagonal measurement of 2.6 inches. It is recommended that two AA lithium or NiMH batteries, which are not included, are used to power the device, and they should last for 20 hours. The water rating of the Astro 320 is IPX7, which means it withstands exposure to rain, snow or immersion in water up to 3 feet deep for no longer than 30 minutes. Features include a USB interface with a large font, a 1.7GB memory, a barometric altimeter and an electronic compass. You can install a base map and other maps on the device.","Unlike the single-unit <a href=\"/petrack-review\">PeTrack</a>, this Garmin pet tracker bundle is ideal for packs of dogs, whether you&#39;re hunting, farming, hiking or living in a rural area on a large unfenced property, because it can track up to 10 dogs at the same time for a distance of up to nine miles. The display on the 320 is customizable and shows the dog&#39;s name, location, status and direction of travel.","The T5 dog device with LED beacons comes with a one-inch pet tracking collar strap, charging clip, AC adapter, vehicle power cable and manual. This pet GPS tracker can be immersed in water with the equivalent pressure of up to 32 feet, so your dog can wear it for swimming, bathing and wading through water. A signal is transmitted every five seconds by the T5 to the Astro 320, letting you track in real time. The T5 and antenna weigh 9.3 ounces, and the rechargeable lithium-ion battery has a life of 20 to 40 hours. It features a rescue or battery-saving mode that is handy when dogs get lost or wander away.","Extras included in the Astro 320 bundle include four different length antennas for the Astro and the T5, a belt clip, charging clip, USB cable, AC adapter, vehicle charging adapter and an owner&#39;s manual. The antennas mean that even when the dog is in a heavily wooded area or deep in a canyon, you&#39;ll still be able to track your animal.","The Astro 320 and T5 work on GPS technology, and you don&#39;t need to be within range of a cellular network. This GPS tracker for dogs is worth investigating, thanks its relatively lightweight and adequate range."]},"id":"34f9b14e-806e-4be9-bd8d-b64fd01cce62","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62786","url":"/garmin-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T00:10:58Z","datePublished":"2015-02-18T00:10:58Z","name":"Garmin Astro 320","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-18T00:10:58Z","id":"ZjEFxGfDQmurNREszH4BAB","meta":{"title":"Garmin Astro 320 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Get the information you require about the Garmin Astro 320 and T5 dog device, which combined form a GPS pet tracking system.
