Sure, smartphones generally come with a warranty, but you can&#39;t get free repairs for having butter fingers. A recent study by independent tech gadget warranty provider SquareTrade revealed that Americans have spent nearly $11 billion on iPhone repairs since the phone was first released.

Details such as port and button covers are taken into account to prevent loose debris like dirt or sand from invading. A raised edge around your phone&#39;s face means a drop is less likely to result in a broken screen. A rubber backing can keep your phone from sliding across your car&#39;s dash. These cases seem to be tailor-made to fit your phone like a second skin. And because phones are so similar in size, these cases may even work for another smartphone you have. Speck, Urban Armor Gear and OtterBox are a few examples of iPhone case makers that consider every bit of your phone worth protecting.","<strong>Rigorous Testing</strong><br/>You can find military-grade iPhone cases that have gone through tough testing. A phone with one of these tactical iPhone cases must be dropped from a height of 48 inches and land on its back, sides, corners and face in tests, all without damage to its screen. These tests, created by the United States Department of Defense, ensure phones covered by these burly cases meet military-grade protection standards.
