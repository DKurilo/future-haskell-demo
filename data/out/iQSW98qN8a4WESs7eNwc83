For instance, the Unplugged mode is best for acoustic or jazz music, while the studio-mix setting is ideal for pop music. Stereo mode only outputs sound from the front speakers and the subwoofer, but it still fills your room with clear, full sound despite only using two channels.","As for movies, the surround sound can handle nearly every sound effect, whether it&#39;s an explosion, gunfire or even low-level detail like leaves blowing in the breeze. This is because the system has a wide frequency response range, greater than any other HTIB system, covering sounds from 25 Hz all the way up to 50 kHz. To put this into context, a double bass reaches lows around 41 Hz and a soprano can sing notes up to 1,050 Hz. The subwoofer, which weighs 21 pounds and has a 10-inch driver, is also impressive and provides deep, well-defined bass.
