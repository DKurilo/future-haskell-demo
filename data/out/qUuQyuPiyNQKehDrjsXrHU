The Liebherr CS 2062 is a four-door refrigerator with a depth of just 36 inches. It is considered a counter-depth fridge because it is flush with your cabinetry. The CS 2062 has a total capacity of 19.4 cubic feet, which is the smallest capacity of the fridges we looked at. The fresh food compartment is 13.4 cubic feet, and the two freezer drawers share the 6 cubic feet of capacity.","In the fresh food compartment, you have three shelves, two crisper bins, a full-length deli drawer and seven door storage bins. The fresh food compartment shelves  are full length and are less adaptable than the split shelving that is common in many of the other refrigerators we reviewed. To accommodate tall items you may have to remove a shelf. Also, the shelves lack a spill-proof protection layer, though they are easy to clean. You can even clean the shelves in the dishwasher. Neither the crisper bins nor the deli drawer are customizable, so you can&#39;t change the humidity or temperature in any of the bins. One of Liebherr&#39;s other french door refrigerators in this series does have humidity-controlled drawers, but it lacks a deli drawer.","You can find the control panel for the Liebherr fridge on the frame of the fresh food compartment. From the digital control panel, you can change the temperature of the fresh food section and each of the two freezer drawers. In most cases, the second drawer is a refrigerated compartment used for snacks or as an extra produce bin. However, the CS 2062 is a unique four-door french door refrigerator in that the top drawer is another freezer compartment. This fridge has electronic touch controls, so you use the images as guides for where to touch, but because it lacks buttons, the control panel is easy to clean. Because the control panel is on the inside of the fridge, you have to open both doors to access it. It would be much easier if the control panel were on the outside of the fridge, but because this fridge lacks a water and ice dispenser, there is no practical way to put the control panel on the door."]},"id":"b75c63a4-9338-4d3c-8af8-00f3949dd514","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9c24e5fd-57c7-45d4-8e88-2f393ab8ccd7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The digitally controlled temperature and the electronic touch controls are nice, but having to open the doors to fix a temperature issue seems counterintuitive. The lack of an ice and water dispenser on the front is also an inconvenience. The full-length deli drawer is nice as is the extra freezer drawer with separate temperature controls. This is not a bad french door refrigerator.
