Instead of paying a monthly premium, you pay an annual membership fee and get discounts on eye exams, lenses and contacts. If you want better benefits, <a href=\"/vision-service-plan-review\">VSP</a> and <a href=\"/eyemed-review\">EyeMed</a> are traditional vision insurers and have frame allowances and exam copays.","A one-year membership costs $30, and a family membership is $45. Contrast this with other insurance plans, some of which cost nearly $30 a month, and the savings potential is obvious. You pay an average of $2.50 a month for an individual EyeBenefits membership, which makes it one of the most affordable options we looked at.","The flip side to being so affordable is its benefits are weaker than other insurers’. Most insurers have copays that significantly reduce the cost of an eye exam as well as allowances on frames and contact lenses. EyeBenefits is different, offering discounts on exams, frames, contacts and lenses. On exams, you get between 10 percent and 20 percent off the usual cost. A typical exam costs between $128 and $200, so you’ll save around $12 to $20 and be on the hook for more than $100. Most visions insurers have copays, which means they cover most of the exam cost and you only pay around $15. EyeBenefits’ benefits on lenses, frames and contacts are similar, around 10 percent to 30 percent of the cost.","When compared with other vision insurers, EyeBenefits may have an affordable membership fee, but you end up paying more in the long run for exams and corrective gear than you’ll save on premium costs.","EyeBenefits can be used at over 12,000 providers’ offices. There is a tool on its website that helps you find nearby eye doctors. EyeBenefits often works at retail locations like Walmart, Target and others. At some of these locations, you can get additional discounts. Because this is a discount program, there are no out-of-network benefits."]},"id":"93704558-a33e-41bb-b2ee-b59578c6aa4a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62706","url":"/eyebenefits-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T20:39:49Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T20:39:49Z","name":"EyeBenefits","synopsis":"EyeBenefits is a vision discount program that may be an affordable alternative to vision insurance.
