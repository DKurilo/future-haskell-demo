You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","JBL is a subsidiary of Harman International and has been in the business of manufacturing loudspeakers and other related audio equipment for decades. The company is split into two parts. One part focuses on professional-grade equipment and the other focuses on us as consumers. This renowned company knows how to make great audio equipment, and the JBL Studio 180 is a decent example of what JBL is capable of for those on a budget. In fact, this <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">floor standing speaker</a> is one of the least expensive we have reviewed.","Despite the smaller price tag, that doesn&#39;t affect the audio quality that the JBL Studio 180 is capable of producing. The frequency range is a little less than we would like, but JBL only sacrificed the additional range for accuracy and balance. It could have stretched the drivers to go beyond the 45 Hz to 22 kHz that they are tuned for, but it would have taken a toll on the sound quality. Even with the reduced range, the floor standing speaker still reaches the ultrasonic frequencies that we like to have.","The low range isn&#39;t as big of a concern because you can always pair these floor standing speakers with a sub woofer. A sub woofer will do a far better job of handling the bass frequencies, and it would keep the system from cutting needed power to the tweeters just to achieve the deepest bass tones. It also allows for higher output, in this case 89 dB at 8 ohms of impedance.","Each channel needs at least 15 watts to run, but you may pump up to 200 watts into each speaker if you want. The JBL Studio 180 floor standing speakers have crossovers set in between the three drivers. The low-frequency driver takes care of everything from 45 Hz to 800 Hz, at which point the crossover starts sending the audio to the midrange. The midrange covers 800 Hz to 3,200 Hz where the other crossover is set. At the 3200 Hz point, the rest of the audio is sent to the tweeters.","That leaves quite a bit for the tweeters, since they can reach as high as 22,000 Hz, but again, the heaviest load falls between roughly 25 Hz and 4,000 Hz. We say that because this is the frequency range of a piano. Violins can go as high as 10 Hz, but that high is not typically a consistent theme in most music and therefore is not a huge concern.","The drivers making all this possible start with a 6.5-inch driver for low frequencies and is made with a PolyPlas cone. The midrange driver is 4-inches in diameter and made with PolyPlas. The 1-inch tweeter mixes things up a bit with CMMD Lite. CMMD is short for ceramic metal matrix diaphragm and can be found in other similar loudspeakers."]},"id":"70ecaf80-e301-4462-b291-f5817ab9a164","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"119dd871-c05e-4881-930f-5c3bd4749a95","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ported design of the JBL Studio 180 allows for high-quality audio reproduction.
