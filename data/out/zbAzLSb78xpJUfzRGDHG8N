You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Camp Chef’s Triton Portable Water Heater allows you to take a hot shower anywhere, at any time. The portable unit simply needs to be hooked up to a garden hose, and it will produce up to 1 1/2 gallons of hot water per minute. The portable <a href=\"/best-water-heaters\">water heater</a> is ideal for rinsing off your kids after a day at the beach, spraying down your pets, or just treating yourself with a hot shower after camping.","At 15 pounds, the Triton 5L Water Heater is light enough to carry. The heat and water flow is adjustable, since the heaters have flame and flow control. The unit’s portable 8-foot hose has four shower settings: jet, shower, mist and off. When water is turned on, the heating unit automatically activates. The brass connector should be compatible with any basic garden hose, and you can attach the regulator hose to a bulk propane tank. You need to pick up a couple of D batteries to power the unit, though.","Once turned on, the portable water heater runs for 20 minutes. At that point, a safety feature will kick off the power. You can still turn it back on again once it turns off, but the feature is designed to preserve water, limit energy usage and act as a safety mechanism.","An electric water heater requires electricity, which can be difficult to track down while on the move. A gas water heater can offer you more flexibility. A single standard LP tank can get you about 11 hours of use, depending on temperature. You can get higher temperatures out of your water heater by limiting water flow. The more water flowing through, the lower the temperature, since there’s a greater volume for the heater to handle.","The Camp Chef Triton is a convenient option if you’re looking for a quick, hot water hookup. The unit is small and light enough that you should be able to put it in the back of your car and take it with you about anywhere, which is helpful for getting the mud off pets or kids before they hop in the back seat."]},"id":"a182fe3c-e34e-49e6-8c5f-f80b757d8c60","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62020","url":"/camp-chef-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T21:02:21Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T21:02:21Z","name":"Camp Chef Triton 5L Portable Water Heater","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits our criteria.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits our criteria.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-30T21:02:21Z","id":"zbAzLSb78xpJUfzRGDHG8N","meta":{"title":"Camp Chef Triton 5L Portable Water Heater Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Camp Chef&#039;s Triton is a portable water heater for getting the mud off of your kids or taking a quick shower while camping.
