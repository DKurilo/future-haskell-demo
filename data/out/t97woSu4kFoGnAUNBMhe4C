It takes four hours to charge, but only lasts 17 minutes before needing to be placed back on its charging base. We liked how easy it was to clean the dust cup, which clicks off and on with a button on the top of the stick.","The Navigator Freestyle is one of the better stick vacuums for cleaning carpet, especially heavier materials. In our carpet test, it only took four passes to sweep up all the debris. It also did well on hardwood, requiring only five passes before the floor was spotless. For pet hair, it had trouble removing remaining strands that clung more tightly to the carpet while our top pick, the <a href=\"/hoover-linx-review\">Hoover LiNX Cordless</a>, did a much better job with pet hair. The Freestyle’s cleaning path is a wide 10 inches, which covers a lot of ground.","This cordless stick vacuum beat out many competitors in terms of overall cleaning performance, but it lacks convenient features. For instance, it doesn’t have a removable hand vacuum for cleaning tight areas or vacuuming your car, and there aren’t any extra attachments like a crevice tool or dusting brush. It’s not your best choice for cleaning upholstery.","This vacuum is also fairly heavy. At 9 pounds, it’s definitely not a bulky full-size vacuum, but it&#39;s still harder to maneuver than lighter stick vacs. One unique feature is its dust bin. Cleanup is bagless, and the bin is large. At 1.2 liters, it’s one of the largest of all the cordless vacuums we tested. This means you’ll have to empty the dust cup half as much as the lighter vacuums."]},"id":"369b8b21-12cb-4018-a044-c20b9de85bdf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a8e3761f-b011-42b7-85a6-f8c9c6e56855","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Shark Navigator Freestyle is one of the best stick vacuums at precision and power and is a good choice if you’re looking to completely replace your full-size vacuum.
