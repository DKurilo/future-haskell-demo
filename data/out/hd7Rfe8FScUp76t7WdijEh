We&#39;ve tested numerous software applications to recommend only the best software for your business. You can learn more about inventory software by reading these <a href=\"/money\">articles</a>.","<strong>Most Efficient Inventory Software</strong>","The inventory tracking software that was easiest to learn and use, had the most pleasing user interface experience, and was 100 percent accurate when updating inventory levels after sales orders were finalized was TradeGecko. This program lets you import products manually, from a CSV file or via your eCommerce solution. You can also use a barcode scanner and input lot or serial numbers.","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/tradegecko/\">TradeGecko</a> can also manage partial orders, and it exports your data in a CSV file or directly to QuickBooks or Xero. This inventory tracking system works well for companies selling products and services online. However, since it does not have a standalone POS system to sync with, it is not necessarily the best option for retailers with a physical store.","<strong>Recommendation: Most Efficient Inventory Software Application – TradeGecko</strong>","<strong>Best for Warehouses</strong>","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/fishbowl/\">Fishbowl</a> is an excellent choice for companies with multiple warehouse locations. This inventory tracking program lets you monitor everything inside each warehouse, including the movements of stock between locations.","This application is particular about inventory management: You must include serial numbers in purchase and sales orders. This is designed to ensure accuracy and organization, though it adds some time and extra work when you are ordering or reordering the ingredients, parts or items that comprise your products.","Fishbowl is easy to use and highly accurate in keeping track of your inventory, including parts and pieces. It is one of the few programs we evaluated that can help you prepare a bill of materials, which is essential if you have multiple warehouses.","<strong>Recommendation: Best Application for Warehouses – Fishbowl</strong>","<strong>Best for Brick-and-Mortar Stores</strong>","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/odoo/\">Odoo</a> is a comprehensive inventory tracking system that you can customize according to the needs of your business. At its most basic level, Odoo tracks your stock. You can add apps to track sales, purchases and several other aspects of your business.","It has a proprietary point-of-sale system, making it ideal for brick-and-mortar stores. You can easily add inventory with barcode scanning, or you can import products using a CSV file. You can also integrate it with eCommerce solutions for greater efficiency.","<strong>Recommendation: Best Application for Brick-and-Mortar Stores – Odoo</strong>","<strong>Best for Easy Product Importing</strong>","For easy product importing, we suggest <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/stitchlabs/\">Stitch</a>. With this software application, you can import products using a barcode scanner, via a CSV file or through your online sales channels. You can also manually add products one at a time, if you&#39;d prefer to enter your inventory that way.","Stitch earned high scores for its user interface, and it accurately updates inventory levels after each sale. This software is easy to use; learning how to fully utilize this application would not take a lot of time out of your busy work schedule.","<strong>Recommendation: Best Application for Product Importing – Stitch</strong>","<strong>Best for Budget</strong>","If you want a budget-friendly inventory tracking solution, your most economical option is a program you buy outright instead of one you subscribe to, such as a Software as a Service (SaaS) app. The least expensive of the downloadable software is <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/inventoria/\">Inventoria</a>.","While it doesn&#39;t offer all of the features of some of the higher-ranked programs, it is still accurate and easy to use. It doesn&#39;t integrate with eCommerce platforms directly, but it can still be useful for brick-and-mortar stores. You can also enter changes manually to update your inventory with this solution.","<strong>Recommendation: Best Budget Friendly Inventory Application – Inventoria</strong>"]},"id":"678b9d38-fc4e-4822-8735-2410191b70dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"What We Tested, What We Found"},"id":"149ee9c9-3527-4062-81e0-b74a26cf4ed4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We want to be sure we recommend only the best inventory software to you.

This score demonstrates how easy the software is to use, the quality of the user interface experience and the accuracy of the inventory following each sale. We started with an initial list of 35 applications, but removed software that reported inaccurate inventory and that offer a specific feature set we looked for in our review. We have only recommended products that we know work. The solutions in our lineup vary with respect to the user interface and ease of use. Generally speaking, SaaS programs have a better interface than downloadable software.  ","<strong>Product Importing Score</strong>","A major step of using inventory software is importing inventory and adding new products. We ran in-house tests to create proprietary scores to show you what programs had the easiest processes for importing your products. The score included support of barcode scanners, the ability to import through a CSV file or an eCommerce solution and other considerations.","Since part of the point of buying inventory software is to let you focus on other, more pressing parts of your business, having a solution that is easy to use and quick to set up is important. Stitch and TradeGecko are the two programs on our lineup that provide the easiest means for importing your inventory.","<strong>Our Verdict &amp; Recommendations</strong>","The best inventory tracking software for you depends on the needs of your business. For a warehouse business, you might want to try Fishbowl, though this solution also works with other types of businesses as well. inFlow is a good choice with a comprehensive feature set and software that is easy to figure out and get used to. TradeGecko is especially useful for product importing and has the best user interface in the industry. Odoo can integrate with various aspects of your business, and Inventoria is best if you&#39;re looking for a budget friendly solution."]},"id":"7ccd68a6-6468-4583-b4b1-f0ee1c0cbcd8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"afd9a8b1-6e1b-4f23-8b56-c9c1a2d6328b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Fishbowl</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">inFlow</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">TradeGecko</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Contalog</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Odoo</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Goods Order Inventory</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Stitch</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-4435218-10839094-1289860279000\">Inventoria</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Inventory Tracker Plus</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/manufacturing/inventory-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Inventory Pro</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"90fdc2e3-7799-40c6-9ca7-7afb4d2a6519","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_774","url":"/best-inventory-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jill-bowers","url":"/author/jill-bowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jill Bowers","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"KJXqSAfoZVwZUiak4mZNTD","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-01-27T21:21:39Z","datePublished":"2016-11-03T16:27:02Z","name":"Inventory Software Review","synopsis":"Inventory software can help you keep track of the products you have in house and notify you of low stock levels.
