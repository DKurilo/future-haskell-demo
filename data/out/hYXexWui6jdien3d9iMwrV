It has five fast Ethernet ports: one for the internet connection and four for attaching local area network devices. Support for the IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi standard allows devices that conform to previous Wi-Fi standards – 802.11g and 802.1b – to connect to and use the wireless router. The 802.11n technology supports a theoretical speed of 300 Mbps.","Security begins with a firewall that protects against hackers with Stateful Packet Inspection, a technology that can identify network traffic that displays malicious intentions. In order to support wireless client devices previous to 802.11n, the router supports Wireless Equivalent Privacy encryption. It also supports Wi-Fi Protected Access, which is state of the art for encryption. However, the AirStation HighPower N300 doesn’t yet support the new IEEE 802.11ac standard, so it may not be your best bet if you own tons of brand-new Wi-Fi capable devices, or wish to enjoy the speeds that can potentially accompany that standard.","In support of telecommuters who connect wirelessly to corporate networks through their router at home, this <a href=\"/best-wireless-routers\">wireless n router</a> supports VPN pass through, a VPN &#34;lite&#34; that requires VPN software on the client machine.","The installation wizard for Windows users makes it easy to get started. For advanced configuration work, there is a web interface. To attach and secure client devices to the router, the product supports Wi-Fi Protected Setup.","The Buffalo website hosts a user forum and knowledge base and contains documentation, software downloads and drivers. The product includes a three-year limited warranty.","The Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 Wireless Router is an affordable way to create a high-speed wireless network in your home. With a theoretical speed of 300Mbps, it will keep up with your web surfing, emailing, music streaming and social media activities. The speed supports simultaneous users. Wireless coverage is excellent because the Buffalo has a strong signal strength that covers quite a range. Competitors usually offer a one-year warranty. Some offer two years. Buffalo provides a three-year warranty, which is far more than the usual warranty in the wireless router industry."]},"id":"0078349e-0895-4f38-9c41-bb985d67b6b7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49924","url":"/buffalo-wireless-n-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-30T21:26:21Z","datePublished":"2010-06-30T21:26:21Z","name":"Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300","synopsis":"The Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 is a wireless router that’s budget-friendly and supportive of telecommuters.","review":{"rating":46,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 is a wireless router that’s budget-friendly and supportive of telecommuters.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-06-30T21:26:21Z","id":"hYXexWui6jdien3d9iMwrV","meta":{"title":"Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 wireless router is fast, provides a strong signal and has the best warranty of any competitor."},"products":[{"slug":"buffalo-airstation-highpower-n300","url":"/product/buffalo-airstation-highpower-n300","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","name":"Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","id":"e6uERv67CsmBbfbXhx3mjm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/r3qihPn9yPa8VJh68hYmyn.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","mimeType":"","name":"49896-buffalo-wireless-n150-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/49896-buffalo-wireless-n150-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","id":"r3qihPn9yPa8VJh68hYmyn","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r3qihPn9yPa8VJh68hYmyn.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 wireless router is fast, provides a strong signal and has the best warranty of any competitor."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/r3qihPn9yPa8VJh68hYmyn.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","mimeType":"","name":"49896-buffalo-wireless-n150-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/49896-buffalo-wireless-n150-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","id":"r3qihPn9yPa8VJh68hYmyn","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r3qihPn9yPa8VJh68hYmyn.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Buffalo AirStation HighPower N300 wireless router is fast, provides a strong signal and has the best warranty of any competitor."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/buffalo-wireless-n-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"home-networking","url":"/electronics/home-networking","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","name":"Home Networking","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:30Z","id":"cFxfUv9HyySUrpfbUtRtDM","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
