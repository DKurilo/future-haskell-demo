Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Color’s <a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA test</a> is the best option if you’re concerned about hereditary cancers. This company tests 30 different genes to identify any cancer risks that you might have. Though the company specifically targets women and helps identify risks for breast cancer, Color also offers tests for men. Unlike the other fitness and health-based DNA tests we researched, Color doesn’t offer diet or fitness guidelines and only focuses on hereditary cancer risk.","This company charges $249 for its tests, which includes complimentary genetic counseling – as much as you request or need. Like <a href=\"/fitnessgenes-review\">FitnessGenes</a>, Color requires you to fill a plastic vial with saliva instead of using a cheek swab. Once you return your DNA sample to the company, you’ll receive your results online in three to four weeks.","Color tests for many common hereditary cancers, but it makes sure to point out that genetic factors only account for 10 to 15 percent of cancers. Furthermore, just because you have a hereditary risk of a certain cancer or disease doesn’t mean you will contract that disease. The largest benefit of getting tested using Color, then, is the included genetic counseling to help you understand your results and know if you need to approach your doctor to ask for further testing.","If you’ve taken a DNA test through another company and have DNA results, you can send those in to Color so they can gain additional insight into your genetic makeup. However, even if you’ve tested with another company, you will still have to send a saliva sample to Color so they can run their own DNA tests.","If you have questions or concerns about your order, you can search Color’s FAQs or call or email to get answers to your questions. If you have genetic-related questions, you can send an email to Color and a genetic counselor will answer you.","For people who know or fear they are at risk for hereditary cancer and disease, Color offers excellent service and provides great counseling resources to help you understand your DNA. This company isn’t designed for just the casual DNA enthusiast or for the curious, though. It is tightly focused on hereditary cancers. If you’re more interested in getting general health information from your DNA, we recommend <a href=\"/dna-fit-review\">DNA Fit</a>, the best health and fitness DNA testing company we researched."]},"id":"84275060-24c0-4593-a7a8-be52c1c0fc27","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69632","url":"/color-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-09-26T20:35:33Z","datePublished":"2017-09-26T20:35:33Z","name":"Color Genomics","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","id":"bhovy2bGgwtwaW3TveFh9M","meta":{"title":"Color Genomics DNA Test Kit Review - How It Works and What I Found","description":"For people at risk for hereditary cancer and disease, Color offers excellent service and provides great DNA counseling resources."},"products":[{"slug":"color-genomics","url":"/product/color-genomics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","name":"Color Genomics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","id":"kiKsLJcTbnZsLiDXxTZ6oB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/CmKZoQy8qdEnBzKNAt9NAh.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","mimeType":"","name":"14ec1c603f950da0d5ba9855e48216f3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/14ec1c603f950da0d5ba9855e48216f3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","id":"CmKZoQy8qdEnBzKNAt9NAh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CmKZoQy8qdEnBzKNAt9NAh.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Color Genomics DNA Test Kit Review - How It Works and What I Found","description":"For people at risk for hereditary cancer and disease, Color offers excellent service and provides great DNA counseling resources."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/CmKZoQy8qdEnBzKNAt9NAh.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","mimeType":"","name":"14ec1c603f950da0d5ba9855e48216f3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/14ec1c603f950da0d5ba9855e48216f3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","id":"CmKZoQy8qdEnBzKNAt9NAh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CmKZoQy8qdEnBzKNAt9NAh.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Color Genomics DNA Test Kit Review - How It Works and What I Found","description":"For people at risk for hereditary cancer and disease, Color offers excellent service and provides great DNA counseling resources."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/color-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"genealogy","url":"/hobbies/genealogy","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","name":"Genealogy","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:57Z","id":"PuNCGX8PqZvk7d7PyEvJ9P","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
