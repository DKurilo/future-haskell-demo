This 15-degree sleeping bag has a 650-fill power down and a heat-retaining design. Active Junky tested sleeping bags on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado, and they declared the women’s version of this bag their favorite for backpacking or car camping.","What most impressed the female testers at Active Junky was how well it held its heat. They were surprised by this in particular because the bag itself is so roomy. The Kazoo offers a wider hip area to accommodate the female shape but narrows at the feet and shoulders to help keep warmth in. The hood cinch design was among the best Active Junky tested, giving a comfortable breathing space while protecting the rest of the head. One issue they had, however, was with the zipper snagging. This flaw has been noted in customer reviews as well.","This lightweight sleeping bag does not compress as well as those with higher fill power, but it nonetheless fits into a 9-inch by 17-inch bag, and even the largest version weighs less than three pounds. This makes it a good choice both for car camping and for backpacking trips.","This 15-degree down sleeping bag comes with a lifetime warranty. It has four sizes, so you can find the one to best fit you whether you are just over five feet tall or just under six-foot-six. It’s a strong choice where warmth is key.","<strong>Tester Comment: </strong>The overall warmth was a surprise in a bag clearly built for room in the hips.  The hood surprised as the best-cinching design to be able to push to the lower end of the rated range.<br/><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Warmth<br/><strong>Best For:</strong> Spring and fall camping as well as backpacking.<br/><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>From the baffles to the shape, everything about this sleeping bag is designed for warmth. While not the most compressible of bags, it is nonetheless a lightweight sleeping bag that truly works as a three-season sleeping bag."]},"id":"979f3eea-9121-4372-84f0-75c2a3ac802f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68162","url":"/the-north-face-blue-kazoo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:57:46Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:57:46Z","name":"The North Face Blue Kazoo","synopsis":"If your backpacking season stretches from early spring to late fall, the TNF Kazoo is a good choice for a three-season sleeping bag that keeps you toasty in temperatures well below freezing.
