The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use. Top Ten Reviews does not endorse piracy or any other illegal activity.</em>","WinX DVD Copy Pro makes an appearance in our review of the best <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD burning software</a> because it’s simple to use, makes a good quality copy, and it allows you to archive your DVD collection and even burn new copies of your movies without the original disc. However, the omission of a critical copying tool kept this program out of award-winning territory.","One of the most important features of any DVD burning application is the ability to bypass the copy encryptions found on commercial discs. These protections are meant to guard against illegal piracy but have the side effect of preventing you from making personal copies of the movies you’ve already paid for. WinX DVD Copy has an integrated decrypter that circumvents these protections so you can back up your DVD library.","Once you’ve begun the burning process, it takes about 45 minutes to make a complete copy of a full-length feature DVD. However, this software only has the ability to make exact copies of DVD content. The best DVD burner programs have the ability to compress movies so they fit onto smaller-capacity blank discs. If you have smaller-capacity discs, this program allows you to copy only the uncompressed main feature; if it will fit.","This program also allows you to burn a new copy of a disc without the need for the original. You can do this by using the program to rip a DVD’s ISO file (sometimes called an ISO image) to your computer’s hard drive. An ISO file is essentially the blueprint for a DVD. It works the exact same way a physical DVD does; it will play in the software application and most common media players. Once this file is on your computer, you can burn it to a new blank disc whenever you wish."]},"id":"a8c1dd7b-d102-4315-81cf-b625bd1e2be4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aa886db3-aefb-4e71-bf72-ae08ca5ae3c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["WinX DVD Copy Pro is a good DVD burner program.
