You can back up files on any USB external hard drive with the appropriate capacity, for example. You will generally need a backup drive with twice as much space as you have on your computer.","<strong>The Software Alternative</strong>","There s a lot more to backing up your computer than copying your Documents, Music and Pictures directories. If you don&#39;t want to go through the process of manually backing up your computer on an external drive, invest in <a href=\"/money/small-business\">data backup software</a> that will do the hard work for you. There are several flexible options that will back up your files, preserve file organization, and create a drive image backup that can act as a boot disk. The best data backup software for your situation will vary depending on your personal needs and the size of your computer. The choices are diverse enough to include something for everyone.","<strong>Back Up Your Files in a Few Simple Steps</strong>","The actual process of backing up your files is as simple as following a few prompts. When you connect an external drive to your computer, it will ask you if you want to use the drive as a backup disk. Follow this series of prompts to quickly back up your files. The prompts are similar for both a Mac and PC backup.","Backup software will guide you through the process of creating a computer backup as well. You may need to consider which files to back up and how often you want new backups created.","<strong>Repeat Regularly and Restore as Needed</strong>","A computer backup is only as good as your backup schedule. Whether you use an external hard drive or backup software, you&#39;ll probably find that your computer has a default schedule for creating backups. Check the settings to make sure it happens regularly. Perform a manual backup yourself any time you make significant changes to your computer. With your computer backup in place, you can easily restore older files and settings as needed.","A computer backup is essential if you want to protect your data. Many experts even recommend maintaining two or three backups to protect yourself from a major catastrophe. With so many simple options available, there&#39;s no excuse for ignoring this essential task."]},"id":"78fd2385-658f-4521-9a03-99eb5efb6af6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9328","url":"/how-to-back-up-your-computer","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-08T20:37:50Z","datePublished":"2015-04-08T20:37:50Z","name":"How to Back up Your Computer","synopsis":"Imagine losing every personal document, work file, family photo in one catastrophic swoop.
