The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-robot-vacuums\">Robot Vacuums</a> here.</em>","The Infinuvo CleanMate QQ2 Basic robot vacuum is a useful device that sweeps and vacuums for you. This cleaner has a rolling brush that agitates debris, freeing it so its suction can lift the dirt away. It is great for use on hard-surface flooring and low-pile carpeting, but it does not work well on tall rugs or high-pile carpeting.","The Infinuvo is equipped with five different cleaning patterns, including the special bounce, which is a random movement that makes the machine bounces off your walls. The spiral pattern is good for spot cleaning, and in the along-wall mode, the machine runs parallel to your floorboards. There is also an S-shaped mode, in which the cleaner travels in a methodical back-and-forth movement, and a polygonal spiral mode, in which the cleaner follows a polygonal pattern. By the time this robot vacuum cleaner has followed its repetitive movements, it is quite unlikely there will be any dirt, crumbs or hair left behind on your floors.","This vacuum robot has a unique ultraviolet light located on its underside. The small, tube-shaped light generates ozone, which deodorizes and kills bacteria. This results in an ultra-clean surface. The unit even has a built-in slot for inserting a small fragrance card to help your rooms smell fresh after a cleaning.","This vacuum cleaner is easy to use. You can select the days and times you want it to run using the scheduled cleaning feature. It even has a remote control for giving it commands. You can set the length of the clean time anywhere from 10 minutes to just over an hour.","Unfortunately, this robotic vacuum cleaner does not have virtual walls or boundary markers, which are standard features with the best robot vacuums. As a result, it basically goes anywhere it in your home unless you use physical barriers or shut doors. It does have sensors that detect sharp drop-offs like stairs, though.","This round cleaner is 14 inches in diameter and weighs 7 pounds, so you can easily carry it up and down stairs. It is 3.5 inches tall, so it can clean the dust under your bed.","You get a one-year warranty with this cleaner. The company offers a toll-free number in case you want to speak with a customer service agent. You can also contact representatives by email, browse FAQs on the manufacturer&#39;s website, watch an informative video and check the user manual to learn more about your robot vacuum."]},"id":"2f88cf32-8ba4-4b89-a272-9e855e91f523","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b02e2466-486a-480d-b2f5-eef5b6c6f667","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Infinuvo CleanMate QQ2 Basic has features you don&#39;t find in other cleaners, like an ultraviolet light that disinfects your floors.
