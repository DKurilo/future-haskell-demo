The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 </em><em><a href=\"/best-programmable-thermostats\">Programmable Thermostat</a> products</em><em>.</em>","Honeywell has been on the forefront of programmable thermostats technology for years. One of their best thermostats is the VisionPRO 8000. The VisionPRO has a large, backlit screen and is made for simple installation and programming. With armchair programming, you can take the thermostat off the wall and program it. This thermostat cannot be programmed from the phone and isn&#39;t Wi-Fi ready, but it is by far one of the easiest smart thermostats to use.","Programming the VisionPRO 8000 is so simple, you can do it from the comfort of your couch. Honeywell has made it so you can take it off the wall, allowing you to sit on the couch and program the thermostat instead of standing near the wall. When you initially set a schedule, each day is listed on the top of the screen so you can just select each individual day instead of pressing back. This makes it easy to change schedules should you need to later on. Most thermostats require that you go through a few different screens before you arrive at the schedule, but the VisionPRO lets you select the day from the home screen.","VisionPRO has one-touch override built in so you can cancel any schedules you have programmed. Then there&#39;s a changeover mode, making it easy to cancel a schedule just for the day. It is also equipped with temperature limits to prevent the thermostat from running the heater or air conditioning too long.","Since this digital thermostat does have armchair programming and you can detach the interface and take it anywhere in the house with you, it has battery backup and is hardwired as well. The large, 10-inch touchscreen is backlit and all the functions are large enough so you don&#39;t accidentally push two buttons at once.","Honeywell claims that this requires professional installation, but there is an installation manual and videos so you can do it yourself. Of course, you will need your own level as there is not one built into this home thermostat. This really is not a setback as most devices in life you install will require a separate level.","The VisionPRO works on multistage heating and cooling (3 stages of heating and 2 for cooling). This is more than enough for any heating and cooling system, since most are 2H/1C systems. It also has some of the standard features you will find with any programmable thermostat. There is a hold/vacation feature and air filter change reminders. It isn&#39;t Wi-Fi compatible so it doesn&#39;t display outside temperature or humidity readings. It does, however, have a programmable fan feature for ventilating your home when you aren&#39;t running the AC or heater.","Since this is a Honeywell thermostat, the VisionPRO has a five-year warranty. It also comes with installation and programming documents. The Honeywell website also features many FAQs from other consumers concerning anything from thermostats to air conditioning units and videos to help you with your thermostat."]},"id":"7d41a145-cb62-4f27-a0b0-2687d80a2dfd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dc592d06-f2c9-48ba-872a-1b0a38a8ea2b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The VisionPRO 8000 earns its place among our top 10 programmable thermostats.
