We’ve done extensive online research, as noted above, and contacted professionals and industry insiders to get opinions about the best travel insurance agencies available. Posing as people looking to insure their travel, we contacted customer support representatives at each agency. The agencies had no input or influence over our testing methodology, nor was the methodology provided to any of them in more detail than is available by reading our reviews online. Results of our evaluations were not provided to the companies in advance of publication.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To test travel insurance, we simulated the same type of vacation plans for each company and compared cost and coverage for each company. Since most people purchase trip insurance to recover costs, we looked at various travel scenarios with an upfront investment of $5,000 or more. We gathered quotes for two adults for a U.S.-based cruise, a French vacation and a high-adventure Antarctic vacation. Since age and state of residency affect quote rates, we varied the state and age, looking at three groups in each category.","Once we collected the quote information, we then calculated a score based on the coverage, the services available in the plan and the plan&#39;s cost. As you&#39;ll see in our reviews, rates and payouts vary. The payouts we listed are possible payouts and may not be the same numbers you see in your policy. We also looked at the process to file claims. When filing a claim, all trip insurance companies require a certain amount of paperwork. Some companies require more documentation than others. Some let you submit your claim online; others require it to be mailed or faxed.","<strong>What Protection Does Travel Insurance Provide?</strong>","Travel insurance provides financial compensation for canceled travel plans, emergency medical assistance, lost luggage and trip delay reimbursements. Other services include emergency medical evacuation, translation services, prescription medicine replacements and rental car insurance. If you experience significant delays on your trip, you may be able to recoup some food and hotel expenses resulting from delays beyond your control.","We compared several trip insurance plans that provide U.S. and international travel benefits. Some offer packages specifically created for cruises and high adventure vacations. Many travel insurance companies offer individual trip plans, as well as yearly, group, family and business plans. Most plans offer group and family plans, but some also cover children without adding to the cost of the premium. If you travel frequently for business, you may want to investigate business or yearly plans.","<strong>Trip Cancellations</strong><br/>Our research revealed that the most common reason travelers purchase trip insurance is to protect themselves from losing money when a trip with a large, prepaid investment is canceled. Such trips often have an upfront cost of $5,000 or more, such as all-inclusive cruises, resort packages or package deals.","For an additional premium fee, many travel insurance companies can help recoup part of your upfront costs should you have to cancel your trip for any reason, even if those reasons are within your control. For the most part, the types of expenses that trip cancellation insurance companies cover are nonrefundable expenses. If your airline tickets, for example, are refundable, you will not be able to recoup the costs. But if you must cancel a costly cruise a week before leaving the dock because you suffered a major medical problem, one that is not pre-existing, chances are your upfront costs will be covered.","<strong>Medical Emergencies</strong><br/>The second reason consumers purchase travel insurance is to help cover the costs of a medical emergency that might happen abroad that their stateside health insurance doesn&#39;t cover. Medical assistance often includes consultation with a U.S.-based doctor. Some plans offer pre-existing condition waivers, but most do not. Most offer medical evacuations if you need to be moved from a remote location to a city with a larger hospital. And some plans will pay to have a friend or family member flown to you if you are hospitalized."]},"id":"600f916e-f0a9-404b-ba8b-374e3d4e88db","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"1bae1da0-bd11-4585-b27e-8d5ddb25a819","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.generalitravelinsurance.com?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_campaign=Top_Ten_Reviews&utm_medium=website\">Generali Global Assistance</a>","<a href=\"http://www.travelsafe.com/\">TravelSafe</a>","<a href=\"http://www.travelinsure.com/index-b-No-Auto-Slide.html\">USI Affinity</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7873003-13064122\">Seven Corners</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7873003-10941966\">Allianz Global Assistance</a>","<a href=\"https://www.mhross.com/\">TripAssure</a>","<a href=\"http://www.insureandgo.com/\">InsureandGo</a>","<a href=\"http://www.travelinsured.com/\">Travel Insured International</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8900250-11485723?sid=TTRTravelInsurance\">Travelex Insurance Services</a>","<a href=\"http://www.aig.com/individuals_3171_411333.html\">AIG Travel Guard</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a9f49691-a6ff-4624-a6b5-1aeb93d5413e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_670","url":"/best-travel-insurance","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-06T17:37:17Z","datePublished":"2015-08-10T20:22:14Z","name":"Best Travel Insurance","synopsis":"The best travel insurance plan provides trip cancellation protection, emergency medical assistance and luggage protection to help make your trips less stressful.","review":{},"strapline":"The best travel insurance plan provides trip cancellation protection, emergency medical assistance and luggage protection to help make your trips less stressful.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","id":"AcfrnFHG9C7kMoCJ9xDw94","meta":{"title":"Best Travel Insurance 2019 -
