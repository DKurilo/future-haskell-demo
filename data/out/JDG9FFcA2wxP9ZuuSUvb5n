This service provides service that can be useful for many small business owners. While this service is rich in features and has an excellent call network, we found ordering service and finding the right plan to be an arduous process.","VOIP.com offers one small business plan with four different levels of pricing. You can choose from a two-year, one-year, month-to-month and yearly pre-paid plan where you pay the total sum up front and save an average of $5 per month. It is always useful to have options in pricing. If you do not want to get locked into a long-term contract, month-to-month is a great option; while on the other hand, if you are sure that this is the plan for you, you can choose a one- or two-year contract and save your company money.","The World Plan has many of the features of the residential plans. It includes a free second line and free calling to the U.S. and Canada; you also have the option to keep your old phone number if your previous provider allows you to export it. Unfortunately, the World Plan does not offer unlimited calling but provides 1200 minutes per month that you can use to call over 55 countries. This equals twenty hours of international calling. If your needs do not exceed this limit, VOIP.com could be a decent choice for your international calling needs. However, if you need an unlimited international calling plan, <a href=\"/phone-power-review\">Phone Power</a> and <a href=\"/broadvoice-review\">Broadvoice</a> are both great options.","This service is strong in call quality. Making an international call is easy with this service, and the setup is a simple process. You even have the option of downloading a softphone to your desktop without being charged an extra fee. This is a great perk since most services charge an average of $10 a month for a softphone option.","We also found many of the features that we looked for in international call services and features found in our top-ranked plans. These include conference calling, call waiting and fully functional mobile apps.","Where the international plans provided by VOIP.com fall short is in help and support. When we tested the live chat, we received attention in less than average wait time, but we found the support unhelpful. We spent over an hour trying to get a simple question resolved and were transferred back and forth between agents multiple times. Email support has been reliable and helpful; we received replies within one business day."]},"id":"4766afed-f04b-4b88-aaa3-ca33c94fc764","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"152329a7-ad87-4734-91e7-e4de63de0930","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, we found VOIP.com to be a reliable service.
