It can power three lights at once or charge your electronic equipment. It has a portable lantern and provides 15 hours of bright light on a single charge. At about 5 pounds, the portable solar generator is small enough to take camping, and it&#39;s made specifically for lighting rural areas.","This solar power kit comes with several components. The solar panel is flat with orange edges about the size of a piece of paper. Each accessory is also highlighted in orange and can be attached with a wire. There are two hanging lamps, a lantern and two wall switches for controlling the level of brightness you prefer. For charging small items like your cellphone or laptop, there is also a USB cord that comes with separate attachments depending on your power needs. It’s versatile. If you need it for lighting a small shed, everything in the d.light D20 will be useful. If you simply need it for camping and don’t want it to take up a lot of space in your pack, you could take the solar panel and leave the lights at home.","This is a 5-watt panel, which is quite a low wattage. Lights require little power so it’s a good kit if that’s all you need it for. It also comes with a 6-meter cable and six adaptors. If your goal is running other electronic items or charging, though, you should expect a long wait. The good news is that the compact battery can also be charged with an AC charger, so you can fully charge it prior to your excursion and let the sun take care of it along the way.","With a two-year warranty, this is a good portable power generator for home use and will give you piece of mind in an emergency, such as a power outage. It’s a bit limited in its capabilities on the road, though isn’t heavy and won’t take up a lot of space. The added accessories give you several power options and the adjustable light levels and wall switches are a distinct addition."]},"id":"11c7097d-c7d7-497a-b978-2f22208efbc6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61704","url":"/d-light-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:26:51Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:26:51Z","name":"d.light D20","synopsis":"The d.light D20 solar home system kit is an upgradable solar system for your home or small office.
