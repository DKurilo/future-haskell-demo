Its small size and variety of available colors make it especially popular with the younger set, as it&#39;s available in six bright colors: Limelight, Pink Glow, Jet Black, Purple Twilight, Silver Moon and Blue Comet.","The OneTouch UltraMini meter weighs just 1.4 ounces, and it measures 4.25 inches by 1.26 inches by 0.67 inches, so it easily fits into pockets, purses and school pencil cases. The glucose test strips for the UltraMini work with six other OneTouch models, which offers optimal versatility. You can use a more elaborate model at home and still be able to take advantage of the UltraMini&#39;s portability when you&#39;re on the go. This meter&#39;s test strips do require coding for each new vial.","When looking at the basic features of this glucometer, it does manage to fit everything needed into this small package. It requires a very small blood sample of 1 microliter, and alternative testing locations include the palm and forearm in addition to the standard fingertip test site. It can read levels from 20 to 600 mg/dL, and it offers speedy results in just five seconds or less.","This OneTouch glucose meter makes it easy to keep track of your blood glucose readings, as it holds up to 500 test results in its internal memory. A single CR2032 battery powers this unit for six to 12 months or more, depending on how many times you test each day.","Online you can find video and text tutorials that take you through the setup and use of this glucose meter. The company provides resources for meal planning, fitness and test tracking, and it also offers information on glucose meters and the best way to use the information gathered. A handy logbook is available for free download as well.","The OneTouch UltraMini meter is compatible with the OneTouch Diabetes Management Software. It&#39;s Windows compatible and free to download, but you will need to buy a OneTouch USB data cable to attach your OneTouch glucose meter to your computer.","The OneTouch UltraMini meter is easy to use and even easier to carry due to its small rectangular shape. However, it does require coding. In addition, the free software is only available for Windows operating systems. Since it uses glucose test strips that are versatile enough to use with any OneTouch meter, the UltraMini a good option if you own and use multiple meters. Itâ€™s also available in a variety of bright colors, making it a good choice for children."]},"id":"d7d572bb-b087-4df1-9b01-21dafbe5472c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60908","url":"/onetouch-ultramini-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:52:54Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:52:54Z","name":"OneTouch UltraMini Meter","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
