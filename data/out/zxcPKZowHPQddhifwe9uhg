It makes an appearance in our review of the best <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a> because it&#39;s easy to use and is one of the fastest copiers on our side-by-side comparison chart.","There are two main options for copying a DVD with this program: compressed and uncompressed. Most commercial discs are burned on what are known as DVD-9s, which have 9GBs of storage. However, the most common blank discs only have 5GBs of storage, known as DVD-5s. This program has the ability to condense the content from a DVD-9 so it fits onto a DVD-5. However, this option drastically reduces the quality of your movie. In our tests, the compression produced by this product is far inferior to the rest of the products in our lineup. If you’re looking for a high-quality compression, this is not the product to choose.","It takes about 30 minutes to make a compressed copy of a feature film DVD. If you are using a blank DVD-9, you can make an exact copy in about 40 minutes. This represents one of the fastest copy times of the DVD copy programs we reviewed.  Only one other program outperformed Magic DVD Copier in this respect.","One of the things kept this program out of the top tier of our lineup of the best DVD copy software was the fact that it has no tools that let you save a disc’s ISO file to your hard drive or burn a new disc from an ISO file that may already be on your computer. An ISO file is the blueprint of a disc that contains the movie as well as menus, audio tracks, and navigation information. The best DVD copiers can rip an ISO file to your computer and even create a new copy of your disc without the need for the original."]},"id":"13b56ff4-63be-4069-9d4a-812db2a3986b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d297d626-4702-4d4d-a2ec-e5af4cb678a3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Magic DVD Copier is a middling choice for DVD copy software.
