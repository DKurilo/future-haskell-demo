If you already have lyrics, consider them when writing your melody. Some questions to ask yourself before composing the music are: What words do I want to focus on? Are there note lengths or timing that will accommodate certain words better than others will?","Consider the following line: I DROVE my CAR down the HIGHWAY. The emphasized words DROVE, CAR and HIGHWAY give the listener an idea of what is going on, even if these are the only words they hear. On the other hand, if you sing the same line but emphasize different words: I drove MY car DOWN THE highway. The listener might have no idea what you&#39;re singing about.","You can emphasize words with a louder note, changing the note itself, a longer note or including a rest before or after the note. Experiment with your song and see what sounds the best."]},"id":"b56fab63-9591-4ccc-a303-a23ba3c3fb11","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<b>Listen to and Learn from Other Composers</b><br/>There is something to be learned from every single musician or band out there. Listen to how your favorite musicians construct their songs examine the style, the tone, how different instruments work together and so on and so forth. You can implement many of the same ideas into your own music or even take some of their riffs and tweak them to fit your style. This is a great way to come up with new melodies."]},"id":"5ada4c61-c847-43d5-bf42-9d6df9e8e7c4","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<b>Use Music Composition Software</b><br/>Music composition software can be a musician&#39;s best friend.

Inspiration comes from all around us: our emotions, relationships, nature, people and experiences some songs are even about surreal situations. A big part of finding inspiration is putting yourself in situations that rouse inspiration and then recognize it when it comes.","We all have different people come into our lives; relationships have always been hot topic for songwriters. To generate other ideas get out of the house, go somewhere, and do something. This could even be something as simple as walking in the park or down the street. You&#39;ll be amazed where inspiration can be found."]},"id":"d3c34746-e50d-4014-b5f3-ce21b2dd58ff","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<b>Have Fun</b><br/>You first started writing music because you love music.
