It uses two AA batteries to power a single white light and a separate red light. The white light can output up to an impressive 200 lumens, and the beam produced is wide, so you can illuminate a large area and easily spot road hazards. The red light LED makes reading maps easy because your eyes adjust easily between the red beam and the dark.","You can choose from four brightness levels to save on battery life or maximize visibility, depending on your needs. At low power, this running headlamp produces light for up to 140 hours, so you can go on long runs without having to stop frequently and change the batteries. Because this unit uses AA batteries instead of the smaller and lighter AAA batteries or built-in rechargeable batteries, the Fenix HL30 is heavier than many other comparable headlamps. However, AA batteries are extremely common, so they are easy to find when you need replacements.","Digital technology inside this running headlight regulates the brightness so everything stays consistent. A circuit inside the lamp stores the brightness level when you turn off the headlamp, so you don&#39;t need to cycle through all of the modes each time you turn it on. A two-button switch makes changing brightness levels easy. The headlamp rotates 180 degrees, so you can aim the beam where you need it. One thing this model lacks is a safety light that alerts others on the road where you are. The buttons on top can be difficult to operate, especially if you are wearing gloves.","The stretchy band is comfortable, while the over-head strap adds extra stability and holds the running head torch in place when you&#39;re running over uneven terrain. Both the around-the-head strap and the over-head strap are adjustable for a good fit. A water resistance rating of IPX-6 keeps this running headlamp operating in inclement weather.","The Fenix HL30 headlamp offers stable performance in adverse conditions and has many lighting options, making it a great option for trail runners who encounter different running conditions."]},"id":"396e8960-9cbf-4176-b472-c95f8aca41b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62541","url":"/fenix-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:44:33Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:44:33Z","name":"Fenix HL30 LED","synopsis":"The Fenix HL30 headlamp is a worthwhile addition to your night running gear collection because it has four brightness levels and a rotatable design.
