The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-binoculars\"><em>binoculars here</em></a><em>.</em>","The Spirit XF is one of Vanguard’s best binoculars. It has many great features to recommend it, but there are some concerning features that the manufacturers chose not to include as part of the information about the model.","These are not rangefinder binoculars (which display the distance between you and an object), but the magnification is strong enough at 10x42mm that you will be able to see a lot of detail even from a long distance. The best birding binoculars have decent magnification and a strong field of view, and the linear field of view of the Spirit XF is 111, enough to display a wide scope and still get in close enough to see specific features of birds or other animals.","The Vanguard website does not clearly list all of the Spirit XF&#39;s optics and viewing specifications. Details on light width and minimum distance are missing, among others, which makes it a challenge to compare them with competing products.","The build and design of the Spirit XF is excellent. It is adaptable to a tripod, and Vanguard has several tripod selections available for different environments and lengths. The binoculars are also waterproof, which will come in handy if you plan to take them on water activities such as boating and whale watching. Polycarbonate housing protects the binoculars, along with rubber armor, which will ease your hands when you have to grip the binoculars for long periods. Lens caps are included in the set, and the binoculars are made to be eyeglass-wearer friendly. A nitrogen-filled build also protects the binoculars from fogging up during extreme weather conditions.","Portability is also great for the Spirit XF. A carrying strap with an adjustable loop is included with the binoculars. A case is also included, and it is not heavy enough to be an added burden or hard enough to harm whatever else you might be carrying in a suitcase or backpack on a trip. The weight of the binoculars is pretty light at 665 grams, and that is probably due in part to its polycarbonate housing. The binoculars are very small, which will work well for you if you do not want a conspicuous or clunky pair.","The help and support from Vanguard is particularly strong in terms of the company’s website. Even though it sometimes lacks specific numbers when describing a pair of binoculars’ optics, there is some excellent information on the site. The anatomy of a pair of binoculars is explained with pictures and diagrams, and there are instructional videos if you learn better from a live-action demonstration.","A help line is available during business hours, and email support is also offered. A lifetime warranty is provided on all Vanguard binoculars, including the Spirit XF. However, be careful in reading the warranty’s terms, because certain conditions will make it difficult to get the binoculars replaced. You&#39;ll have to demonstrate that it was the binoculars’ make, and not a user accident, that caused the damage. And with new binoculars always being made, models can go out of circulation pretty quickly."]},"id":"5512c605-4830-41d5-930a-13e6b0d8ff57","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"93b33d29-3726-442e-ba6f-853c16d3cddc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Spirit XF has a solid build and is easy to carry.
