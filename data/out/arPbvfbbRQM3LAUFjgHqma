Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LG brand has made a name for itself in the electronics industry in recent years, and its line of <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TVs</a> has landed one of the top three spots in our comparison of the best LED-backlit TVs. The model we reviewed, the LG Infinia 55LW6500, offers a 55-inch screen with a great contrast ratio, an above-average refresh rate and an impressively thin display panel. Almost every one of the specifications of this LED TV is above the norm, and it&#39;s visible in the picture quality.","The picture that the LG Infinia 55LW6500 produces looks almost too good; we often caught ourselves thinking that the picture looked a bit too real while we were testing the set, as if the action wasn&#39;t authentic because it looked too good. Ironically, that may be one of the only things that we could construe to be a con for this line of LG LED TVs.","LG has been in business for decades, but the company has only recently made an entrance into the global market. Operating primarily out of South Korea in its beginning years, LG entered the public eye as a plastics manufacturer. As its business expanded, it established GoldStar Co., Ltd., which later merged with the Lak-Hui plastics division to become LG.","The company has only competed seriously in the Western electronics market since the late &#39;90s, but competitors have felt its impact. With the performance of this LED TV, it&#39;s clear that LG is committed to manufacturing quality products and ousting its western competitors."]},"id":"77d7f323-9a62-42b7-9555-dfc6af134036","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"2a4de540-c33f-4fd4-a863-9365a6c9affe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/uDngpinTueMvBQtWNu7iZG.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The LG Infinia 55LW6500&#39;s display matches the standards of the industry at 55 inches. If your tastes favor a more expensive set, TVs in the Infinia line are available up to 65 inches wide. Compound these amazing screen sizes with the local dimming and 3D capabilities that the LG brand is known for, and you have an exceptional value for the price. The local dimming that the LG Infinia boasts allows your TV set to dim certain areas of the screen by adjusting the brightness of the LED panel that sits behind the LCD screen. This greatly increases the contrast that your TV is capable of, since – with the advances in local dimming technology – almost each individual pixel on the screen can be dimmed or brightened beyond its normal abilities by using the LED backlighting technology.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/53562-lg-infinia-55lw65004.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDngpinTueMvBQtWNu7iZG.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"uDngpinTueMvBQtWNu7iZG","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDngpinTueMvBQtWNu7iZG.jpg","alt":""},"id":"14261185-2634-40a9-99b9-334943e83598","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If 3D is something you&#39;re looking for, the LG Infinia will perform well for you with all of your favorite 3D Blu-rays.
