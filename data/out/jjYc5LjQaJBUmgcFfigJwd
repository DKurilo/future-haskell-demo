Four key things really make GoPhoto stand out among the competition. ","The first is the flat-rate shipping. No matter how much stuff you send them, it’s $20, round trip. You print out a UPS label when you open your order, and they subsidize any shipping fees over the set amount. The second is that you don’t have to organize your media at all in order to send it to GoPhoto. You can even send whole photo albums or slide carousels, and they’ll carefully remove your photos and slides, scan them and replace them in the same order. The third thing is their payment structure. Most photo scanning services require you to pay about 50 percent upfront, but you don’t have to pay GoPhoto until you’ve seen your scans. You can then choose to keep or delete any of them, and you only pay for the scans you keep. The last little touch that GoPhoto throws in is a free, unlimited online library. This is great for organizing your photos, keeping a backup and sharing images on social media. GoPhoto also offers add-ons like rush service, extra copies of your photo scan DVD, home movie conversion and Pro options if you’d like TIFF formatted files or higher resolution scans.

We then researched each service individually, ranking them based on price, available services, add-on options, turnaround times, ease of use and other factors.

A cheap photo scanner costs $40 or you can purchase a high-end scanner for around $500. However, scanning photos is a laborious project, especially if you have a large library of memories to get through. Not only does scanning photos take a lot of time when you&#39;re scanning one to eight at a time, but you must crop each photo then go back and edit any irregularities, such as dust from the scanner. If you don&#39;t have time for photo scanning as a part-time hobby, then a photo scanning service is the best option. These services do all the work for you: the scanning, cropping and editing. They even have expert technicians to help restore damaged photos and old, faded photos. You can get your entire photo library scanned and returned to you in a few weeks.","<strong>Choosing a Photo Scanning Service</strong>","Over time, photos, slides and negatives deteriorate. It’s a limitation of that analog technology. Digital files, however, have no such limitation. Scanning photos by hand is a time-consuming project, so thankfully there are services that can do it for you so that you can preserve your memories and save yourself some time. When you’re choosing a service, these are the things you should keep in mind:","Type of Media<br/>Most of the photo scanning services we researched can do more than just scan printed photos. Many offer negative and slide scanning as well. Some have home movie conversion services to transfer film or VHS tapes into a digital format. When looking into the best fit for you, make sure the service can cover all your media types.","Resolution<br/>Different photo scanning services offer different choices for the resolutions of your scans. This is usually measured in dpi, or dots per inch. Depending on why you’re scanning your photos, you may only need lower resolution copies, but if you plan to print, crop or enlarge your photos, you’ll want higher resolution scans.","Photo Restoration<br/>The best services lightly touch up your photos when they scan them to fix some fading or correct some colors, but some photos may require a bit more intensive attention. Many photo scanning services also offer digital restoration services to repair images that may have had a run in with mold or water damage.","<strong>Things to Consider When Choosing a Photo Scanning Service</strong>","If you’ve decided that now is the time to finally scan and digitize all the photos you’ve been holding onto for years, here are a few things to think about when choosing a service:","<em>You Pay for Shipping: </em>You’ll need to ship your photos, negatives and film to the company. This costs from $10 to $20, depending on the company and how quickly you want to send and receive your photos. Shipping options vary from company to company, and some work with UPS to provide shipping materials.","<em>Think Local:</em> Depending on where you live, there’s likely a local shop or two that can scan, digitize and restore you photos. You’ll save money on shipping and may also be able to get smaller jobs done – many online photo scanning services have order minimums you need to reach.

Most companies charge an hourly rate for retouching, though some minor work may be available at lower prices. It can also take several weeks to complete the work. Even if you have your own scanner, you may still want to pay for retouching because it requires expertise and software you may not have access too."]},"id":"dcfdfd65-1c18-49e7-bcf3-3afb39004047","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_237","url":"/best-photo-scanning-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-24T22:34:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-24T22:34:00Z","name":"Best Photo Scanning Services of 2019","synopsis":"Many photo labs offer services to convert film and VHS to DVD, scan slides and negatives and restore old, printed photos: here are some of the best.","review":{},"strapline":"Many photo labs offer services to convert film and VHS to DVD, scan slides and negatives and restore old, printed photos: here are some of the best.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-24T19:19:14Z","id":"jjYc5LjQaJBUmgcFfigJwd","meta":{"title":"Best Photo Scanning Services 2019 - Digitize Film, Photos and Videos","description":"Many photo labs offer services to convert film and VHS to DVD, scan slides and negatives and restore old, printed photos: here are some of the best."},"products":[{"slug":"gophoto","url":"/product/gophoto","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","name":"GoPhoto","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"sVyPnQAzZVRU8r6j4MuHEk","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"scancafe","url":"/product/scancafe","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","name":"ScanCafe","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"gnfUDvLePm37iLWCvUe7QZ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"scanmyphotos","url":"/product/scanmyphotos","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","name":"ScanMyPhotos","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"PcKPperi2uPYPRuv2zUK64","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"digital-memories","url":"/product/digital-memories","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","name":"Digital Memories","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"UGvGdSCiEjoEXgca54QxbW","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"scandigital","url":"/product/scandigital","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","name":"ScanDigital","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"eumXxpcKcipAiLGXyQsmZk","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ad6ro99qYJCGvUcMT89Va8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Photo-Scanning-Services-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/9/G/789604/original/Hero-Photo-Scanning-Services-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"ad6ro99qYJCGvUcMT89Va8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ad6ro99qYJCGvUcMT89Va8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Photo Scanning Services of 2019","description":"Many photo labs offer services to convert film and VHS to DVD, scan slides and negatives and restore old, printed photos: here are some of the best."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ad6ro99qYJCGvUcMT89Va8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Photo-Scanning-Services-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/9/G/789604/original/Hero-Photo-Scanning-Services-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"ad6ro99qYJCGvUcMT89Va8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ad6ro99qYJCGvUcMT89Va8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Photo Scanning Services of 2019","description":"Many photo labs offer services to convert film and VHS to DVD, scan slides and negatives and restore old, printed photos: here are some of the best."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"photo-printing","url":"/hobbies/photo-printing","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","name":"Photo Printing","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:03Z","id":"z8PD3S7mzqALyx6pv6h2Pi","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
