That is evidenced by the more than 500 included loops and sounds from various genres just waiting for you to combine them in unique ways. This product is going to feel like a playground if you are the creative type.","It will be a lot more fun to use if you have experience. Sequel 3 can do most of the things we want it to, but it makes those operations more difficult than other applications do. For instance, some audio editing software has high-shelf and low-pass tools to make it really easy to filter out frequencies above or below a designated point. With Sequel, you can get the same effect, but you have to do it manually, going through many more steps.","Also, it is missing some of the features we think you would like, including cross-fading, a white noise tool, a harmonizer and a few others. It also lacks batch processing, which is a way to convert a set of files from one format to another or to apply effects to multiple files at the same time.","We are relatively impressed with the Steinberg Sequel 3 interface. Other audio editor interfaces can be a bit more intuitive than this software&#39;s, but once you get the hang of this one, it is pretty convenient.","We are not really sure why, but Steinberg makes it difficult to download this application, although that is an acceptable quirk. What is less acceptable is the fact that the Steinberg site is somewhat confusing to navigate. The company seems to hide the help section. Once you find it, you can get a pretty good response to email queries, though. We waited about 24 hours or so, which is not bad at all.","Steinberg makes up for some of its limited customer support by offering a truly helpful digital user manual. It&#39;s searchable, comprehensive and contains internal links to related topics within the manual on different pages."]},"id":"f116761e-8cd9-4ad0-9095-98a563442475","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c3af964c-86de-4745-8936-035d9c9d0d3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This software has so many sounds for forming your musical masterpiece, which is great for people with a lot of mixing experience.
