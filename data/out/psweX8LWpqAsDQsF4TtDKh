You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","There was a time when you could only find an infrared thermometer in industrial kitchens and professional culinary businesses. Now these remote <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">meat thermometers</a> are working their way into home kitchens. These non-contact thermometers are perfect for helping you to refine your culinary skills by providing temperature data previously unavailable in the home.","The Maverick LT-02 is an infrared surface thermometer. It helps you to take the guesswork out of many imprecise temperature readings in the kitchen and on the grill. When you turn a stovetop too High or Medium-High, how hot is your pan getting? When you&#39;re lighting the charcoals on your grill, when is it ready for cooking?  The Maverick LT-02 provides these answers. It works in a point-and-shoot manner. You point the thermometer at a surface, pull the trigger, and the infrared beam takes a temperature reading in four second. This is ideal for checking the temperature of pouching liquids, grills, ovens and cooktop pans.","There is a large and bright display on the Maverick LT-02. This makes reading the temperature data simple. The display also includes a backlight, making it useable in the dark. The Maverick LT-02 has a MAX function. When you take a reading with the thermometer, the maximum temperature reading will appear below the main temperature reading. You can continue scanning the surface area for other temperatures, and if you find a new high temperature that will replace the maximum temperature readout. This is ideal for getting a specific reading.","The temperature range for the Maverick LT-02 is five feet. There is a single laser sight to help you guide the invisible infrared beam to get precise readings. This remote meat thermometer has a measureable temperature range of -58 to 1,022 degrees Fahrenheit, more than enough for measuring the heat of a cup of coffee, a pizza stone or a broiling pan.","The Maverick LT-02 takes two AA batteries. There is a battery display on the LCD screen, and the battery housing is easily accessible. This makes replacing batteries easy and economic.","The Maverick LT-02, like all infrared thermometers, only measures the surface temperature of items. This means that while using an infrared thermometer will improve your cooking, it doesn&#39;t test the doneness of meat as thoroughly as a probe thermometer that can read a meat&#39;s inner temperature.","The use of a remote meat thermometer, like the Maverick LT-02 infrared thermometer, will open up many new opportunities in your home kitchen. It will help you to refine how you use every day cooking appliances like your stovetop and oven, as well as increase your grilling prowess by providing you with accurate surface temperature readings."]},"id":"845fdb4e-8697-4c86-bdec-7263cacadd70","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58142","url":"/maverick-lt-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T20:44:05Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T20:44:05Z","name":"Maverick LT 02","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-11-13T20:44:05Z","id":"psweX8LWpqAsDQsF4TtDKh","meta":{"title":"Maverick LT 02 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Maverick LT-02 infrared thermometer lets you scan the temperature of any surface in four seconds, making it a great grill thermometer."},"products":[{"slug":"maverick-lt-02","url":"/product/maverick-lt-02","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","name":"Maverick LT 02","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","id":"k3JfoSNNeSupu43sJZEX5d","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:44:23Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/DYtY2xcH4jzW8ARsX9Qe3U.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"58114-maverick-lt-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58114-maverick-lt-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","id":"DYtY2xcH4jzW8ARsX9Qe3U","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DYtY2xcH4jzW8ARsX9Qe3U.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Maverick LT 02 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Maverick LT-02 infrared thermometer lets you scan the temperature of any surface in four seconds, making it a great grill thermometer."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/DYtY2xcH4jzW8ARsX9Qe3U.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"58114-maverick-lt-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58114-maverick-lt-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","id":"DYtY2xcH4jzW8ARsX9Qe3U","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DYtY2xcH4jzW8ARsX9Qe3U.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Maverick LT 02 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Maverick LT-02 infrared thermometer lets you scan the temperature of any surface in four seconds, making it a great grill thermometer."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/maverick-lt-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gadgets","url":"/kitchen/gadgets","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","name":"Gadgets","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:22Z","id":"hw664pAQ3ic5obm4EFCZjh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
