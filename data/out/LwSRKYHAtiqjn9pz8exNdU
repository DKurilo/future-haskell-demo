You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Before the advent of DVD and Blu-ray, VHS tapes were the standard-bearer of home media. We watched our movies, recorded our favorite TV shows and filmed our home movies on these magnetic tapes. During its heyday, few people thought about a time when it would be a chore to find a new VCR to play their tapes. Now, just a few years later, VHS is all but buried and those of us in the 30+ camp still have stacks of VHS tapes and no way to watch them. Fortunately, Samsung maintains a line of DVD/VCR combos. The Samsung DVD/VCR Combo DVD-VR375A not only breathes new life into your VHS collection but also plays DVDs as well as any media player currently on the market, and this is why this unit earned our TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award for DVD/VCR combos."]},"id":"b6d532ee-759b-416c-bef7-8ef26bd72abc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"DVD Features"},"id":"51c3a664-54ac-4026-8bda-7fc08a1712b9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["By their very nature, neither DVDs nor VHS tapes are capable of rich, high-definition picture quality achieved by most televisions and monitors in production these days. To combat this problem, the Samsung DVD/VCR combo features 1080p upconversion technology. Upconversion is a process that scales standard-definition images to high-resolution signals that take advantage of every pixel on an HDTV or HD monitor. This unit also possesses progressive scan technology that reduces blurry images and pixilation that can result from the upscaling process. These two features combined mean that you can utilize the full potential of your HDTV and get a clear picture from your standard-definition media.","The DVD portion of this unit also plays other disc media. It serves as a music CD player and supports almost all forms of rewriteable CDs and DVDs. Supported formats include DVD-RAM, -RW, +RW, -R, +R, CD-R and CD-RW. This means you can burn a CD or DVD on your computer and play it in the Samsung DVD/VCR combo."]},"id":"a469393e-ae12-4856-9add-fe4ce6902b90","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"VHS Features"},"id":"965507ef-345a-4db9-95cc-000908b9e312","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The VCR on the Samsung DVD/VCR combo is a four-head hi-fi model. This means that unless your VHS tapes are in seriously bad condition, the VCR portion of this unit will play them with no problems. Unfortunately, that&#39;s about all the VCR does. There is no two-way dubbing on this unit, so you can&#39;t transfer your VHS tapes to a digital format. There is a recording feature for the VCR, but good luck finding blank VHS tapes."]},"id":"82d202a4-c014-4fc5-a881-7464d6a3b9d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"717cef78-9635-4d88-a61c-c214b4b6af6d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The previously mentioned 1080p upconversion functionality would be somewhat useless without an HDMI terminal to connect the DVD/VCR Combo to an HDTV.
