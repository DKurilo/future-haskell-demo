This wheel works on both the PC and PS3. Everything from the pedals, shifter and the wheel are top notch. The RGT Force Feedback Pro Clutch Edition receives our TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award because it offers a balance of features, design and customization and takes a  high quality approach to racing games and excels with its customization.","This wheel and pedal set ranks highly in every category. There are a few minor omissions in terms of design. With such a high quality wheel, we hoped for a leather rim rather than the standard rubber.
