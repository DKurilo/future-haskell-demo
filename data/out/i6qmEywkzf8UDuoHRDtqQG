Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The latest version of Apple iPhoto, part of iLife &#39;11, is a <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac photo editing software</a> app that’s an easy way to import, organize, edit and share photos in a variety of ways. In fact, the organizing and sharing options are the best aspects of iPhoto, thanks to the new iCloud and Photo Stream features. The editing options are basic, which is fine for casual users but not pros or advanced users.","The other apps found in iLife ’11 include iMovie and GarageBand, a video editor and music creator; iWeb and iDVD are no longer offered.","The newest features include a fullscreen mode for those using OS X Lion, which allows you to browse through bigger thumbnails. Plus, the new bookshelf view allows you to easily view all your projects for print, like cards, photo books, etc. Since Facebook is the most popular place to share photos, iPhoto is synced well with the social network, allowing tags and comments added in Facebook to show up on iPhoto.","Another nice new feature is easily creating a template when you email photos. Simply highlight the photos you want, select Email from the share buttons, and choose the template you’d like. The mail app is the default program to email your photos, and you can set up most email clients within the Mail app, such as Gmail, Yahoo, etc.","Importing photos to this Mac photo editing software from a camera or a folder on your Mac is very easy. You can set up iPhoto to automatically launch when a camera or memory card is plugged in, or simply use the dropdown menu to import pictures.","As mentioned, this Mac photo editing software gives you only basic editing tools, though it’s obvious the app has come a long way since its humble beginnings. There are options to fix red eye, blemishes, color, exposure, contrast, noise and more.","If you’re looking for more editing power, one of the best aspects of iPhoto is its compatibility with more powerful image editors such as Photoshop Elements or Acorn. You can set a third-party application as your default photo editor so when you click the Edit button your preferred editor will  launch.","One of iPhoto’s strong suits is how many options it gives you for sharing your photo projects. You can export photos in an email, send them to be printed by a third-party printing company or print them yourself.  You can also create a slideshow to share, or upload to a variety of websites, such as Photo Stream via Apple’s new iCloud, Facebook, Flickr, etc.","The Export dialog box also allows users to choose to save as a file format (like JPG), a webpage (optimized for the internet), a QuickTime movie or a slideshow. with the option to select if you’ll share it online or in an email. You can also have iPhoto format your photos to share on your Apple devices including iPod, iPhone, iPad Apple TV or computer.","If you want to be able to view your pictures on all your iOS devices and your Mac, you can use Apple&#39;s new Photo Stream feature. It’s easy to set up iCloud in your system preferences and then simply turn it on in iPhoto. Now, every time you save a photo with iPhoto it will show up on all your devices. Windows users will need to download and install the iCloud Control Panel to enjoy this feature.","Working in iPhoto to organize pictures and albums is simple; use Events to name what a specific album contains. For example, “Matt’s Birthday Party” will only have the photos from that event. Using GPS-enabled cameras will also allow iPhoto’s Places feature to keep track of specific locations where the photos were taken. No GPS, no problem. Simply enter the location of the pictures. The software will detect faces in pictures and will recognize who is who, which is a very cool feature.","iPhoto ’11 and iLife &#39;11 are supported on Intel Macs running OS X Lion and earlier. Check Apple’s website for more specific details, as each app has different system requirements. For example, iMovie requires a little more power under the hood than others do.","Apple provides online support through its website, along with user forums, tutorials and a resources page. Visitors to the Apple Store can also get in-person lessons and introductions to iLife. It&#39;s also easy to find third-party user forums found on the web that can help, along with training materials both free and paid."]},"id":"be9da12c-6a2b-4b63-b721-2581c8e753d3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a6cd7ce9-2462-4309-9405-4f94b285d9eb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Apple iPhoto ‘11, found in iLife ’11, is a solid photo editing app for hobbyists and casual users, though professional users may desire more power and features.
