An easy way to pass the time is by watching a movie. A flip down DVD player is a roof-mounted monitor and DVD player that can keep kids, teens and adults in the back seat entertained for hours. And when the DVD player isn&#39;t in use, you can flip the monitor up and out of the way.","Your DVD wallet won&#39;t take up much more space in your luggage, and it can save a family vacation from whining, complaints and sibling fights that spark out of boredom. Even a portable DVD player can&#39;t offer the same amount of entertainment for a group of people stuck in a car for hours. The screen on a flip down player is generally wider, no one has to hold it up for everyone to see, and you can choose whether you use wireless headphones for private viewing on an overhead DVD player or connect to your car&#39;s stereo system so everyone can hear. Plus, flip down DVD players do more than play DVDs. Many of them allow you to connect external devices, like video game consoles, or connect to your car&#39;s radio."]},"id":"af652d33-3cf6-4bca-a2af-0f1a251788e4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"The Best Flip Down DVD Players for Gaming"},"id":"918d6e54-e253-4399-a90f-306297f2c253","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If movies don&#39;t keep your passengers from squirming in their seats or asking &#34;are we there yet?&#34;, you should consider investing in a flip down DVD player that enables you to hook up a gaming console.

The monitor of an overhead car DVD player is generally larger than other portable DVD player options, which ensures everyone in the back seat can see the movie playing. Many newer vehicles come with the option of a roof-mount DVD player, but if you&#39;re driving an older model, you can self-install a flip down DVD player with the features you need.","Most overhead car DVD players support DVDs and CDs, so you can watch a movie or listen to your favorite music without having to pack a portable device. Many flip down DVD players also include an FM transmitter, so you can listen to the radio through your headphones, which gives the driver and front-seat passenger a respite from loud music or movies. Also, you don&#39;t have to worry about tangled wires, because the best flip down DVD players support – and some even include – IR wireless headphones, which transmit audio via infrared signals.","A remote control is a helpful accessory that most overhead DVD players include, which ensures that the rider in the very back of the vehicle can control playback of DVDs or CDs. The best flip down DVD players include dome lights on the unit to replace the dome light of your minivan or SUV. Many overhead DVD players include HDMI inputs, which let you plug in your smartphone, tablet or other handheld device, making it easier to share streaming media with the whole crew. Other ports, such as A/V or USB ports, let you connect a hard drive or other media device so you can watch movies you own in other formats.","<strong>Flip Down DVD Players: Self-Install vs. Professional Installation</strong>","If you&#39;re a self-proclaimed handy person, it may go without saying that self-installation of a flip down DVD player is the way to go. However, you may not feel comfortable installing an electronic device in your vehicle yourself, so trusting a professional with the bits and bolts may make more sense to you. There are pros and cons to each route.","<strong>Self-Installation</strong><br/>One of the most obvious benefits to installing a flip down DVD player in your van or SUV yourself is the savings. All it costs you is time and patience, as long as you have the tools needed. In addition to basic tools, such as screwdrivers, a drill and a utility knife, you need some electrical tape, a volt ohm meter and pliers. You also need some electrical wiring know-how.","<strong>Professional Installation</strong><br/>If you choose to have a professional install your overhead DVD player, you&#39;re likely going to pay about the same as what the device cost you. However, this may be worth it to you if you&#39;re unsure of how or where to connect certain wires. You also get a clean-looking entertainment console in your vehicle with no effort on your part.","Whether you choose a basic flip down DVD player to play your family&#39;s favorite movies while you&#39;re running errands or a feature-filled overhead DVD player to hook up a gaming console or smartphones for hours of entertainment on long drives, it&#39;s an investment in your vehicle and your sanity. The best flip down DVD player is the one that fits your budget, lifestyle and car."]},"id":"6b9130b5-7cdd-47a6-b755-a1a72b8f8355","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"481f27d3-6e9c-409e-a97b-d4cfab3dac90","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UL7YL0/?&tag=ttr_flip_down_dvd_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|626[art|NA[pid|50571[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Pyle Audio</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RNNYPW/?&tag=ttr_flip_down_dvd_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|626[art|NA[pid|50572[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Power Acoustik</a>","<a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">XO Vision</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KH5UUI0/?&tag=ttr_flip_down_dvd_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|626[art|NA[pid|68326[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Alpine</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4UAIHK/?&tag=ttr_flip_down_dvd_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|626[art|NA[pid|68325[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Audiovox</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D80VGVA/?&tag=ttr_flip_down_dvd_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|626[art|NA[pid|68328[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Rockville</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L41L706/?&tag=ttr_flip_down_dvd_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|626[art|NA[pid|68327[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Xtrons</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"67b71eb2-4918-45ac-8aaa-ac0b940d5296","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_626","url":"/best-flip-down-dvd-players","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-30T17:16:39Z","datePublished":"2016-09-16T15:09:20Z","name":"Best Flip Down DVD Player","synopsis":"A flip down DVD player for your car can make the difference between a pleasant road trip and a ruined family vacation.
