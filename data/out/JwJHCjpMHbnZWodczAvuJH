Many of these appliances come in matching color schemes, and the AGA Legacy AMLFDR20 french door fridge has five color options: black, white, ivory, cranberry and the ever-popular stainless steel finish. This fridge has a total capacity of 19.8 cubic feet, with 14.4 cubic feet for the fresh food compartment and 5.4 cubic feet for the freezer compartment.","The fresh food compartment has five shelves, four of which are split, adjustable shelves. You can move the shelves up and down in the compartment, but there is not a lot of adaptability when it comes to fitting tall items. You will either have to move an entire shelf up or remove it altogether to accommodate large items. Also, the shelving lacks spill protection, so you run the risk of having spills leak down the sides or on to other shelves. You do have two humidity-controlled crisper bins and a temperature-controlled full-width drawer. An added bonus would have been energy efficient LED lighting, but the fridge is Energy Star certified despite having the less efficient incandescent light bulbs. If you leave the door to the fresh food compartment or the freezer compartment open, an alarm will sound after a few minutes. This fridge will also sound an alarm if the internal temperature rises to a dangerous level or if the power supply is disconnected.","The AGA Legacy AMLFDR20 has an internal water dispenser, and the icemaker is in the freezer. This means you will have to open the fresh food compartment to get cold, filtered water, and bend down to get ice cubes out of the freezer drawer. With an external water and ice dispenser, you would have those amenities in one location. The freezer compartment has two tiers in the pull-out drawer. The ice bin is removable so you can fill several glasses quickly, and the bin and other compartments in the freezer are all made of plastic."]},"id":"09a44714-7615-40ac-8e24-74becca7e9ee","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fb787030-af87-4fa6-b33d-535abf42ee15","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AGA Legacy AMLFDR20 comes in five colors to better match your kitchen.
