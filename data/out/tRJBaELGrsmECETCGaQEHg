The straight shaft measures 40 inches, giving you plenty of range for hard-to-reach areas, such as around shrubs and bushes. Some of the attachments available (sold separately) include a blower, edger and tiller.

Fortunately, the Toro can use other brand name attachments – as long as they use a universal connector – without voiding its warranty. This is a great value if you already own multiple attachments but need a stronger weed whacker. It can also potentially save you money since you can shop for the best attachment deals, regardless of brand. One of the only downsides to the Toro 51978 is that it weighs 12.5 pounds, which is quite heavy for extended use.

Our expert reviewers have trimmed, cut and tested with over 60 models during that time to find the machines that perform the best.","After completing our testing, we determined which tool works best for tall, strong users; which trimmer was the most comfortable to use that didn&#39;t leave us feeling shaky; and which tool is best for shorter users with smaller hands. Our tests identified the tools that cannot eradicate thicker weeds but might work satisfactorily for your yard if you don&#39;t require a more powerful engine.","<strong>How We Picked the Best</strong>","We took 10 weed whackers to five lawns and a city park to test their functionality. A trimmer should be powerful enough to cut through the thick brush in your yard with only a few passes, so our testers used each trimmer in a series of practical, everyday tasks and some controlled tests to determine which ones performed the best.","For design, we measured the decibel level of each trimmer running at full throttle. We measured the shaft length, the cutting path and the weight. To make sure we catered to all body types, we enlisted the help of several testers of varying height, weight and strength to determine how the balance and weight of each weed whacker worked for them. Exposure to vibrations for a long period of time can be potentially damaging, so we also asked the testers to rate the level of vibration they experienced while using the weed whackers.","<strong>How Much Do Gas Trimmers Cost?</strong>","Gas trimmers generally cost more than electric trimmers. The least expensive models in our lineup are in the $100 range. The cheapest gas trimmers we found online were about $70, but those are the exception. Most gas trimmers cost around $130 up to more than $200. In contrast, corded electric trimmers have many cheaper options. You can find good corded trimmers for $50 or less. Battery-operated electric trimmers can cost as much as gas trimmers, but there are more options in the $60 to $90 range.","<strong>Curved- vs. Straight-Shaft Weed Whackers </strong>","When deciding on a weed whacker, shaft shape is an important consideration. Curved models are best for shorter people, since they stay closer to the ground and have shorter shafts than straight trimmers. In addition, curved shaft trimmers are usually more balanced than straight shaft models, and they tend to be lighter weight. As such,they are more ergonomic and comfortable to use for long periods. Further, they are easier to maneuver in awkward areas like around rocks and under decks. Curved-shaft weed eaters also tend to cost less than their straight counterparts.","Straight-shaft weed whackers are more multifunctional and accommodate people of all sizes since they are adjustable. A straight shaft usually generates more torque than a curved shaft trimmer, so you can effectively cut tough weeds and scrub. Straight shafts can also reach more awkward, tight and narrow areas around your lawn. In addition, you can use a straight-shaft trimmer as both an edger and trimmer, and you can attach other tools like a brush cutter.","<strong>What Else Is Important When Selecting a Weed Whacker?</strong>","Below are some other considerations when selecting your next weed whacker.","String Features: How Easy Is It to Replace the String, and How Long Does It Last?<br/>All weed whackers use some variation of a wound-up spool of string, which is enclosed in a case inside the trimmer, to knock down tough grass and weeds. This string wears out and needs to be replaced, often several times in one session. String reloads from the case in a few distinct ways: Semi-automatic models have string that adjusts on its own. Most models require a bump, meaning you need to knock the bottom of the weed trimmer against the ground to activate a button at the bottom that feeds out additional string. Manual-feed models require that you stop trimming, turn over the unit and pull the string out manually.","You want to pay attention to the amount of string the case holds. The more feet of string you have, the longer the weed whacker will work before you need to purchase replacement string, which can be expensive.","Attachments<br/>A little more than half of the weed whackers we reviewed are compatible with attachments that increase their functionality. Attachments can include blowers, edgers, hedge trimmers and tillers, thereby transforming one tool into several and creating a far more useful product.","You can get these attachments from the weed whacker manufacturers or third-party and aftermarket companies. Some products are compatible only with attachments of the same brand. Other brands, such as Toro, don’t make their own attachments, but their products can use attachments from any brand as long as they have a universal connector. The most attachment-friendly weed whacker we reviewed was the Troy-Bilt TB32 EC.","<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>","If you have a smaller yard or you don&#39;t need to do yard work weekly, an <a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">electric string trimmer</a> could be a good fit for you.
