You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Bushnell&#39;s Trophy Cam 119467C trail camera provides one of the highest resolutions in <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-cameras\">game cameras</a>. The pictures and video have sharp colors and pictures. As one of the top 10 best game cameras, we recommend the Trophy Cam 119467C for its quality and battery life. Its design is durable and weatherproof but is not the easiest to hide from animals and humans, which may cause a problem when it&#39;s out on the trail.","On the right side of the camera there are latches that you can use to open the camera. Within the camera, you will find a display screen and a control panel for customizing the settings on the left side. On the right side, you will find the battery compartment. The control panel buttons are labeled so you don&#39;t have to guess which button performs which function.","The trail camera is slightly larger than an aluminum soda can and is in a black hard-plastic case. The case is sealed with a weatherproof lining so that, rain or shine, the camera is protected and will take consistent footage of the area you have marked.","The Bushnell Trophy Cam 119467C offers 8 MP of digital resolution; it&#39;s the second highest resolution that we found in game cameras, and it provides sharp, clear footage of the area you are scouting. The camera will capture footage during the day and at night; however, we did find that the night images are often blurry and more pixelated than the daytime pictures.","Like many other game cameras, this Bushnell trail camera has passive infrared technology. This allows the camera to capture footage when motion triggers the camera. The focus range is approximately 50 feet, depending on light and weather. Through our research, we found that it often exceeds 50 feet and provides a clear picture of the subjects in the area.","The camera has a continuous shooting setting which will capture multiple images from a single trigger. You can select one, two or three pictures to be taken each time the camera goes off. There is also a programmable trigger interval that can be set anywhere from immediate (0 sec) to 60 minutes. In addition, the camera has an adjustable PIR (Lo/Med/High), which affects the trigger speed. We were impressed with the number of features that can be customized on this camera to fit your needs. While the trigger speed is slower than we hoped it would be, it still captures movement and the subject within the frame.","This game camera can run on 4 to 12 AA batteries. As you would expect, the more batteries you use, the longer the battery life. Bushnell says that the camera will run for a full year on one set of 12 batteries. While we were unable to test that claim, the camera will run for a number of months on a single set of batteries. However, you should keep in mind that the temperature, the camera&#39;s settings and the amount of activity in the area are all factors in battery life. The Bushnell trail camera has a SD memory card port that is compatible with up to 32GB of external memory. At full resolution, the camera will hold more than 10,000 photos and more than eight hours of video.","We were very pleased with the Bushnell customer service team. They are one of the most responsive support departments that we worked with during this review. You can reach Bushnell customer support by phone or email. We found that the best method of contact is the toll-free telephone number provided on the company&#39;s website.","The reason that we found the customer support team to be one of the best that we reviewed is because there is little wait time and the customer representatives are very knowledgeable regarding the Bushnell trail cameras. They were able to answer our questions and expound on the functions and features of the camera with little hesitation and without needing to put us on hold while they looked up the answer."]},"id":"a7951d24-8c51-4b26-82da-3501b9e6d8d1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"249bd10d-fc39-4f0f-a9d0-db2c156dde0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite the blurry and pixelated footage that comes from nighttime use, this game camera has some good features to offer.
