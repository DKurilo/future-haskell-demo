Burglars sometimes pose as door-to-door salespeople and ask probing questions about their potential victims&#39; home security to gather information they can use to stage a home invasion.","<strong>Beware of the ADT Scam<br/></strong>An otherwise peaceful neighborhood becomes dangerous when scammers walk door to door. Although con artists can pose as workers for any security company, ADT scams have appeared in the news with some regularity; reports warn consumers to ask for identification before revealing personal information or inviting a technician into their homes.","Potential thieves tell homeowners they are selling, upgrading or evaluating <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security systems</a> in the area. Sometimes, scammers even volunteer to install a free security system as part of a corporate promotion. They seek entrance to the home so they can note potential vulnerabilities and decide whether the house has any items of significant value.","<strong>Don&#39;t Answer Personal Questions<br/></strong>Con artists might ask whether the house is left unattended for long periods of time and if the homeowners have dogs. They might ask for a tour of your home.","These questions might seem legitimate because they pertain to home security, but they also give burglars information they can then use to break into your home more easily and with less risk. Consumers can avoid falling for home security scams by asking for identification and calling the company directly to ask about sales solicitations in a particular neighborhood.","<strong>Avoid Common Red Flags<br/></strong>The tactics used in home security scams vary, but widespread reports from victims reveal a few common denominators. Con artists use pushy tactics to gain entry to the home or to collect personal information. These scammers also lack employee identification, such as badges or cards, to prove they work for a particular company.","Some thieves drive out-of-state vehicles or refuse to give their names. The scammers might make unlikely promises, such as offering a free security system or a complimentary upgrade to your current alarm system. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.","<strong>Protect Yourself<br/></strong>If you suspect a salesperson is not the real deal, end the conversation and shut the door or hang up the phone. Never give personal information, including your name, social security number, or the names of other residents in the home. Some con artists try to prove their legitimacy by providing official-looking forms; do not complete any forms unless you receive confirmation from the parent company.","To install a legitimate home security system, contact the provider you choose directly. Initiating the contact yourself should give you a great deal of peace of mind because you know you are dealing with a legitimate representative.","Home security scams put your home and your family at risk. Whether you&#39;re answering the phone or the door, regard unsolicited offers with suspicion and call the police if you feel threatened or concerned."]},"id":"bf2f4716-10e6-40f5-a5d8-c87d4ab4d9c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9572","url":"/avoiding-door-to-door-home-security-scams","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-26T23:11:57Z","datePublished":"2015-05-26T23:11:57Z","name":"Avoiding Door-to-Door Home Security Scams","synopsis":"When someone knocks on your door or calls you on the phone claiming to represent a security company, don't take those words at face value.","review":{},"strapline":"When someone knocks on your door or calls you on the phone claiming to represent a security company, don't take those words at face value.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-05-26T23:14:33Z","id":"zBXEgUHKX94rXDKDdC4RRU","meta":{"title":"Avoiding Door-to-Door Home Security Scams","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
