Although this is the least powerful kitchen <a href=\"/magic-bullet-review\">blender</a> out of all the models we reviewed, its simple design makes it easy to use. Unfortunately, the Magic Bullet did not perform as well in our tests as the best blenders did. For a blender with more blending power, check out the <a href=\"/dash-chef-series-review\">Dash Chef</a>.Â ","During our tests, the Magic Bullet was able to crush ice, blend fruit and make almond butter. However, it had difficulty performing all of these functions. Although it was able to crush some ice, large chunks remained at the top of the jar that were left virtually untouched unless we stopped the blender and pushed the ice down. Making fruit smoothies was slightly easier, but some chunks were still left over. The Magic Bullet was able to make somewhat creamy almond butter, which is more than some of the other blenders could accomplish, but there were still large chunks left over, which is unfortunate. This performance is due to the low power of the blender, which is only 250 watts, making it the least powerful model out of all the blenders we reviewed.","While in use, this model was slightly louder than the average blender, producing up to 93 dB. To give you an idea of how loud this is, the average vacuum produces around 75 dB, while a whisper is closer to 30 dB. However, the Magic Bullet produces isn&#39;t as loud as some of the other units we reviewed.","The feature that separates this model from the other kitchen blenders we reviewed is its size. The Magic Bullet is the smallest blender we reviewed, barely larger than a coffee cup when the blending jar is taken off. This blender comes with several single-serving jars for when you cook for yourself or make personalized recipes, such as individual smoothies. The unit is also dishwasher safe and doesn&#39;t include any operating buttons, making it easy to clean.","The Magic Bullet comes with a one-year warranty for the entire unit, including the motor. This is among the shortest warranties out of all the blenders we reviewed. If you need to speak with customer support, you can contact the company through email or over the phone.","The Magic Bullet is a small blender with a unique design that makes it easy to use. It is the least powerful out of all the models we reviewed, which was rather apparent during our tests. Crushing ice or other hard substances with it was a bit of a chore, and it left some chunks in fruit smoothies. However, its included single-serving cups make it great for small or individualized recipes."]},"id":"002d4a8d-1aa8-40ad-9ee7-0dff15c32da4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65254","url":"/magic-bullet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-29T18:02:16Z","datePublished":"2015-05-29T18:02:16Z","name":"Magic Bullet MBR-1701","synopsis":"The Magic Bullet is a small but effective blender that you can use to quickly blend foods.
