You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","While touch screen smartphones get the lion’s share of media attention these days, there is a very large group of users who need and prefer the solid performance of a more traditional mobile communication device. For those people, both in terms of sheer business power, unsurpassed messaging capabilities and reliability, the BlackBerry Bold 9700<strong> </strong>is simply the best smartphone available.","The Bold 9700 is the epitome of the no nonsense, enterprise device but in today’s market, no smartphone can survive today without extensive multimedia capabilities, location based features and the ubiquitous apps. The Bold 9700 excels in all of these areas. We considered its predecessor to be the best smartphone on the market without a touch screen and the 9700 improves on that standard.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>","•\tOptical track ball navigation<br/>•\t3G, Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth<br/>•\t3.2 MP camera with flash and video recorder<br/>•\tFaster 624MHz processor<br/>•\tUpdated BlackBerry OS 5.0"]},"id":"6c0a5f72-5e62-48e7-960b-f14ac75a8faa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"b03b379a-e700-4ef8-94a0-8ebf73d7c846","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bold 9700 is the first 3G BlackBerry to come to T-Mobile. In the case of AT&amp;T, it’s an upgrade to the 3G Bold 9000. Like the previous Bold, the 9700 includes Wi-Fi connectivity and, on T-Mobile, will allow for unlimited Wi-Fi calling with an optional subscription to the HotSpot Calling plan. AT&amp;T doesn’t offer such an option. The phone is also equipped with a built-in GPS/A-GPS receiver and is compatible with mono and stereo Bluetooth devices.","Aesthetically, the original BlackBerry Bold was distinguished by its exceptionally clear display screen and elegant looks. Its shiny black and chrome finish, set off by the leather like back panel were clearly emblematic of the device’s power and the users self confidence. The Bold 9700 retains this heritage but in a sleeker package. While decidedly not feminine in appearance, it’s certainly not as overtly masculine its predecessor. The design, while likely appealing to a wider range of users, does result in a slightly smaller display screen at 2.44-inches diagonally compared to 2.75-inches. Still, with its substantial 480 x 360 pixel resolution, the Bold 9700 has one of the industry’s best displays. Keys are just bit smaller and are more closely spaced than on the older Bold but the keypad is still very solid and easy to use.","BlackBerries are notorious for being tough, reliable devices. But, if there’s been one weak link in that chain over the past couple of years, it’s been the track ball. Though usually trustworthy, it has been reported to function intermittently or to stop all together, usually as a result of tiny dust particles interfering with its electrical contacts. It has also been known to pop out requiring repair. The Bold 9700 continues the current trend of replacing it with an optical track ball that eliminates the mechanical interface and promises to be more dependable. Its sensitivity can be adjusted to suit individual users needs.","In general, the Bold 9700 runs faster and more smoothly than previous BlackBerries. It features a fast and improved 624MHz processor and 256 MB of internal RAM.  Memory can be expanded with up to a 32GB MicroSD card and it comes with a 2GB card. It’s complete with the vastly improved BlackBerry 5.0 OS. Not only does it feature an attachment viewer, but it also comes with the Documents-To-Go Standard Edition program from DataViz which allows for editing Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. Creation of them requires upgrading to the Premium Edition of the program.","The center of any BlackBerry experience is the unparalleled messaging capabilities. For business and organizational users, the smartphone can sync with the BlackBerry Enterprise Server supporting MS Exchange, Novell GroupWise and IBM Lotus Domino. The BlackBerry Internet Service provides support for up to ten IMAP and POP3 email accounts.","The camera has been upgraded to 3.2-megapixels. It has an integrated flash, auto focus, 2X zoom and records video."]},"id":"1d4b075e-743e-4572-b0f2-7de0d87fe4a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"081188a7-5a20-44d5-86ad-475d4c975927","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The previous Bold was well liked by reviewers across the board and the new one is seen as an improvement on a good thing.
