It weighs less than 2 pounds and is easy to carry from the closet to your desk. Additionally, the Wolverine F2D20 has a stand-alone design that works independently of a computer and software, so you can use it almost anywhere.<br/>The easy to use quick start guide takes you systematically through each step. Simply load your film or negatives into the tray and insert them into the slot. Navigating the menu is easy and intuitive.","Compared to other digital slide converters, the 100MB of integrated memory on the F2D20 is a stand out feature. Since you cannot save images directly to your computer, this is a bonus. If you have a large number of slides to convert, you will still want to use an SD card for storage. Without using an SD card, the process is time consuming. You can only capture 40 images before having to transfer via USB cable. You cannot save your images directly to a PC. Fortunately, the Wolverine stores directly to an SD card, bypassing its own memory limitations. You can save thousands of photos on an SD card.<br/>The images appear sharp and clean on the 2.4-inch color LCD screen. The downside of the small screen is that it is difficult see the result, which is especially concerning if you need to edit the image by adjusting the brightness.","Additional accessories for this unit are available, but you will have to purchase them separately. A 110 mm film tray and negative roll adapter are available if you need them. However, this device is not able to convert photo prints to digital images.
