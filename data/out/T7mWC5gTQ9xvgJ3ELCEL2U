This is important because many HDMI splitters place the LEDs on the top of the device, which makes them hard to see when you&#39;re sitting on the couch.","The Etekcity switcher uses auto switching to quickly change video sources for you. It does this by detecting which connected devices turn on. When you power up your PlayStation 4, the switcher automatically jumps to the PlayStation 4&#39;s input. Auto switching is very useful when it works well, but sometimes it doesn&#39;t and can be frustrating. If more than one connected device is powered on, it can confuse the HDMI switcher.","When auto switching doesn&#39;t work, you can control the Etekcity switcher via the included remote. With this, you can manually choose which video source you want to view. Unfortunately, the Etekcity switcher doesn&#39;t come with an external IR sensor. This means you have to leave the switcher in plain view so that the remote can properly communicate. An external IR sensor would allow you to hide the switcher and only leave the IR sensor accessible.","This HDMI switcher doesn&#39;t have any sort of equalizer, so you&#39;ll want to keep your HDMI cables short. With long HDMI cables, the data signal can begin to deteriorate and you need an equalizer to normalize it."]},"id":"ac0ebaaa-e472-42f4-9332-65eed5a83cc7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Compatibility"},"id":"f766c156-2270-4569-a8e7-84f344429acf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/CgKm6CtWYxKwWwCB7NJBhC.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67376-etekcity3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CgKm6CtWYxKwWwCB7NJBhC.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"CgKm6CtWYxKwWwCB7NJBhC","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CgKm6CtWYxKwWwCB7NJBhC.jpg","alt":""},"id":"41b616aa-ee77-4b3f-bb5f-a7e96b84213e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In order to get the most vibrant video on your TV, you need to know about color – deep color, specifically.
