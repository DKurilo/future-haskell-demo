We looked at a wide variety of thermoses and insulated food containers and spoke with moms, commuters and outdoor enthusiasts who tend to use these items frequently to learn about their experiences with different types of thermoses and the brands they purchase.","For example, Richelle Kimbal, a mother of four, bought an insulated food jar to send hot lunch to school with her second grader during the cold winter months. Kimbal was so impressed with the quality, value and ease of using it that she purchased a second one when another child started all-day school. We used this feedback while examining different characteristics of insulated food jars, such as wide mouths, durability, spill-proofing and ease of washing them. We also considered cost since that is an important determining factor for many people.","Another consumer we spoke with is Anna Burleson, who totes an insulated thermos to the office in the morning with several ounces of coffee. Burleson pointed out that during her commute it’s important that the flow of coffee from the pour spout is consistent to avoid burns, and equally important is to control the speed of the flow. Also, being able to unlock and open the flask with one hand is necessary. With this information we looked closely at pour spouts, cap locks and ease of opening and closing them, plus which thermoses fit into standard car cup holders.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We conducted multiple temperature tests to see if the manufacturer’s claim of how long a thermos keeps food or liquid hot or cold was accurate. After filling each thermos with a consistent hot or cold temperature measured water, we waited for the claimed hours to go by. We then opened the thermoses and remeasured the water to learn how much heat was lost, or how warm cold water became as it sat untouched.","Hot Water Tests<br/>According to a study published by the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226454\">US National Library of Medicine National Institute of Health,</a> researchers at The University for Texas at Tyler found coffee, tea and other hot beverages are typically served between 160 and 185 degrees F. For heat tests, we added water heated with a sous vide machine to 200 degrees F. When it was transferred to the thermoses, the water cooled to 188 degrees F. We performed multiple tests, with some testers filling thermoses at room temperature and others pre-filling the thermoses with hot water to heat the inside first. We didn’t see much difference in how quickly the water cooled between the pre-filled and non-pre-filled thermoses. On average hot water cooled by 55 degrees after sitting between six and 12 hours, with another 15-degree cooldown at the 12-hour mark. "]},"id":"9fc8368f-1f09-483a-9ff8-0e34e9c9ca0f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ozT5tdnk7K8XfcPvGxs8i8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/thermos-testing-3/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9PL0svODAwNTE2L29yaWdpbmFsL1RoZXJtb3Nlcy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMy5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozT5tdnk7K8XfcPvGxs8i8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ozT5tdnk7K8XfcPvGxs8i8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozT5tdnk7K8XfcPvGxs8i8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7c30b803-4e3c-42c9-b0ee-324d98518284","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We wanted to learn the average heat loss for each thermos, so we filled each pre-filled thermos with 188-degree F hot water then remeasured after only two hours. The best insulated thermoses retained over 90 percent of the water’s heat, though several dipped down to 80 percent heat retention. Only one thermos retained less than 70 percent of its water’s heat after two hours.","Cold Water Tests<br/>As with the heat tests, we started by filling each thermos with water that had been chilled to 33 degrees F, which is 1 degree warmer than water’s freezing point. We noted how long each thermos claimed it could keep water cold, and we measured the water temperature once that time had elapsed. On average the water warmed by 23 degrees to a temperature of about 58 degrees F, still 15 degrees colder than room temperature.","Food Jar Tests<br/>For the three food jars we tested, we wanted to learn how hot the food stayed after sitting in the thermos for six hours, which is the amount of time manufacturers claim their jars keep food warm. We heated soups, chowders and Top Ramen to 187 degrees F, which is 27 degrees hotter than food should be heated to kill any foodborne bacteria. There was a decent difference in heat loss between the food jars with a range of 33 to 66 degrees of cooldown.

However, you can expect to spend between $15 and $20 for a decent thermos that is well insulated, holds a good amount of liquid and includes a leak-proof lid. Most thermoses in this price range also come with a warranty to cover major manufacturing defects.","<strong>Things to Look for in a Thermos</strong>","Whether you are toting icy water to hydrate you after a long workout or bringing warm baby food with you to keep a hungry child happy, having a quality thermos can make or break your outing. Different thermos models have different characteristics, so you’ll need to choose the one that works best for your situation.","Construction &amp; Insulation<br/>Construction and insulation can profoundly affect temperature retention and durability. There are plastic and pressed tin models on the market, but better- quality thermoses give you a double-walled stainless steel construction. This provides strength, scratch resistance, shatterproofing and corrosion resistance. Stainless steel is also able to withstand the pressure of vacuum insulation. This type of insulation maintains temperature with airless space between the two walls of the thermos. This prevents heat or cold leaching into or out of the interior, which means a flask with good quality vacuum insulation holds heat or cold for longer intervals than one with foam insulation.","Capacity<br/>The capacity of a thermos dictates how many people can stay hydrated and for how long. With capacities ranging from 4 ounces to 1 gallon, you should choose the size of your flask based on its most likely use. If, for example, you need a thermos for hiking, family picnics or other all-day or overnight activities, you’ll no doubt need one with a substantial capacity. For your own hydration during a workout or a hot drink on the daily commute, a single-serve travel mug or travel tumbler that holds between 4 and 16 ounces probably would work better.","Features<br/>If you&#39;re looking for a thermos that&#39;s easy to carry while you run or work out, consider one that comes with a carry strap, clips to your belt or has a contoured body for a comfortable grip. For drinks while driving, opt for a slimline travel mug that fits into a vehicle cup holder. When you require a large-capacity flask, look for one with a carry handle, strap or case. For storing in a backpack or lunchbox or to carry over rough terrain, the flask needs to be airtight so it doesn&#39;t leak."]},"id":"86141862-1e96-44bb-bc71-3671b59fecb5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"be1be2fc-9718-4ab0-8a1f-e9c0acd9b799","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/stanley-review\">Stanley Classic</a>","<a href=\"/hydro-flask-review\">Hydro Flask Standard Mouth</a>","<a href=\"/mira-review\">MIRA Lunch Food Jar</a>","<a href=\"/thermos-review\">Thermos Sipp</a>","<a href=\"/zojirushi-review\">Zojirushi Food Jar</a>","<a href=\"/contigo-review\">Contigo West Loop</a>","<a href=\"/reduce-review\">Reduce Vacuum Food Jar 12oz, Blue</a>","<a href=\"/yeti-review\">YETI Rambler</a>","<a href=\"/asobu-review\">Asobu Imperial Beverage</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"151b2697-a83c-4a42-a313-59ca44554b10","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_164","url":"/best-thermoses","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-09T20:30:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-09T20:30:00Z","name":"Best Thermoses of 2019","synopsis":"Here are some of the best insulated flasks including traditional Thermoses, travel mugs and stainless steel insulated tumblers.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are some of the best insulated flasks including traditional Thermoses, travel mugs and stainless steel insulated tumblers.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-09T23:11:27Z","id":"tKmMBjkYEWRFESRK6vFjwL","meta":{"title":"Best Thermoses and Insulated Flasks for Keeping Drinks Hot -
