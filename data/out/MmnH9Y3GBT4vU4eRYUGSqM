Though the unit is quite long, measuring more than 8 feet, it creates enough heat to control the temperature in large rooms. The wide design limits where you can place the heater. The unit also has high energy requirements.","Many electric baseboard heaters are small enough to fit in a variety of locations, but this unit’s 98-inch width requires that you free up a significant portion of a wall. For comparison, our top pick, the <a href=\"/dimplex-review\">Dimplex PC6025W31</a>, is only 60 inches wide. Still, the size of this heater enables it to heat rooms nearly 150 square feet in size, operating at 1500 watts of power output. Between the size and wattage of the unit, it is sufficient to gradually heat a large room and maintain a comfortable temperature.","Mostly because it has high energy requirements, the unit requires 240-volt wiring. For older homes with an existing 120-volt wire, you’ll have to run new wire to install this device. The device has a ceramic thermal storage core, which generates and retains heat more effectively than typical electric heating elements. The unit is designed for both single and double pole unit-mounted thermostats to achieve temperatures between 45 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, though the thermostats are sold separately.","It comes with high-grade aluminum fins to produce better heat transfer between the top and bottom vent panels than other units are normally able to achieve. As an added precaution, the electric baseboard heating device is designed with a full-length capillary sensor that automatically turns off the element if its surface temperature becomes too hot. It then automatically resets when temperatures return to normal. Frequent overheating can contribute toward product failures, and this unit is only protected with a five-year warranty. Many of the more popular brands offer 10-year or even lifetime coverage, which brings this unit’s longevity somewhat into question."]},"id":"a7bc40bc-ffb2-4f8f-ab4f-c9a38c942b2d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fa60303e-6d57-4fdb-812a-ce5b69898a49","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The King 8CB2415BW electric baseboard heater is ideal for providing extra or primary heat to larger areas of your home, such as a living room or master bedroom.
