There&#39;s studying, socializing and a job or internship to juggle. With all of this going on, a student really doesn&#39;t need another thing to worry about. He just needs a computer that runs perfectly and helps him get his research and writing done with no hiccups. That&#39;s why seamless <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">anti-virus software</a> is so important. It safeguards a student&#39;s most important tool without interrupting her work. We&#39;ve found that <a href=\"/kaspersky-review\">Kaspersky Anti-Virus</a> is the best security software for students. Here are few reasons why this software makes the grade.","<strong>Zero Learning Curve</strong>","Students have enough to memorize; you don&#39;t want software that needs in-depth research to use. Kaspersky takes just minutes to install and it has an intuitive design that will be easy to use for any person who uses computers on a regular basis. The security status is also color coded, so you can tell if your computer is infected with just a glance. There&#39;s no need to search through a scan log for infected files.","<strong>Task Scheduling</strong>","The best security software is one that you never have to see, but protects and cleans up your computer completely. Kaspersky Anti-Virus does this by giving students the option to schedule when they want the software to do system scans or updates. A scan can be scheduled for a time when the computer isn&#39;t in use so that it doesn&#39;t interrupt studying or research time.","While scheduling tasks may seem like it would be a common feature, it isn&#39;t. Some software is able to schedule updates only, while other security packages are able to schedule system scans. Kaspersky Anti-Virus is unique because it can do both types of scheduling.","<strong>Rollback</strong>","Another uncommon feature that Kaspersky software sports is rollback. Rollback is the ability to reset the software to its status before a glitched update. This is important to students because when you have a paper due or you need to study for a big test, you don&#39;t have time to work on computer troubles. Rollback is a simple, quick fix for a common problem.","<strong>Laptop / Battery-saving Mode</strong>","If you take your laptop to class with you, you want your battery life to be at its best. Some student security software tends to drain a laptop battery, so it is important to go with a security package that offers a Laptop or Battery-saving Mode that can be switched on when your laptop is on the go.","<strong>Silent Mode</strong>","The Silent Mode feature of Kaspersky Anti-Virus allows you to use your computer in full-screen mode without being interrupted by updates or alert messages. For a student, this is a particularly handy mode for use during class presentations or in-depth study sessions.","With these helpful tools from a leader in anti-virus software, keeping your computer safe and in first-class working condition is easy. Now all you have to worry about is making good grades.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You DonÂ t Have To."]},"id":"d663537d-2e86-4a3e-8475-a84239b10294","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6498","url":"/the-best-anti-virus-software-for-students","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alina-bradford","url":"/author/alina-bradford","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alina Bradford","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"B3tPrF8sxRUy8i2s9RVdDe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-24T16:07:25Z","datePublished":"2011-08-24T16:07:25Z","name":"The Best Anti-virus Software for Students","synopsis":"The life of a student is hectic.
