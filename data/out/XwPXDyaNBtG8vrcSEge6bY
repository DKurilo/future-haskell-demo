The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">Home Subwoofers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The KW line from Klipsch includes entry-level subwoofers that allow you to upgrade your home entertainment center sound without spending a small fortune. The KW-100 is the model we reviewed for our lineup of best home subwoofers. The KW-100 is a 10-inch, down-firing woofer with 225-watts of dynamic power.","Even though this inexpensive subwoofer will raise the sound quality of your home entertainment center, it is underpowered, especially for a 10-inch subwoofer. The 225-watt dynamic peak power is the lowest wattage produced by any subwoofer that we reviewed.  The 55-watt RMS continuous power is really only efficient enough for small home entertainment rooms.","This home theater subwoofer has a frequency range of 29Hz to 120Hz. Compared to other small subwoofers on our lineup, this frequency range is not as versatile, though 29Hz is typical for a 10-inch subwoofer. Subwoofers that measure 12 inches and 15 inches generally have a lower frequency response because the size of the woofer allows for it to handle more bass.","This is the one of the only subwoofers that we reviewed that is a down-firing subwoofer. Low-end frequencies are omnidirectional, so even though this subwoofer is underpowered, the down-firing design helps the bass travel throughout the room when you are watching movies. This small subwoofer is rear-ported. You don’t want to place it against a wall covering the port. In order for the subwoofer to reach maximum potential, you need to allow the port to breathe.","On the back of the woofer you will find volume control, adjustable crossover control and phase switching. This speaker features multiple speaker-in connections but does not have any speaker outputs, so you won’t be able to run a signal from your subwoofer to other speakers in your sound system.","Klipsch offers a 5-year warranty on the speaker, and a 2-year warranty on both the amplifier and wiring within the subwoofer. If you have any questions about your subwoofer, you can visit the FAQs section on the Klipsch website for quick answers. You can also contact Klipsch via phone and email."]},"id":"72c8f32c-31bd-4020-83da-6e11ebd17c80","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d7288f44-e9df-4dae-bd63-0452075302e4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The 10-inch KW-100 woofer is underpowered but suitable for small rooms.
