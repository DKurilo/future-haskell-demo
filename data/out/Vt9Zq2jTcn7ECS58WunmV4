If you have a lot of kids that go through towels by the truckload, this will be a good dryer for you. The Sanitize cycle will help eliminate environmental elements that aggravate allergies or spread germs.","The white interior combined with the drum light, make it easy to see your clothes, decreasing the likelihood that a stray sock will be left behind in the dryer.","This device also has a steam refresh function, which is unusual for a midrange dryer. To activate the steam option you have to hook up the dryer to an existing water supply. This is a quick and easy process and once you’re hooked up you don’t have to worry about it again. Typically, other dryers with a steam option require you to keep a reservoir filled with water.","This is one of several products in our clothes dryer reviews that simplify the process of drying and alleviate any concerns about dryer maintenance by allowing you to set the cycle and let the dryer do its job. A moisture sensor will prevent over-drying, which can be hard on clothes and increases your utility bill as it wastes energy. It is also a potential safety hazard.","While this electric dryer is relatively efficient at its sole purpose, it has no eco monitor and the temperatures tend to run a bit high. The Normal cycle runs at temperatures exceeding 150 and the delicates reach into the upper 130s. This can cause extra wear on your clothes and uses up more energy than is necessary. Despite its high energy use, it is a solid dryer with enough cycles to meet most if not all of your drying needs and performs well.","Maytag has a chat service that is easily accessible via a prompt at the top of each product’s webpage. You can also download manuals and other information from their website and the manuals effectively explain the dryer’s different functions and will answer many of your questions."]},"id":"bc29adb9-bb62-4b10-9909-a54ddbd51496","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b88a63e1-b732-4b57-93d1-6c94cbd311cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag Bravo XL is a great midrange laundry dryer with 11 cycles including the less common Sanitize, Towels and Sheets cycles.
