However, the Bissell ProHeat 2X Select Pet offers this fantastic feature that will help to keep your carpets and upholstery free of mold and mildew. Microban protection attacks microbes (e.g., mildew, mold and bacteria) at the cellular level to ensure an added level of cleanliness that most carpet cleaners don&#39;t have. We applaud Bissell for seeking out this extra layer of antimicrobial technology; it will help your carpet look and smell fresh longer.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52688-bissell-proheat-2x-select-pet5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6peK6JhVRZFAzJqyZBS3tF.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6peK6JhVRZFAzJqyZBS3tF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6peK6JhVRZFAzJqyZBS3tF.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b5db7ab5-3a04-4cfa-81db-107112699827","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Having the ability to add heat to your carpet cleaning solution is a big plus when trying to remove dirt from heavily soiled areas. The Bissell ProHeat 2X Select Pet is one of the carpet cleaners that is equipped with a water heater that will allow you to increase your tap water temperature an additional 25 degrees, for better cleaning performance. Although you can increase the water temperature, there is a safety feature that will not allow the water to exceed 190 degrees.","The water tank on this carpet cleaning machine is a 1-gallon 2-in-1, which means that there is a bladder inside of the water tank that holds the cleaning solution. When the dirty water is pulled out of your carpets it is sucked back into the water tank itself, and fills the area outside of the bladder. This system works well on carpet cleaners and keeps the clean water separate from the dirty water without taking up any additional space on the machine. It is also easier to carry one tank to the sink to empty and refill instead of having to worry about two different tanks.","This is one of those carpet cleaning machines that offer several on-board tools to help you clean in a variety of different situations. Included with the purchase of this carpet shampooer you will receive a 3-inch hand-held brush that will help you scrub those hard to reach stains. It also comes with a 6-inch hand-held pet tool that allows you to force cleaning solution deep into the stain to remove it completely. This tool allows you to clean carpet from the bottom up, which will ensure that stains do not resurface.","This unit also comes with a spraying crevice tool that will help you clean up those difficult to get to stains around your house. For those looking to clean more than just their carpet, the Bissell ProHeat 2X Select Pet also comes with a 4-inch upholstery tool. This brush can help you to clean your favorite chair or the interior of your car or truck in a snap."]},"id":"0c097e2f-dc16-441b-9d52-591ab30e0ce2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"ab679dcb-e687-474a-8fac-6ca5e5fe9864","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/A8KMwRb6gxCBtJiJoY9coP.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This is one of those carpet cleaning machines that is designed for tough jobs.

If you are lucky enough to purchase a demo model, you may not have to worry about putting the unit together. However, chances are that you will have to quickly learn how to assemble carpet cleaners before you can use your new unit. The Bissell ProHeat 2X Select Pet comes in three different pieces and you can assemble it quickly using only a Phillips-head screwdriver.","Another feature we liked about this carpet cleaning solution is its 30-foot-long power cord. It is much easier and more efficient to clean your carpets when you are able to run the machine over the carpeting without having to spend time looking for a different outlet to plug your carpet shampooer into.","We would have liked to see this unit come with a 13-inch cleaning path width; however, among carpet cleaners the 12-inch cleaning path width is also a good size. By having a larger cleaning width you will spend more time enjoying the freshness that fills your home after you have cleaned your carpets and upholstery and less time cleaning your carpets.","The Bissell ProHeat 2X Select Pet is one of the few carpet cleaners we reviewed that comes with automatic height control. This option allows the machine to automatically adjust  for the perfect height away from the flooring for maximum cleaning. This feature also allows you to move from carpet to hardwood floor without having to readjust the height of the machine."]},"id":"7b4ec550-7611-4ec1-867a-3be32e7f66ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience"},"id":"3084d020-b229-40b1-900c-cc90b9e99c3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/29xcf97ooHcTeRcWGWqLxc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The name Bissell is very well known in the world of carpet cleaners.
