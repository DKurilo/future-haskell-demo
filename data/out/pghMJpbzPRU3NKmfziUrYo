Platinum Collection Bagged Upright was the lightest vacuum cleaner we tested, which is a great thing if you have a lot of stairs in your home. It also had the best cleaning performance of any competitor on medium-pile carpeting. Since that is the most common flooring in homes, that is a pretty big advantage.","There are some disadvantages with this unit, though. It seems pretty pared down and old-fashioned compared with other <a href=\"/best-deep-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaners</a>. There isn&#39;t even a hose you can deploy for cleaning stairs and furniture like the <a href=\"/shark-apex-review\">Shark APEX DuoClean</a>. It is just an upright for cleaning floors. It&#39;s good at cleaning them, though – at least the carpeted ones.","This Hoover struggled quite a bit on hardwood flooring, especially when removing flour. It took more passes than any other vacuum on that task, and never really cleaned it completely. However, the Hoover was exceptional on carpet.","The Hoover Platinum Collection Bagged Upright far less versatile than others we tested. Others boast hoses and tools to clean any surface – in most cases right on the vacuum body. Hoover partly makes up for its shortcomings by including a small separate vacuum in the purchase of the Platinum Collection Bagged Upright. It is an unimpressive unit, but at least it has a hose and some of the tools you need for cleaning furniture, drapes and other areas of your home. It also has a strap that allows you to sling it over your shoulder so you can take it where you need it. Having to switch out vacuum cleaners at any point in the cleaning process will seem almost ridiculous if you are used to having those tools built into your upright, but it does make for a very light machine. The Hoover Platinum Collection Bagged has a wide cleaning path that makes the cleaning go even a little faster, too.","Buying a bagged unit like this means a little bit more hassle and expense when it is time to replace the bags. However, the bagged units are better at containing dust, especially when it is time to empty your machine, so allergy sufferers would do well to consider a vacuum cleaner with bags like this.","This one struggled on some maneuverability tests because it does not have a swiveling head. That made it hard to get around table and chair legs in some cases. It was helpful on low-slung furniture, though, because it can be dramatically reclined before the cleaning head loses contact with the floor. That means you can get pretty far under beds and similar pieces without breaking out the separate vacuum with the hose.","For being so pared down and light, this vacuum is quite noisy. Only two others were louder during testing. Vacuum cleaners make a lot of sound by nature, but if you sometimes clean at odd times or live in an apartment, you might need a quieter option."]},"id":"48860b59-3dfb-4d91-a479-57953b7f4385","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ff2de3e6-589c-4066-b908-5e4365156a34","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This vacuum cleaner looks like a quirky blast from the past with its pared-down design, but it’s really powerful on carpeted areas and so lightweight that you can haul it up and down stairs easily.
