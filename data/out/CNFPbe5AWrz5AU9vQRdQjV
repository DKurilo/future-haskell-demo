You can burn both CDs and DVDs, but its DVD burning options are by far the most impressive part of its offerings. You can choose from one of nine different DVD burning options, including the ability to copy DVDs and create bootable DVDs. We thought this program was one of the easiest to use and most powerful of this category. Unfortunately, since it doesn&#39;t focus on either CD or DVD burning, you&#39;re left with a program that&#39;s understandably spread thin trying to give two complex technological pursuits equal attention. You&#39;re going to get the job done if you decide to take a chance on this program, but the fact it doubles as CD burning software doesn&#39;t do good things for its feature set and other areas of the program.","Nero Burning ROM truly has (almost) it all: DVD burn capabilities, DVD authoring, virtual imaging, CD and music functions and more.","This program&#39;s data burning supports CDs and DVDs but it did prove a bit confusing to get to the right place – there are a lot of menus and options and sometimes there is more than one way to get to the function you want. But once you get there, drag and drop the data information you want to copy and burn into the Nero interface and click the burn button. Reading and writing ISO files is perhaps one of Nero Burning ROM’s most valuable data tools. ISO files are complete images taken of the data or disc and stored in an uncompressed format.","Although Nero Burning ROM only rips CDs to MP3, its own Nero Digital or WAV formats, it can read most other music formats including WMA and AAC. Nero also converts tracks to MP3, M4A/MP4 (similar to AAC), WMA, FLAC, OGG and more. Other music and audio features include the ability to edit and record sound files, and edit and mix music. Nero does not convert AVI files and has no video convertor function, which is really its weakest link.","Nero Burning ROM&#39;s capabilities when it comes to ripping and burning are still known as the most reliable and established in the industry. We successfully burned and copied from our hard drive to CD, DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Nero also supports DVD-R Dual Layer and DVD+R Double Layer support, which allows us to fit more data on just one disc.","Successful tests included burning to our hard drive, from our hard drive, and onto any disc we wanted. This program has a full array of compression techniques as well. Nero Rescue Agent is another helpful feature that helps you recover major file systems on optical drives, USB storage devices, memory cards, hard drives, floppies and more.","The Nero Burning ROM menus look great, but are a bit difficult to understand sometimes. This program will take some familiarization time. But long-time users swear by its functionality and well organized interface. For instance, the Burn Data and Copy Disc functions take you to the same place, but offer slightly different output destinations. Copy Disc is ideal for making just a straight copy, but you can also accomplish the same thing from Burn Data. I’m sure if we’d had more time to get used to the interface it wouldn’t have been as frustrating trying to interpret the various menu options.","Installation was a breeze – though it took 30+ minutes to download, run, install and get going with projects. You have the option of downloading a free trial – it is a good idea to try it out and see if you like it. As long as it’s free, why not? If you don’t like it, uninstall and move on to the next program you’d like to try. The un-install took close to an hour though and even the trial software comes with bundled programs that embed deeply into your system.","As far as testing goes we test-copied and burned an unencrypted DVD to our hard drive and successfully outputted the file to our test iPod. It was a little confusing navigating all the menu options, but once we blundered into it, the actual conversion and copying was easy and pretty fast. The same scenario applied to our DVD-to-DVD test - it even lets you select the burning speed. Another successful test was conducted wherein we accomplished the erasing of a re-writable DVD. There are plenty of great features in Nero - in fact, Nero has all of our matrix features. The problem is just figuring out how to get to the point where you can use the features."]},"id":"3279e501-204f-467f-b600-5b8abf80c3e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e67c1521-40aa-4ab8-9a9d-76a57e0e08a0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Nero Burning ROM has the look of a well designed DVD burning software program but it doesn’t really deliver on many points: mainly ease of use and functionality in general.
