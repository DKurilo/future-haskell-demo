The application offers a cinema mode, specifically designed for distant viewing, and multi-language support for both audio and subtitles. Additionally, it has digital zooming, auto-resume playback, and a virtual remote control, so users can effortlessly navigate BD menus through the software interface.","These days, most PC multimedia players are outfitted with a cluster of internet features geared towards interactivity and social networking. CinePlayer BD is no exception and does an excellent job of seamlessly integrating a social element for its users. For starters, the software supports interactive Blu-ray and BD-Live features. This means users can access bonus online film content supplied by motion picture studios not stored on the actual disc. Users can also download movie trailers, upload their own YouTube videos and more.","As the Blu-ray player software&#39;s name indicates, CinePlayer BD with 3D also offers robust 3D functionality. The software is compatible with Blu-ray 3D movie and 3D DVDs, though users must have additional compatible hardware to sufficiently view 3D content.","While CinePlayer BD with 3D delivers superb, high-definition playback, it does lack a few notable features offered by other competitors.

The multimedia player delivers rich, high-definition output that seems on par with the studio master and gives users a stunning cinematic experience regardless of their viewing configuration.","Playback compatibility is another asset of the BD player software.
