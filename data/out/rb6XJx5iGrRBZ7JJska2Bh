Also, you can specify at what security level your software accesses these websites.","The main items you can customize include how your firewall controls your software; you can allow or deny each program access to the Internet. For example, let&#39;s say you have some children&#39;s software that pesters you to register constantly, even though you already have. Your firewall can block this request so your children can run their software without being interrupted by invitations to go online.","The control panel has three stop signs along the top bar; the green light allows full online access, the yellow light allows conditional access, and the red light lets you stop all Internet access immediately.","Some of the conditions you can set for Internet access include direction; you can block outgoing but allow incoming data for a specific website. You can get picky about which ports (doorways) the software uses to receive and transmit, you can specify a security level and you can set other conditions as well.","Privatefirewall has a log view that shows the time and date of every data arrival and departure for software applications."]},"id":"5e135ba2-162d-4e2e-9877-2bc719c99b5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"User Experience"},"id":"b85c5a31-0015-4c4d-91ee-8fc1d6c53367","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Privatefirewall was easy to use.
