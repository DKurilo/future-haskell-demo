The Pro Line toaster’s design coordinates well with the KitchenAid’s iconic 1937 stand mixer and with other appliances in the line, but it can stand alone to give a designer-level accent to any kitchen counter. The Pro Line toaster is designed with a heavyweight die-cast frame, and it comes in four colors. The frame adds weight to the toaster, with the four-slice model weighing 18 pounds. This makes the toaster difficult to move if you don&#39;t plan to store it on the countertop. The toaster&#39;s design lends itself to easy cleanup. You can wipe the sides of the toaster without fear of losing its shine. It also doesn&#39;t pick up visible fingerprints like other high-gloss metal toasters. The toaster includes a removable crumb tray that eliminates the troublesome task of shaking clean the toasting elements.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58445-kitchenaid-pro-line1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PY7Akk44xUwxvvRS7gXNfG.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"PY7Akk44xUwxvvRS7gXNfG","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PY7Akk44xUwxvvRS7gXNfG.jpg","alt":""},"id":"812c2094-62c9-47dc-8771-ab2659bcfb07","type":"image"},{"data":{"text":"Safety"},"id":"9f8a40db-e8f3-415c-b1ac-f0ac86b92125","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/JeUbAuqVRS4oxqAfmg4wCF.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The KitchenAid Pro Line carries an amazing five-year warranty.
