The DAV-HDX576WF matches Sony’s TVs in both form and function. Paired together they make a pretty nice setup.","The DAV-HDX576WF features two floor standing speakers, two rear speakers, a center channel speaker, and a subwoofer.","The DVD/CD changer duties are handled by an elevator type system that keeps the system relatively small. The only downside is load times, waiting for the changer to shuffle discs.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>","S-Air Technology","BRAVIA Sync","Digital Media Port","HDMI Output","Digital Cinema Auto Calibration","<strong>Features</strong>","Perhaps one of the biggest features on the DAV-HDX576WF is the S-AIR technology. Included with this theater system is a box type device that, when taken to another room, allows the user to stream music wirelessly from the main unit. Sort of a simple multi-room setup if you will.","With Sony’s BRAVIA Sync, you can connect other equipment to the main unit, and control it through the connected HDMI cables. This makes it easier and faster to get all your gear turned on and means watching your movies just got easier.","In addition to holding 5 CDs of DVDs, the DVD player will output the signal in 1080p. The neat part is, if you are connecting this to your Sony BRAVIA TV, the system will automatically determine the best resolution based on your TV. This means fewer things to mess up while setting it up.","And speaking of setup, the DAV-HDX576WF comes with a setup mic that makes setting up your new system a breeze. Simply place the mic in your listening position, and press a button. Done. This will automatically determine the optimal settings for you new system.","Sony didn’t forget the portable media user either. The Digital Media Port means that you are able to connect your iPod and control it via the remote control. In addition, the amplifier features an audio enhancer that will improve those less-than-perfect recordings you might have on your iPod.","<strong>Summary of Reviews from Across the Internet</strong>","The ease of use and relatively nice feature spec impressed the expert reviewers. The larger display screen makes it easy for the user to see exactly what operations are being performed.","Users liked the easy setup options and the overall sound quality of the DAV-HDX576WF. When paired with a Sony TV, the features were easy to use and operate.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The DAV-HDX576WF is a good value and would work well for someone that had a matching BRAVIA line TV to go with it."]},"id":"28b32093-8b69-4b8e-b2d4-2dfd20978fb5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_27358","url":"/sony-dav-hdx576wf-24144-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-10-31T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-10-31T06:00:00Z","name":"Sony DAV HDX 576WF DAV HDX576WF","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":41,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-10-31T20:47:21Z","id":"updoqxRy388yYJPDDXtRsQ","meta":{"title":"Sony DAV HDX 576WF DAV HDX576WF Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
