The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"http://www.toptenreviews.com/best-3d-printers\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","The UP Mini 3D printer keeps you and your small prints safe from harm. Perfect for any small desk or cramped office, the UP Mini is compact and efficient.","Your 3D designs will need to be scaled down because the UP Mini can only print objects up to 4.7 x 4.7 x 4.7 inches. They also print very slowly, with speeds ranging from 3-30 mm per second. For how slow this printer prints, it would be nice to see a high resolution, but the UP Mini&#39;s smallest layer height is 0.2 mm, which is only average for the best 3D Printers.","ABS and PLA are both compatible with the UP mini printer. Either purchase $41 replacement cartridges from the manufacturer, or use any 1.75 mm universal cartridge for your printing needs. The UP Mini also only have one print head, so that means no multicolor prints unfortunately.","This metal printer has many of the best aspects of 3D printing technology. The design features a housing enclosure and a heated platform. The enclosure prevents your ABS prints from warping too much from environmental humidity and other factors. It also improves the safety of the UP Mini; now, little hands and fingers aren&#39;t in danger of getting burned while watching models print.","PP3DP offers many different support options for you and the UP Mini 3D printer. Email and phone support for the U.S., plus a blog, community forum and a manual are all available on the website for quick solutions. There is a three- to four-week lead time for the UP Mini, so order in advance. Also, this 3D printer is covered by a one-year warranty â€“ much longer than many other 3D printing systems.","Before you buy a 3D printer, make sure it&#39;s compatible with your home or office computer. The printer connects via USB cable to Windows and Mac operating systems, but is not Linux capable. USB also happens to be the only connection available; no flash drive, SD card or WiFi printing here. However, you can unplug the cable once your print is sent to the printer, which will free up your computer for the hours it&#39;ll take to print.","Software for the UP Mini is not downloadable from the PP3DP website; you&#39;ll have to find your own 3D design software. Any CAD program or free modeling software such as Repetier will work, though. The UP Mini does come with its own power supply, USB cord, maintenance tools and starter filament cartridge."]},"id":"dba8f0a9-81ca-4cd8-b0eb-b6556080e5ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8a5fcd35-8008-45d3-a723-e80252ae7bfa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The UP Mini 3D printer is one of the safest 3D printers and keeps the heated platform well concealed behind a housing enclosure.
