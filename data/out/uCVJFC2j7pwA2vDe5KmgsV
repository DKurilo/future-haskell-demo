Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","TomTom makes several general levels of <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> units. Some of the more feature-packed devices include the designation GO in the model number. Some of the mid-level devices have XL in the model, and the most basic units include ONE in their designations. From that, we know that this device, the<strong> XL 330 S</strong>, is characteristic of a middle category of devices.","Another note regarding designations in model numbers: for TomTom the S means that the device features text to speech technology and we find that very important because that is the feature that allows the unit to tell you, audibly, the actual names of streets to turn on. For example, the XL 330 S will say “Turn right on Johnson Street” where a lesser unit might say only “Turn right in 20 yards.” This allows you to keep your eyes on the road instead of watching the display screen.","Overall, the latest navigation GPS models from many different brands outshine the XL 330 S pretty solidly, but there are still things to like about this unit.","Typical of TomTom units, the XL 330 S has a very responsive and customizable touchscreen. Another standout feature is that it has voice recognition, allowing you to verbally tell the device where you want to go rather than typing the information. This is an invaluable feature and promotes safety when you need to input data on the fly. This bit of technology also allows for an emergency menu that can help you to find the nearest hospital, police or fire station completely by voice commands.","On the down side, the XL 330 S lacks the IQ Routes feature. IQ Routes is an intelligent programming feature that takes historical traffic data for days of the week and time of day into consideration for avoiding rush hour bottlenecks. Also lacking on the XL 330 S is an integrated traffic receiver. You can’t get real time traffic data unless you opt to buy an optional receiver. Absent also are multimedia features like an MP3 player and many of the sophisticated screen functions of the latest models. Some of the newer navigation GPS units allow you to maneuver the perspective on the screen by simply pinching your fingers together on the surface of the screen.","Though the XL 330 S has Bluetooth connectivity to pair with your cell phone, there are a rather limited number of phones that work with it. Check with the manufacturer to make sure that your phone is one that will pair with this navigation GPS unit if you plan to use that feature. Being able to make calls through your navigation GPS receiver will mean less time with your hands off the wheel, a great bonus for safety."]},"id":"318e4396-4f77-4933-984b-c8c06a3abb4f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3c45a16a-69dd-4b7d-ad5b-eccdb05e3722","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>TomTom XL 330 S</strong> is a solid navigation GPS device which includes many features that you’re likely to need but doesn’t have some of the options that have become common on the latest models from all navigation GPS manufacturers.
