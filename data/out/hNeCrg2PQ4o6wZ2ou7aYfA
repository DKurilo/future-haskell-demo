You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Homax 211-Gallon Inflatable 4-Person Round Portable Hot Tub is an <a href=\"/best-inflatable-hot-tubs\">inflatable hot tub</a> made by an unlikely manufacturer, Homax, better known for its wide selection of home repair products. However, Homax has turned its expertise in sealants and synthetic materials toward portable spa products, and the result is a well-made inflatable spa that you can set up at home or take with you when you travel.","The hot tub is made of a laminated material that sandwiches nylon fabric between layers of PVC for a stronger material than PVC or vinyl alone. The tub measures 71 inches across, and with an interior diameter of 55 inches and a depth of 25.6 inches, it holds up to 211 gallons of water. While Homax indicates that this model will seat four people, similarly sized hot tubs from other manufacturers are recommended for two adults and two children, so it may be a little cramped trying to fit four grown adults in the tub at once. The uninflated, unfilled tub weighs 53 pounds, making it one of the more portable options on the inflatable hot tub market.","The tub includes a combined pump and heater, along with an air blower that powers the tub’s 130 bubble jets. Unlike the majority of portable inflatable hot tubs, this unit has the combined pump and heater built into the side of the tub. In most other models house the pump and heater as a separate external unit. The heater and jets are controlled with a digital control panel mounted to the wall of the tub, with a maximum temperature of 104 F.","The tub also comes with a fitted top cover that has a foil lining to help trap and retain heat, as well as locking straps to secure the cover for long periods. A black PVC ground mat provides a protective layer between the tub and the ground.","In addition to the cover and ground mat, the tub comes with two filter cartridges, a pack of water test strips and a repair kit with two patches. Homax covers the pump and heater unit with a 12-month warranty, but it only covers the inflatable tub with a six-month warranty. Additionally, if you look for a support page on the Homax website, you won’t find its hot tubs listed anywhere. Instead the company sells its products through a dedicated Amazon store, which makes buying simple, but it complicates getting any sort of customer support. Some hunting online will get you a customer service number in China, but it’s not toll free.","The Homax 211-Gallon Inflatable 4-Person Round Portable Hot Tub has some premium features, like a built-in pump and heater, sturdy PVC and nylon laminated construction and a generous selection of included accessories. What may give you pause, however, is the difference in warranty coverage between the electrical components and the inflatable tub, paired with the difficulty in getting customer service should you need it."]},"id":"dc8be10f-0b11-440a-8459-daa41018aab0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67244","url":"/homax-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-16T14:24:18Z","datePublished":"2015-10-16T14:24:18Z","name":"Homax 4-person Round PH050017","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-16T14:24:18Z","id":"hNeCrg2PQ4o6wZ2ou7aYfA","meta":{"title":"Homax 4-person Round PH050017 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Homax 211-Gallon Inflatable 4-Person Round Portable Hot Tub is an inflatable hot tub from an unexpected manufacturer.
