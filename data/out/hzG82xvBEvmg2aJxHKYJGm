It’s also easy to clean thanks to the cooktop’s deep-well design, which keeps spills from spreading. Further, the range is equipped with sealed burners, so spills can&#39;t fall below the stovetop and create a baked-on mess. In addition, the EI30GF45QS’s oven has a heat self-cleaning cycle you can customize to the interior’s soil level – light, medium and heavy. The only cleaning feature it’s missing is a steam self-cleaning cycle, which is a quick and easy way to maintain a clean oven.","The Electrolux EI30GF45QS gas stove has five stovetop burners with an exceptional range of heat outputs. Positioned in the right front corner, the primary burner outputs 18,000 Btu of heat, which is hot enough to quickly bring a big pot of water to a boil. The second most powerful burner sits in the left rear corner and produces 14,200 Btu of heat. The left front burner has a 9,500 Btu rating, and the right rear burner creates up to 5,000 Btu of heat – warm enough to melt delicate foods like butter or chocolate without damaging them. This range comes with an integrated reversible griddle/grill, and it works best on the oval-shape burner in the center of the stovetop, which reaches 10,000 Btu.","The stove’s grates sit at countertop level, making it easy to move heavy pots between the cooktop and counter. Also, the cast iron grates are continuous, so you can move heavy pans from one burner to the next without lifting them.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"57ecd743-adc8-4444-9b43-25db8b927f2e","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Electrolux includes a one-year warranty that covers parts and labor, and if you register your range, you get an additional two years on the parts warranty.
