The Kobalt, by contrast, only requires you to insert the battery and fill the chain-oil tank. Starting is as easy as holding down the safety button and pulling the trigger.

He emphasized safety above everything else. “You have to respect the saw, if you don’t you can definitely get killed.”","He likened buying a chainsaw to riding a motorcycle, “If you have bought a motor cycle, you get a safety course, you should have one for chainsaws too.” He recommended asking the dealer you buy your chainsaw from if they offer classes or recommend ones you can take. He cautioned against the mindset that chainsaws are just another power tool. “When you take that tool on, you don’t think it’s dangerous - any model at any level can hurt or kill you,” said Bustos.","When we asked him about the different types of chainsaws, he said it’s all about the situation you use them in. Of gas vs. electric he said that, “Gas ones can go quite a while,” noting there’s about a two-hour limit on electric models.

All the saws were put through these tests for more than a week. This gave us a great idea of how well each saw would perform for common yard work.","<strong>How Much Does a Chainsaw Cost?</strong>","The cost of chainsaws varies widely depending on the type of chainsaw, brand and size of the motor. Corded and battery-powered models cost anywhere from $62 to $179. The gas models that we compared cost $175 to $200. If you aren’t a professional and just need a chainsaw for smaller cleanup projects around the yard, this is the price range you should be looking at.","<strong>Safety</strong>","<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/chainsaws.html\">According to the CDC</a>, an estimated 36,000 people per year are treated in emergency rooms for chainsaw related injuries. This number increases after storms and natural disasters.","To keep yourself out of harm&#39;s way, we strongly encourage you to use ear protection, chaps, goggles and gloves. It&#39;s best to wear fitted clothes that cover your whole body and a helmet, especially when working in trees.","Never, ever operate a chainsaw under the influence and be sure to keep children and pets away from the work site. There are many online chainsaw safety courses available that can teach you how to operate, store and maintain your chainsaw properly. Proper maintenance keeps the saw&#39;s chain sharp and well lubricated, preventing kickback.","The grip and weight of a saw have a huge effect on its performance of the user. A saw without anti-vibration features can fatigue your hands quickly, making it hard to hold the saw and work safely. Since power source comes down to preference, if you don&#39;t need a powerful beast of a saw, go with an electric model. If you want power and use the saw often, gas is a good direction to take.","<strong>Parts &amp; Maintenance </strong>","We tested each chainsaw’s performance as thoroughly as possible, but other factors play a role in the experience you have owning and using your chainsaw. If you&#39;re new to chainsaw maintenance, you may want to consider a saw available through licensed dealers.","Chainsaw brands like <a href=\"/best-stihl-chainsaws\">Stihl</a>, Husqvarna, and <a href=\"/echo-review\">Echo</a> can be purchased from licensed dealers. In case you encounter problems with the chainsaw, you can take it back to these dealers for repairs. This ensures the people working on your chainsaw are experts and have the parts you need. The websites for these models have store locators to find a dealer nearby to help with maintenance and repair.","Whether it&#39;s a gas or electric model, storage, cleaning and routine replacements are essential to keeping your chainsaw operational. For both power types, you should complete several routine procedures before and after use. Before you start your chainsaw, check for leaks, cracks or obvious damage, test the throttle, choke, trigger lockout and stop switch. The chain brake, chain, bar, fuel and oil levels will also need your attention before you start a job. After you&#39;ve finished the job, clean the entire chainsaw while paying special attention to the air filter and cylinder fins.","Chances are you store your chainsaw away during the winter, and both gas and electric models store similarly. Before you put your saw away for an extended period, drain the fuel and oil from the chainsaw. This prevents residue build up and potential fire hazards that come with storing such flammable materials. For gas models, run the engine until the carburetor is dry. This keeps the diaphragms from sticking together. For both types of chainsaw, remove the chain and guide bar before storing and wipe the machine down.","<strong>How Do I Know If My Chainsaw Is Dull?</strong>","The more you work with and get to know your chainsaw, the easier it is to recognize when it needs sharpening.

If you don&#39;t know how to properly sharpen the blade, we recommend heading to a dealer with expertise in your brand of chainsaw.","<strong>Are STIHL Chainsaws the Best?</strong>","STIHL certainly makes a good case for being one of the best brand of chainsaws.  If you’re willing to put out the cash for a fine chainsaw, it’s worth a trip to the hardware store to look at a STIHL.","By most accounts, you can expect these saws to be powerful, durable, reliable and long lasting. The <a href=\"/stihl-review\">STIHL MS170</a> performed well in our tests, but missed out on being our best overall pick due to its price and entry-level nature. We found it to be smooth, fast and agile, making clean, straight cuts every time we used it.","One other thing to note about STIHL chainsaws is that it’s almost impossible to purchase them online. You’ll have to go to a local STIHL dealer, which you’ll be able to find through the company’s <a href=\"https://www.stihlusa.com/locator/search/?Sku=msa120cbq\">dealer locator</a> on their website.<br/><strong><br/>The Alligator Lopper</strong><br/>","If you’re mainly interested in pruning trees and cutting back bushes, a full-sized chainsaw might be more than you need. A better choice may be a unique device from Black &amp; Decker called the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-LP1000-Alligator-Electric/dp/B000BANMUY/\">Alligator Lopper</a>. It’s an amusing name, but it’s design, which is something of a marriage between a set of pruning shears and a chainsaw, actually resembles an alligator.","The Alligator Lopper is specifically designed for small tree branches and thick shrubbery. The 6-inch chainsaw is powered by a 4.5 amp motor, which can handle branches up to four inches thick. The tool’s clamping jaw holds the branch in place while the saw cuts, making it more accurate, smooth and safe than a full-sized chainsaw.","The chainsaw weighs 6.5 pounds, so anyone can use it for an extended period without becoming exhausted. The Alligator Lopper comes in both corded and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZW9ZL8/ref=psdc_552918_t1_B000BANMUY\">battery-powered</a> models. If you&#39;ll be keeping it in your yard, go with the corded model, so you don’t have to worry about charging the battery. If you plan to take it on the road or do some high in-tree work, the battery-powered model is probably your best bet.","You can buy this chainsaw for less than $100, so it’s a great price, especially if you do yard work often."]},"id":"5f874769-ec10-49f4-a6d2-4c8a246dab24","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"90ed9edd-f9ae-4b4a-8246-f37817f77954","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/echo-review\">Echo CS-310-14</a>","<a href=\"/worx-review\">WORX WG303.1</a>","<a href=\"/stihl-review\">Stihl MS170</a>","<a href=\"/husqvarna-review\">Husqvarna 240</a>","<a href=\"/homelite-review\">Homelite XL-12 Electric Chainsaw</a>","<a href=\"/craftsman-34120-review\">Craftsman 34120</a>","<a href=\"/remington-rm1645-review\">Remington RM1645</a>","<a href=\"/poulan-pro-review\">Poulan Pro</a>","<a href=\"/kobalt-review\">Kobalt KCS 120-07</a>","<a href=\"/black-and-decker-review\">Black &amp; Decker LCS1020</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"31adbc7e-4957-465d-a2d4-da1b64466f4d","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_271","url":"/best-chainsaws","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
