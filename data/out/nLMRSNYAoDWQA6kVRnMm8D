Whether you are already part of this growing industry or you are considering starting your own mobile restaurant business, a <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-credit-card-processing\">mobile POS solution</a> will help you process all types of payments, freeing you from a cash-only operation to provide your customers with the payment options of their choice.","In the food truck business, most food vendors cannot depend on a traditional Wi-Fi connection and will need to purchase a data plan for a mobile device to process payments. The simplest solution is a mobile credit card processing agreement with a company such as BluePay, Square or Intuit. However, other point-of-sale companies offer full POS solutions that can also help you manage inventory, customer contact information and loyalty programs.","Here are three mobile POS options to consider for your food truck business:","<strong>Mobile Credit Card Processors</strong><br/>Most mobile credit card processors do not charge for the mobile app or the credit card readers. But they do charge per swipe or per transaction. The benefit, of course, is that you only have to pay for it when you use it. Some offer the choice of a low monthly fee in exchange for a lower per-swipe fee. Popular services include Square, GoPayment, iPayments, Amazon Local Register and PayPal. These solutions require minimal upfront investment. You only need to have a smartphone or tablet with a data plan.","<strong> </strong>","<strong> iPad Restaurant POS</strong><br/>iPad or tablet point-of-sale solutions also require internet access. These solutions are specifically designed to process food orders and manage food inventory, employee schedules and customer data. Some require a monthly subscription fee, while others offer the software in exchange for swipe fees. Popular solutions include Digital Dining, Revel, Ambur, Breadcrumb, ShopKeep, NCR and Lavu.","<strong>All-in-One Touchscreen POS Systems</strong><br/>Some point-of-sale companies create solutions specifically for food trucks. These systems are shipped to you preloaded with restaurant software such and Adelo for Restaurants Lite. All-in-one solutions often also include card readers, cash drawers, receipt printers and keyboards. POS companies that provide this type of solution include SunrisePOS, Biyo and GoPago. These systems require a bit more up front but often allow you the freedom to choose your own credit card processor, and the hardware is durable.","By far, the most popular type of food truck point-of-sale solution right now is the iPad restaurant solution. The upfront costs are minimal, and usually food truck vendors do not require additional hardware such as cash drawers and receipt printers. In addition, most food trucks sell a limited menu that may not require a complex inventory control system to manage. Whatever system you decide will work for you, you will reap a larger portion of the trillion-dollar industry by being able to accept all types of payments from your customers."]},"id":"c7042e5b-ecf1-4cab-8cb8-5cad65f48f03","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8688","url":"/mobile-pos-options-for-food-trucks","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"pamela-s-stevens","url":"/author/pamela-s-stevens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Pamela S Stevens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"e9bBMEAQ9LLhA3c2cSq39Z","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-26T15:40:32Z","datePublished":"2014-08-26T15:40:32Z","name":"Mobile POS Options for Food Trucks","synopsis":"According to ArmorActive, a Salt Lake City mobile technology company, Americans spent over $800 million in the past year and are expected to spend $1 trillion in 2015 at food trucks.","review":{},"strapline":"According to ArmorActive, a Salt Lake City mobile technology company, Americans spent over $800 million in the past year and are expected to spend $1 trillion in 2015 at food trucks.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-26T15:52:10Z","id":"nLMRSNYAoDWQA6kVRnMm8D","meta":{"title":"Mobile POS Options for Food Trucks","description":"Explore three mobile POS options for processing payments for your food truck business.
