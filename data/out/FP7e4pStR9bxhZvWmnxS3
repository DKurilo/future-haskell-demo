You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are in the market for a basic <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a>, the Phaser 6500N may have what you are looking for. This Xerox printer lacks several advanced tools but provides the necessities to get you by in either a home or office environment. Among these features are a monthly duty cycle of 40,000, 256MB of installed memory and a print speed of 24 pages per minute. The Phaser 6500N may not be the most powerful printer on the market today but it will do the job with high-quality results.","This laser printer can print both black and white and color documents at a speed of 24 pages per minute. This speed drastically reduces wait time, which is a benefit, especially for color prints. This device also has a 40,000 monthly duty cycle. This allows you to print up to 40,000 pages a month without causing any damage to the printer. This will be an adequate amount for a small office or for home use. We didn’t find any blurry or unclear print jobs when using this laser printer. The Phaser 6500N offers a maximum print resolution of 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch) for both black and white and color prints. This isn’t the highest level of resolution we found on a laser printer but it is adequate for a printer this basic.","One of the standout features available on the Phaser 6500N is the 256MB of installed memory available. This device also offers a paper tray that can hold up to 250 sheets of paper, which prevents the need to restock the tray on a frequent basis. This laser printer also has the ability to print on a variety of sizes up to the maximum size of 8.5 x 14 inches.","This printer offers several print features including booklet printing, poster printing and watermarks. Additionally, the first page will take 13 seconds for color and 12 seconds for black and white. There are no wireless printing capabilities with the Phaser 6500N, but it still offers Ethernet connections for simple networking and a USB 2.0 port for additional connectivity.","According to the Phaser 6500N’s specifications, this laser printer is not large and bulky, but unfortunately its appearance says otherwise. This laser printer is 16.4 inches tall, which makes it appear much larger and bulkier than it is. The device is only 15.9 inches wide and 16.75 inches deep, which is small compared to several similar devices. Additionally, it only weighs 40 pounds, which is much lighter than several similar printers. The control panel is located on the top of the device, which features a few buttons and a small display screen."]},"id":"d96aeae1-c598-4e3a-bb49-36e9b8d15e10","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cdb84520-aa15-4007-9d5a-00f08e3e4115","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though the Phaser 6500N doesn’t offer the most advanced features on a laser printer, this device still offers high-quality performance.
