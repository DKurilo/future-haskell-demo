The original review is below, but check out our current </em><a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\"><em>GPS Trackers</em></a><em> here.</em>","There are plenty of features to be found in the iTrack GPS Tracker, one of the few GPS trackers that don&#39;t require a subscription. The battery lasts six days in standby mode, and the device uses text alerts to send out tracking data to your mobile phone, which means no email alerts. It is a solid tracking device, nonetheless.","This GPS tracker’s features include both GPS and GSM cellular technology; the GPS tracks the unit’s location via satellite, while the GSM sends out the location, time, date and more. You’ll need to use a prepaid SIM card to use the iTrack GPS Tracker, or you can add it to your own cell plan. There’s no need for a paid monthly subscription because you’re calling the unit and receiving text messages with coordinates and other data.","Other features include a car kit, waterproof pouch, a waterproof magnetic case and a built-in mic. The battery can last up to 144 hours while tracking, however, the battery life during active use will depend on how often you call to get a location report. It takes about 12 hours to charge the batteries.","One of the ways you get tracking updates from the iTrack GPS Tracker is by calling the unit. It will immediately send you a text alert with latitude and longitude coordinates, the speed the iTrack is traveling (handy if your teen is driving), the date and time of the update and the tracker&#39;s battery life. There is also a hyperlink at the bottom of the text, which will show the position of the iTrack GPS Tracker on a map if you have a smartphone.","If you don’t have a smartphone, you can use Google Earth, Google Maps or ElectroFlip&#39;s own web-based mapping software to find the coordinates. Google Earth doesn’t require an internet connection once you’ve downloaded the software.","You will also receive alert text messages if the unit hasn’t moved for several minutes, when the device starts moving again, if the battery is running low and also if the geo-fence has been breached. A geo-fence is an area you designate where your child or teen is allowed to travel freely. This GPS tracker has built-in memory that can hold up to 16,000 position request. This internal memory is 1MB big, but it can support a 2GB microSD card.","The iTrack GPS Tracker is easy to use, and ElectroFlip includes plenty of help and support items to get you going with this tracking device. After setup, you and your child or teen should agree to areas they can travel in, by foot, bike or car, and then attach the unit to their backpack or the vehicle&#39;s dashboard. Then it’s easy to start tracking.","ElectroFlip includes plenty of help and support options to not only get you started, but to make sure the iTrack GPS Tracker continues to work well. There is a user manual, a how-to video and a FAQs page on their  website. The company encourages users to email or call if they need further help or support, plus you can request an RMA, or return form, if you need to return the device for repair."]},"id":"416b13ee-4696-45ed-b0a9-66590b73c68b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"deca9b13-1b24-4e0f-8e23-16f31013e526","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iTrack GPS Tracker is great if you don’t want to pay a monthly subscription fee, which can cost up to $30 or $40 per month, per device.
