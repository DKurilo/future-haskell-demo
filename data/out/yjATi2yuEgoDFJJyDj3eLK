During our testing process, we conducted a survey in which participants graded the optical quality of each pair of binoculars. Most participants found the images with the Vanguard weren&#39;t very clear, with some noting that images appeared blue or there was a slight blur around the ring.","This pair of low-powered binoculars has a 10x magnification, meaning that an object appears 10 times closer than it would without the eyepiece. This magnification makes these some of the best binoculars for general outdoor use, like boating and sports events.","The Vanguard ORROS has 42-millimeter objective lenses, resulting in bright images, so you can use these binoculars for birdwatching or in low-light settings, such as the forest at dawn if you go hunting. It also has a small minimum distance of 2.1 meters, which means you can see fine details when using it to view wildlife.","At 20.46 ounces, these binoculars weigh several ounces less than the average of the binoculars we reviewed, which was 26 ounces, so you can use them for longer without arm fatigue. The binoculars are tripod adaptable, so you can set them up on a tripod, which you purchase separately, when using them for an extended time.","A central knob allows you to focus both lenses at the same time and make quick adjustments to see clear images. This set of binoculars also has twist-up eyecups and an eye relief of 18 millimeters to make it easy for eyeglass wearers to use them.","The Vanguard ORROS uses BAK-4 prisms to direct more light toward your eyes and produce brighter images than you&#39;d get from binoculars that use other prism materials. The lenses are multicoated to allow more light through them. They also use roof prisms, which are lighter and more compact than Porro prisms, to reflect light to your eye.","This pair of binoculars is both waterproof and fogproof, which makes it tough enough for your outdoor adventures. If you take it boating or use it in the rain, you don&#39;t have to worry about water or condensation ruining the optics and prisms. The Vanguard ORROS also has rubber armor to protect it from damage if it accidentally gets bumped or dropped.","Like all the binocular manufacturers we reviewed, Vanguard offers a limited lifetime warranty to cover defects in materials or workmanship. If you have questions about your binoculars, you can&#39;t reach the company via live chat, but you can contact it by email or telephone."]},"id":"ba8a22d8-f417-4d06-b1f1-4b298c0e9e57","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"819bc3bd-6181-48a7-ac32-a3d698b136d9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vanguard ORROS is a good set of general-use binoculars, with a rugged, waterproof design that allows you to use it both on land and in the water.
