Memory foam reacts chemically to your body s temperature and creates that experience of support and comfort. However, if you re like other consumers, you may want a mattress you can lay down on and not fear for the types of chemicals you re inhaling or coming into contact with. Natural latex mattresses offer the same experience as memory foam but utilize an organic ingredient. Three models within the market are the <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Essentia Tatami Queen</a>, <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Lifekind Trio</a> and the <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Astrabeds SerenityBed</a>.","Natural latex is created from the sap of rubber trees specifically planted and maintained for latex and rubber production. These trees are tapped to create a regular and sustainable resource akin to maple syrup harvesting. The end result is a type of mattress support that doesn t require the use of dangerous and toxic chemicals to create a long-lasting and always-springy bed.","<strong>Latex Mattresses: What to Look For</strong>","Many different types of mattresses exist, and latex is among the least common of these types. The unique manufacturing process, in addition to the high price tags, makes such beds difficult to happen upon in most mattress stores. These beds aren t as widely available as memory foam due to their rigorous manufacturing process. However, the difference of materials ultimately lends toward the mattress  strengths and makes comparing it against regular memory foam mattresses an even more sensible process.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>One of the main appealing factors of the organic latex mattress over memory foam is the absence of chemical off-gassing. When you first purchase a memory foam mattress, you ll likely notice a very strong chemical odor that reportedly fades with time, a by-product of chemical off-gassing. Latex mattresses, on the other hand, are often made without toxic chemicals or hazardous additives and thus don t smell. In addition, due to their organic nature, the mattresses are also hypoallergenic and mold resistant, maintain their springiness after years of use and remain among the most durable mattresses on the market.","When picking a latex mattress, the design of the mattress is typically the same for any bed. Each layer is designed with holes throughout to encourage air circulation, heat reduction and moisture removal. However, the more comfortable and desirable mattresses are typically those with three or more layers of latex foam. This allows you to create varying levels of foam density for higher levels of comfort and support.","<strong>Latex Materials</strong><br/>While latex by itself is a natural and healthy alternative to memory foam, creating a 100-percent natural latex bed is incredibly expensive. To offset the cost of latex, many bed manufacturers create material blends that leverage the organic nature of latex with low-cost alternatives like synthetic latex, blends of natural and synthetic, and blends of natural and botanical latex. While a fully-organic latex bed may be the epitome of natural, healthy and earth-friendly mattresses, many latex beds will blend materials to create an alternative to all-natural.","The best materials found in latex mattresses are that of Dunlop and Talalay latex. The Dunlop process entails whipping rubber sap into a froth, pouring it into a mold, and then baking it. The natural materials found in rubber often settle to the bottom, resulting in latex layers being heavier on the bottom. The Talalay process adds two steps to Dunlop. After the latex is poured into a mold, the material is put in a vacuum chamber and flash-frozen before baking. The result is a latex more consistent in structure and more expensive.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>Of all the types of bed mattresses available to you, latex beds are reputed as the most long lasting of all mattresses. Due to the durable and breathable nature of latex, the mattress is better able to circulate air, retain spring and remain comfortable for a minimum of 10 years on average. Warranties help in protect you against product failures that might decrease the lifespan of your bed to anything shorter than that. The warranty of the mattress you choose should be sufficient to protect those first 10 years of use.","The all-natural latex mattress simulates the same experience as memory foam, contouring to your body and helping reduce back pressure. These mattresses respond instantly to your body s position, allowing you to easily change positions in the night. The result is a good night s rest and a longer-lasting mattress."]},"id":"b2e51f34-39f7-4b27-8df2-6ccdba4c8cd3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"04ff52f6-56c4-4f70-a63a-0fc83a82e3c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.astrabeds.com/serenitybed-latex-mattress.html\">Astrabeds SerenityBed</a>","<a href=\"http://thenaturalsleepstore.com/products/nove3.html\">Bella Sera Nove 3</a>","<a href=\"http://www.myessentia.com/mattresses/tatami\">Essentia Tatami</a>","<a href=\"http://www.urbangreenmattress.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=173&product_id=196\">Foam Sweet Foam Urban Green</a>","<a href=\"http://thenaturalsleepstore.com/products/green-sleep-dolcezza.html\">Green Sleep Dolcezza</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/30272122/#/70272120\">Ikea MORGONGÅVA</a>","<a href=\"http://www.lifekind.com/index.php/site_category_product/20/?from=5\">Lifekind Trio</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ER64RQQ/?&tag=ttr_latex-mattresses-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1219[art|NA[pid|59270[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Plushbeds Botanical Bliss</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7510723-10377208?url=https://www.allergybuyersclub.com/royal-pedic-latex-quilt-top-mattresses.html\">Royal Latex Quilt-Top</a>","<a href=\"http://sleeptek.ca/products/classic-3000\">Sleeptek Classic 3000</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"83b1d767-672e-4c27-b38e-4afd5d580a3d","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1219","url":"/best-latex-mattresses","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-06T22:37:51Z","datePublished":"2015-08-24T23:30:22Z","name":"Latex Mattresses Review","synopsis":"Latex mattresses are an organic building block to a good night's rest, offering the same experience as memory foam without all of the chemicals.","review":{},"strapline":"Latex mattresses are an organic building block to a good night's rest, offering the same experience as memory foam without all of the chemicals.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-24T23:30:22Z","id":"x8DvsrozrRMjYLmyqBk7BT","meta":{"title":"The Best Latex Mattresses - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Looking for the best latex mattress?
