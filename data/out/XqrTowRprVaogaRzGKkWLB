They are ideal for use in a standard home theater setting. These remotes can work with up to about 12 electronic devices from popular manufacturers, but they may not be compatible with newer devices. So if you have a mix of old and new electronics, you may want to forego a basic pre-programmed remote and opt for a newer learning remote instead. With pre-programmed remotes, you can quickly and easily enter a device’s control code and start using the remote with it.","Learning remotes are newer than pre-programmed ones, and with their enhanced features and abilities, they tend to cost more as well. You can use this kind of remote in a home theater as well as for other smart devices, like lighting or heating systems. Typically, you can sync them with more than 12 devices, so they are also great for households with a large variety of remote-controllable electronics in the home theater area. These remotes allow you to teach them a specific function that you want to apply.","Once you find the remote that’s right for your needs, and you get it synced with your devices, you’re all set. Some of these remotes even have automatic scan and setup functions, which tell the remote to scan through all available codes and find matches automatically, which makes setup even easier."]},"id":"56e28ffb-122d-4771-83b1-cae12507aca3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_259","url":"/best-universal-remotes","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-08T19:56:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-08T19:56:00Z","name":"Best Universal Remotes of 2019","synopsis":"After about eight hours of research and 10 hours of testing in our lab, we learned a lot about connecting even the most complicated of home entertainment systems to one remote control.
