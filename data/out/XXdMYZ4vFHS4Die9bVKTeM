It has a quick turnaround time to deposit funds in your account and an easy-to-navigate application process. While it is only available in five states, its other eligibility requirements are reasonable, and you can borrow up to $10,000. Additionally, LoanNow offers its own scoring system that rewards you for making your payments on time and completing other steps like credit education. Based on your behavior, you can grow your LoanNow score and unlock better rates for future loans.","This company offers installment loans instead of payday loans, which means that you can take a longer period of time to pay back your loan. Remember, though, that the longer you&#39;re in debt, the more money you have to repay. The longest possible loan term is 48 months, though we encourage you to pay  your loan in full much sooner than the maximum term if you can."]},"id":"d2573e4b-9e4f-4bff-900c-00c09270ee14","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Test"},"id":"03e52f8c-61f5-49e9-a6c5-47c8c0214609","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/BZBdNnVha5p5VKm45zMqpK.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The highest rate LoanNow charges is 299 percent, depending on the state you live in.
