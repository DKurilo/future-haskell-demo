We also review other travel services, including travel insurance and car rental services. We know how much goes into planning travel, and we look for and recommend services that make the process as easy as possible","For our evaluations, we focused on booking sites that let you complete the process through them, which means we did not include popular services like Kayak which aggregate results.","Most of the services we reviewed are owned by either Expedia or Priceline, so you may not find many differences in the hotels you find. If you’re a frequent traveler, look carefully at the rewards programs offered by each service. Many let you earn points for each dollar you spend, and frequent travelers can move up to different tiers.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","To test hotel booking services we used each site to book hotels in Los Angeles, New York City, Seattle, Chicago and Miami. We looked for the lowest price we could find in each of those cities and averaged the prices together. We also looked at the number of hotels we found in each city and averaged those results. When booking hotels, we looked to see how close we could get to downtown. Most services let you search by location, so you can stay as close to whatever attraction your visiting.","We also looked to see if you could rent cars, book flights and bundle those together. Bundling a hotel with a car rental or flight can save you money, and it is one of the chief benefits of these services.","We looked closely at the standard search features, including filtering by amenities and property type. We favored sites with a wide range of options, including hostels or apartments, which are usually cheaper than standard hotels.","The best hotel booking services offer price watching and price matching. With price watches you’ll get notifications if the price changes between the date of booking and your stay, and the service will reimburse you if you find a lower price than you paid.","We also evaluated the rewards programs offered for frequent travelers. With a rewards program you can earn points for each dollar you spend, which can then be redeemed for free stays and lower member rates. Many rewards programs have tiers, so you get more benefits the more often you book trips.","<strong>How to Use a Hotel Booking Service to Save Money</strong>","According to Statista, the average cost of a hotel room in 2018 is around $130. This fluctuates during the year, with January and November being the cheapest months and peak season happening in July. Through the services we reviewed, we were able to find hotels for as low as $44 a night. A lot depends on the city you’re travelling to – some cities peak at different times. You can also save by bundling flights with your hotel room. In our trials, we saw savings of up to $100, and in some cases we were able to get a flight and hotel for the same price as a flight.","<strong>Best Ways to Save on Hotel Bookings</strong>","Finding the right hotels for the right price can be tricky. Here’s some things to look for when booking your hotels.","Bundle: If you’re flying to your destination or plan on renting a car, see if the booking site will let you book those all at the same time; usually you’ll be able to save quite a bit. In some of our test runs we saved as much as 50 percent. We especially saw large savings on rental cars.","Rewards programs: Many of the sites we reviewed offer rewards programs that let you earn free stays after accruing enough points. You can also get special members-only prices. Many hotel chains offer rewards programs as well, which are more generous than those offered by the booking sites. However, the booking site’s programs work regardless of where you book your stay.","Search for other hotels: Check out the area you’re staying to see if there are other hotels in the area. Not all hotels want to partner with the booking sites. You may be able to get a better rate by calling and negotiating directly with the owner.","Try the hotels directly: Hotel booking sites are middlemen, and in some cases you may be able to get a better deal from the hotel directly. Also try to book for non-peak times. For resorts, book during the week, and if you’re looking at a business hotel, book during the weekend.","<strong>Airbnb vs. Hotel: Which Is Better?</strong>","Airbnb has become one of the most popular alternatives to a hotel. Each type of accommodation has advantages you should weigh before booking your stay.","Price: If price is your main concern, you may be surprised to find out that hotels tend to have lower prices than Airbnbs in general. Granted, hotels run the gamut from budget to luxury, so there’s a wide distribution of prices. According to <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5209426/travel-airbnb-hotel-places/\">Money</a> magazine, Airbnb prices rose 5.4 percent in 2018, while hotel prices rose around just 1 percent. Price also varies from city to city. In addition, both hotels and Airbnbs tend to adjust their pricing depending on season and local events, so you may find a better price when you travel during the off season.","Quality: Quality varies widely from Airbnb to Airbnb because the individual property owners are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance. Hotels and motels tend to be more standardized, though there’s always the risk of a substandard experience at both. Read customer reviews before booking to ensure you have a good stay.","Location: One benefit of an Airbnb is you can get one close to the attractions and places you want to see. For example, if you’re in town for a wedding, you can likely find an Airbnb within a few blocks of where the event will take place. In addition, with an Airbnb, you can find a place in the city that’s closer to what you want to see, and it can also give you a chance to experience places like the locals do.
