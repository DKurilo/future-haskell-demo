This <a href=\"/best-parental-software\">parental control software</a> is also easy to install and use.","This internet monitoring software has 18 filter categories – when you select one, the program automatically blocks any website with content that fits that classification. In addition, you can block all game sites online, or you can block games based on their Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rating or specific content. Other Net Nanny parental software tools include chat filtering and blocking.","Net Nanny can also mask profanity. This is useful if you want to allow your child to access sites like YouTube but don’t want them bombarded by the colorful language in the comments. The program disguises offensive language with symbols.","In addition to controlling which sites your child visits, you can use Net Nanny to set limits on the amount of time they spend on the internet. This website blocker comes with a scheduling feature that lets you grant or deny internet access. For example, you can restrict access during sleep hours or during homework and chore times. If your child needs to use the internet for homework assignments, Net Nanny lets you restrict access to certain websites, such as social media sites and online games, during study time.","This program lets you create individual user profiles and set restrictions based on age and maturity level. Net Nanny has age-based restrictions built in, so just by selecting your child’s age, certain blocks and filters are automatically applied. You can adjust these to include more filters or unblock certain websites.","While Net Nanny is a good internet monitoring program, some filtering and blocking capabilities that come with other parental control software aren’t included. For example, while Net Nanny lets you know if your child visits a social network site, such as YouTube, Facebook or Twitter, it doesn’t provide you detailed reports about their activity there, allow you to filter content or provide access to more specific anti-bullying tools. To access these features, you must purchase Net Nanny Social separately. Most of the software in our lineup, including <a href=\"/verity-review\">Verity</a>, offer this feature without additional cost.","Net Nanny records all visited websites as well as when you child accessed them and how long they stayed on the page. The program also snaps screenshots so you can view what your child sees. This is helpful since questionable ads and links can show up on legitimate sites. You can choose to filter content on a site rather than block it entirely. Filtering allows you child to interact with a good site, but the program blocks certain content such as dangerous ads.","This internet monitoring program captures transcripts of conversations that your child has in chat and instant message applications so you can keep an eye on who they speak with. It also records the words and keywords used in online searches.","Net Nanny is a subscription-based service. After buying the product, you receive a link for the download. Installation is straightforward, and the setup wizard walks you through the process of creating user profiles, setting filters and blocking websites. One advantage of Net Nanny’s design is you can access the parent portal remotely from any web-enabled device, so if you need to adjust setting, you don’t have to wait until you get home to do so."]},"id":"a315fb4e-5eb0-4446-acc8-0b9fc396f16c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ffc1faa7-463b-459e-8137-ca563976ad63","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Net Nanny effectively regulates your child’s access to online games, social media sites and internet content.
