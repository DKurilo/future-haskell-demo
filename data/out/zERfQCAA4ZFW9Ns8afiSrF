You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Eureka Brushroll Clean with SuctionSeal is a versatile <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright bagless vacuum</a> that cleans hard floors well and does a good job on carpeting, too, especially when it comes to pet hair. The patented sealed system worked well in our testing, and we could clear away any messes in short order with this vacuum, removing dust, fine particles and other debris with little effort on our part.","Although this bright orange cleaning machine came with a great deal of packaging and pieces to pull out of the box, it was easy to assemble in only 4.5 minutes. Once we started testing it, we were impressed. This works nicely on both carpeting and hardwood floors, with strong suction to clear away fine debris such as dust, course debris like kitty litter and lightweight debris like pet hair.","In our testing, we found this upright vacuum cleaner picked up most messes noticeably faster than competitors. It only took 35 passes to clean up all the messes. The average number of passes was 50. There were only three machines that cleaned in slightly fewer passes than this one but most of those cost double the price of the Brushroll Clean. It had some trouble cleaning up flour, especially on the low-profile carpeting, but then most in our vacuum cleaner reviews did. It was great on everything else. For a vacuum with a perfect performance score, consider the <a href=\"/dyson-animal-review\">Dyson Animal 2</a>.","This is a decent option if you have multiple types of flooring. You can switch the brushroll off so you don&#39;t have to worry about damaging delicate hardwood flooring. It had good suction on hard flooring during our tests – it doesn&#39;t just protect the wood floors, it cleans them.","The Brushroll Clean also is versatile. It comes with a stair and upholstery brush, dusting brush, crevice tool and extension wand so you can clean furniture and draperies too.","This is a bagless upright vacuum, so you don’t have the hassle of vacuum cleaner bags. A bagless design does bring with it a potential dust cloud when you empty it, but if you do it carefully you won&#39;t get a big cloud.","The Brushroll Clean has a wider-than-average cleaning path of 13 inches. That means you can cover more ground in less time than a smaller cleaning head would allow.","This vacuum is lighter than average – only 15.8 pounds – but it still seemed bulky and clunky compared to others. It was pretty hard to move and turn due to the lack of a swiveling head. It is also a bit noisy to operate at a decibel level of 86 dB, but not tiresomely so. It falls in the middle of the pack for sound when you compare it to the other units in our review.","This machine comes with a retractable cord that was quite handy – it got stuck once, but we gave it a gentle yank and it retracted completely. The hose extends 12 feet so you can reach high places to get them clean. The electrical cord is 27 feet long. That is a little shorter than average but should be plenty to cover most rooms without stopping to look for a closer outlet.","We found a few shortcomings with this device. The extension wand fell off during use. Also, you cannot tell if the brush roll capability is on just by looking at it, and the brush roll button is somewhat hard to push. We also found the motor gets hot, and since the filter is on top of the motor, you might want to let the vacuum cool off a bit before you change the filter.","The Eureka Brushroll Clean with SuctionSeal performed well in our tests, on different types of flooring and different types of messes. Its motor does get hot when it is operating, and the machine is a bit difficult to move due to the lack of a swiveling head. Those few quirks are less significant, though, when you consider the versatility, excellent cleaning performance and relatively low price of this upright bagless vacuum."]},"id":"d231a523-60e9-4cd1-8bab-fc106b1bd401","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66734","url":"/eureka-brushroll-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-31T14:59:37Z","datePublished":"2015-08-31T14:59:37Z","name":"Eureka Brushroll Clean AS3401A","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is not widely available.","review":{"rating":89,"verdict":"This upright vacuum does a good job of cleaning all types of flooring, and it has the attachments to clean more than just floors.","pros":["This vacuum does a good job picking up pet hair.
