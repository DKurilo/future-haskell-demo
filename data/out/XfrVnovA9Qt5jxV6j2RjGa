The unique twist-locking ear gels provide a stable and comfortable fit, as long as you have the correct size for your ear. The audio quality doesn&#39;t compare to the best Bluetooth earphones, but it is adequate for providing a soundtrack to your exercise regimen.","The best feature of the Leap is the sweat-proof and water-resistant design, making it a great pair of wireless earbuds for intense exercise like running or cross-training. The components are protected with a water-resistant coating so that you never have to worry about sweating too much. While you can&#39;t swim with these in your ears, the water-resistant design allows you to run in the rain or take them kayaking, where they&#39;ll likely experience splashes and some submersion.","The battery life is six hours for both music streaming and talking on the phone, which is average for Bluetooth in-ear headphones. For comparison, the best wireless earbuds for exercising have a battery life of up to eight hours. However, the battery life varies depending on how loud your volume is and how often you use the controls.","One of the reasons that the audio quality doesn&#39;t match up to the best Bluetooth earbuds is the earbud design. The design allows a significant amount of ambient noise, which is on purpose. This allows you to hear your surroundings better, like when you&#39;re running in the street, but the lack of noise isolation sacrifices low-end bass frequencies and high-end treble. You&#39;re also more likely to turn the volume up to dangerous levels in order to block out the ambient noise.","The unique twist-locking earbuds are designed to provide a stable fit that won&#39;t shake free no matter how hard you shake your head. The problem with the design is that it only works if you have the correct size earbud for your ear. Most wireless earphones use a soft gel tip that conforms to your ear canal despite the shape. The success of these earbuds depends on how well they fit your ear. Unfortunately, everyone&#39;s ear has a different shape and size. While there are six available sizes, only two sizes are included with the Leap. If those don&#39;t fit, you have to purchase the additional sizes separately."]},"id":"c54d0b7d-b0a9-46c3-a091-4c3111cb9056","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e4259271-33f3-4b72-bc76-06fd95cebb1e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite being powered by JBL, the Yurbuds Leap lacks the audio quality of better Bluetooth earphones, but the sweat-proof and water-resistant design provides good value for intense workouts.
