For many people, this is not always convenient, so shrinking DVD file sizes is becoming increasingly popular.","<strong>Why Shrink DVD Files?</strong>","There are several reasons why you might want to shrink DVD file sizes, but the most likely is because the original copy is too big to fit on your chosen media. Standard DVDs hold 4.7GB of data. If your source disc contains more data than that, you will either need multiple discs or have to forego the copying procedure altogether.","<strong>How to Shrink a DVD File</strong>","When you are ready to shrink your DVD file size, the best approach is to use a DVD converter or DVD copy software. These applications copy the original data and compress it so that it takes up less space. You then have the option to save the file to your computer s hard drive or burn it to a compatible disc.","The process is highly automated and requires little in the way of technical knowledge due to the step-by-step burning wizards that come with this type of software. Advanced options may allow you to configure the level of compression involved to help you dictate the final quality and file size of the copied file.","<strong>Recommended Software</strong>","If you are looking for some suggestions for the right software to use, a great place start is visiting our <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD Copy Software</a> review. Our top three picks for the best DVD copy software are <a href=\"/dvd-cloner-review\">DVD Cloner</a>, <a href=\"/123-copy-dvd-review\">123 Copy DVD</a> and <a href=\"/1click-dvd-copy-review\">1Click DVD Copy</a>. All of these titles are tested and proven to be among the best solutions you can get, but you might also want to compare them to free options such as DVD Shrink. Some software options are faster than others at shrinking your data, but for the most part, they all take an hour or less to complete the process.","Wherever possible, look for solutions that support episodic DVDs. With this feature, you can select and exclude specific episodes to reduce your overall file size. You can shrink files even further if you opt for software that allows you to remove trailers, bonus features, commercials and so forth from your copied DVD file.","<strong>Side Effects of Shrinking DVD Files</strong>","Unfortunately, there can be some side effects associated with shrinking a DVD file size. Primarily, this will result in a reduction in the audio and video quality of the original DVD caused by the compression engine that reduces your file sizes.","A good copying application works hard to minimize the visual and auditory artifacts caused by compressing the data, but few products claim to eradicate this completely, so pay close attention to this section of any DVD copy software reviews you read.","Shrinking a DVD s file size is easier than you might think, but you need to have the right tools to do it properly. When you&#39;ve chosen the right application, fire up your DVD drive and get ready to burn!","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"c2b3fbb7-ff81-4f25-9040-687c7d12b3c4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6201","url":"/a-guide-to-shrinking-dvd-file-sizes","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-wylie","url":"/author/jonathan-wylie","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Wylie","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dmpAeXU5XQymRmsWKwDrd8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-29T16:53:12Z","datePublished":"2011-06-29T16:53:12Z","name":"A Guide to Shrinking DVD File Sizes","synopsis":"If you’ve ever tried to copy a DVD before, you will know that it contains a lot of information, and can have a file size that easily contains several gigabytes of data.","review":{},"strapline":"If you’ve ever tried to copy a DVD before, you will know that it contains a lot of information, and can have a file size that easily contains several gigabytes of data.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-06-29T16:56:42Z","id":"rZu5jg6hxYYUBhpK3noqgc","meta":{"title":"A Guide to Shrinking DVD File Sizes","description":"Shrinking a DVD file is easier than you think!"},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:57:52Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/JbXkvBj6MEfae4tvLha9N9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"6201-a-guide-to-shrinking-dvd-file-sizes.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6201-a-guide-to-shrinking-dvd-file-sizes.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:52Z","id":"JbXkvBj6MEfae4tvLha9N9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbXkvBj6MEfae4tvLha9N9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"A Guide to Shrinking DVD File Sizes","description":"Shrinking a DVD file is easier than you think!"},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/JbXkvBj6MEfae4tvLha9N9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"6201-a-guide-to-shrinking-dvd-file-sizes.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6201-a-guide-to-shrinking-dvd-file-sizes.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:52Z","id":"JbXkvBj6MEfae4tvLha9N9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbXkvBj6MEfae4tvLha9N9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"A Guide to Shrinking DVD File Sizes","description":"Shrinking a DVD file is easier than you think!"}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/a-guide-to-shrinking-dvd-file-sizes","label":"","tags":[]}
