The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">RC Helicopters here</a>.</em>","The Night Hunter Xtreme Glow in the Dark remote controlled helicopter has colorful LED lights and a solid, pointed glow-in-the-dark body and blades. The lights work well on the remote control helicopter, but the glow-in-the-dark paint loses its charge after just a few minutes. The construction is less sturdy than other similar remote control helicopters, and the flight controls are a little more difficult to master.","There’s no doubt that this remote control helicopter is pretty. This flying RC helicopter also has the basic capabilities you’d expect from a radio controlled helicopter. It flies in all six directions: up, down, right, left, forward and backward. It has two blades that help speed it up and keep a modicum of balance while flying. But it’s missing so much in execution. The glow-in-the-dark design sounds novel on paper, but when put into practice, it’s missing a lot of emphasis. The glow lasts just a few minutes and is dull to begin with.","Also, some of the more advanced remote control helicopters offer more comprehensive feature sets. While this helicopter covers all the basics pretty well, it’s missing so much in execution. For example, some RC helicopters have high-definition cameras, others can fly at a much faster speed and others can turn tricks and stunts through the air. The remote control helicopter has an adequate performance but lacks some of the better and more-advanced features.","We&#39;re also disappointed with the glow-in-the-dark paint. The design sounds novel on paper, but when put into practice, it&#39;s missing a lot of oomph. The glow lasts just a few minutes and is dull to begin with.","This remote control helicopter bills itself as an entry-level flight machine and is a good choice for beginners. However, be aware that this machine lacks some of the protective features on other RC helicopters, and its design isn&#39;t as sturdy. As a result, this unit likely won&#39;t be able to handle the hard crashes that other helicopters are built to withstand.","As you learn to fly your remote control helicopter, some crashes are inevitable. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a good thing that the Night Hunter Xtreme Glow in the Dark machine comes with an extra set of blades, just in case one breaks.","In order to fly your helicopter, you have to remember to charge it for about 30 minutes to get 5-10 minutes of flight time. This is standard for the industry, and other remote control helicopters have similar flight and charge times.","The documentation included with this remote control helicopter says the controls were inspired by gaming machines. We’re not sure which gaming system they had in mind, but in our testing the controls were stiff and unresponsive. In fact, we found it difficult to fly inside, and flying outdoors with a breeze was nearly impossible."]},"id":"f9defc39-6fd5-4a47-a4ab-5e8ae4cd4f96","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6b6ade37-41e6-488d-b9e2-97e4ee3b1e1d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Night Hunter Xtreme Glow in the Dark remote control helicopter is an interesting concept.
