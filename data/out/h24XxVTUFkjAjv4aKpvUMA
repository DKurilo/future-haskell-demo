Now, with Google Wallet, we can use it for <a href=\"/best-p2p-payments\">peer-to-peer (P2P) payments</a>, and with the Google Wallet Card, we can also use it for buying things online and in person. Google Wallet is available for Android and Apple phones and tablets.","Sending payments through Google Wallet requires you know a person&#39;s email address or phone number. The person receiving your payment inputs his or her own banking information (a debit card number works) in order to cash it out. You can also receive money from others, such as what your friend owes you for gas money. Google Wallet sends you instant notifications when you receive money.","Like most of the person-to-person payment services we&#39;ve profiled, Google Wallet stores money in your Google Wallet account rather than transferring it directly to your banking account. Therefore, you can add money to this account for easier spending or keep money you&#39;ve received from other Google Wallet transactions on hand for later use. You can set it to notify you of low balance alerts.","In addition, you can use the Google Wallet card to spend it straight from your Google Wallet account. The Google Wallet card works just like a debit card, letting you purchase at any stores that accept MasterCard debit cards as well as allowing you to use it to withdraw funds at ATMs. Of course, you still have the option to cash out to your bank account.","Google Wallet has several security features in place. All your financial data is encrypted and stored in Google&#39;s secure servers at protected locations. Google Wallet conducts 24/7 fraud monitoring and covers 100 percent of verified unauthorized transactions, plus purchases are ensured with MasterCard&#39;s Zero Liability protection. You need to enter a PIN code to conduct transactions, and you can instantly freeze or revoke access to your account if you lose your Google Wallet card or your phone.","Google has established itself as a convenient and trusted service in the information industry. Now, it&#39;s putting its talent into making cashless person-to-person financial transactions as easy as looking up the nearest restaurant or sharing a file with a friend."]},"id":"3f4075eb-534f-4cc4-bb79-1a2516e5cf05","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67657","url":"/google-wallet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T17:30:18Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T17:30:18Z","name":"Google Wallet","synopsis":"We use Google for finding information, communicating via email, and storing and sharing documents.
