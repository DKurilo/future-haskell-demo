The LED camping lights with added reflectors increase the lighting output, and it has impact- and water-resistant features and sturdy construction for long use.<br/>","This <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/buyers_guides/camping-lantern-buyers-guide\">outdoor camping lantern</a> is 14 x 14 x 5.75 inches and uses a 6-volt battery that you can recharge. The 24 LEDS that power this lantern put out 157 lumens, which is sufficient to light a room or campsite. It runs for about six hours and emits light in an area of about 24 feet, which covers a large room or entire campsite. An LED at the back of the lantern is green when the lantern has a full charge and turns red when the charge is low.","Two cords for recharging come with the lantern: a 120-volt cord that plugs into the wall and a 12-volt cord that you can use in your vehicle. It can operate as a solar camping lantern thanks to the solar panel on the lid. The fourth way to charge it is a hand crank on the bottom of the lantern.<br/>","The camping lantern comes with a carrying handle with a hook that folds out from the top for hanging. However, the hook is small, and it might be hard to find a small enough branch that also supports the lantern&#39;s weight of 3.67 pounds.","A button in the front lets you turn on the LED camping light, but it does not have a dimmer or allow you to adjust the setting, which might hinder you from hanging the lantern inside your tent while camping. However,  the lantern is still versatile, with added reflectors to increase the light it emits and its multiple charging options.","The NEBO Tools 5959 Eco Lantern uses 24 LEDs and reflectors to provide light for a large area, uses a rechargeable battery, and has multiple recharging options. Despite its weight of 3.67 pounds, which is a consideration when you take it camping or backpacking, this battery-powered lantern also offers durability and the ability to charge in complete darkness with the hand crank.<br/>"]},"id":"35fed284-5002-46d6-931a-9fe9ddb72247","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65249","url":"/nebo-tools-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","datePublished":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","name":"NEBO Tools 5959 Eco Lantern","synopsis":"The NEBO Tools 5959 Eco Lantern has four ways to recharge when you go camping, boating or RV-ing or have a power outage at home.
