For all the big jobs that need doing, the Husqvarna 1827EXLT proves its mettle in the arena of snow removal equipment by simply being one of the biggest snow blowers you can purchase. Whether you’re doing snow removal for a full neighborhood or have a really long driveway, this machine will get the job done with time to spare."]},"id":"24887839-9818-4f67-80b8-73da5e5c9e2c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/SwCixmsbs5DrUTxVZHj7Rn.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57481-husqvarna-1827exlt2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SwCixmsbs5DrUTxVZHj7Rn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"SwCixmsbs5DrUTxVZHj7Rn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SwCixmsbs5DrUTxVZHj7Rn.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9cec6d89-c0f3-4b9e-ac13-74d1c3104f11","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Apart from being among the best-equipped snow blowers out there, the Husqvarna distinguishes itself with a wide range of features to increase its ability in the field. Rather than using a traditional set of wheels for maneuvering, this snow thrower utilizes a trac drive for better traction on paved and icy surfaces. In addition, the unique tread pattern on the drive system actually helps reduce vibration created from rolling.","Considering the size of the two-stage snow blower, many consumers expect it to be difficult to maneuver. To combat its size, the device comes with trigger-controlled power steering you can operate with one hand. In addition, you can adjust chute controls while the wheels and auger are engaged.","Where the Husqvarna really shines is in its main task of removing snow. The clearing path is an amazing 27-inch range with a cut depth of nearly 2 feet, at 23 inches. This makes it an ideal device for areas with high volumes of snowfall and large paved areas.","One of the main problems faced by many people with gas-powered snow blowers is dead batteries. To protect against this, you can plug in the snow thrower to an electrical outlet and utilize the push-button electric starter. Not only will you never have to worry about a dead battery, but you can also expect easy starting in cold weather.","The Husqvarna 1827EXLT is one of the best snow throwers out there simply for its sheer power in removing snow. With its 18 gross torque SnowKing engine and two-stage design, you can expect all the power you need to remove snow quickly, and then some. While an expensive model, it delivers in every regard you’d expect and will clear even the largest paved areas with little effort."]},"id":"0c3a27f8-5110-4554-a9d6-a6aea76d9af7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57509","url":"/husqvarna-snow-blower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-09-14T14:53:21Z","datePublished":"2013-09-14T14:53:21Z","name":"Husqvarna 1827EXLT","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
