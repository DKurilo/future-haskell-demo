It weighs 20 pounds and measures 24 inches tall and 4 inches thick.","This water heater comes in white and has a metal door. There are two dials and a digital display built into the lower bottom of the door. One dial controls water temperature, while the other regulates gas pressure. The digital display shows temperature. The unit also comes with a stainless steel vent kit and uses an electronic ignition activated by 40 psi water pressure. All parts, including the heat exchanger, come with two-year warranties.","While Eccotemp includes more parts required for its tankless water heater installation than most manufacturers do, you still need a pressure relief valve to install the FVI12-NG. It must be installed on an exterior wall or on a corner wall near one in order to use the included stainless steel vent kit. However, since this is not a noncondensing water heater, you need to keep the horizontal vent pipe slightly sloped to prevent condensing gas from corroding it.","The heater is powered by natural gas but still needs to run on electricity. It requires electricity to drive its internal exhaust fan and digital display. While the gas tankless water heater is idle, it consumes 2 watts of electricity. Its peak electric power consumption is 10 watts. This unit has a capacity of 12 liters but can only effectively supply water to a house with one bathroom. It also has a 74,000-Btu maximum water inflow, which is lower than what most gas-powered water heaters are capable of handling.","The minimum water flow for the Eccotemp FVI12-NG is 0.9 gpm, while the maximum is 4.8 gpm. Compared to the typical gas tankless water heater, the minimum flow is high and the maximum is low. For example, the <a href=\"/ecosmart-review\">EcoSmart ECO 27</a> has a maximum flow of 6.5 gpm. This unit achieves its maximum flow rate when heating inflowing water to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the flow rate drops to 2.3 gallons per minute if you want your hot water hotter than the inflowing cold water by 77 degrees Fahrenheit. While this Eccotemp water heater&#39;s maximum flow rate is fairly low, the drop to 2.3 gpm is unlikely to power anything but a low-flow faucet and shower head.","The Eccotemp FVI12-NG is a compact and sleek gas tankless water heater with independent gas and water controls. It also draws very little electricity. However, it is an underpowered water heater that is most suitable for small apartments."]},"id":"db269ae3-caac-40ff-b164-fc9b398e1a5d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65900","url":"/eccotemp-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-25T15:19:23Z","datePublished":"2015-06-25T15:19:23Z","name":"Eccotemp FVI-12-NG","synopsis":"The Eccotemp FVI12-NG is an indoor tankless water heater for small residences.
