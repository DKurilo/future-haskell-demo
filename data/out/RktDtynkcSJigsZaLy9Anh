Before editing your images, you can view, tag, rate and categorize them in folders. This <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">photo editor</a> has an advanced search to help you find specific images, and you can use the filter to help you sift through your photos and find the exact one you are looking for.","AfterShot is available for $79.99 on Corel&#39;s website. We also found it selling cheaper on Amazon when we purchased our testing copy, so look for a sale to save some money ordering it that way. The free demo period lasts 30 days, so you&#39;ll have enough time to get a feel for the program and determine if it will work for you.","To help you sort through your images quickly, add star ratings, one of six different color labels, metadata and keyword tags to your photos. These organizing tools are especially helpful if you have several untagged or unrated photos. AfterShot also allows you to view thumbnails of your photos as you work on them, which makes it easier to switch from one photo to the next.","This program includes several standard and advanced editing tools. You can make quick fixes with basic tools like crop, resize and red eye removal, but the software lacks painting and drawing tools, as well as the ability to add text to your photos.","AfterShot&#39;s 21 different filters allow you to enhance colors and alter textures in your photos. Appling multiple filters to one photo can completely transform it, and there are several automatic options that adjust the color, lighting or brightness of your photo for you. This software has HDR imaging capabilities, as well as the ability to create panoramic images.<br/>This Mac photo editor has several tools you can use to correct your photos or remove unwanted objects. You can use the cloning or touch-up tools to cover unwanted blemishes. If your photos look off, use the lens distortion correction tool to eliminate any distortions caused by the camera.","Unfortunately, AfterShot does not support very many file formats when exporting photos. You can only save your files in TIFF or JPEG formats. However, it can import most image file formats, including RAW images. If you&#39;d prefer a program that can work with more file types, you might be interested in <a href=\"/adobe-photoshop-elements-review\">Photoshop Elements</a>. This software processes high-quality images relatively quickly, and you can use batch processing to apply the same edits to many photos at once.","After you edit your photos, upload them directly from the application to online photo galleries. You also can use the printing resources to make hard copies of your photos. Corel does not offer a way to share your photos to social media sites directly from the application. Instead, you have to manually upload them to those sites.","Corel offers strong support options with its products. You can contact the company by phone, email or live chat if you encounter any problems. We found that its representatives quickly responded to our inquiries. You also can access video tutorials, a learning center and a FAQs page for answers to any additional questions.","Corel AfterShot Pro serves as an effective photo organizer and editor. You can easily access your photos, regardless of how many there are, using the photo manager. While it lacks some tools and capabilities, you can make basic adjustments and add cool effects to your photos with this easy-to-use software."]},"id":"a84bf0ca-4212-4591-9d9f-54de4b41b1a3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cb73b472-4401-4cf9-974b-969bae796aa6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Corel AfterShot Pro serves as an effective photo organizer and editor.
