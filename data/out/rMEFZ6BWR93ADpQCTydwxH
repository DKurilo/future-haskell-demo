You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HoMedics SoundSpa Portable is a <a href=\"/best-baby-sound-machines\">baby sound machine</a> that can easily travel with you when you&#39;re away from home. This simple infant sound machine doesn&#39;t include an MP3 adapter, nightlight or resume function, but it does offer continuous play and a timer. The white noise runs continuously on default and shuts off automatically if you use one of the 15-, 30- or 60-minute timer options. The HoMedics SoundSpa earned our Top Ten Reviews Silver Award.","The included sounds are ocean, summer night, rain, tropical forest, waterfall and heartbeat. Most of the sounds are water-based, which is often soothing for infants and adults. This HoMedics model doesn&#39;t include white noise or lullabies, so it doesn&#39;t qualify as a white noise machine like the <a href=\"/baby-shusher-review\">Baby Shusher</a>. However, it still offers a fairly wide ranges of sounds to choose from.","The controls on this sound machine for your baby make it simple to adjust the volume, select different sound options and set the timer. They are conveniently located on the top of the device. The SoundSpa Portable is compact and travel ready, so it fits nicely in your diaper bag or suitcase.","To capitalize on the portability factor, you can use this baby sound machine with batteries. However, they&#39;ll need to be changed often if you solely use the batteries to operate the device. We recommend using the included AC adapter and plugging the machine into a wall socket for continual use. Otherwise, be sure to turn the machine off after each session. This infant sound machine includes a one-year warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship."]},"id":"01de6a58-e430-4e46-8d24-e85a69ef2cd5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"af5bca29-4c86-4569-b2d9-56d3402e4a0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HoMedics SoundSpa Portable baby sound machine has the necessary features to successfully soothe your child to sleep in a compact package.
