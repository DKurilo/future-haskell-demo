The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-weather-stations\">Weather Stations</a> here.</em>","This weather station goes outdoors with you and monitors multiple weather-based conditions. It is useful for outdoor workers and hunters, as well as those who enjoy other outdoor sports such as skiing or hiking. The Kestrel Meter 2500 Weather Meter is lightweight at 2.3 ounces, and with dimensions of 4.8 x 1.7 x 0.7 inches, it is small enough to put in a pocket or on a belt clip. This outdoor weather station has a real-time clock, floats and is waterproof, which appeals to boating enthusiasts. It is accurate, easy to use and includes an adjustable neck lanyard and a protective slipcover for a sure grip. The device is RoHS certified.","The display on this personal weather station is easy to read. It is backlit and has a hold function for reading later. It gives the time and date in addition to weather information. An added feature on the version in olive drab, at an additional cost, is a night vision backlight that uses an optical filter allowing it to work with night vision equipment. This outdoor weather station&#39;s adaptable design allows for quick changes by the handler or the weather.","The Kestrel Meter 2500 Weather Meter measures current wind speeds and calculates an average speed. It also measures maximum wind gusts. Pressing the up and down arrows on the case displays both measurements. The impeller on this personal weather station is extremely sensitive, is replaceable and offers accurate readings. This is vital for those who rely on wind measurements, including long-range shooters, boaters, utility linemen or surveyors.","Atmospheric temperature measurements are accurate and displayed in Fahrenheit and Celsius. Before actually taking a measurement, the unit provides prompts on the easy-to-read backlit display. Submerging an exposed wire on the meter allows you to measure the temperature of ice and water. In addition, this outdoor weather station is submersible for 30 minutes at a depth of 1 meter.","The Kestrel Meter 2500 Weather Meter is a personal weather station that does what you need it to do. Its lightweight construction, its cost-effectiveness and the fact it is waterproof make it useful in many situations. Although the lanyard is not detachable, this unit provides consistent, accurate data at work or during outdoor sporting activities."]},"id":"00d0365d-6ec3-450e-ae69-921976cf09a5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63338","url":"/kestrel-meter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T19:45:45Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T19:45:45Z","name":"Kestrel Meter 2500","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-09T19:45:45Z","id":"FhoNE4rYPenA3Rt8e4onTW","meta":{"title":"Kestrel Meter 2500 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kestrel Meter 2500 is a portable, handheld weather station that only weighs 2.3 ounces, and you can use when you work or play outdoors."},"products":[{"slug":"kestrel-meter-2500","url":"/product/kestrel-meter-2500","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","name":"Kestrel Meter 2500","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","id":"PnBqiWFYBjegeUXSLGYpm7","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bqEhahcxcjEQQ6z3JYvVXE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"63310-kestrel-meter-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63310-kestrel-meter-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","id":"bqEhahcxcjEQQ6z3JYvVXE","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bqEhahcxcjEQQ6z3JYvVXE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kestrel Meter 2500 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kestrel Meter 2500 is a portable, handheld weather station that only weighs 2.3 ounces, and you can use when you work or play outdoors."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bqEhahcxcjEQQ6z3JYvVXE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"63310-kestrel-meter-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63310-kestrel-meter-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","id":"bqEhahcxcjEQQ6z3JYvVXE","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bqEhahcxcjEQQ6z3JYvVXE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kestrel Meter 2500 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kestrel Meter 2500 is a portable, handheld weather station that only weighs 2.3 ounces, and you can use when you work or play outdoors."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/kestrel-meter-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:52Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
