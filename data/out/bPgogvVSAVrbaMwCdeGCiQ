You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hoover Anniversary WindTunnel <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum cleaner</a> is self-propelled, so it does all of the heavy work; you simply guide it. With its dirt sensor that lets you know when your floors are clean, it is easy to use. The sensor light turns green when there is no more dirt left on your floor.","This bagged vacuum cleaner is equipped with a HEPA filter that traps 99.97 percent of dirt, pollens and particulate matter. It has an extra filter that cleans air after it leaves the bag. Even though it has excellent filtration, it does not have airtight seals around each compartment of the machine, which means dusty air can still escape and blow into your home.","The vacuum bag is easy to empty, and you don&#39;t have to touch or inhale any dirt. You just remove the bag and throw it away. The dirt is contained in the bag, so there is none of the dust cloud that you sometimes get from dumping out canisters.","This vacuum cleaner has an indicator light that lets you know when it is time to empty the bag. It also has an auto shut-off feature so that, if you run over an object, the machine shuts itself off. This feature is vital in preserving the life of your motor.","This Hoover can adjust to three different levels. It can clean any surface, from high-pile rugs to bare floors. We were impressed with the machine&#39;s power drive setting, which allows the vacuum cleaner to propel itself. It does take some getting used to, especially if you have never operated a self-propelled machine. We recommend shutting off the power drive when vacuuming around furniture. Otherwise, you may bump into it. It is also a little heavier than the best upright vacuum cleaners we reviewed. It weighs 20 pounds, but you may not even notice with the self-propulsion feature.","The cord is 29 feet long. We prefer cords that are around 35 to 40 feet so you do not have to stop and switch electrical outlets as you clean. This machine&#39;s handle does not recline to allow you to reach under low furniture. You will have to move the coffee table to clean underneath it. We were impressed with the quantity of the on-board tools this machine includes. It is equipped with a crevice tool, dusting brush, air-powered hand tool, upholstery brush and wand.","This upright vacuum is backed by a three-year warranty, and Hoover service centers are located in most major cities, so you should have no trouble getting local support. You can also contact the company by email or phone. The Hoover website offers a FAQs page as well as informational videos."]},"id":"d9bc200d-38c0-40ca-a0f2-dc72cd578aa8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e55977c0-1b04-41fa-8278-d997a094a8a3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hoover Anniversary WindTunnel is versatile and full of useful features, like the power drive and dirt sensor.
