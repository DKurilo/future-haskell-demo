Its 1.3-pound weight is well balanced, and its instructional markings are clear.","“It has a nice, laid-back design that feels sturdy and complete,” said one of our testers. “The soft-touch material makes it feel very nice, and its controls are well marked and in sensible places.”","This <a href=\"/best-hair-dryers\">hair dryer</a> has a narrow, 1.75-inch European-style nozzle and operates at 1,875 watts. It has a heavy-duty, 8-foot cord and a removable endcap to facilitate filter cleaning, and it comes with a concentrator, diffuser and straightening pik. Its concentrator has an extra-narrow opening to give you more focused control in creating a sleek, smooth look, and its diffuser helps you shape curls and create volume.","The Hot Tools dryer uses tourmaline heating technology to convert heat into far-infrared energy. That means it breaks water into smaller droplets that evaporate more easily to reduce drying time. Like every model we tested, the Hot Tools dryer has a hanging ring and a cord guard, as well as  an <a href=\"https://www.hunker.com/13418888/what-are-alci-safety-plugs\">ALCI safety plug</a> to prevent an electrical hazard if the operating blower comes in contact with water.","“This seems like a very high-quality hair dryer,” said one of our testers, “Its accessories are easy to attach and remove, and I really like the straightening pik. It fits in my small hand, and it’s light and easy to maneuver.”","With three heat settings and two air speed settings, the Tourmaline Tools 2000 has a temperature range of 85 to 179 degrees, which is the widest range we recorded in our testing. Its air speeds are the slowest we measured, however, at just 15.4 feet per second on low and 22.1 feet per second on high. If your hair is thick, you may want a dryer with more oomph.","At the same time, it’s important to consider how temperature and air speed interact. One of our testers with curly hair appreciated how this blower’s gentle air speed maintained the shape of her curls, but she feared that its highest temperature setting might burn her hair.","The Tourmaline Tools 2000’s volume ranges from 76.7 decibels on low to 83.2 dB on high, and most users found that noise level comfortable. With a maximum volume of 79.8 dB, the <a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic Nanoe</a> is the quietest hair dryer we tested but also the hottest, measuring up to 197 degrees in our lab.","The one-year warranty term for Hot Tools’ dryer is below average. Two years is the average term for a dryer warranty, and <a href=\"/remington-review\">Remington’s Pro Thermaluxe</a>, <a href=\"/conair-review\">Conair’s InfinitiPRO</a> and the <a href=\"/babylisspro-review\">BaByliss Nano Titanium</a> are all covered for four years. Some competitors also provide better customer service. Support for both Hot Tools and Revlon hair dryers is available by email and phone through <a href=\"http://www.hotus.com/consumer-services/\">Helen of Troy Consumer Services</a>, and we experienced slow response times when we reached out to that provider for help."]},"id":"a5561c29-7dca-4194-bbd2-4c99d2355c64","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70100","url":"/hot-tools-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-09T21:35:01Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T21:35:01Z","name":"Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 2000","synopsis":"We like the Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 2000 because of its soft housing and comfortable grip.
