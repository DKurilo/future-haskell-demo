You can buy the Chamberlain B970 for around $270, which makes it one of the more expensive residential garage door openers on the market. (The average price for garage door openers is about $200.) We think the number of useful features in this product make it worth the extra cost.","With 1 1/4 horsepower, the B970 is one of the most powerful models we reviewed. It can handle two-car doors up to 7 feet tall (or 10 feet if you buy an extension kit), which is more than enough for most garages. The B970 uses a steel-reinforced belt lift system, which makes it smoother and quieter than chain-driven units. ","In addition to including the standard safety functions, the B970 has some notable features: battery backup and motion-activated lighting. The backup battery allows you to operate your door in the event of a power outage, which can give you some peace of mind if you have trouble with the emergency release. Only one other unit we reviewed, the <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/liftmaster-review\">LiftMaster 8500W</a>, has a built-in battery, while two others let you purchase an add-on battery."]},"id":"7ad4d1fd-a5e3-4c2b-abe0-f38b94ed5bbe","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/vnnJCo6gJqWjyQFgfn73tB.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/70326-chamberlain-b9705.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnnJCo6gJqWjyQFgfn73tB.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"vnnJCo6gJqWjyQFgfn73tB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnnJCo6gJqWjyQFgfn73tB.jpg","alt":""},"id":"48e1302f-db62-4f1e-86af-c4b2b2a71017","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The motion-activated lights help you find your way around the garage without the need for a switch, and they shut off after you leave to save energy. The B970 also has a timer-to-close feature that closes your door automatically after it’s been open a few minutes, though this is fairly common in mid- to high-priced garage door openers."," ","During our research into customer satisfaction, we learned that the Chamberlain B970 is probably the most popular model on the market; the Home Depot website alone lists over 1,000 customer reviews. Of the garage openers we reviewed, the Chamberlain B970 has the fifth-highest satisfaction, with an average rating of 88 percent, or 4.4 stars out of 5.

Monthly fees aren’t common among smart home platforms, so this requirement is disappointing. Likewise, the opener works with Apple HomeKit if you buy the $94 MyQ Home Bridge.
