This garage door opener is known for its good safety features, wonderful warranty and its ability to whisk your door open at twice the speed of other systems."]},"id":"33b43c1b-b8a5-46fa-bdd2-04a6ed0b3cb0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Control"},"id":"a07a5683-f91e-4d52-870e-615c1ecb3841","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This garage door opener has a screw at the core of its main mechanism, machined from one solid piece of steel for durability. People like all sorts of garage door openers for all different reasons. The screw system is valued for the way it ages. Belts in a belt system eventually wear out. Chain garage door openers are great in many ways, but they have been known to loosen over time. It’s not too hard to adjust for the loosening of a chain, but if you don’t want to fiddle with it a screw-driven system like this one might work even better for you.","This garage door opener also is noticeably faster at opening your door than most products. For the sake of safety it closes at the same speed, but on the way up it is super fast. That will be helpful for added security – less exposure and opportunity for criminals – and for anyone that has ever felt like their garage door opens more slowly when they’re in a hurry.","Genie PowerLift Excelerator comes ready to integrate with the HomeLink or Car2U systems, which allow you to control this garage door opener, appliances inside your home and more from a control unit in your vehicle. This compatibility has become quite common among new garage door openers but we still consider it a valuable feature.","This opener is designed to handle most doors that are 7.5-feet tall, regardless of material, though the manufacturer recommends an extension kit for doors that are 8 feet or taller.","This unit accommodates two 60-watt bulbs for a total of 120 watts of light. That’s more than earlier garage door opener models but we like to see even more wattage."]},"id":"56a4f6b8-5634-4097-aee6-2eaf77e96903","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience"},"id":"5bf625a5-1a82-4688-bc8e-5138d2a1ef7f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In terms of safety this garage door opener has most of the features we were looking for, including a rolling code system, which makes it virtually impossible for criminals to “listen” to the code your remote sends to your opener and try to recreate it. The code is automatically changed each time you use it.","The security locking mode eliminates even more risks by making the opener inoperable by any means while you are out of town.","We liked the safety features on this garage door opener very much. One example is Genie’s Force Guard Control, which allows you to set the door to open using the minimum force required to fully open and close your specific door. There is no need to engage more force than is necessary for lighter doors because that adds to potential risk for injury, especially for children and pets. Additional safety features reduce risks even more. This opener automatically stops the closing process within two seconds of making contact with any object. There is also a Safe-T-Beam system that projects a beam of light across the bottom of the doorway. The closing process will stop anytime that beam is interrupted. The Safe-T-Stop system is designed to automatically open a door that does not finish its closing process within 30 seconds. This garage door opener has many layers of safety features that anticipate a wide range of dangerous scenarios. We were very impressed.","While there is no motion detector lighting system – some units sense any time someone enters the garage and automatically light up – this opener will automatically illuminate as soon as you engage the opener. It also shuts its lights off automatically about five minutes after you use the opener so you don’t have to remember.","The manual release allows you to open and close your door manually when you need to in case of an emergency."]},"id":"0d3755b6-9955-41bc-adba-cf2461e6a114","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Warranty"},"id":"0f2fcefa-aff5-41b3-80dd-7315187133b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As mentioned, this unit has a reputation for easy maintenance because it has fewer moving parts that can come loose or wear out.

Not starting out with at least two adds a hidden cost for most users."]},"id":"488a0a16-a79e-4e0d-af24-7868dd8b4177","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"19c3a7f6-7498-4eea-99a2-b7ae57591e74","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Genie PowerLift Excelerator comes with a truly impressive warranty, covering this garage door opener and its parts for a lifetime. This shows a great deal of confidence in the craftsmanship of this product. Genie is not expecting to have to replace parts, or the entire unit, but they will if necessary. The warranty does not cover absolutely everything. You are expected to replace your own batteries and ensure proper installation and maintenance, but the fact that they are even willing to use the word “lifetime” with the word warranty is very reassuring.","We found Genie customer service to be pretty good.
