For example, if you accidentally bump the sensor, your recorded pen strokes will distort. In addition, if the way you hold the pen gets in the way of the pen&#39;s tip and the positional receiver, your pen strokes won&#39;t be recorded to the digital page. So while you don&#39;t have to purchase or print special paper, you have to be extra careful as you write. If you&#39;re an aggressive scribbler, this might require you to modify the way you write.","The Bluetooth function allows you to connect to your smartphone and tablet to sync notes wirelessly to mobile apps, and it means you can also use the pen in real time as a mouse. With Bluetooth, you can use this pen in conjunction with many apps like Evernote, OneNote, Dropbox and social networking sites like Facebook. You can write notes directly in these programs or import your previously written notes. However, you must purchase these mobile apps separately.","The size and lightweight shape of the pen make it very comfortable for both writing and sketching because it&#39;s not very different from a typical ballpoint pen. Designed with both writing and sketching in mind, you won&#39;t experience hand fatigue any more than you would with a typical pen.","Transitioning from one page to the next is as simple as pressing a button on the positional receiver at the top of your page. When you&#39;re done writing, you hit the power button and it saves the page. When your next page is ready, you hit the power button again to start writing.","The battery lasts up to eight hours if you don&#39;t use Bluetooth. It recharges using the USB connection to your computer and takes about 3.5 hours to charge. Unless you have a marathon note-taking session, you&#39;ll have plenty of battery life. It also features an idle function that will cause the receiver and pen to turn off if you haven&#39;t made any pen strokes for sixty minutes."]},"id":"8392d752-654e-4ecb-9547-12928861c5e4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"80b0e7d9-7fd7-4c30-9a58-288fde40020f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/HsvtBDP8Y22qPAWzdtgYme.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"s Pro comes with Notes Manager and Photo Sketcher software.

It includes a training interface designed to help you write in a way that will have the highest conversion accuracy. While this is helpful, the training can require you to modify your handwriting for better accuracy, which can be frustrating if you&#39;re an aggressively fast scribbler.
