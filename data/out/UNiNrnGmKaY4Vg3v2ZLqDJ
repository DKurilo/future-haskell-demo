If you only need to gather a handful of people, a basic and inexpensive service will likely suffice. The key is to closely match the service&#39;s offerings to your needs. Some features to consider when choosing a conferencing service are the number of attendees and hosts, the variety of devices that you can work from, whether the service integrates with other applications and if the service features HD video and voice.","<strong>Number of Participants</strong><br/>A subscription to a video conferencing system can include multiple hosts handling multiple meetings simultaneously. The service you select may depend largely on the number of people you would include in your meetings. Many of these services include the ability to invite outsiders, like a client, by providing a URL and holding the meeting in a cloud-based video conference. Some of the services require each user to have a web-based account or download the software or application on their device or computer.","<strong>Mobile-Ready</strong><br/>One of the best features of video conferencing is that it removes the requirement that everyone be in the same office at once. Most of these services include mobile apps that allow any user to participate with just a smart phone or tablet. Some services allow you to schedule, host and attend meetings right from your phone.","<strong>Application Integration</strong><br/>One of the less-known benefits to video conferencing services is the ability to combine other applications into your meetings. Many offer the ability to share screens with the rest of the users. Others limit your sharing to individual applications. You can also schedule video conferences with clients or team members using your existing calendar and email applications, such as Outlook or Google Calendar.","<strong>User Experience</strong><br/>Some of the benefits of face-to-face meeting can be diluted by poor connectivity and low definition. Also, if you’re working with a client over video conferencing, it may be challenging to make a good impression if the picture and audio are bad. Consider services that offer HD sound and video. Also note that some services allow you to record the meeting for future reference.","There is a wide range of video conferencing services available, so you&#39;ll be able to find the one that best suits your needs. Even the services with fewer features offer you the ability to see your clients and employees face-to-face, taking the guesswork out of your communication. Video conferencing can be tailored to your needs and customized to the needs of your business.","<strong>Adobe Connect Review</strong>"]},"id":"68e60837-9628-4a9c-a28a-200db82f941c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/6JHYBrirEjkcWL5RnpGEXA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Adobe Connect is one of the most robust video conferencing services.

Presenters can show up on camera, show presentations or share desktops. You can manage the data of all of the attendees and track performance of those who register for the course. Adobe allows you to manage your own catalog of courses and embed it on an Adobe URL. Once you’ve created content for your classes, Connect will publish the content to be used across different platforms.","Connect’s webinar feature allows you to create buzz over social media to market your webinar, then measure the effectiveness of your campaign. You can find out what’s working and what isn’t, and then adjust your campaign accordingly. During the webinar you&#39;re able to track who attends or drops out and how effective your discussion is based on the engagement of your audience using simple barometers. You can also integrate the results of your marketing into your own customer relationship management (CRM) software.","Each of Connect’s services are available on mobile devices for your employees who work remotely or are away from the office.

Attendees can contribute notes, whiteboard marks and files. The host can control the level of access each user has, whether they can annotate, upload or chat, and what they can view from the host or other attendees. You can change the level of access at any time during the meeting. Also, you can sort and view all of these contributions by user. You also have the option of receiving notifications when certain contributions are made and by whom.","From the dashboard, you send invitations and assign attendee roles and access. Vyew doesn’t require registration. You just send an email, and your attendees click on the link to enter. Once they&#39;re in, you can allow them to navigate the content or force them to see what you see as you go.","Vyew is a good choice for your business if you are primarily in need of a shared workspace with a web video conferencing option. If you are looking for a service that really specializes in video conferencing solutions, there are many options that are less focused on workspace and better enable a face-to-face meeting.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Zoom Review</strong>"]},"id":"536d9119-53b9-4dbc-bd54-5c71a97bdb71","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/PRKLpGTcpyaw6AeXj5QCgd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Zoom is a video conferencing solution that can be tailored for small businesses and large corporations.
