It took us awhile to be able to make a copy of our home video DVD. The data burning function, audio CD and mixed media CD creator was great and worked perfectly. If you have any designs on making backup copies of your DVD movie collection, you might have a hard time getting this product to work for you. Luckily, the other parts of the program make up for this one, insignificant flaw.  While we had issues with the DVD copying feature in this software, we were still able to make a copy our DVD.","The coolest element of Power2Go is the Sidebar Gadget that comes with the install. The gadget is a single icon that shows a picture of a DVD and how much space you have left on your disc.  All you have to do to get to the other types of discs is click the arrow keys at the top of the gadget.","In Power2Go, drag-and-drop burning applies to the following formats:"]},"id":"cb8542ed-7662-4ee1-8912-96d70437bd05","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Data","Photos/video","Music","Music copying"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6255df9b-49c8-4042-9069-f16be1f38555","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Power2Go also has a search-and-locate function that helps find files really fast using file names, or tags in the case of music files.","Power2Go Security features use 128-bit encryption for protecting data discs, including Blu-ray Discs. You can protect an entire disc or partial content. You can also opt to hide the names of files.","You&#39;re given the ability to burn any type of media to any disc imaginable.  While similar programs might limit what you can burn, Power2Go seeks to remove these limitations.  If you want people to stay away from the files on your disc, you can encrypt your data with 256-bit encryption and added password reminder.","Drag-and-drop features are taken to the next level with this software. The Sidebar Gadget is always there in your Windows Vista desktop, just waiting for the next file to be dropped.","The video and photo tools offer useable features for quickly authoring DVDs that showcase video, photo slideshows, and 2-channel Dolby Digital audio. Menu creation, inserting DVD chapters, video trimming and DVD auto-fit compression are the main tools you can use here. Users who want to show off their photos can do so by creating HD photo galleries that can display their images in their original quality.","Audio features allow the extracting of audio tracks from video files and create Audio CDs from MP3s. Power2Go unlimited MP3 ripping and file conversion tools let you create audio files for your portable media player. There are many more audio features available in Power2Go as well, such as the ability to enhance and trim your audio with WaveEditor, this program&#39;s built-in audio editing tool.","If you need files or folders from .ISO images, you can extract them directly from the image itself using this program. The disc authoring capabilities in this program continues to improve with each passing version. In this incarnation of Power2GO, you can create professional looking DVDs with fancy, customized menus.","Installing Power2Go was as easy as following prompts to complete the download. There is a trial version you can get for free – it’s really the mark of a superior product when they let you try it out before plunking down the money for it. Trial versions are often a bit limited (that’s how they get you to plunk down the money) but are very valuable for looking at an interface and testing it out to see if it’s compatible with your own technological skill and comfort level."]},"id":"95241392-a444-46b4-97dc-fb6538f8c308","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d322355d-7d70-4136-9188-f31b26a26c30","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Power2Go is a great-looking program with many great features.
