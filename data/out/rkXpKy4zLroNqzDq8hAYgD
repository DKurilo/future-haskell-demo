Harnessing the fury of a 40 cc, 2-cycle, 18-inch chainsaw, you&#39;ll be able to cut down virtually anything you need to cut.","Most chainsaw reviews indicate the Poulan P4018WT possesses an average lifespan of seven to eight years, which gives consumers an impressive amount of use. Apart from needing to replace the bars and chains on a yearly basis – a normal aspect of chainsaw maintenance – this device will perform in most low- to medium-duty cutting."]},"id":"17f47c6b-c116-4e79-866b-22409aadd5df","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/LaZbDhUAkbQEmCoR3NP3BJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56688-poulan-p4018wt2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaZbDhUAkbQEmCoR3NP3BJ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"LaZbDhUAkbQEmCoR3NP3BJ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaZbDhUAkbQEmCoR3NP3BJ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"63ed58cb-55ab-4d40-816e-0bc051c4b123","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Whether you’ve got pine, oak, spruce, maple or crabapple trees growing on your property that need trimming or removal, the Poulan has the strength to get the job done. Another common remark among consumers is that the chainsaw starts in as little as five pulls even after a season of storage. Replacing the gas in its tank with fresh gas always helps in reducing the number of pulls it requires, but even with old gas the device hums to life with little effort.","On the downside, the oil chamber on the Poulan P4018WT does have a bad habit of leaking when in storage for a prolonged period of time. This issue is easily avoided by ensuring the oil levels are not completely full prior to extended storage.","Overall, the Poulan P4018WT earns points for its lightweight and easy-to-use controls, though it does require some assembly out of the box. Placing the bar and chain can prove problematic, as improper setup of the bar can result in crooked cutting and even cause the chain to drop.","The chainsaw comes equipped with the usual features of a chain braking system and auto chain oiler, but also offers the added perk of a carrying case. The device offers a one-year manufacturer’s warranty that will cover all major repairs to keep your chainsaw running over the long term. Unfortunately, a single year often isn’t a long enough span of time to identify manufacturing flaws unless you have a lengthy project that requires repeated use.","The Poulan P4018WT Wild Thing is a powerful, albeit tame, chainsaw and is up to the task in most landscaping and property maintenance tasks. It excels in removing trees up to 12 inches in diameter, though it can cut larger widths on downed trees. The chainsaw isn’t the most powerful out there, but it performs quite well for its price tag."]},"id":"3d5c59cf-247e-42f6-af8f-209256587a4d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56716","url":"/poulan-chain-saw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
