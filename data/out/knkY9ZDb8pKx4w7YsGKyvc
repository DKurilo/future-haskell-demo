It is not a position that any one wants to be in. There are few properties that the IRS cannot put a lien on. The most common tax lien for Americans is a lien on their home and business assets (including accounts receivables). In addition to liens on property, payroll checks can also be garnished. Payroll wage garnishments can be quite severe. The IRS also has the option to levy property, which means the seizure and sales of your property to cover your tax debt.","It is much easier and profitable for the IRS to seize funds over property, but it can happen. Tax liens usually don&#39;t happen unless the debt is over $25,000 and other methods of gathering payments have proven unsuccessful. And it most cases, if compliance is reached, and you pay your debt to under $25,000, you may request that liens to be released. Wage garnishments are not percent based. Wages can be garnished down to a set amount regardless of income. The IRS calls this &#34;excluded&#34; income. Whether you make $1000 per paycheck or $10,000 per paycheck, your excluded income will be the same. If you are single and can claim only one, the IRS can reduce your excluded income to $845.83 per month. For many, this amount will not cover their basic living expenses and will prove a severe financial burden. Again, this is a situation you will want to avoid. ","The quickest way to remove a wage garnishment or tax lien is to pay your IRS debt obligation completely. For many, this is simply not readily possible or they would have paid it already. If you are being garnished or you are experiencing a property lien or seizure, you have likely already missed or ignored some IRS communications or have defaulted on payment arrangements. So the best you can do is strive to get back in compliance. While it is always best to consult with a tax professional and contact the IRS about your specific case, there are a few things you can do to help bring yourself to compliance, including the following suggestions: "]},"id":"308be12b-5256-49b4-a45e-e12b68b5e94e","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Making sure you have accurately filed the past three years&#39; returns","You are current on your current estimated tax payments and federal tax deposits, if applicable","Get your debt down to $25,000 or less (keep in mind your wages can be garnished for less debt)","Make at least three debt direct payments consecutively, as agreed","Ensure that your Direct Debit Installment Agreement will pay your obligation within 60 months"],"type":"ul"},"id":"72b8d8a1-5662-4598-9c9d-799eab0ab1fd","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have already defaulted on a previous Direct Debt Installment agreement, your choices may be limited and the IRS may not want to enter another agreement with you.
