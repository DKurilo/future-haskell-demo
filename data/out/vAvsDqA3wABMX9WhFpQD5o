You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GreenWorks G-24V cordless electric leaf blower is so lightweight that you can use it comfortably and easily to clear your yard. At a mere 3.3 pounds, it is a breeze for anyone to use. It is powered by a 24-volt Lithium-ion battery, which means there are no emissions to the environment, plus you don&#39;t have to worry about mixing gas and oil like you would with a gas leaf blower. Another benefit is that you&#39;re not restricted by a cord. You can move about your yard freely sweeping away leaves and any lawn clippings.","This is lightest leaf blower of the 10 units we evaluated. If you are going to be using this blower over a long period of time, this reduces the chance of strain on your body.","Despite its numerous benefits of this <a href=\"/best-leaf-blowers\">leaf blower</a>, there are a couple drawbacks. This measures 96.3 decibels, which is noisy. You&#39;ll want to wear noise-blocking gear while using it as the blower exceeds U.S. standards for safe usage. This leaf blower also vibrates quite a bit and, at times, can jolt and pulsate during operation.","This leaf blower features a soft-grip handle, which helps somewhat with the tough vibrations this leaf blower exhibits, but you may still want to invest in a pair of anti-vibration gloves when using this leaf blower.","GreenWorks can blow debris 17 feet across a concrete floor. That is a good length, especially given its air power of 130 mph, even though there are some brands that can move debris further. The model features a curved handle, which allows you to easily carry the blower and point it in the direction you want without putting additional strain on your arm or shoulders. In other benefits, GreenWorks covers this leaf blower with a four-year warranty, which is a reasonable period of time.","This leaf blower has other drawbacks: It doesn&#39;t come with any additional convenience options, such as a vacuum or mulching function, and there are only two speed settings.","The GreenWorks G-24V leaf blower is hindered by its rough vibration and lack of convenience features, such as mulching or vacuuming. It is very light, however, so it may be ideal for anyone with a small yard who doesn&#39;t need a lot of features."]},"id":"b4fbe3f3-fe3d-4f5b-8029-6e78713e2c66","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56469","url":"/greenworks-leaf-blower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-22T23:47:47Z","datePublished":"2013-05-22T23:47:47Z","name":"GreenWorks G-24V","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":66,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-05-22T23:47:47Z","id":"vAvsDqA3wABMX9WhFpQD5o","meta":{"title":"GreenWorks G-24V Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The GreenWorks G-24V weighs only 3.3 pounds, presents a soft-grip, curved handle and is easy to use.
