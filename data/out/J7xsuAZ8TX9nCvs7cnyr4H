You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Well-respected for its designs of sports optics and security products, Barska also makes <a href=\"/best-metal-detectors\">metal detectors</a> with its Winbest line of detectors. The Winbest Elite 200 is a highly affordable option for beginning detectorists. While it’s easy to use and has above-average accuracy, it lacks some key features.","We tested the metal detectors in our review by burying treasure in a field at varying depths – pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. We also buried trash metals like nails and pull-tabs from soda cans. Then we recorded how accurate each detector was at identifying the metal and the depth. Once we swept across the field, we swept across it a second time.","The biggest issue with the Elite 200 is the lack of an adequate depth indicator. When you get a hit, it doesn’t indicate the depth, only the signal strength. The signal strength for hits at 2 inches was the same for hits at 10 and 12 inches. You can’t really use it to determine if you need to dig just below the surface or nearly a foot down, which is why it’s a good idea to use a handheld pinpoint tool with this metal detector. (That said, it’s a good idea to use a handheld pinpoint tool with any dig.)","For accuracy, the Elite 200 accurately identified the correct coin or trash metal 30 percent of the time, which was above average. It came close an additional 22 percent of the time. So, all in all, it’ll lead you to treasure on a little over 50 percent of the hits you make. It failed to detect 13 percent of the objects we buried, but this isn’t terribly surprising as most of the objects it missed were beyond its maximum depth.","The Elite Edition&#39;s design is straightforward enough: A standard S-shaped pipe supports the control box&#39;s housing, while a classic 10-inch concentric search coil rests at the end of its adjustable-length shaft. Its padded armrest is comfortable, adjustable and unobtrusive, and the buttons on its control box are all easily reached with your thumb while you&#39;re scanning – something not all detectors can claim.","Overall, it received an B+ for ease of use. There aren’t many learning curves with this detector. You can set it to ignore pennies and pull-tabs. In addition, the graphic target ID makes it very easy to identify what may be under the soil. However, it lacks a pinpoint feature, which is another reason why having a handheld pinpoint tool is a good idea.","Another downside to consider is the short one-year warranty and the weight. Most metal detectors come with a five-year warranty. And at 3.5 pounds, it’s the heaviest detector in our review. You’ll feel this extra weight after a few hours of hunting."]},"id":"f4f2d4a8-0e45-4e6c-b762-93a67b6115e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"60f71b45-f8a2-4113-8f0e-2b4b4fc789c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Barska Winbest Elite 200 is an affordable metal detector with reasonably good accuracy compared to other detectors, but the lack of adequate depth detection hurt it in our review.
