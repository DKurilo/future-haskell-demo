It is a no-frills, single-disc, budget player with progressive scanning and a good remote.","The GPX D1816 has a drawer-load that works with DVDs, CDs, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, and JPEG discs. It has a zoom feature, TV aspect ratio conversion for 4:3 and 16:19, and NTSC/PAL system conversion. The 2-channel audio, component video, digital coaxial, and S-video output are all located on the back of the deck.","Users of the D1816 have had mixed experiences. A few have been very disappointed with the deck not working soon after purchase, and several have complaints about the remote. Others have had no problems with the DVD player and have purchased several. Users particularly enjoyed the ease of setup and NTSC/PAL system conversion. Regardless of their experiences with the GPX D1816S, users have found that they simply can’t complain about the extremely low price.","The GPX D1816 offers a basic DVD player with limited features, but comes at a very low price. The drawer-load DVD player has easy setup with a variety of video output methods. If you’re looking for a simple DVD player for the lowest price, this deck may be a great option for you."]},"id":"55cfe3e0-aba2-47c4-9a83-1158c13d1ec3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_6453","url":"/gpx-d1816sil-3173-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","name":"GPX D1816 D1816SIL","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it is outdated.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it is outdated.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-08-11T17:48:04Z","id":"c97PKLh93QhqZ777iDAo57","meta":{"title":"GPX D1816 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
