This Mac encryption software employs a power-on authentication tool that requires a password before OSX is even loaded. Coupling full disk protection with start-time verification has the effect of making your system impregnable when it is not in use. However, this method also comes with a great deal of risk and should be used with extreme care.","Probably the most appealing aspect of Sophos SafeGuard for Mac is the completeness of the file encryption. Not only does this application encrypt every file on your Mac, but it also encrypts the operating system. This way you know for certain that not even the tiniest bit of information can escape your machine. This encryption software for Mac is great for enterprise users and companies that store large volumes of highly sensitive information. However, it doesn&#39;t have an option for a more targeted approach that may be more appropriate for people who don&#39;t feel that they need to lock down their systems like Fort Knox.","The most noticeable difference for anyone using Sophos SafeGuard for Mac will be the manner in which they log into their computers. After this Mac encryption software is installed, you will see the power-on authentication screen at startup. This is similar to the login screen that normally pops up when a Mac is password protected. The difference is that the password for the power-on authentication screen decrypts the drive rather than just granting access. The machine behaves normally thereafter. The obvious benefit to using this application to encrypt files on your Mac is that there are no workarounds to the power-on authentication screen, so without the password, it is nigh unto impossible to retrieve any information from a machine that is fully encrypted.","Now, this type of powerful, full-scale encryption is very useful. However, it&#39;s designed for advanced and enterprise users. This is not to say that average or causal users cannot find great use for it, but if you are not fully aware of the changes being made to your machine, such as hard drive partitions or the power-on authentication, you may find yourself in an unfamiliar situation and make mistakes that could result in completely locking yourself out of your Mac. If such a situation occurs, which happened during the course of our evaluation, only a complete wipe of the hard drive and operating system, and a complete reinstall of OSX, can fix the problem."]},"id":"0e70ea57-89b7-4333-a865-4a1e9e4c6d18","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3cec497d-9eab-47a0-a1ae-8ec2ab6a77c9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re looking for 100-percent security for every single file on your Mac, Sophos SafeGuard is probably the product you want.
