Telephoto lenses are also ideal for taking photos of subjects in motion like sports events or animals. The lens features several switches to change how it operates to keep you in control of your photos.","The EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM is light, weighing in at 1.7 pounds, as opposed other similar models, even from Canon, which can be nearly double the weight. The weight of a lens can factor in greatly since it’s possible to be strained by holding up heavy camera kits or hanging them around your neck over a span of time as you shoot.","The lens is built with Canon’s IS (image stabilization) feature which reduces motion blur when shooting handheld. Motion sensors within the lens sense the movement of the camera while you’re taking a photo and shift the image to compensate for any shakiness. It’s most useful when shooting without a tripod where you need to depend on your own stability to take a clear photo. This feature, paired with the lens’ lightweight design, makes it ideal for handheld shooting.","Multiple switches around the lens let you toggle options on and off to accommodate your shooting style. There is a switch to change auto-focus to manual. A focus limiter switch sets the field of focus on your lens, making focusing faster and more accurate. Another switch lets you change the IS mode to one tailored to shooting objects in motion. You can also turn the IS off completely.","The EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM is a full-frame lens telephoto lens that fits nearly every Canon camera. However, when paired with an APS-C camera, images will crop, giving you a narrower field of view.","This lens boasts high mobility due to its lightweight frame and features to keep your photos stable and sharp. While it doesn’t possess the higher aperture of other lenses in the series, this version is considerably cheaper and half the weight."]},"id":"1126b9c6-5465-41fc-ae5f-c8b063b5343a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68108","url":"/canon-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-07-18T16:46:19Z","datePublished":"2016-07-18T16:46:19Z","name":"Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens","synopsis":"The Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM  telephoto lens allows you to shoot photos across long distances, and  it is designed to be easy to carry and hold.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM  telephoto lens allows you to shoot photos across long distances, and  it is designed to be easy to carry and hold.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-07-18T16:46:19Z","id":"NBReMVTBGWnXAmydz7SJCo","meta":{"title":"Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM is a telephoto zoom lens for your DSLR camera lets you stay put while shooting photos across great distances.
