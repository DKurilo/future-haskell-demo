On paper, it looks like the best <a href=\"/best-hdtv-antennas\">HDTV antenna</a> around. It’s advertised as being able to pick up UHF and VHF signals from more than 150 miles away and has a built-in remote-controlled rotor. Upon further inspection, however, we discovered that everything is not as it seems with the HD-2805. While it is a great antenna, it doesn’t actually pick up signals from 150 miles away as advertised. In addition, it’s made of cheap plastic that may not withstand outdoor temperatures for very long."]},"id":"671b811e-d8b2-497a-b80e-3528337cd9ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Signal Quality"},"id":"92d83c36-bb68-47ae-a337-73113367c4ba","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Lava antennas may not be the best of the best, but they get the job done.

Even the largest HDTV antennas can rarely reach more than 80 miles to grab signals, and this antenna is just more than three feet long. Sure enough, when we mounted it at the height of a single-story rooftop, we found that the HD-2805 cannot pick up signals that are broadcast from more than about 50 miles away."]},"id":"54f44472-aef7-4b50-822d-a1ddd2125ab9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"0fc63d59-3313-4cb3-bdfe-d5fe963132a7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The installation instructions for the HD-2805 are filled with details, including an illustrated packing list, photos of each assembly step and a diagram to help you connect the antenna to a converter box and your television.

The HD-2805 is a directional antenna, but if you want to change the direction to pick up different channels, all you need to do is step outside and use the remote control to rotate it.","One of our main complaints about this antenna is that it’s made of plastic. Online images of the HD-2805 make it look like it is made of metal like most HDTV antennas, but the cheap quality of its plastic components leaves us doubting this antenna’s durability."]},"id":"2173c95c-49c3-40ae-ab75-ba52bacaf06b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"846b7775-c55c-4d9f-a762-fcda5996efb3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Compared to other HDTV antennas, the HD-2805 Outdoor Antenna from Lava is average.
