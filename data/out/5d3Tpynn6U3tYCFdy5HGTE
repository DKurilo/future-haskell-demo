Its ceramic heating technology makes it versatile, and its easy-to-read controls make it convenient. It’s a<a href=\"/best-hair-dryers\"> lightweight hair dryer</a> with more power than we expected, and it comes with a concentrator and a diffuser. While its accessories are among the least sturdy of those we evaluated, they fit securely and can help you achieve both smooth and textured hairstyles.","The InfinitiPRO has an 1,875-watt motor, which is typical of the hair dryers we tested. The <a href=\"/babylisspro-review\">BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium</a> and the <a href=\"/parlux-review\">Parlux 3200 Compact</a> have slightly more powerful motors, but 1,875 W is plenty of power for home use. Professional stylists often use 3,600-W blowers, but those salon-grade hair dryers are far more expensive than home models because they are built to dry more than 2,000 heads per year in a much shorter time per head.","The Conair dryer weighs only 1.1 pounds, making it the second lightest model we tested. The <a href=\"/revlon-perfect-heat-review\">Revlon Perfect Heat Fast Dry</a> weighs 0.1 pound less, but the Revlon blower is a travel dryer that has fewer settings and accessories. Both hair dryers have 6-foot cords, which isn’t quite long enough for easy maneuverability. They are also the loudest models we tested, each generating 85.5 decibels at their highest operating levels.","The InfinitiPRO has three heat settings and two air speed settings to help you find the optimal combination for your hair. To minimize hair damage when using any blow dryer, it’s best to use the lowest effective temperature while drying. The ability to adjust both heat and airflow levels with the Conair maximizes your control to achieve the desired styling result. Based on our lab testing, the hair dryer’s temperature range is 108 to 158 degrees, and its air speed ranges from 23.8 to 29.1 feet per second.","Like eight of the 10 blowers we tested, the InfinitiPRO has a removable endcap. That lets you clean its filter more easily to remove lint buildup and extend the life of its motor.","The Conair dryer also scored high marks for its handle. “It’s a terrific handle that perfectly matches the arc of my hand,” one tester said.","“It might feel just a little bit top-heavy,” said another, “but the overall weight balance is good.”","We invited both female and male testers to evaluate each of the hair dryers in our review, and we appreciated their feedback not only about each device’s functionality, but also about pricing and aesthetics.","Like all of the dryers we tested, the InfinitiPRO has a cool-shot button to give you a blast of unheated air when you’re ready to set your style. This blower’s cool-shot button makes a noticeable clicking sound, but the click doesn’t seem to indicate a problem. Pushing the button creates an immediate temperature change, which is important if you need to reduce heat quickly.","“This hair dryer works better than I expected overall,” one tester told us. “You can tell definite differences when you switch between heat and air speed settings. Granted, some of the other hair dryers feel more solid, but this one still does the job.”","Many manufacturers offer only a year or two of consumer protection on hair dryers. Conair, however, backs the InfinitiPRO with a four-year warranty (as Remington does for the Pro Thermaluxe, our best-overall pick, and BaByliss does for the Nano Titanium, which is roughly twice the price of the Conair dryer). You can contact Conair customer service by phone and email."]},"id":"c1cf0d3f-ba36-49d8-acc6-88c657604966","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58172","url":"/conair-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:58:18Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:58:18Z","name":"Conair InfinitiPRO","synopsis":"With an MSRP of $39.99, the Conair InfinitiPRO is a great value.
