The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-circular-saws\">Circular Saws</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Craftsman 10870 is a lightweight circular saw that comes with a number of additional features, but it lacks the power and effectiveness of the best corded circular saws we reviewed. As with most sidewinder saws, the sawblade is located on the right-hand side of the tool, giving it a nice balance, but at the expense of a fully visible blade. This 7 1/4-inch saw is one of the only products we reviewed that did not have a place to store the blade&#39;s hex key on the tool itself, which is a minor oversight but still something to consider.","This saw has an ineffective dust chute that allows sawdust to build up around the blade and cut line. This proved to be rather frustrating in the middle of a long cut in our tests, as we had to lean close to the material to blow excess sawdust away from the cutting line. Additionally, the excess sawdust obscured our visibility of the blade itself, making it rather difficult to cut in a straight, even line. However, the Craftsman 10870 does include a laser line that you can use to help you maintain a straight cut.","The Craftsman 10870 does allow you to make plunge cuts with a maximum depth of 2 3/8 inches at a 90-degree angle and 1 13/16 inches at a 45-degree angle. You can adjust the bevel up to 54.5 degrees, which allows you to make versatile cuts with the tool. Unfortunately, the tool only pulls 14 amps, the only saw in our reviews to do so, and has a maximum speed of 5,000 rpm, which is the slowest of all the circular saws we reviewed.","In case you run into any defects, Craftsman offers a one-year warranty with this tool to protect you from such situations. You can download the owner&#39;s manual from the company&#39;s website if you misplace the one that comes with the tool. You can contact customer support through email, phone or live chat."]},"id":"b2a1dd73-ad88-426a-a53b-580b87bfbec6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce12fa0e-27ac-4611-8492-87d53156dbe0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Craftsman 10870 is a decent saw that can cut through various materials, but without the speed, ease or efficiency of the top circular saws.
