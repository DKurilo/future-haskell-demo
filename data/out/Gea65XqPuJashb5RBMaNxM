The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">Floor Standing Speakers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The Sony SS F-7000 tower speakers are an affordable choice if you&#39;re looking to upgrade your outdated audio system. At first glance, these floor standing speakers do nothing to immediately impress. The matte black finish is generic with a black grill the covers the entire front face of the speaker. When you remove the grill, you begin to see this stereo speaker system’s unique characteristics.","This home stereo system is driven by two 8-inch enhanced H.O.P cone drivers, one 3.2-inch enhanced H.O.P driver and a single 1-inch dome tweeter. We only reviewed one other speaker that boasted 8-inch woofers. Larger woofers generally represent lower frequencies better. The white speakers contrast the matte black finish and give these Sony speakers some character.","Sound quality is what matters most, and these speakers lack definition. The sound is flat, lacking clarity and tonal separation, with overly boomy bass production. There is no dampening material within the speakers, which is a common problem among less expensive speakers. This results in the woofers moving too much and causing unwanted tones.","The Sony SS F-7000 has a frequency response of 35Hz to 50kHz. The 50kHz high frequency looks impressive on paper, but the human ear can only process sound up to 20kHz. This spec is simply to boost this speaker’s appeal.","The maximum power this speaker can handle is 200 watts and the nominal impedance is 8-ohms. Minimal power requirements allow these speakers to be used on virtually any low-powered amplifier or receiver. This can be nice if you have an older receiver you don’t feel like replacing. Though these speakers don’t require a lot of power to run, the low sensitivity rating of 90dB suggests that these speakers mismanage power consumption and aren’t as efficient as many others we reviewed.","Each speaker is 41.9 inches high, 11.9 inches wide and 11.5 inches deep. They weigh 33 pounds apiece. The speakers are available only in black and are covered by a one-year warranty. This is the shortest warranty we have seen from a manufacturer."]},"id":"7f5830fe-6ff9-47df-8bec-02433e73bd94","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a0a43d20-70ae-4d22-8b56-98df0338c221","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony SS F-7000 makes for a quick upgrade to your outdated audio equipment.
