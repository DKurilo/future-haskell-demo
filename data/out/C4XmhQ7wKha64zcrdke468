Your customers expect to be able to pay for these recurring services in the easiest way possible, which means they supply their credit card once and then have the card billed automatically for the duration of the subscription.","Many <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing services</a> can accommodate recurring payments. While all businesses seeking the best credit card processor should investigate the processor&#39;s reputation, rates and customer support, subscription-based companies need to consider the following additional factors:","1.\tFind a credit card processing company that integrates with your eCommerce software or that has the ability to handle recurring payments itself. With a compatible credit card processor, you can set up your shopping cart software to handle transactions automatically. If you don&#39;t have eCommerce software yet, some credit card processors supply gateways, hosted payment pages or online store platforms that include the tools you need to handle subscriptions, saving you money.","Here are some tools to look for:<br/>•\tProgrammable billing schedules that allow you to set up recurrent billing with specific dates or that can be configured to bill automatically on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual basis.<br/>•\tCredit card expiration date reminders that alert either you or your customer when a card or a subscription is set to expire.<br/>•\tAccount updating capability that automatically retrieves new card expiration dates from the card networks and updates the credit card accounts on file, saving you the hassle of contacting customers and manually keying in new expiration dates.<br/>•\tFlexible credit card descriptors that allow you to add a note to customers&#39; credit card statements, helping them recognize the expense; thus preventing unnecessary chargebacks.","2.\tGet the best security. You want to look for a processor that tokenizes sensitive credit card information and stores it in an encrypted card vault on its secure servers. The best processors are PCI Level-1 Compliant, which is the highest compliance level offered by the Payment Card Industry&#39;s security council. Additionally, it&#39;s important that your in-house payment system is PCI compliant, has a TSL 1.1 or higher security certificate and that your entire system is password protected, including specific administrative levels that prevent employees from accessing areas of your system they shouldn&#39;t be accessing.","3.\tNegotiate rates. Once you&#39;ve narrowed your search for a payment processor to your top choices, compare rates, fees and contractual terms. Subscriptions ensure a regular monthly income for you and your credit card processor. You may be able to leverage this guaranteed income to your advantage and negotiate for better rates or fewer fees.","After you choose a processor and start charging your customers on a recurring basis, you need to have a plan for failed transactions. While running the card a second time – just in case – is a good idea, you also want a process in place to flag failed transactions and contact the individuals to reestablish the subscriptions.","Even the best credit card processors can&#39;t help you if a transaction fails due to a canceled credit card. Your subscribers with canceled cards may have forgotten their subscription to your service was tied to the card that was canceled and need a reminder call, email or letter requesting new card information in order to prevent disrupted service.","The best credit card processing companies automate recurring payments for subscription-based businesses. They have tools to handle routine changes in credit cards, such as new expiration dates, and have excellent security. With a good credit card processor to handle subscription payments, you&#39;re free to concentrate on other areas of your business that need your attention.","Contributing Writer: Karina Fabian"]},"id":"4b9b699d-88a1-40f2-943f-f4acf59f268b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10127","url":"/subscription-business","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-05T21:16:10Z","datePublished":"2016-10-05T21:16:10Z","name":"Credit Card Processing For Subscription-Based Businesses","synopsis":"From magazines to meals to club memberships, subscription-based products and services are continually popular.","review":{},"strapline":"From magazines to meals to club memberships, subscription-based products and services are continually popular.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-05T21:53:44Z","id":"C4XmhQ7wKha64zcrdke468","meta":{"title":"Credit Card Processing For Subscription-Based Businesses","description":"Recurring credit card processing can make handling subscription-based payments a breeze, but there are some factors you should consider.
