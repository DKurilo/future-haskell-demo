Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it  has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are looking for a <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">high definition camcorder</a> that covers the basics then you will want to take a look at the Canon VIXIA HF G10. It doesn&#39;t come with much memory capacity, but you can use memory cards if you need extra time. And though we were impressed with the zoom and LUX rating, you will probably not be using this HDV camcorder in place of a digital camera since it takes 2.37-megapixel still images.","There are a variety of features to look at when it comes to image and video quality. Some of the things to consider are the zoom, still camera resolution, focal length, LUX rating and recording speed. All of these features combined make sure that you get a quality image in whatever lighting or position you may be standing.","The specifics of the Canon VIXIA HF G10 include a middle range zoom of 10x for optical and 200x for digital. Though this number isn&#39;t the highest we&#39;ve seen, it does mean that you can still record the action without needing to be in the middle of it. The focal length of the camera is a pretty standard 4.25-42.5 mm and the LUX rating is great, coming in at 0.1. That is the lowest of any of the HD video cameras we looked at.","Some of the specifications are not as good as we feel they should be. This is true when it comes to the recording speed but is especially true with the still camera resolution. The recording speed is 24 megabits per second, and while this isn&#39;t bad, it isn&#39;t the best. Having a higher recording speed means a more fluid video. What really disappointed us was the still camera resolution, which is only 2.37MP. Most cell phone cameras have better resolution than this. This means you will probably have to carry around a digital camera if you want to take photos.","There are several additional features of this camera that make is a respectable product. Some of what we looked at was the physical dimensions and the navigation. The camcorder is 3.1 inches high, 3 inches wide and 5.9 inches long. The weight is 18 ounces, placing it in the middle of the pack. The navigation uses a few of the buttons and a 3.5-inch touchscreen. One of the features we would have liked to see is an embedded GPS device. This isn&#39;t necessary but it is an added benefit when you are trying to remember where you filmed your movie.","The memory that comes with this camera is somewhat disappointing. Though we were pleased with the dual memory card slot that is equipped to handle SD, SDHC and SDXC cards, the internal memory is dismal. It only comes with 32GB of memory, which when filming in HD is not much. This HDV camcorder can record up to 12 hours on the lowest setting and roughly 3 hours with full HD."]},"id":"ed6218c8-eeff-4d6f-bb94-82e0a79fc76c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1979ea94-2196-41f3-9576-4c318ce2fcc6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Canon VIXIA HF G10</strong> is a product that covers the basics and doesn&#39;t bring much extra to the table.
