That’s why it is the subtle differences that make a difference. Most LED TVs include wireless internet so you can use web apps and browse the internet. The Sharp Aquos 6 Series has many of the features you want in an LED TV, and the most important aspect – picture quality – captivates viewers with eye-popping realism.","Sharp prides itself on its Quattron technology. Most manufacturers use three colored subpixels – red, green and blue. Sharp takes it one step further. Quattron technology adds yellow to the spectrum. This one extra color lends a new dimension to video quality, improving the contrast ratio and producing more vibrant colors. While the picture on the Sharp Aquos 6 Series is excellent, we’re just not sure how big a difference the extra subpixel makes. Nonetheless, the video quality on this LED TV is superb as the black level and color accuracy scores are way above average and blow away low end TVs.","The 6 Series also has the smart TV features you desire. With the built-in Wi-Fi you can connect wirelessly to the internet and access streaming video apps like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu Plus so you can catch up on your favorite movies, TV show or cat videos. If you want to use the web browser to surf the web or get on the Facebook or Skype apps to keep up with friends and family, you can also do that.","Sharp has been making TVs for a long time, so you can trust in their dependability. Sharp offers an industry standard one-year warranty. Sharp has a reputation of supporting its products and offers plenty of customer service options if you do have a problem or question that needs to be answered."]},"id":"905dbeb9-372b-4d6e-9bab-f33d6a71d26f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce91484c-e5d4-486b-b42a-defd6edc3d95","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Because an LED TV is a high priced item, you want to buy from a company you can trust.
