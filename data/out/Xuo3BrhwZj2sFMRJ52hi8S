The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-dishwashers\">Dishwashers</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Bosch 800 Series SHX68T55UC dishwasher is fairly standard all around with its wash cycles and wash options. Although it lacks a child-lock function, it includes some advanced features. And it’s incredibly energy efficient so it doesn&#39;t cost much to operate.","The sound level on this Bosch built-in dishwasher is just 44 decibels, which makes the unit very quiet while running a wash cycle. You can fit a lot of dishes into a single load, up to 15 place settings. Additionally, this unit features three racks – two regular-sized dishwasher racks and one small third rack on top. The racks are adjustable to three different height levels, giving it a total of nine different positions. This unit’s racks also include fold-down tines, which make loading large items easy.","You have a choice of six wash cycles and an additional five wash options to pair with the wash cycles. The six wash cycles are heavy, auto, eco, normal, express and a rinse only cycle. The five options you get are delay, half load, delicate, sanitize and extra shine.","This Bosch dishwasher also features a sanitation wash option, and it’s certified by the National Sanitation Foundation. When you select this wash option, the wash cycle will use high-temperature water to make sure your dishes are sanitized.","This Bosch dishwasher is ENERGY STAR qualified and estimated to only cost you an annual $27 to operate. Additionally, it is estimated to consume just 259 kilowatt-hours every year. Along with its low estimated operating cost and energy consumption, this ENERGY STAR-rated Bosch dishwasher includes an eco-friendly wash cycle. This cycle is recommended for delicate dishes; it will lower the water temperature and shorten the length of the wash cycle to help save energy. Although this energy-efficient dishwasher features an eco-friendly wash cycle, there is not an eco-friendly dry function.","Bosch tacks on an impressive warranty with this dishwasher. For the first year, the unit’s parts and any labor will be covered. Additionally, the racks and electronics on the unit are backed by five-year coverage, while a lifetime warranty kicks in for the unit’s tub and door liner. Bosch offers customer support by phone and email. You can also access the dishwasher’s user manual along with FAQs and tutorials on the Bosch website."]},"id":"2514fd32-91a9-4747-8520-441ec1bc9440","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"23b1e573-3d1d-4079-99ed-7d71eb4d46bd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch 800 Series SHX68T55UC dishwasher has some surprising features, including adjustable racks and energy efficiency.
