The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-sports-tickets\">Sports Ticket Websites</a> here.</em>","TicketsInventory is a secondary sports ticket broker company that is looking to provide you easy access to theatre, concert, event and sports tickets. The design of the website is standard among those sport ticket websites we reviewed. A search bar at the top of the screen allows you to perform specialized ticket searches, which you will find a time saver as you can search tickets by team, event and date. After clicking on the sports tab, there is a list of sport-specific topics from baseball, basketball, football and hockey tickets to rodeo, rugby and car racing tickets. The wide range of ticket options is a real plus of the TicketsInventory site.","The fees charged by TicketsInventory are standard when compared to other sport ticket sites. Other websites we reviewed will display cheap sports tickets but add additional fees onto the backend of the purchase – TicketsInventory does add fees like a general service fee, shipping and will call, but none are overly exuberant.","A real drawback with TicketsInventory is the lack of ticket resale on the website. Other websites will allow you to list your extra tickets on their website for resale – that is not the case with TicketsInventory. Other similar sports tickets sites will also use the resale option as part of their return policy, offering to resale tickets customers wanted to return. With TicketsInventory, all sales are final and there is no return policy offered.","The part of the sports ticket business where TicketsInventory thrives is the delivery of your purchased tickets. You can choose to have your tickets delivered traditionally by mail service, through email in an eTicket that you printout and present at the door, paperlessly to your smart phone so you can use your phone&#39;s screen as a ticket at the ballpark, or printed off at a pick-up center. There are charges involved with each option, but the versatility of options help you to find both the most economical and convenient solution that works for your schedule.","TicketsInventory has both email and phone support if you encounter problems with your ticket purchase. You can also complete your purchase over the phone with TicketsInventory, a feature not offered by other sports ticket site. TicketsInventory has a good FAQs section on their website designed to help quickly answer common questions."]},"id":"76ed742a-443f-43f5-9ed8-bf4606b51b2c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6b3c6c7a-ab6d-42c3-b557-6c50ae5f4628","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TicketsInventory is a good location for a safe and easy way to buy sports tickets.
