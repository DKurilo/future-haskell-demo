Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-smoke-detectors\">Smoke Detectors</a> here.</em>","The BRK 7010B is a hardwired photoelectric smoke detector that is best equipped to detect smoke from slow-burning, smoldering fires. It comes with a 10-year manufacturer warranty and top-quality support for troubleshooting but lacks some additional features that would push it higher up in our rankings.","Unlike wireless smoke detectors that utilize battery power around the clock and require more frequent battery replacement, the BRK 7010B is hardwired directly into your home’s electrical system. This means that during power outages, it switches to backup power provided by a single 9-volt battery. As a result, you can expect to achieve much longer battery performance. Regardless of the battery life, safety precautions dictate you should still change out your smoke alarm batteries every 12 months. A chirping sound notifies you when the backup battery needs to be replaced.","One of the benefits that most hardwired smoke detectors have over battery-powered units is the ability to interconnect with one another. The BRK 7010B includes this function, which sounds all alarms in your home when one of them is tripped and can cut down on the risk of an alarm not being heard. It is capable of being interconnected with up to 18 BRK devices, with a limit of 12 smoke alarms and six other devices, like carbon monoxide (CO) detectors or heat alarms.","A flashing red LED on the initiating unit tells you which alarm was tripped. A standard hush button lets you silence all alarms at once. The same button performs double duty as the smoke detector’s test button, which you can use to ensure your alarm is working properly. The BRK 7010B has an alarm that sounds off at 85 decibels, which is standard. Help and support channels include telephone, email, online FAQs and a downloadable manual.","The unit has a photoelectric sensor that can detect the presence of smoke, specifically smoke emanating from smoldering fires. It does not have an ionization detector, which is another smoke-detecting technology that works better with fast-burning, raging fires. For this reason, you may want to opt for a dual-sensor unit that can do both or purchase separate ionization detectors to place in your home."]},"id":"eb79cf0d-81d6-48a2-96cf-67292c2c33b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"76209cf2-1248-496f-8f79-676092283584","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BRK 7010B is best equipped to detect smoldering fires but still has the ability to detect flaming fires.
