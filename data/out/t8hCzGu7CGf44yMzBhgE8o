We were especially impressed with the powerful bass that reverberated through the capped earphones when we played hip hop and rap. It has some of the best bass options of all the products we tested.","The device also boasts an automatic level control which regulates the wireless audio to adjust for speech recognition. We did notice a difference when using these wireless headphones, especially when watching DVDs. The sound quality was clear and we were able to notice the sound level adjusting to the different variances in the movies. As the scenes got quiet and only dialogue was played, the volume increased so we could understand everything being said.","There are a few different technologies that can be used for wireless headphones: infrared, Bluetooth, Kleer and radio frequencies (RF). Infrared technology uses light emitting diodes (LEDs) and the range is limited. You have to stay within the view of the transmitting device when using infrared headphones. Bluetooth technology opens communication between two different products, such as a headset and a cell phone. Kleer technology is a proprietary design that can transmit a high volume of data wirelessly and provides audio products with 16 bit digital lossless sound. The Sennheiser earphones we reviewed utilize radio frequency (RF) technology. This technology is the most common of the transmission standards. The manufacturer advertises a 320 foot range; however, for optimum listening standards, we found it best to stay within approximately 30 feet. After wandering too far from the transmitter, the sound quality decreases significantly."]},"id":"943a61ed-fb5b-4ca9-8895-a30254ca26ff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"656f7b8a-7699-4a4b-a32f-43b685acea80","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sennheiser RS180 model is a plug-and-play device; there is no setup required. The transmitter is plugged into the audio sources of your choice and when the product is turned on, they are automatically recognized. The transmitter can broadcast the signal to four different wireless headphones at the same time. The headphones include a balance control to customize the sound balance in your left and right earphones.","One of the useful features offered with this model is the transmitter. It also serves as a docking and charging station for your wireless headphones. The device can plug right into the transmitter while not in use. As the batteries get closer to losing charge, a series of lights will appear. However, the life of these batteries can easily exceed 20 hours of constant play and we loved the fact that we would never have to purchase batteries.","The wireless headphones are over-the-ear and completely comfortable. Unlike the Pioneer SE-DIR800C model, this product does not use Dolby Digital Surround Sound. Instead, this model utilizes the Kleer uncompressed audio transmission. The headphones produce a clear digital sound that is sure to please even the pickiest of listeners. Sennheiser delivers a clear sound with this model and we did not notice any digital interference or playback, even as we wandered away from the transmitter.","All the control buttons are located on the sideâ€“ volume controls, the power button, the left and right balance buttons, and the LED battery-indicator light.
