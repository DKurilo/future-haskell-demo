Although it can only record content from an antenna or streaming video services, the TiVo Roamio OTA VOX is a smart option for certain households.","This <a href=\"/best-dvrs\">digital video recorder</a> has a 1TB internal hard drive, which is standard across the industry. It can record up to 150 hours of HD content or up to 1,000 hours of standard definition content. It also has four tuners, so multiple people in your household can record shows simultaneously. It can stream to multiple rooms in your house, letting everyone in your household watch what they want when they want.","If you’re worried about what your little ones might access, the unit has parental control settings you can adjust. You can also easily schedule one or more recordings for any show and even skip commercials when you watch recorded content.","Unlike other TiVo DVR recorders, like the <a href=\"http://www.toptenreviews.com/tivo-bolt-vox-review\">Bolt VOX</a>, the Roamio OTA VOX doesn’t require a subscription, which saves you money. As for the kinds of TV shows or movies it can access and record, it is limited to over-the-air (OTA) content. It can also access video and audio streaming services you subscribe to. However, it cannot access satellite or cable content.","The Roamio OTA VOX has a decent variety of ports. It features a USB 2.0 for external storage, an HDMI port, Ethernet, coax and composite video. However, the DVR itself is one of the largest on our lineup. It measures 15.1 x 7.4 x 2 inches.","The device comes with a full selection of direct and indirect customer service support resources from TiVo. If you want to contact a representative directly, you can do so via email, phone or live chat – team members are easy to talk to and provide you with any information you need. TiVo also has a variety of guides and how-to resources available on its website, so you have all the information you need to troubleshoot something or learn more about your DVR.","Though it’s limited to recording over-the-air content, the TiVo Roamio OTA VOX is a solid DVR, with the capacity to record content from video and audio streaming services as well. It has four tuners, which let you record multiple shows at the same time and stores them on the internal 1TB hard drive. It has all of the necessary ports and is backed by great customer service, making it a decent option if you want to get away from cable or satellite subscriptions."]},"id":"59f09ca0-e7ac-4483-a814-7360b7a1178e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55169","url":"/tivo-roamio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-09-28T01:12:41Z","datePublished":"2012-09-28T01:12:41Z","name":"TiVo Roamio OTA VOX","synopsis":"Just because you don’t have a cable or satellite television subscription doesn’t mean you’re forever unable to watch your favorite shows and movies whenever you want.","review":{"rating":75,"verdict":"The TiVo Roamio OTA VOX has multiple tuners and 1TB of storage, making it a decent option for a family, though it is somewhat limited in the types of content it can record.","pros":["It does not require any sort of subscription."],"cons":["It can only capture OTA content or streamed video from services you have subscriptions to."]},"strapline":"Just because you don’t have a cable or satellite television subscription doesn’t mean you’re forever unable to watch your favorite shows and movies whenever you want.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","id":"PCaDQ2WwK7V8dcaKaHhDSP","meta":{"title":"TiVo Roamio OTA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TiVo Roamio OTA VOX has multiple tuners and 1TB of storage, making it a decent option for a family, though it is somewhat limited in the types of content it can record."},"products":[{"slug":"tivo-roamio-ota-vox","url":"/product/tivo-roamio-ota-vox","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","name":"TiVo Roamio OTA VOX","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","id":"Zx9YPj7ozwXosNYWrtYVUQ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/A4G5WsfEd7hEMoccHwtEUT.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","mimeType":"","name":"70e57ba124fd5efef9bfbf41659bd418.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/70e57ba124fd5efef9bfbf41659bd418.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","id":"A4G5WsfEd7hEMoccHwtEUT","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4G5WsfEd7hEMoccHwtEUT.jpg","alt":""},"title":"TiVo Roamio OTA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TiVo Roamio OTA VOX has multiple tuners and 1TB of storage, making it a decent option for a family, though it is somewhat limited in the types of content it can record."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/A4G5WsfEd7hEMoccHwtEUT.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","mimeType":"","name":"70e57ba124fd5efef9bfbf41659bd418.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/70e57ba124fd5efef9bfbf41659bd418.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","id":"A4G5WsfEd7hEMoccHwtEUT","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4G5WsfEd7hEMoccHwtEUT.jpg","alt":""},"title":"TiVo Roamio OTA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TiVo Roamio OTA VOX has multiple tuners and 1TB of storage, making it a decent option for a family, though it is somewhat limited in the types of content it can record."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/tivo-roamio-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"tv","url":"/electronics/tv","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","name":"TV","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:08:43Z","id":"hetzCY2dg335aDLYkLr6cG","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
