It does not include a library of recipes, but it can import text files, web recipes and information copied to the clipboard, so the library does not have to stay blank for long. The program lets you import and revise recipes you find. Adding a recipe manually by typing in each field is a simple process, though somewhat tedious. And while no recipes are included with this software, the manufacturer allows you to download recipe packs from its website.","This Mac recipe software is far from the most attractive program, but what it lacks in style, it makes up for in options. You can customize the ingredients list, add divider lines to make recipes more legible and add any nutritional information that you wish to document. You can also add one recipe as an ingredient in another. For example, you can add one recipe of homemade chicken stock as an ingredient for homemade chicken noodle soup.","Recipe Box&#39;s meal-planning tool is one of the more unique interpretations of meal plans we saw during our review process. Rather than conforming to preset daily or weekly menus, the software allows you to create free-form menus. One menu might be for Sunday, another for next Tuesday, a third for a dinner party next month, a fourth for the first week of the month, etc. This flexibility is incredibly handy for cooks who prefer a little less structure in their kitchen.","The shopping list, on the other hand, leaves a bit to be desired. There is no way to organize items by type, as in other programs, to simplify a shopping trip. Creating multiple shopping lists is not possible, and you can&#39;t add recipes to an existing list, meaning you have to create a new shopping list every time you want to add a recipe. Because of these shortcomings, Recipe Box&#39;s shopping list tool is the least convenient among the Mac recipe software we reviewed.","This program has a useful, interactive conversion tool to help scale and adjust recipes according to how much food you need to cook. The software includes a live search field, so you can find your favorite recipes quickly. However, Recipe Box does not offer other tools such as a duplicate recipe finder, which would reduce clutter.","The program has an excellent recipe index and filtering capabilities, which allow you to attach a label to certain recipes to make finding them easier. When you really want to organize your recipes, you can put them into the recipe index, where there are even more categories for storing recipes.","If you have trouble with the software, support is available via email. You can also check out a FAQs section and user manual directly from the website. However, the website lacks video tutorials to walk you through specific processes."]},"id":"e0acdd3f-8c60-4799-bc28-045fc15770a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4c17920b-0d6d-400d-a366-99b1a9498a51","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Recipe Box is not the most visually stunning program that we have seen, but it offers numerous features that make it a useful companion in the kitchen.
