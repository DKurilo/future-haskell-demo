While they maintain a physical presence there, their main focus is distributing their conversion software online. Wondershare offers several different products outside of the traditional video and audio conversion lines, including scrapbooking and image editing products. This diversification has helped them become one of the largest software exporters in their native China, but the lack of attention they were able to pay to their converter caused it to lose a few points in our comparison. That said, Wondershare is still able to compete with some of the top-rated DVD to iPad converters on the market.","Some of Wondershareâ€™s most impressive aspects are its complete feature set and impressive ease of use. Without exception, this application provides every feature that we looked for, including video enhancement tools and audio extraction capabilities. It fell behind the top three contenders, however, due to its slightly poorer converted video quality and average conversion speed. Nevertheless, its pros outweigh its cons, and it ends up near the top of our comparison."]},"id":"68d553b4-594d-40a4-92de-2fd0996f3e04","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fa96e997-fe95-4ab7-b136-1c00f18c28fb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though it has a few drawbacks, the Wondershare DVD to iPad converter is a high-quality product overall.
