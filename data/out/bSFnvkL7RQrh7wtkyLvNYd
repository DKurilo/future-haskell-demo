You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The VonHaus 2-in1 Upright Stick works as a traditional long vacuum cleaner using an extension tube or as a handheld vacuum, allowing a lightweight, convenient option for cleaning furniture and drapes. The large 1.2 liter dust-bin capacity means the container  needs to be emptied less frequently than other smaller models. We weren’t impressed, though, with its overall vacuuming performance, and the website offered very little in terms of customer support.","This <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vacuum cleaner</a> didn&#39;t perform great on carpet. It took six passes to pick up all the dust and debris we spread out. On hardwood it was worse, requiring a total of eight passes. This vacuum is not a good choice if you have pets in your home. The VonHaus simply doesn’t do well with picking up clingy fur. In our pet-hair test, it only picked up half of the hair we spread out, the worst of the ten stick vacs we tested. The VonHaus comes with a swivel head, but it lacks range of motion and doesn’t provide you the ability to change the direction a full 90 degrees.","The VonHaus has a nice overall design and feel. The head swivels smoothly and the removable hand vac sits low on the vacuum and doesn’t add much weight. In fact, its lower-powered motor makes this the lightest vacuum we tested. With an empty dust bin, the VonHaus comes in at just over 3 pounds.","One big concern was that, despite lacking power and performance, the vacuum was unusually loud. We tested it at a volume level of 96.5 decibels, which is twice as loud as the best stick vacuums. The noise was jarring and nearly requires ear buds to use when you&#39;re vacuuming","The VonHaus website also leaves much to be desired. It’s difficult to navigate and there isn’t a page devoted specifically to this model. There are no FAQs and no direct customer service number. If you end up losing the manual, you’re out of luck. VonHaus doesn’t have an online manual for reference."]},"id":"1b37de13-fd6a-4afb-910c-1c63ea7df355","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1f0a817-704d-4cf0-9427-c4884646da64","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We had high hopes for this vacuum, but the VonHaus fell short.
