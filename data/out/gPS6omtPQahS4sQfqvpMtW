You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Body-Solid EXM2500S is a versatile and durable <a href=\"/best-home-gyms\">home workout solution</a>. This product features two seats and can perform up to 21 exercises to give you a full-body workout. It features a 210-pound weight stack and is built with steel and fiberglass reinforced nylon pulleys. The machine also features a lifetime warranty, which is an exceptional addition.","This home gym&#39;s 21 exercises can work your entire body, including your pectorals, quads, traps, delts, triceps and abs. You can enjoy features such as a chest press, pec station, leg extension/leg curl, lat pull downs and seated rows. If you want more exercises for your fitness plan, look at the <a href=\"/bowflex-xtreme-2-se-review\">Boxflex Xtreme 2SE</a> that gives you more than 70 exercises.","The workout system comes with a 210-pound weight stack. Many similar products max out at 160 pounds. However, there is no option to upgrade this machine.","The Body-Solid EXM2500S features two seats. It is built with a steel frame, 2,200-pound test cables and fiberglass-reinforced nylon pulleys. You will want a fairly large workout area for this machine. It is  6.9 feet tall and 4.25 feet wide. It weighs up to 440 pounds.","A lat bar, weight bar and an ankle strap are all included. We would like to see training DVDs and other exercise assistance provided to help you utilize the machine to its fullest. You can purchase additional accessories such as weight adapter plates, stirrup handles and tricep ropes.","This home gym comes with a lifetime warranty on both the frame and all moving parts. We are pleased to see a lifetime warranty featured on this product, as many similar machines are limited in their warranty coverage. If you find that you have questions or concerns regarding this home workout system, you can communicate with representatives via email and telephone."]},"id":"9ae6f35d-bcf8-46c6-b239-7cde9c22ef7a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e6de9c4e-53c9-4934-baa4-a44294ee53bf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Body-Solid EXM2500S has many benefits, including the lifetime warranty, a 210-pound weight stack and several included accessories.
