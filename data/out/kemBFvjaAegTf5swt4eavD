If the scheduling process is not smooth in your dental office and patients are waiting prolonged periods of time, you can easily lose their service.","<a href=\"/best-dental-software\">Dental practice management software</a> is one option to help keep the scheduling process quick and simple. However, even if you don t understand a few key components of scheduling appointments, you can run into a crowded waiting room and upset patients. Here are five ways you can simplify the dental scheduling process and keep everyone happy."," ","<strong>Consider Set-up and Restocking Supplies</strong>","It is often the role of front desk personnel to decide how far apart appointments are made. Unfortunately, these workers may not understand that it takes time between patients to restock supplies, clean the area, read through upcoming patient s files and more. Additionally, some appointments may run into a few unwanted circumstances and appointments can run much longer than planned. When deciding how far apart to schedule appointments, it is important to allow extra time for the small details to take place. These tasks must be completed and it is better patients are not waiting for them to be complete.","<strong>Communicate Directly with the Dentist</strong>","Dentists have their own preferred way of managing the schedule. Discuss with them exactly what they want and expect when seeing patients. Also, communicate with them regularly about any upcoming vacation plans they may have or days they are planning on coming in late or taking off early. You must plan around these events and it can make for some disgruntled patients if you cancel their appointment last minute.","<strong>Do Not Overbook</strong>","Overbooking patients is a common mistake but one that should be greatly avoided. By trying to rush patients in to see the dentist, even if they have just a minor problem, it is time away from others. It is time they must sit in the waiting room. Some situations may require overbooking patients like if you have a large problem with no-show patients. Otherwise, find open appointments throughout the day or in following days. If time is hard to come by, you may need to stop accepting new patients until you have the time to give them the proper care they deserve.","<strong>Set Time for Specific Work</strong>","One of the easiest ways to maintain a schedule is to set blocks of time throughout the day for specific types of appointments. For example, set aside a certain block of time in the morning and the afternoon just for regular checkups and cleanings. Then, set aside time for specialty work and even for same-day appointments for those who are in need of care quickly. Of course, you will need to be flexible to work with your patients, but by attempting to keep similar appointments together, it can save time reviewing notes, setting out supplies and more.","<strong>Patient Reminders</strong>","You can actually save time by reminding patients of upcoming appointments. Send emails, text messages, post cards and even make phone calls to ensure they know when their appointment is taking place. By reminding patients, you will save time from rescheduling and your staff won t be standing around waiting for the next person to walk in.","Scheduling appointments at a dental office doesn t have to be a frustrating ordeal. By planning ahead, considering the needs of others and reminding patients, you can minimize the amount of time your patients waste at your office."]},"id":"e1ec87ca-1202-4326-bf3a-9c28cc8fc07f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8216","url":"/5-tips-to-make-appointment-scheduling-easy","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"courtnie-packer","url":"/author/courtnie-packer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Courtnie Packer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"XeLDpnf8mohkN8LhxKwS3h","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-11T04:56:36Z","datePublished":"2013-12-11T04:56:36Z","name":"5 Tips To Make Appointment Scheduling Easy","synopsis":"Your patients’ time is crucial and should not be wasted sitting in a waiting room.","review":{},"strapline":"Your patients’ time is crucial and should not be wasted sitting in a waiting room.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-17T16:59:35Z","id":"kemBFvjaAegTf5swt4eavD","meta":{"title":"5 Tips To Make Appointment Scheduling Easy","description":"Are you struggling scheduling appointments in your dental practice?
