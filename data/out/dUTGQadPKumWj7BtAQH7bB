Our most recent testing took over 25 hours in Purch Labs. The applications were thoroughly researched and tested, with all of the features and functionality studied and compared. We considered each program’s interface design, task-oriented tools, budget templates, schedule planning, security, integration, configurations, customer tech support and ease of use, all while examining how effective each program would be for users of all requirements and experience levels.","Our team of reviewers and Purch Labs test assistants worked together throughout the evaluation process. This helps us consider software from the perspective of many types of users, ensuring our product recommendations appeal to a variety of personalities and technological experience levels.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We thoroughly evaluated each organizer’s features, tools, interface, templates, security, app integration, device compatibility, customizable settings and overall ease of use. We programmed in a variety of events, alarms, passwords, alerts and tons of other data to test not only each program’s capacity, but also to see how reliable, powerful and effective it is. Where applicable, we also tested accompanying mobile apps to see the extent of data integration, alerts and syncing capabilities. The most powerful organization software has an intuitive interface, a variety of tools and features and extensive customization options.","We investigated each software company’s technical support and informational resources, verifying it offers the services it advertises. We also read through the accompanying warranty where applicable and weighted that against each software program’s price and quantity of features, helping us find the highest-quality products for you.","We found that, when it comes to organizer software, price isn’t an indicator of what you’ll get. However, we determined that the most useful features for most users are space for note taking, integrated budget templates, to-do lists, data backup, event conflict warning, a password manager and extensive app and file format integration.","<strong>How Much Does Organization Software Cost?</strong>","The organization software we tested cost an average of $38 and comes with a multitude of tools including calendars, budgeting templates and to-do lists. There are free organizational apps for your smart phone, but they often have far fewer features.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying Organizer Software</strong>","Features &amp; Tools<br/>All of the organizers come with similar organizing tools such as address books, calendars, note sections and task lists; however, the programs differ in convenience features. For example, all of the software we evaluated offers either a calendar or date planner, but only some of these organizers allow you to assign your tasks a priority level and remind you about upcoming events. Likewise, not many of the programs alert you to events with conflicting times. Programs with all of these features rank high in our lineup, as each one greatly improves organization.","Each program has a to-do list tool. To test these lists, we tracked tasks and evaluated how the programs alerted us to each task. Programs with reminders, filters and categories make it easy to customize to-do lists to work best with your organization style. We also took note of the programs that allow you to adjust each to-do item’s priority level, as this feature helps you complete your tasks in an efficient manner.","All of the organizers we reviewed come with an address book to hold your contact information for a large number of people. While some of the programs include extra features, such as the ability to add a photo to your contact or access driving directions, each software’s address book functioned similarly.","Security<br/>Organizing software is set apart from personal information managers like Microsoft Outlook and Google by its security features. Since you likely store personal information in your organizer, a program’s security features are just as important as the tools it has. All of the programs we reviewed are protected by passwords to keep your data secure. Some of the software can also generate passwords and securely store them for email, social media and other websites.","Usability<br/>While each organizing program has a unique feature set, we evaluated the usability of the software and the effectiveness of its tools. Our ease of use score considers how easy it is to input events into the calendar, add tasks to the to-do-list, create notes or journal entries, add contacts to the address book and use the password manager. The score also factors in the presence of features that make the above tasks easy to complete. For example, the ability to create a recurring event improved the usability of the calendar and resulted in a higher ease of use score.","There is little difference in the usability of the organizers we reviewed; they’re all rather intuitive and easy to use. While the address book and notes tools were included in our score, the differences between these two tools are minimal from one application to the next.","Mobile Sync<br/>Over half of the programs we reviewed include a mobile app. Using this app, you can access your information on your smartphone from anywhere. Most of the software syncs with Android and iOS systems and some even with Windows phones. Downloading these apps and syncing them to their desktop is easy. Some of the applications don’t include apps and instead sync with Google or upload your information to the cloud.","When software uploads to the cloud, your organizer is always up to date on all of your devices, making it the best option. However, most cloud services require a subscription fee to store your information. If your software doesn’t upload to the cloud, you have to sync the software on your computer to your smartphone’s app, or vice versa, each time you input data.","Many of the programs automatically import data, contacts and events from Google when you give them access to your account. This feature is very useful if you are already using Google to keep track of your tasks. It also provides you with another way to access the information on the software from a handheld device. During testing, we were able to import information from Google with ease using the programs that have this feature.","Export Options<br/>If you use the software as a word processor or need to export your calendar, to-do list or address book, it’s important to find software that exports the file types you use. For example, if you use the software’s journal feature, you want to export the files either in text or PDF format. Most of the programs export text files, with the best organizing software exporting CSV, XML, HTML and PDF formats.","<strong>Should You Buy Organizer Software?</strong>","If you struggle to remember appointments, birthdays, due dates and other events, organization software can really be a godsend. Personal information management software organizes your life by creating daily to-do lists, helping you manage your budget and keeping you on track to reach life goals. Organizer software also serves as a planner, notebook, journal and address book.","The one major downside of these programs is that, in most cases, they can only be accessed and managed on your computer. A few have complementary mobile apps that let you access a good portion of the program’s functionality, but they’re really meant for use on your computer. Additionally, you’ll only be able to hear or see your alerts on your computer, so if you’re not near it, you may miss them. These setbacks are slightly less of a hassle if you install the program on a laptop and typically carry it around with you wherever you go. There are also multiple smartphone apps that do the same thing for free.","<strong>Similar Assistance Programs</strong>","Keeping your life organized is a big task, and we don’t blame you if you need some extra help staying organized. There are many programs and web apps that pair well with traditional organizer software – they act almost like extensions and aim to help you keep even more things organized. With software for homework and time tracking as well as general task management, organization help is readily available.","Sometimes the easiest way to get organized is to have a simple, clean place to write down all your thoughts and to-dos. Note-keeping programs like <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a> and <a href=\"https://keep.google.com/\">Google Keep</a>, as well as mobile phone apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;ls=1\">Things</a>, make this easy. Building on these programs, there are brainstorming and visualization apps like <a href=\"https://mindnode.com/\">Mindnode</a>, which helps you find and list out tasks and subtasks so nothing gets forgotten.","Many of the organizers we reviewed integrate with <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com\">Google Calendar</a>. It is also available as a mobile app, so you can view your events anywhere you go.","If you want to audit how efficiently and effectively you spend your time, use a time-tracking program like <a href=\"https://letsfreckle.com/\">Freckle</a> to log everything you do during a certain period of time. Knowing how you spend time – or waste it – is another great step to helping you stay organized.","And in the spirit of saving time, you can use task automation software like <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> or <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a> to automate certain digital tasks.
