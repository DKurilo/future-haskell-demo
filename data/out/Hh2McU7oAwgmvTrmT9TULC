However, just because it has a low price doesn’t mean this RC drone is low quality. It reaches speeds of 25 miles per hour and has a flight time of up to 15 minutes thanks to its 2700mAH LiPoly battery. The best drones reach speeds more than 30 miles per hour and have flight times around 20 minutes, so this one doesn&#39;t quite match the top drones on the market, but it is a much better value.","This drone has an impressive range of 3,280 feet and is easy to fly for beginners or professionals. Although it doesn’t have a built-in camera or come with a gimbal, it does have GPS and a built-in compass so you can plan your flights and map out where you want the drone to fly. It has LED lights that signify battery life and GPS status. Not only that, they help you keep an eye on where your drone is when it gets dark out.","This UAV has a lightweight, molded plastic body that measures 11.81 x 11.81 x 7.87 inches. It weighs under 2 pounds and is extremely portable and easy to toss in the trunk of a car or in a backpack. It has four 8-inch propellers and comes ready to fly. You just need to get four AA batteries for the transmitter.","If you are interested in using this personal drone for aerial photography or video, you&#39;ll need to purchase a camera and gimbal separately. This drone is made to use the Quanum Q-2D gimbal, which is specifically designed for the GoPro Hero 3 camera, but it is compatible with similar sized action cameras. Since this drone is more affordable than others, the camera and gimbal are a good investment. However, if you would rather fly the drone recreationally and don’t need to capture videos or photos, they aren&#39;t necessary.","This personal drone does have a warranty for a month, so if your GPS malfunctions or you have other issues, you can reach out to Hobbyking for support in a variety of ways. The company offers telephone, email and chat support all on the website. You can download a PDF of the instruction manual for this drone on the web, as well."]},"id":"218d9511-cd45-414e-80f9-9f2d110e32f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"32ed78b6-8e36-4e42-ada3-103278acc0d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With this drone, you get steep speeds for a not-so-steep price.
