The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Maytag Maxima X MHW4200BW front-load washer has a very simple-to-operate control panel, gives you plenty of wash cycles and options, and has a nice, large-capacity washtub. It may not be as fancy and flashy as some of the washers we have on our front-load washer lineup, but it gets the job done and is an option to consider.","Its 4.1-cubic-foot capacity allows you to fit more laundry into each load, which in turn means less loads of laundry for you and less energy used. This front-load washing machine does bare the Energy Star label and is estimated to cost $14 to operate per year and consume an estimated 127-kilowatt hours annually.","This Maytag Maxima X front-load washer gives you 11 wash cycles and eight wash options for every load of laundry you do. Additionally, you have the choice of three soil levels and five wash and rinse temperatures for each load of laundry.","Among the 11 wash cycles is a PowerWash cycle. This wash cycle uses extra cleaning action and a more thorough rinse to help remove stains that are deep in the fabrics. Additionally, you can use the steam option for even more help to remove those tough and stubborn stains.","This front-loading washing machine also has an allergen cycle, which we like. This wash cycle can help to remove up to 95 percent of common household allergies and pet dander. Additionally, you can select the sanitize option, which is NSF certified, meaning it will remove up to 99.9% of household bacteria that tends to gather on your laundry.","We were disappointed to see no prewash option, a whites cycle, a small load cycle, a colors cycle or a hand wash cycle included in the features of this front-loader washing machine.","This Maytag Maxima X front-load washer is 38-3/4 inches high without the optional pedestal drawer that is also available with this appliance. It is 27 inches wide and 32-15/16 inches deep. You can get this Maytag washer in either a standard white color or its Cosmetallic dark grey color.","Maytag excels in regards to the warranty coverage by offering quite the warranty for this front-loader washer. For the first year, the parts and any labor necessary will be covered. Additionally, the washer motor and washtub are backed by a 10-year warranty.","Maytag can be contacted by phone, email, or its live chat function on its website for any help or support you need regarding your appliance. Maytag also provides the user manual and FAQs on its website for your convenience and reference."]},"id":"4f7fced5-3c84-43ea-ad6a-279ce420aeb9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9530665e-159b-4795-a75a-afdd21a084bc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag Maxima X MHW4200BW front-load washing machine has a less-than-fancy look to it, but it does offer the consumer features that make it a good option.
