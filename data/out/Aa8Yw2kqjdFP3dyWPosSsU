You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","Many consumers may have instinctual thoughts like ours, that a Crayola-brand digital camera for kids must be a quality product. We quickly learned differently. The Crayola Kidz Digital Camera is built kid-tough with a preview screen, which allows them to look at the pictures they have taken. It also comes with fun and easy-to-use editing software, but that’s where the benefits stop. The beginner camera has not been built with the stability or the quality that a <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital camera for children</a> needs.","Like most digital cameras for children, the Crayola Kidz Digital Camera for kids includes a flash; however, if the camera is pointed too closely, it will wash out the subject and make it unrecognizable. We were happy that this digital camera for kids does provide a 1.3” LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows kids to review their pictures. Although the camera itself doesn’t offer games and photo editing, the packaging does include a unique and fun software program that comes with games and photo editing capabilities that even allows kids to create puppets from their images.","We were disappointed that the viewfinder and the lens were not placed in alignment with each other. When kids take a picture, it will be off center. However, the digital camera for kids has a simple design that makes it easy for kids to navigate. The design of the digital camera for children includes four buttons around the LCD screen. The buttons are used to delete photos, power the camera on and off and navigate through photos backwards and forwards. It is built to withstand a drop and has two handles on each side for small hands to grip easily.","Although the inexpensive camera for kids has a simple design that suggests it would be easy to use, we found otherwise. Taking a picture was fairly easy. Kids are able to take a picture on their own without help from an adult, which was nice. But we did find that it is very temperamental. All pictures are deleted if the battery dies – which tends to happen fairly often. The pictures can be saved to an SD card to outlast the battery, but even that form of saving is temperamental. Those pictures can be deleted without warning as well.","We were able to find a phone number and an email address for the Sakar customer support team, but to our dismay, they were very hard to work with. After emailing the company regarding the camera and never receiving a response, we opted to call their customer support team. Once we were connected with a representative we had zero questions answered and felt as though the representative had no desire to help us. They were unable to answer any of our questions and rushed to get through the phone call, putting no effort into finding the answers for us. We were very disappointed and hope that we never have to deal with the Sakar customer support team again."]},"id":"ced82cbc-72af-4468-969e-76e160aa3cfe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c3953183-a1b9-4773-b654-d67a4981d8ae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Crayola Kidz Digital Camera for children has not delivered the features, design or quality that we hoped to find. It is a cheaply built digital camera for kids. Even if it is their first digital camera, children deserve some quality. Sakar does not do well backing up their products, and it is not a company we would want anyone to go through when trying to correct a technical glitch or problem. We recommend the KidiZoom Plus, the Fisher Price Kid Tough Digital Camera and Disney’s Pix Jr. Digital Camera for children."]},"id":"bf80ac7f-c4fa-4622-9da6-16d8d0a09bb7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50606","url":"/crayola-kidz-digital-camera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-31T19:45:09Z","datePublished":"2010-08-31T19:45:09Z","name":"Crayola Kidz Digital Camera 23070","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":47,"verdict":"It is an inexpensive camera but its quality reflects the price.
