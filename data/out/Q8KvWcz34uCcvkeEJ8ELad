It is priced at the lower end of the scale for running headlamps, but it is completely functional for basic, short runs.","One of the best aspects of the Princeton Tec Fuel is its lightweight design, as it weighs just 78 grams. It is also exceptionally compact, so it doesn&#39;t feel bulky on your head. However, there is no top strap to keep it in place when you are running at top speed, so this option might not be suitable for intense runs or heavy exercise in inclement weather. While it is rated as being moderately water resistant, there is no rubber seal or gasket inside this running head torch, so it should not be submerged.","This running headlight uses three AAA batteries, which are easy to find when replacements are needed. The headlamp can be used for up to 146 hours before the batteries run down. You can use rechargeable AAA batteries in the headlamp, but there is no built-in mechanism for charging the batteries.","With just a single push button, operating this Princeton Tec Fuel Headlamp is simple. The large button is easy to find without having to look directly at the unit, so you don&#39;t need to take off the headlamp to turn it off or on. The light output of this running headlamp is 70 lumens, which makes it easy to see objects in the road ahead, and the four LED lights are lined up to maximize beam width. You can angle the lamp up or down to position the light where you need it, and the lamp itself stays pointed in the direction you choose and doesn&#39;t shift or droop over time. There is no red light function on this headlamp, and it t doesn&#39;t have a dimming function. You can&#39;t exert precise control over the light level, but you can cycle through high, medium and low light levels by pressing the button.","The Princeton Tec Fuel Headlamp is a basic running headlight that isn&#39;t as feature-rich as more advanced models. However, the lightweight design makes it a good choice for short, casual nighttime runs."]},"id":"2354cfe3-5c80-492d-b7d1-d0735e7a4447","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62536","url":"/princeton-tec-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:42:35Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:42:35Z","name":"Princeton Tec Fuel","synopsis":"The Princeton Tec Fuel headlamp is compact and smartly designed, making it a useful addition to your collection of night running gear.
