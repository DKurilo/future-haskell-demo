Rainbow 2L kids microscope is great for children and beginners. Kids will love the fact that you can order it in purple, blue, white, yellow or red. However, this <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">children&#39;s microscope</a> does not only have good looks. The 2L also performs well and has a decent though somewhat brittle design.","While the average overall optical score for microscopes we reviewed was 67 percent, this one earned a score of 90 percent. It had no problem magnifying slides clearly. We were able to see small details with ease. In addition to transparent slides, this kids microscope allows you to view solid objects. It has no problem with this either. We were able to use all three magnification levels of this microscope – 4x, 10x and 40x – and see both slides and solid objects in high quality.","This model has the traditional microscope design, so it&#39;s quite easy to use. The only minor issue we found was the position of its knob to control the light. While the knob is typically on the back for easy access, the knob on this beginner microscope is on the side. It required some fiddling around before we were familiar with the setup. However, after a few tests, we had no issues in adjusting the microscope.","A slight disadvantage we encountered is the quality of this microscope&#39;s body. The best student microscopes we tested had a solid and durable feel. This one has a cheaper feel to it. Although we didn&#39;t test this theory, we imagine that this unit would be more likely to break if accidentally dropped from a table, which can happen a lot around kids. We also considered that this lightweight design could be an advantage. The lightness is preferable for young children who might have issues handling a heavier instrument. The scope still produces high-quality magnifications, which compensates for the less sturdy design.","The scope comes with all the accessories you need to get started. This includes five prepared slides, five blank slides and a few other items. Your child can start discovering right upon opening the box. The Rainbow 2L can go cordless with four AA batteries, or you can plug it into a power outlet with the included AC cable. That means your child can develop their own bedroom laboratory or take it out into the field for explorations. However, this unit does not come with a carry case or handle. This slightly reduces the microscope&#39;s portability, although you could easily place it back into its plastic packaging for travel or storage.","Levenhuk has an impressive warranty and customer service. While most microscopes we tested only have a one-year warranty, this one is under warranty for its lifetime. You can purchase this instrument without worry, as you can always send it back in if it begins to malfunction.  We had no problems contacting the manufacturer, as someone quickly responded every time we called or emailed."]},"id":"6a217335-7837-4a20-bf3b-8657f50cae3d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"909eaf7f-888f-4de4-b02a-e49a59274472","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Levenhuk Rainbow 2L is a good kids microscope.
