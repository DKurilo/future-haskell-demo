The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">Video Editing Software</a> here.</em>","MoviePlus X6 is one of the most flexible programs on our side-by-side comparison chart of the best video editing software. It caters to the casual user by offering wizards to help you create movies quickly. More advanced users can take advantage of its nearly complete array of video editing tools and unlimited editing tracks.","If you don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time creating a movie, you can use the QuickMovie tool. This video editor wizard helps you compile all the elements you want into a themed movie. It helps you choose a theme, import your files and add a personal touch to your movie. The tools are intuitive, and the video editing user guide is a great resource for some additional help.","This video software is a good choice for learning the ins and outs of video editing. You can learn common editing tasks such as trimming and arranging clips on the timeline by using the wizards and templates. From there, you can move on to more advanced tools such as the chroma key, audio mixer and video stabilizer. Anyone, regardless of skill level, can learn how to use all the tools and features in this program.","When using the full-feature editor, you&#39;ll have access to a nearly complete selection of video editing tools. This program has a library of over 300 video effects and transitions that allow you to customize and personalize your video. This isn&#39;t as many as some of the other video editing applications in our review have, but it&#39;s enough to construct the video you want.","While MoviePus X6 has most of the features we look for in the best video editing software, itâ€™s missing some tools. For example, you cannot create closed captions for the hearing impaired or configure your audio for surround sound. Granted, these are advanced features, but they can be found in the video editing programs in the top tier of our side-by-side comparison chart.","When you&#39;re done building your video, MoviePlus offers a few options for sharing it with an audience. You can upload your video to Facebook or YouTube directly from the program. You can also optimize it for playback on smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. While these options are useful, other products on our lineup offered more choices for sharing your videos through additional file formats and popular social networking sites.","MoviePlus X6 has a comprehensive user guide with links from its table of contents to specific topics, and it is searchable. Serif has telephone and email contact information on its website. Additionally, the website has links to forums, a knowledgebase, and tutorials on such video editing subjects as basic timeline operation, color correction and the chroma key."]},"id":"01089b41-c187-444a-8e58-30c0f182980a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bd449b30-99a7-40af-a671-5255d64a36a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MoviePlus X6 is a virtual video editing training camp; the program is designed to teach you the basics and prep you to use more advanced tools.
