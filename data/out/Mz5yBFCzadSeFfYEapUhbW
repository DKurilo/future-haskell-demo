As I tested these programs, I put most of my focus on ease of use, evaluating each software’s GEDCOM accuracy, interface navigation, tools and features, and data entry process. However, I also considered the apps’ charting capabilities and data management, paying special attention to their scrapbooking tools because genealogy is about much more than tracking down your ancestor’s records – it&#39;s about collecting, recording and managing your family&#39;s story.","While this is the first time I&#39;ve reviewed family tree software, genealogy is a frequent topic of conversation in my family. My ancestors’ stories make up a core part of who I am and how I came to be. I&#39;ve traveled to Ireland, Wales and England specifically to visit ancestral sites. Genealogy software has an existential value for me, and I approached each program as someone recording his family’s story."]},"id":"bd823098-d709-413d-8848-a4bb1ce85bad","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Sharing research is a major part of successful genealogy work. To do this, you create a GEDCOM file, a universal format for recording genealogy records. It allows you to incorporate research from others, such as a great aunt or a cousin, into your own database. However, while GEDCOM files are universal, not all programs accurately interpret their data.","To test the apps’ accuracy, I used GEDCOM files of Irish kings and U.S. presidents. Then I created a GEDCOM file based on my own family tree and a fictional file based on characters from my favorite TV show. The purpose of the first two records was to test the breadth of the program, as each file had thousands of names and hundreds of families. The other two records were made to be as difficult as possible – they included same-sex marriages, polygamist relationships and complicated mixed families. Each of these GEDCOM files included media files, notes, memories, web links and more.","The amount of information in these GEDCOM files was staggering, making it all the more impressive when two programs emerged with perfect results. The biggest problem programs had was excluding huge swaths of information from a family line based on one problematic entry. Another issue was errors in the media files and missing notes. Often, the data was still available, but the connections had to be re-stitched.","I also evaluated how easy each program is to use by looking closely at its interface design and data entry process. The easiest programs are modeless – you don’t have to open a new window for every tool or feature you want to use. Instead, you enter data in an interface that uses floating tabs and adjustable modules in a single window. This process requires fewer mouse-clicks, so it saves time. Overall, modeless interfaces have shallower learning curves and help novices become experts quicker.","In addition, I evaluated the programs’ charting capabilities and scrapbooking tools. Genealogy is about much more than collecting dates and names – it’s also about telling your family story; displaying family connections on a visual chart; and tracking down pictures, videos, audio, family memories, life events, health records, facts and other notes. The best genealogy programs put their chart options and scrapbooking tools front and center so you don’t have to dig to find them.","<strong>How Much Does Genealogy Software Cost?</strong>","We tested genealogy software that cost an average of $46, making it more cost-effective than paying a monthly fee to use a genealogy website. If you opt for genealogy software the only ongoing costs are for software updates or upgrades, which costs roughly $20 depending on the service.","<strong>Why Buy Genealogy Software?</strong>","As I began researching genealogy software for this review, my family had a big party to celebrate six birthdays – siblings, nieces, nephews, grandmother. Everyone was there. At the party, I talked about reviewing genealogy software, knowing it&#39;s a topic my family is interested in. The reaction I got from everyone was &#34;So, you&#39;re reviewing services like <a href=\"/ancestry-com-review\">Ancestry</a> and <a href=\"/myheritage-review\">MyHertitage</a>? Are you going to get your DNA tested?&#34;","Indeed, Top Ten Reviews covers <a href=\"/best-genealogy-websites\">genealogy services</a> and <a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA testing kits</a>, but when I explained it was desktop genealogy software, the response was &#34;Why? Aren&#39;t the services better? FamilySearch.org is free!&#34;","And they make a good point – why buy genealogy software? The software doesn&#39;t come with a database of names and records. If you have to access a database to do research anyway, why not use a service to build your family tree?","Ownership<br/>I asked Simon Orde, director at Family Historian, the same question: Why is genealogy software still relevant? While he praises online genealogy services as a vital part of the genealogy industry that connects people with vast databases of names and records, he draws a stark line between the value of genealogy software and that of genealogy services. Desktop software, he explains, &#34;allows customers to store their own data on their own PC, under their own control.&#34;","It may seem like a small detail, but there are big implications. Namely, when you use a cloud-based database, the information isn&#39;t yours to control or maintain. When you put your family history together in a desktop genealogy program, you not only own the data, but you own the process. It makes you more invested in your family’s story.","Cross-database Hints<br/>Doing genealogy is like being a detective. This is part of the appeal for many people – building an ancestor&#39;s life story through small clues and fractured information. To do this, you can&#39;t limit yourself to one database. However, genealogy services lock you into a subscription with complicated user agreements and intellectual property issues, making it difficult to do cross-database research.","If you&#39;re like a detective, online services limit the scope of your detecting. Orde illustrates this by pointing out that services only provide hints within their own database – you don&#39;t get hints about records on other databases. For example, Ancesty.com doesn’t direct you to MyHeritage.com or other sites, even if the information may further your research. But with software, you get hints and matches for individuals on multiple databases.","User Changes<br/>The cloud-based nature of online genealogy services means other users can change information. While citing information is good practice, an online user doesn&#39;t necessarily need to cite the reason for changing data. For example, a few years ago, someone changed my grandfather&#39;s death date on a popular ancestry service&#39;s database. My father had to go through the process of fixing the altered date, showing he had firsthand experience and citing the death certificate before the date was corrected. As it turned out, the person who altered the date had mistaken my grandfather for someone with a similar name. Not an uncommon issue with databases.","A Living Record<br/>Another reason to buy genealogy software is to build a record of living relatives. Marcia Helzer, a retired school teacher and volunteer indexer for FamilySearch.org for the last eight years, emphasizes how genealogy is a living record. It should focus as much your living relatives as it does your ancestors. But this is difficult to do with online services because it may violate living individuals’ privacy. Online databases, she argues, are great for building backward but not for building forward. In an era where identity theft is a real concern, a privately managed database on your computer is the safer option.","<strong>Pairing Genealogy Software With DNA Test Kits</strong>","While genealogy software can do a lot to help you reveal your family’s history, it is still fallible since you may be missing information or have some incorrect details. For example, there are many stories about people taking DNA tests for fun only to find out that the person they thought was their father isn’t. Without this accurate paternity information, it is impossible to fill in correct genealogical data.","On the flip side, a DNA test kit is also worth it if you don’t know anything about one or more of your parents and want to learn about where you come from. Similarly, a consumer DNA test is also beneficial if you are multiracial – it can reveal a detailed breakdown of your heritage, including information about which continents and countries your DNA originates from. Also, depending on which test you purchase, you may find out what percentage of your biological makeup comes from each region. This can help you focus your genealogy research.","Consumer DNA tests are fun and educational. Though the process has inherent risks, the information the tests provide can help you fill out your genealogy correctly. They can also bring your family closer together and even inspire future travel plans.","<strong><br/>More Guides for Family Historians:</strong>"]},"id":"7437de20-5b59-45cc-8f4b-fbfcf944c63a","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">The Best (Inexpensive) 35MM Film Scanners</a>","<a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">The Best DNA Testing Kits</a>","<a href=\"/best-genealogy-websites\">The Best Genealogy Search Websites</a>","<a href=\"/best-people-search-services\">The Best People Search Engines</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-scanning-services\">The Best Photo and Movie-Film Scanning Services</a>","<a href=\"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters\">The Best VHS to Digital Converters</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"657afeac-bb0e-4be0-a0f4-0f473ae6fe68","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_65","url":"/best-genealogy-software","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-30T01:26:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-30T01:26:00Z","name":"Best Genealogy Software of 2019","synopsis":"We ranked a collection of family tree-making software from best to worst based on our testing and interviews with genealogy experts.","review":{},"strapline":"We ranked a collection of family tree-making software from best to worst based on our testing and interviews with genealogy experts.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-11T20:04:09Z","id":"Mz5yBFCzadSeFfYEapUhbW","meta":{"title":"Best Family Tree Software 2019 -
