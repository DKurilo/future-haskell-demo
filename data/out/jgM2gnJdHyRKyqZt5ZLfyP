Now that it is available, we looked at its available games and additional software. Although it has an impressive battery life and a supportive community, it still does not compare to the other mobile consoles we reviewed.","As one of the lightest handheld consoles available, the GCW-Zero is extremely portable. It is much smaller than most of the other mobile consoles available with a 3.5-inch LCD screen. At 320 x 240 pixels, its screen resolution is among the most disappointing on our lineup. Fortunately, it offers a battery life of around seven hours. It also has some hardware that isn&#39;t fully utilized at this point, like the built-in microphone. As more software becomes available, developers might take advantage of the hardware and make it something special.","At this point, the GCW-Zero is best as a retro game emulator. If you miss playing Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis games, there are several emulators available. You&#39;ll have to find ROMs online and either download them to the device or to a MicroSDHC or MicroSDXC card. The console comes with an impressive 16GB of internal storage, and as long as the software supports it, you can play multiplayer games online with the built-in Wi-Fi.","This handheld console looks better on paper than in your hands. The console lacks any additional multimedia apps, although these could appear as more developers get involved. Also, the buttons tend to stick. There is an analog stick, but our fingers slipped off regularly. Lastly, the speakers are located at the bottom of the machine, and we noticed that we regularly covered the speakers with our fingers on accident.","If you need help, you can go to the GCW-Zero website to email the manufacturer or read FAQs. However, the best support available comes from the user forum, where developers discuss ways to get the most out of the console. You can get some great information from other active users."]},"id":"15728ae6-c61d-43ea-9560-315ef85485ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b7a29c4e-e027-4d53-8851-2b1215ab8ff4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GCW-Zero is the only open-source handheld game console we reviewed, and while its potential is impressive, there isn&#39;t much going for it at this point.
