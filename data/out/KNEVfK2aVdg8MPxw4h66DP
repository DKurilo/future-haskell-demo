This is because many of these threats are designed to block antivirus software, and others are disguised to look like real programs so they’re difficult to spot. In addition, while antivirus software can remove some existing malware, it can’t repair the damage the threat may have caused.","If your computer is infected with malware, we recommend seeking out a professional to help remove the viruses. Most local computer stores have professionals on hand who can remove malware for you or can recommend someone close by.","Once your computer is clean, you should install a good antivirus program like <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus</a>.This will keep the system clean by blocking malware from downloading and infecting your computer, to begin with. Both <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton</a> and <a href=\"/mcafee-review\">McAfee</a> have computer protection programs that comes with a virus-free guarantee – if your computer becomes infected with malware while either program is installed, one of the developer’s experts will clean it.","What is the best antivirus for computers?<br/>The biggest factor we considered while testing antivirus programs is how well it stops your computer from becoming infected. And using over 300 live malware samples, we found that most antivirus programs do a really good job of stopping all kinds of threats. <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2019</a> is the best antivirus for computers because it stops and removes threats before they download – and it’s a good value.","Basic antivirus software tends to be pretty sparse on features. Beyond malware protection, most programs also include phishing scheme detection and safe browsing tools. But more advanced security features, like firewalls, password managers and safe banking tools, are left for the pricier internet security suites. Bitdefender includes many of these with its basic antivirus program so you get optimum security at a decent price.","How much does good antivirus software cost?<br/>Basic antivirus software generally costs between $30 and $50 each year to protect a single computer. These programs don’t have a lot of extra security features but will offer discounts if you need to purchase multiple user licenses.","More inclusive security suites are available for around $80. These typically come with three or more user licenses and include additional protection features like password managers, safe banking features, VPNs and mobile security","What is the cheapest antivirus software?<br/>This depends on the current sales promotion. However, both <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2019</a> and <a href=\"/kaspersky-review\">Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2019</a> retail their lowest package for $59.99, which comes out to just under $20 for each of the three user licenses included with these packages. If you only need a single license, <a href=\"/webroot-review\">Webroot</a> is the cheapest at $29.99 compared to most other programs that start at $50 to protect one computer. There are some companies, such as <a href=\"/avg-review\">AVG</a> and <a href=\"/avira-review\">Avira</a>, that offer free antivirus programs with fewer features.","What is the best free antivirus?<br/><a href=\"/avira-review\">Avira</a> is the best free antivirus program we tested because it comes with so many tools that other programs, even paid antivirus programs, don’t typically come with. These include parental controls, vulnerability detection, automatic gaming mode and a VPN. And don’t discount <a href=\"/avast-review\">Avast</a> and <a href=\"/avg-review\">AVG</a>, which also come with password managers and vulnerability scanners. Other companies that offer a free antivirus solution include Norton, Bitdefender and Panda, but they are pretty bare-boned compared to Avira, Avast and AVG.","The biggest drawback of free antivirus programs, besides the lack of security tools, is the number of pop-up ads asking you to upgrade to the paid version. The protection is the same for free antivirus as it is for the pricier internet security programs offered by the same company, but the paid programs do come with more tools, like a personal firewall, vulnerability detection and password managers.","Is Bitdefender safe?<br/>In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/is-kaspersky-safe,news-25983.html\">U.S. government accused Kaspersky</a> of partnering with the Russian government to gather information and spy on departments and officials. The U.S. government banned the use of Kaspersky’s security programs for both agencies and workers’ personal computers that would be used for work. Accusers believe that Kaspersky used its data sharing tools to gather sensitive information virtually undetected. Kaspersky has adamantly denied these accusations and recently has begun moving several of its primary operations out of Russia as a way to prove its innocence and build good faith with its users. Because of the uneasiness surrounding this company, consumers have become wary of using other antivirus programs and their data sharing tools."]},"id":"dcdee874-59e8-46a5-9674-2412c4ddc28c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/EekJMSUBwhuqjYDrDm2RPS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"<a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2019</a> also has a data sharing program that allows the software to send information about viruses, Trojans, rootkits and other malware found on your computer back to its databases.

We can confidently recommend both McAfee and Norton as good antivirus solutions.","There are some differences between them, however. McAfee scores higher in overall protection with a perfect 100 percent, and Norton comes close with 98 percent. Both programs come with extra security tools like spam filters, secure delete, secure browsing and vulnerability scanners. McAfee does include a few additional tools, most importantly a personal firewall and parental controls. Norton includes these with its premium security program.","The other big difference is how easy each program is to install and the amount of resources each takes from your computer to run. Overall, we felt that Norton was a little easier to figure out than McAfee. And while both don’t create too much drag on your system, McAfee does take a lot longer to complete its virus scans than Norton.","Do I Need to Uninstall an Old Antivirus Program Before Installing a New One?<br/>Most antivirus software competes with other protection programs, so you need to uninstall your old program before installing a new one. Also, antivirus programs take up substantial memory, and having two installed will cause your computer to run much slower. During the installation process, most programs perform a scan to see if any other antivirus software or components are already installed, and they will either uninstall the old program for you or prompt you to uninstall it manually.","However, there are a couple programs that work in tandem with other antivirus software. Both AVG and Avast work alongside other protection software to add a second layer of security, catching threats your main program may miss. In both programs, you can turn off the virus detection and scan features – your main program can provide those specific service, and you can still take advantage of AVG’s and Avast’s more advanced tools like safe banking and password managers. If you install <a href=\"/avast-review\">Avast</a> or <a href=\"/avg-review\">AVG</a> as a secondary antivirus program, make sure to install it after your main antivirus. Otherwise, your primary program will require you to uninstall it before completing the installation process.","What Is the Best Antivirus for Business?<br/>We found that <a href=\"/kaspersky-one-universal-security-review\">Kaspersky</a> is the best antivirus solution for small businesses, with excellent malware protection and a program that is easy to install and use, even if you’re not tech savvy. And if you don’t have dedicated IT personnel, Kaspersky has cloud-based programs so it can help you keep the program updated. Kaspersky’s Small Business program, which covers up to 25 endpoints, is compatible with both Windows PCs and Mac computers, as well as Android phones and tablets, so all your business devices can be protected. It includes password managers, data backup, both antispam and antiphishing tools, and web controls to keep tabs on what your employees are doing online. However, keep in mind that there has been some suspicion about Kaspersky using its security programs to gather sensitive information and spy on government employees, even in their own homes.","Another good business protection program is <a href=\"/avast-review\">Avast</a> Business Antivirus Pro Plus. It isn’t much different from the personal computer antivirus program, except it can easily protect more than 350 computers at a time. This program uses a personal firewall and VPN to keep your employees’ identity secure while connected to public Wi-Fi. It also includes a vulnerability scanner to help keep all software on your computers updated and plug up any hole where hackers and ransomware could sneak in. Avast also monitors your webcams to ensure no one is accessing them without permission.","What is a personal firewall?<br/>Firewalls inspect the packets of information coming through your internet connection and block those that are harmful. Hardware firewalls are included as part of your internet router. If information comes from a computer or a country known to be dangerous, these firewalls won’t let it through to your computer. But even if a packet of information comes from a trusted source, there still can be a threat inside that the hardware firewall is unable to detect.","Software firewalls, also known as personal firewalls, inspect what’s inside the packets to make sure there’s no malware. Some of the most common threats caught by firewalls are ransomware (viruses that hold files hostage until you pay the developers a fee), and Trojans (files that look legitimate on the outside but inside have another threat like a rootkit inside). Both of these threats are used by hackers as a way to get personal information and use it for financial gain, or sometimes just to wreak havoc. Running firewall software is especially important when you’re connected to a public hotspot because these often don’t use hardware firewalls, leaving your computer vulnerable to anyone looking to snatch information.","Firewall software also looks for devices connected to your internet that doesn’t belong to you or your family – a tactic commonly known as piggy-backing. Personal firewalls boot neighbors off your internet and block them from stealing your service in the future.","While you can purchase standalone personal firewall software, we’ve found using an antivirus program with an included firewall much easier, cost-effective and efficient. We’ve tested a number of antivirus packages that include a personal firewall; some of the best are <a href=\"/vipre-antivirus-antispyware-review\">VIPRE Advanced Security</a>, <a href=\"/avira-review\">Avira Free Security Suite</a>, and <a href=\"/mcafee-review\">McAfee Total Protection</a>. You can learn more by checking out our reviews of the personal firewall software we tested.","<strong>It’s Gift Card Scam Season, and Your Boss May Be Part of It</strong>","As the April 15 tax filing deadline gets closer, you may start getting panic-inducing phone calls from people claiming to work for the IRS and demanding payment in iTunes gift cards. However, this is a trick, and it isn’t limited to phone calls – scammers also use email messages that look convincing to demand payment of taxes, utility bills and other debts with gift cards. The scammer has just enough information and sounds professional and pushy enough to scare many people into giving into their demands.","Another phishing scam is targeting businesses, with scammers posing as your boss. An urgent email message asks you to purchase several gift cards in specific amounts to give out to clients or employees. The “boss” also mentions you shouldn’t respond back to them via telephone because they are in important meetings all day – instead, you should email them the gift card numbers for their records.","In both these cases, although the messages may look real and sound convincing, there are signs that they are fake. Here are a few things to know and look for if you get an email request to purchase a gift card:","1. Check the address<br/>While it certainly isn’t the first thing we look at when we open a message, it’s important to see exactly where the email was sent from. Some email accounts, like Gmail, show the sender’s name instead of their email address, but you can click on the name to open a window with this info. If it didn’t come from a work address, message your boss through his or her work email and double check the request is legitimate.","2. How many? How much?<br/>Most retailers now limit the number of gift cards one person can purchase per transaction and per day – usually five. This is in direct response to gift card scams. Many scammers know about this daily limit, so they instruct you to go to multiple stores to fill the quota.","Also, while it is possible your boss may legitimately want you to purchase more gift cards than the daily limit, typically they aren’t in exorbitant amounts. A $100 gift card might make sense for your business, but if you’re asked to get the maximum amount added to the card, typically $500, it may be wise to question if the request is legitimate. If you feel the number of or amount on the gift cards feels a bit much, ask you boss. However, make sure you send your question via your boss’s work email – don’t just reply to the original request.","3. Know what you can and can’t use gift cards for<br/>You cannot use a gift card to pay your taxes, utilities bills or other debts. Period. Gift cards are not considered legal tender, and the person or organization you are being asked to pay cannot convert gift cards into the cash needed to credit your account. Bottom line, if you’re asked to pay a bill with a gift card, it’s a scam.","4. Call or email using a legitimate contact<br/>If you want reassurance about what you are being asked to purchase and the amount you should pay, or if you’re wondering if the request is real, call, email or text the source using a legitimate address or phone number. If the request came from your boss, create a new message and email them at the address you are familiar with. If you’re being asked to pay taxes, you can find legitimate phone numbers and contact information on the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/\">IRS’s website</a>. This is also true of any other company or debt collector.","<br/>You can cut down on the number of phishing schemes you receive by using spam filters. You can purchase a stand-alone spam filter program, but we recommend buying software that also includes antivirus protection. We found that <a href=\"/escan-review\">eScan</a> has some of the most impressive spam filters, and they are included with its antimalware software.","<strong>Protect Yourself From the Astaroth Trojan</strong>","Computer security experts at <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/information-stealing-malware-targeting-brazil\">Cybereason</a> have issued a warning to be on the lookout for a new variation of the Astaroth Trojan. Though it’s found mostly in Brazil, the Astaroth threat has also been discovered in Europe and is possibly making its way to networks in the United States. It attaches itself to your antivirus program and accesses personal information and online credentials, such as usernames and passwords, then sends them back to the malware creators to be used for identity theft.","According to Active Hunting, Cybereason’s malware research team, the Astaroth Trojan primarily uses Avast antivirus programs to carry out its attack. It is believed this is because Avast is the most used internet security program in the world.","By nature, Trojan files are disguised to look like legitimate files, so they are difficult to recognize as threats. In the case of the Astaroth Trojan, the files are disguised as JPEGs or GIFs and sent primarily through email as spam or phishing messages.","One of the best ways to protect yourself is to not click on links or attachments in emails. Phishing messages look like they are from legitimate sources – for example, your power or cable company. Even the email address will look right at a glance, but most often there is something off, like a missing letter or an extra punctuation mark. Clicking on a link inside a phishing message or downloading the attached file releases the Trojan.","To be safe, type the company’s URL as it appears on your statement into your web browser. From there, you can access discounts, billing information and contact information that’s safe.","In addition, you shouldn’t save financial information or passwords online. While storing passwords is convenient, it also increases the risk your information will fall into the wrong hands, whether through a Trojan like the Astaroth or a security breach.","If you have an antivirus program installed on your computer, make sure its malware definitions are up to date. Most antivirus software asks you often to download the latest definitions so you don’t have to remember. This is important because malware databases update daily to include the most recently discovered threats and variations of old threats. These definitions are what help your antivirus program recognize and stop known malware."]},"id":"c9167ee6-debe-42dc-b380-2128ef1dbf53","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/antivirus-with-lowest-system-impact\">Antivirus Software with the Lowest System Impact</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"fe950016-d973-414c-b96f-8d3432103982","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0b7a184e-89ce-4d79-985a-5a3b85c159c0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2019</a>","<a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton AntiVirus Basic</a>","<a href=\"/vipre-antivirus-antispyware-review\">VIPRE Advanced Security</a>","<a href=\"/avira-review\">Avira Free Security Suite</a>","<a href=\"/kaspersky-review\">Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2018</a>","<a href=\"/trend-micro-review\">Trend Micro</a>","<a href=\"/mcafee-review\">McAfee Total Protection</a>","<a href=\"/avast-review\">Avast Free Antivirus</a>","<a href=\"/webroot-review\">Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus</a>","<a href=\"/webroot-review\">ESET</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a76d6764-8e86-4a5e-bd36-b6f7c9bce9d9","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_266","url":"/best-antivirus-software","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-03T14:55:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-03T14:55:00Z","name":"Best Antivirus Software of 2019","synopsis":"It pays to safe online.
