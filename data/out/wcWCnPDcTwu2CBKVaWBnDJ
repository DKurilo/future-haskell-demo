The average human ear can hear frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz, so this center speaker can reproduce almost everything we are capable of hearing. It can also create the supersonic sounds added into film and music to enhance the audio. Tones lower than 80Hz are usually handled by the subwoofer, so lower frequencies are not as important in a center speaker.","Even though a sensitivity of 89dB is good, it is less than most of the other center channel speakers in our review. Sensitivity measures how much power is required to produce a given volume. Higher levels of sensitivity mean less wattage is needed. You may hear some hissing or static if you crank up the sound, but the NS-C444 should play fine at regular volume levels."]},"id":"4fa63dd8-278a-4755-84bf-e4e1c5ba2f06","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"871bab83-f6b0-43a3-abf2-c7aa1f7c27ef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Two 5-inch Polymer-Injected Mica Diaphragm (PMD) cone woofers reproduce the midrange and low tones.
