It has some modern touches that make it feel like a true upgrade but it is not quite in the realm of things like smartphone control and steam cycles that you see on the pricier units.","The controls are the first sign of the middle ground the FFRE4120SW occupies. They are not quite like the clunky dials on the budget machines but they are not the fully-flat button displays either. There is a modern dial that has LED indicator lights to let you know what cycle you have chosen. The panel also houses a digital countdown to the finish time. That is much easier to understand than the dial-style ones that almost imperceptibly move toward the end-of-cycle line.","In terms of cycle selection this machine is quite competitive. It has almost as many as the top <a href=\"/best-dryers\">dryers</a> we compared. There are some pretty specific, rare cycle types like Active Wear, Bulky and Towels, as well as more basic cycles. You can also be pretty specific about the options you add to those cycles. You can choose from five levels of dryness and five temperature levels. Most machines don&#39;t offer that many choices.","The Frigidaire FFRE4120SW even allows you to save multiple favorites. That&#39;s rare even among the pricier machines. It means you don&#39;t have to re-enter the times and temps for your most used cycles every time. Just push Favorite 1 or Favorite 2.","This machine is average in terms of price, which goes perfectly with its middle-of-the-pack feature set. You can find it for just under $700. It does not have an Energy Star designation from the EPA so it may prove a bit more expensive than some in ongoing operating costs.","You just get the standard one year of coverage on this machine, which is a little disappointing. Most of the machines we compared have the same coverage but a few offer longer warranties.","The Frigidaire FFRE4120SW is about average in terms of price and its feature set. It is not specifically designed to be efficient and it is not the most cutting edge in its overall design but the modernized dial and broad choice in cycle types are impressive. It will be a great set with its matching washer, <a href=\"/frigidaire-review\">Frigidaire FFTW4120SW</a>, or washers of similar size. "]},"id":"cd49d0ae-5503-4f96-9717-c5c9ce39b6c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70270","url":"/frigidaire-ffre4120sw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-03T13:28:16Z","datePublished":"2018-10-03T13:28:16Z","name":"Frigidaire FFRE4120SW","synopsis":"The Frigidaire FFRE4120SW is a nice middle point between the most innovative machines and the most budget-friendly.
