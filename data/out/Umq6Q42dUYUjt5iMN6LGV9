At 240 x 180 pixels, only the FLIR E60 and Fluke Ti400 beat it, with 320 x 240 pixels. You can see a difference between the two resolutions, but it&#39;s not as big as your price savings might suggest, and it&#39;s still well over the RESNET standard of 120 x 120 pixels.","This device features a secondary standard digital camera you can use to capture reference photographs of a scene or to overlay with an infrared image for improved detail. The digital camera provides a decent 3.1-megapixel image, which should be more than enough for the purposes of thermography.","There is no autofocus, meaning you&#39;ll have to focus manually every time before shooting. We prefer cameras that let you switch between manual and autofocus to suit the occasion. This is a flaw for the E50, though not a fatal one.","Speaking of convenience, there are two major types of radiometric image formats. The more convenient of the two is an altered version of a JPG, called a radiometric JPG. The E50 uses this format to store its infrared information. Because you can open the files using nearly any photo viewer, this format is useful for sharing information with people who don&#39;t have thermal imaging software."]},"id":"383f296b-e5bc-418e-b289-057e43103b72","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Thermal Precision"},"id":"0322a607-bcb6-4e58-9e54-335f891e0f0e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/ymYCz8Ey89yQgyQrPszy79.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67066-flir-e501.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymYCz8Ey89yQgyQrPszy79.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ymYCz8Ey89yQgyQrPszy79","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymYCz8Ey89yQgyQrPszy79.jpg","alt":""},"id":"a39a5ac0-1932-4c95-a100-dcdf925357d1","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Having a good sensitivity rating is crucial for capturing accurate thermal data.

The range extends to 0.15 degrees in lower-end cameras.","In addition to its best-in-class sensitivity, the E50 also offers the second best temperature range available.

The main ones you&#39;ll want to look for are Wi-Fi connectivity, voice and text annotation, an illuminator lamp, a laser pointer and radiometric video recording. The E50 doesn&#39;t shed any features to cut costs; it has all the features the very best FLIR cameras can offer.","Wi-Fi connectivity means that you can capture an infrared image, transfer it to your phone or tablet and share it quickly without ever having to head back to the office. While this might not be a necessity for some, sharing information with coworkers and clients quickly speeds up your work and lets you get the go-ahead quickly for tasks that require immediate action.","The E50&#39;s voice and text annotation tools are also very useful when working in the field. If you&#39;re spending a lot of time inspecting, keeping track of your images can become difficult. Taking written or spoken notes helps you keep things organized and makes images easier to recall later.","When you&#39;re shooting in some dark corner of a work site or in an attic or basement, sometimes there isn&#39;t enough light to work efficiently. For this reason, the E50 is equipped with an onboard flashlight, which keeps your hands free for other tasks. In addition to the flashlight, there&#39;s also a built-in laser, which helps with targeting a subject.","Lastly, there are its video capturing capabilities. There are two ways that infrared cameras capture video. One is by saving directly to an SD card, and the other is by streaming to a PC. The E50 is capable of both, but only when streaming does it save the actual radiometric data. If you save to an SD card, you&#39;ll have a visual representation of the data but no actual infrared measurements to back it up."]},"id":"e711c0a5-97ca-45c0-ab05-b4c471361e38","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Battery Life &amp; Design"},"id":"34680668-510c-493a-8904-ee79de5cc714","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The FLIR E50 runs for up to four hours on a single charge, just like the vast majority of thermographic cameras.
