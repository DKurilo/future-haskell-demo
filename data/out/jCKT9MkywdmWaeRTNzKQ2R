40-Volt Max String Trimmer has plenty of power to trim a yard on a single charge. This is a cordless trimmer that packs a similar punch to that of a gas trimmer. It’s not the most versatile or adjustable trimmer in our comparison, but its durable design and generous warranty make it one of the best <a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">electric trimmers</a> out there.","<strong>Trimmer Design</strong>","This electric string trimmer has a dual-string head and a 13-inch cutting path. This is not the widest swath we’ve seen but is still a decent cutting path. The widest cutting path we saw was the <a href=\"/greenworks-21142-review\">GreenWorks 21142</a>, at 18 inches.","The handle is designed to allow for edging with a grip that you can grasp from either side. You have to hold the edger upside down and use the guide bar to cut straight lines while you’re edging. This is more awkward than a trimmer with a rotating head and wheels.","In contrast to most gas trimmers, which tend to be top-heavy, this weed cutter is somewhat bottom-heavy. The head that does all the cutting is heavier than the battery pack up top. This is a small complaint, but after using it for a while, you may feel the effects of this slight imbalance.","<strong>Power &amp; Battery</strong>","A big advantage to this trimmer is that the battery is interchangeable, and if you own other Kobalt 40-Volt products, you can change out the battery if you run out of power in the middle of a job. The 40-volt battery has plenty of power to handle all types of grass and weeds.","It has a variable speed trigger that lets you increase the speed over tough areas of the yard and then ease up at other times to conserve on battery life and extend the run time.","<strong>String Features</strong>","This trimmer has a dual-head design that cuts fast and effectively. You shouldn’t have to spend a lot of extra time going over the same areas of grass. If you have an especially big yard, you may want to consider a trimmer with a wider swath, but the 13-inch string diameter is more than adequate for most yards. The string operates on an automatic feed system so you won’t have to take off the cap to adjust the string unless you have a malfunction or need to change the spool.","<strong>Warranty &amp; Support</strong>","This trimmer comes with an unusually generous five-year warranty. This is the best warranty of any product we reviewed, although the battery is covered for just three years.","Unfortunately, there is no option to download a PDF manual online, but you can contact customer service via phone or email if you have questions while assembling or using this product."]},"id":"87210411-f501-4ab4-a2f6-517af10a30ab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"eb2bef83-227b-425e-a987-d2255cd5ec47","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kobalt 40-Volt Max is a solidly designed trimmer with the capability to function as a trimmer or an edger.
