The full setup process requires far more steps than any other Wi-Fi speaker we reviewed. Using the Sonos mobile app (which is required for the speaker setup) the PLAY:3 accesses your smartphone&#39;s microphone while the speaker plays a pulsating low frequency. This process helps evaluate the room environment and tunes the speaker accordingly. It seems a bit like audio science voodoo, but there is no denying how well it worked. We were blown away by the clarity and power of the speaker.","We listened to Lettuce, Metallica, Pretty Lights and other bands through the speakers, and they all sounded great on the PLAY:3. Many of our reviewers described the tonal quality as crisp, clear and distinct. The speaker balanced the tones evenly even when we increased the volume to full blast. It never blurred or distorted, nor did certain frequencies start to overpower at high volumes. The bass doesn&#39;t thump harder than our three best wireless speakers, but it&#39;s focused, loud and punchy. The sound dispersion is incredible, especially considering the size of the speaker. We were able to stand anywhere in the room and the sound never diminished. The clarity of the speaker cannot be overstated. Overall, it&#39;s simply one of the best-sounding speakers we reviewed."]},"id":"5ec4bad2-e5ab-4d27-b168-10f244bc861f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"87973803-3fe2-4f1c-9bb1-fe20d7580a81","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The PLAY:3 is a Wi-Fi speaker only.
