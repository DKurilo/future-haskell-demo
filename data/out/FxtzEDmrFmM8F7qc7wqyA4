You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Although the Wolverine F2D14 does not convert photos, it can convert 35mm film and slides to a 14-megapixel JPEG image in less than three seconds. The 14-megapixel resolution is one of the highest of all the <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">slide converters</a> we reviewed. We recommend this compact digital converter because it is an affordable and effective conversion device.","Compared to the competition, the Wolverine does a great job of rendering clear, vibrant images. The Wolverine captures high quality shots. At 14 megapixels, this device has one of the highest resolutions on the market. In our testing, the rendering of the slides was accurate and the device was able to capture the slides in a quality digital image. The image brightness adjustment makes viewing photos fun and easy.","When testing the unit we converted film of underwater photographs. Although the shots were originally dark, we were able to brighten them up and see more vivid colors in the coral reef.  The Wolverine F2D14 has a stand-alone design that works independently of a computer and software. With a modest 20MB of integrated memory, this slide converter still has more than other units do, and you will be able to store a few images without using an additional memory card. With an expandable memory capacity of 32GB, you can store thousands of photos on an SD or SDHC memory card.","You can view the images you capture on the LCD screen, but it is pretty small – measuring only 2.4 inches. By connecting a cable to the TV out jack located on the back of the converter, you can view your images on your TV. If you would rather use a computer to view and store your images, you can transfer images to a PC or MAC. Uploading your photos is easy because you don&#39;t have to install a driver or software – just plug in the device via the USB port and you are ready to go.","Easy menu navigation is a bonus with this unit. Once the device is on, the icons appear in the LCD display window. Using the handy arrow keys, you can select different options. Simply press the convert and OK buttons to save your image. The instruction manual comes with a quick start guide that walks you step by step through the simple process.","Included in the box you will get the F2D14 converter, one slide tray, one negative tray, a USB/Power cable, a 110v-220V AC adapter, a cleaning stick and an instruction manual. All Wolverine digital converters come with a one-year warranty. An instruction manual is included with each purchase. We are pleased with the support and contact information on the web site. Customer service is available through email and by telephone, and we were impressed with the quick response we received to emails and phone calls."]},"id":"b90383f2-10b8-4028-b3fc-963573d4f516","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"476dc936-af07-486e-8609-0e41d2ba740c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Wolverine F2D14 has impressive features that convert slides to digital images.
