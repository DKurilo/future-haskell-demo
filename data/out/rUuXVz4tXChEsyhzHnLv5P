The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/payday-loan-service-review\">Payday Loans</a> here</em><em>.</em>","When you apply for a payday loan with LendYou, your information is sent to multiple third-party lenders. You receive a loan offer for up to $1,000, depending on your state of residence and the lender that the LendYou system selects for you.","You expect to pay an APR that ranges from 200 percent to 1,386 percent. This means that for every $100 you borrow, you would pay $8 to $54 for every 14 days you are in debt. The APR you end up paying depends on your lender and your state. The term of your loan also depends on those same factors, though the typical term for an online cash advance is 14 days.","When it&#39;s time for you to repay your loan, the full amount of the loan is automatically deducted from your checking account. Be aware that your bank may charge an overdraft fee if you don&#39;t have enough money in your account to cover the amount that&#39;s withdrawn by your lender. If you choose to pay your loan back early, there is no penalty for early payoff.","Information about APRs, fees and repayment is readily available on LendYou&#39;s site, so you can have an idea of what you&#39;re signing up for and getting into before you take out a loan with one of LendYou&#39;s lenders. Be sure you still read your lending contract before you take out the loan so that you are sure you understand your responsibilities when it comes to taking out a cash advance.","LendYou&#39;s application is all online, has few steps and is easy to fill out. Be aware that you must provide a checking account number, a bank routing number and a Social Security number when you apply for a loan. While many services can give you a decision within minutes, you have to wait until the next business day to find out if you&#39;ve been approved or denied for a payday loan with LendYou. After your loan is approved and you sign your lending contract, you can have your money the same day or the next business day, depending on your lender.","To be eligible for a payday loan through LendYou, you must have a verified income of at least $1,000 a month. Bad credit does not disqualify you from getting a payday loan here and bankruptcies are acceptable to many lenders that work with LendYou.","We reached out to LendYou via phone and email to evaluate its customer support. LendYou was unresponsive to email, and while we left messages, we were unable to contact anyone via phone. For these reasons, LendYou earned a zero percent for customer support. In our testing, we received  no customer assistance despite multiple attempts to contact a representative. However, a FAQs page is available for answers to common questions."]},"id":"133bdf21-0eac-4884-9849-bd2cb032577d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ae6d4f22-c6d8-4561-b9e6-dd014033d2ce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["LendYou connects you with third-party lenders for an online payday loan.
