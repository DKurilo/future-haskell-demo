This unit is certified by ENERGY STAR and has an annual operating cost of $32. While the unit costs more to run than other units in the lineup, it employs longer wash cycles to help conserve water and ensure that your dishes are clean. The normal cycle on this unit runs for 150 minutes and recycles and reuses the water until your dishes are clean.","This KitchenAid dishwasher has six wash cycles and several wash options you can add to each cycle. The unit includes an express, light, normal, ProWash, rinse only and tough cycle. The ProWash cycle serves as an eco-friendly option. It uses a soil sensor to determine how much water and time the dishes need to become clean.","The wash options on this unit include 4-hour delay, high-temperature wash, ProDry, ProScrub and a sanitizing rinse. The Pro options all focus on energy efficiency, using the least amount of energy. This model also has wash zones where you can place your heavily soiled dishes. The ProScrub option employs 40 targeted spray jets on that zone, removing baked-on foods from heavily soiled dishes.","Between the convenience features, adjustable racks and fold-down tines, this dishwasher makes it easy to load and run it. This unit has two racks and 14 place settings. You can adjust the tines to fit odd-shaped dishes. While it lacks a hard-food disposer, it features hidden touch-sensitive controls, a status light and a child lock.","This built-in dishwasher is made out of stainless steel. The steel serves as an insulator, keeping the unit quiet when running and serving as a heat source. When running, the dishwasher measures at 42 decibels, which is quiet in comparison to the other units on our best dishwasher comparison chart.","The stainless steel dishwasher has three spray arms to help clean your dishes thoroughly and a filter that requires you to clean it manually. With hidden controls, the exterior has a bar handle you can use to open and close the unit.","KitchenAid offers an excellent warranty for its dishwasher. It covers labor and parts for one year after the purchase date, racks and electronics for five years, and the stainless steel tub and door liner for the lifetime of the unit. If you need to contact KitchenAid, the website lists phone, email and live chat as contact information. The website also has product manuals and a knowledgebase available."]},"id":"05c53612-fe01-47cf-bd44-1165bb05f75f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3cc2bae4-51b8-4f30-adca-53cd9ad9bd9a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KitchenAid Pro Line Series KDTE404DSP dishwasher effectively cleans your dishes.
