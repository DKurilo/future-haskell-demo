They are convertible notebooks with a display screen and a keyboard. In laptop mode, they work the same as a conventional laptop. The device easily transforms into a tablet, with a touchscreen you can navigate by fingertip or stylus, by either swiveling on a hinge or folding in half.","A tablet laptop can be handy in an office setting where workers are mobile. These computers are easily picked up and relocated, but most importantly, they are versatile. Showing a presentation to a co-worker with a quick flip of your screen saves time and energy. Going from typing notes to drawing plans on a tablet means you aren&#39;t chained to a desk. These devices free workers and make them mobile, which expands your office options.","We determined the best tablet PCs on the market to be the <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/lenovo-ideapad-yoga-2-pro\">Lenovo Yoga</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-twist\">Lenovo ThinkPad Twist</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/best-2-in-1s\">Fujitsu LifeBook</a>. These tablet PCs performed the best in the categories we evaluated, and each constitutes a powerful machine that will appeal to corporate professionals. For additional information on these devices, be sure to check out our <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">articles on tablet PCs</a>.","<strong>Tablet PCs: What to Look For</strong>","Not all tablet PCs are created equal, and finding one that suits your needs can be challenging if you don t know what to look for. When looking for the right tablet PC, consider design, help and support, features, and technical specifications, the last of which determines the device s overall performance. We used each of these as our criteria to determine the best tablet PC on the market.","<strong>Performance</strong><br/>The technical specifications of a tablet laptop are the type of processor the device has, the amount of RAM, hard drive or solid-state drive capacity, battery life, wireless capabilities (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and other features. The technical specifications determine how powerful and fast a tablet PC is and how well it performs.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>Any tablet PC should be easy to operate in both clamshell and tablet mode. The touchscreen should be sensitive enough to accurately register light swipes and taps with a fingertip or stylus.","A tablet PC should also be easy to convert from clamshell mode to tablet and vice versa. The screen should swivel easily and remain secure while in tablet mode.","The best tablet PCs are designed for portability. Look for models that are sleek, lightweight and durable. You should also take into consideration the device s dimensions, resolution and screen size. A larger screen size may mean easier navigation in tablet mode but a larger device overall.","Decide whether you need a webcam and select among the many available features, including USB 3.0, HDMI and Ethernet ports; auxiliary jack; built-in microphone; and memory card reader.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Customer support options for tablet PCs should be comprehensive and easy to access. The manufacturer should provide technical support via email, telephone or live chat. Online resources such as a knowledgebase, community forum and product manual should be available for your perusal. Also, look to see whether a company offers in-store or in-home repair. This can save you time and money if you ever require a fix.","This category also includes a tablet PC s warranty. Most come with a standard one-year hardware warranty, though a few have exceptional three-year warranties.","The best tablet PCs are those that excel in each of these areas and provide convenience, portability and performance, even on the go."]},"id":"1317c699-cdb2-42e9-89e6-e283c31c9d98","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8e753472-14ed-414b-8830-625f9de05f84","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OVFGU36/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|58586[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Lenovo Yoga</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009MPBFNU/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|58587[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Lenovo ThinkPad Twist</a>","<a href=\"http://www.aztekcomputers.com/SPFCT902002-FUJITSU-3781650.html\">Fujitsu LifeBook</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GJUPWA8/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|58588[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony VAIO Fit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GJUQ4Z0/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|58589[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony VAIO Tap</a>","<a href=\"http://adfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/127498?DURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fxps-12-9q33%2Fpd%3Foc%3Ddncwi1108s\">Dell XPS</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BNHOQFY/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|53745[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">HP EliteBook Revolve</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009F1II54/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|58590[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ASUS TAICHI</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OJAODM/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|53746[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Lenovo ThinkPad</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FF6BDAK/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|58592[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Microsoft Surface</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HV3IMY/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|53748[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ASUS Eee Slate</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ANBTMH8/?&tag=ttr_tablet_pc-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|585[art|NA[pid|53752[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ASUS VivoTab</a>","<a href=\"http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NT.L1XAA.002\">Acer Iconia W</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7a230e9d-f5b4-4a12-a430-09830acf4a70","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_585","url":"/best-tablet-pcs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-29T21:51:43Z","datePublished":"2014-01-17T18:12:47Z","name":"Tablet PC Review","synopsis":"Get the best of both worlds with a Windows laptop that doubles as a touchscreen tablet.","review":{},"strapline":"Get the best of both worlds with a Windows laptop that doubles as a touchscreen tablet.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-17T20:47:59Z","id":"pDLYWMbAiABTJyRreuTHSX","meta":{"title":"The Best Tablet PC 2017 | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Looking for the best tablets?
