The best POS systems can function as a hub for your entire business. ","Typical POS systems have hardware that lets you ring up orders, including a barcode scanner, credit card reader, cash register and receipt printer. Modern POS systems include much more, though. For example, they include tools for inventory tracking, sales tracking, employee management and customer management. You can purchase each of these tools individually, but you save money by bundling them into a POS system.","<strong>What Kind of POS System Should I Get?</strong>","Choosing a POS system for your business is a serious decision. The best kind for you depends on what type of business you have, how busy you are, and whether you need it to track inventory, sales and other data. For example, restaurants need systems to assign tables and track orders, while businesses that work trade shows or farmers markets need portable systems.","Cloud POS systems are becoming the norm. To use cloud POS software, you pay a monthly fee, which tends to be cheaper in the long run than buying a costly software license and paying to have a server onsite. There are also no annual upgrade costs associated with cloud systems. ","<strong>What to Look for in a POS System?</strong>","A POS system can be as complex or as simple as you choose – you can ring up customers on a tablet or have an elaborate checkout kiosk with lots of advanced features. A lot depends on the type of business you have and what you need to keep it running smoothly. As such, before you even start shopping around, take stock of your business. Ask yourself if there are any tools you could use to improve your business, and consult with your employees to see if there’s anything that could help them. This will give you some direction as you navigate all the complexities of buying a POS system. ","You should also take stock of what equipment you have. If you’re upgrading to new POS software, check to see if your existing equipment is compatible with what you’re looking for. Itemize all the equipment you already own and see if you have enough. <br/>","<br/>Another part of choosing a POS system is finding a payment processor. Some POS systems come bundled with their own processing, which can save you the headache of finding your own processor. However, if you run a larger business with a lot of sales, you may be better off finding a separate processor. Read our reviews of <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processors</a> to find out which is best for your business.","<strong>What Are the Costs?</strong>","As a business owner, your biggest concerns are likely the upfront and ongoing costs. You can get all the equipment you need for anywhere between $500 and $2,000. The software may cost extra, depending on whether it&#39;s bundled with the equipment or not. You can pay another $1,000 or so for a software license or $50 a month to use cloud software. The advantage of a cloud program is you don’t have to pay annual upgrade fees.","The price also goes up as you add features. Often, POS systems are sold at different service levels, and the features you want may bump you up to a higher pricing tier. ","One of the biggest ongoing costs is payment processing. Many POS companies offer payment processing, but not all do. And even if you find one that does, you may get a better price on the service elsewhere. Often, it&#39;s better to look at payment processing as a completely separate cost, especially if you run a large business."]},"id":"7fcd22a0-6fa5-4bd9-8ab6-c69c22868b27","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_381","url":"/best-pos-systems","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nate-drake","url":"/author/nate-drake","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nate Drake","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6Rk5zYKExFAD8Ue8U7vTzg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-07T23:23:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-07T23:23:00Z","name":"Best POS Systems 2019","synopsis":"Point-of-sale systems let you take payments wherever your customers are.
