It also flexes in eight directions to help you achieve a close, comfortable shave.","With an MSRP of $149.99, the Braun Series 5 is priced in the midrange of the 10 <a href=\"/best-electric-razors\">electric razors</a> we tested. Our testers gave it an A- performance rating, saying it pulls a bit on longer whiskers but provides excellent results overall. ","“It took a minute to get used to,” one of our testers said, “but I like it.” ","This razor is one of <a href=\"https://us.braun.com/en-us/products/male-grooming/electric-shavers\">Braun’s Series 3, 5, 7 and 9 shavers</a>, and it’s designed for maximum comfort and convenience whether you’re shaving wet or dry. Because it is waterproof up to 15 feet deep, you can use it to shave wet with water, foam or gel. You can also use it in the shower, and it has a textured grip to keep it from slipping from your hands as you shave.","The Braun Series 5 has a battery life of 50 minutes, and a three-level battery display tells you how much shaving time you have left. If you don’t have time for a full one-hour recharge, it has a quick charge feature to give you enough power for a single shave. You can also use this razor while it’s plugged in, but its battery life indicator is disabled during charging. ","Like the <a href=\"/braun-review\">Braun Series 7 790cc-4</a>, the Series 5 has an autosensing motor that adapts its power to the density of your beard to minimize pressure on your skin. This helps protect sensitive skin from irritation. The <a href=\"/philips-norelco-7500-review\">Philips Norelco 7500</a> is another good choice for sensitive skin, especially if you’re a fan of rotary shavers. ","The Braun Series 5 has worldwide voltage adaptation and a convenient travel lock. However, it’s missing a storage/travel pouch. There’s a Clean&amp;Charge station to hygienically clean, lubricate and dry the shaver with a proprietary alcohol-based solution. Although our testers thought the Series 5’s cleaning cartridge was “kind of a pain to install,” they were pleased with its result. ","Braun warranties the Series 5 for two years, which tends to be the industry standard. Of the 10 razors we tested, only the <a href=\"/wahl-shaver-review\">Wahl LifeProof 7061-100</a> has better consumer protection, with a five-year manufacturer’s warranty. Braun’s options for consumer support include phone, live chat and an online self-service tool. "]},"id":"61f8e9f3-cd3e-4578-832d-ca6035592eea","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66709","url":"/braun-series-5-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-26T22:46:49Z","datePublished":"2015-08-26T22:46:49Z","name":"Braun Series 5 5190cc","synopsis":"Our testers described the Braun Series 5 5190cc as being “surprisingly smooth.”","review":{"rating":90,"verdict":"The Braun Series 5 5190cc is a time-tested electric razor designed for performance and comfort.
