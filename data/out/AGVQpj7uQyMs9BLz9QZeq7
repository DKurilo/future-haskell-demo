EZPhotoScan is a <a href=\"/best-photo-scanning-services\">photo scanning service</a> that abides by the guidelines set forth by the National Archives when handling your photographs. Your photos are handled by gloved professionals, organized by container and backed up on to archival preservation CD or DVD discs.","If you have photo albums full of pictures that you want backed up to disc, sending them to EZPhotoScan is a good way to save time and effort. Before removing your photographs, the company&#39;s staff documents the exact position of each one in the album and makes sure that they’re put back in their original places when finished. While these professional take extra care with your photographs, damage can occur if the photos are very old.","Slide and negative transfer are another scanning service offered by EZPhotoScan. Using high-quality imaging equipment, the company digitizes negatives and slides, and applies color correction where necessary. Scanned slides, along with the digital copies, are shipped back to you when finished. Of course, you have to trust that the shipping courier doesn&#39;t lose your precious memories.","EZPhotoScan handles your treasured documents as well. Everything including old family marriage licenses and your child&#39;s favorite artwork is handled by specialists and scanned in high-quality digital format following the same guidelines as the photographic scanning process. The scans are then placed on gold archival discs that last potentially forever, providing you care for them.","Bound document and scrapbook scanning is also possible with EZPhotoScan’s photo scanning service. The company uses special scanners that preserve the structural integrity of bound items. Copyright restrictions apply, however, so don’t expect to be able to scan the latest bestseller.","If you would rather attempt to scan your own photographs and documents, EZPhotoScan rents the equipment to do so. The system comes complete with everything you need to just plug in and go, including the tools you need for slide and photo scanning. The company rents this equipment for a flat rate fee that includes a specific number of days of usage and round-trip shipping.","If all you need scanned are photos and documents, EZPhotoScan is a good choice. However, this photo scanning service doesn&#39;t handle videocassette tapes. If you don&#39;t want to ship your photos, you can rent the equipment from the company to scan and transfer them yourself."]},"id":"5d32fd9e-6edf-4b09-aefe-86c416e77e9f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64757","url":"/ezphotoscan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-12T15:39:32Z","datePublished":"2015-05-12T15:39:32Z","name":"EZPhotoScan","synopsis":"When it comes to preserving your photographs and memories, you want to make sure that they’re the best possible quality.
