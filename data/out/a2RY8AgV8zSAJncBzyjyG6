We compared DVRs from cable and satellite companies, as well as those manufactured by third-party sources. We evaluated their storage and file organization, media sourcing abilities, recording and playback capabilities, and interface. We noted which devices were easy to use, powerful and capable.","<strong>How Much Do DVRs Cost?</strong>","The DVR boxes we tested cost an average of $250. Units with more modern capabilities like 4K video and multi-program recording cost closer to $400, while old fashioned OTA boxes are about $200. Some DVRs require a separate hard drive to store your recorded content, which increases the overall cost of your investment. Purchase one with at least 1 TB of storage space, which costs roughly $50.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","As we evaluated these DVRs, we looked at how much high definition (HD) and standard definition (SD) content they can store, how many tuners they have, how they record and play content, how many unique sources of content each can access, and the quantity and quality of inputs and outputs each comes with. We also pored over reviews from actual customers and compared them to manufacturer specifications.","We found that the best options were powerful, feature-rich high performers with all the bells and whistles, as they offer the most flexibility for the widest variety of users. However, there are plenty of less expensive DVRs that provide basic yet solid functionality.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a DVR</strong>","Functionality<br/>Odds are, if you’re considering a DVR, you’re serious about keeping up with your favorite TV shows and movies. If your DVR has a small hard drive and you can’t keep up with your shows, the DVR may quickly fill up and become unable to record new episodes. We found that the best DVRs have at least 1TB of storage, if not double or triple that. At the very least, a DVR should allow you to connect an external hard drive, so you can store more of your shows.","Households with more than one person using a DVR should choose a device that allows for simultaneous recording and viewing from at least two channels. This feature is a must-have if everyone in your family loves primetime shows that play at the same time but on different channels. A good DVR has anywhere from four to six tuners that can each record different content at any given time. You should also make sure your device can skip through commercials for recorded content if you prefer not to watch them.","Equally important to recording multiple shows at the same time is the ability to stream that content on multiple TVs throughout your home, appeasing everyone in your family. Mom and Dad can watch the latest <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/\">Netflix</a> series in the living room while the kids watch their favorite TV shows in the playroom, and Uncle Joe can catch up on the latest sports highlights in the guest room. Of course, if you want to ensure your little ones aren’t watching anything inappropriate, look for a unit that has versatile parental controls.","Access<br/>Consider your viewing needs as well as what – if any – hardware or cable contracts you currently have as you look for a DVR. Few DVRs can record content from every single given source. More often, however, you’ll see some that can record from cable or an antenna but nothing from a satellite dish. Others may only record content from on-demand or streaming sources. A few can even replace your cable box. You may also be able to use your DVR to view your personal videos, photos and music, through apps like Plex. This helps you connect all of your media into a single, unified source.","You may also want to consider a DVR that has a companion mobile app, such as Tablo. This allows you to view any of your recorded content on your mobile devices, even if you’re not at home. Such apps are handy if you travel a lot but still want to keep up with your favorite shows.","Input &amp; Output<br/>Each DVR differs in the ports it offers. Some provide the bare minimum – for example, just a USB port and either an HDMI or Ethernet port – while others include a coax connection, optical and analog audio ports, component and composite video ports, and even 4K connectivity in addition to the basics. Consider your needs, your existing hardware and your willingness to deal with cords when searching for a DVR.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Ideally, the DVR manufacturer offers a variety of customer support resources, both direct and indirect. All of the DVR companies offer support over the phone, and depending on the company, you may also have live chat or email support options. If you simply want to learn more about the product or troubleshoot an issue on your own, most companies have knowledgebases, user forums or FAQs on their websites.","<strong>How Do DVRs Work?</strong>","A DVR is essentially a hard drive, and when you record and save content to it, it’s not much different than saving a file to your computer. DVRs are programmed to be compatible with your TV along with antennas, cable boxes and other media sources. From these external devices, the DVR receives signals through its tuner, and these signals then split, travelling to the hard drive then to your screen. It can do this for multiple shows at once, depending on how many tuners it has.","Most DVRs require a subscription to a service or cable contract. A few of them, like TiVo, have no subscription but focus mainly on over-the-air content.","<strong>Planning Ahead: Understanding How Much Content Takes Up a Gigabyte of Storage</strong>","One of the main things to consider when buying a DVR is how much recorded content it can hold. A DVR’s actual capacity is less than advertised, as it does have some software already installed on it by the manufacturer which allows it to run; this is the same case for computers, smartphones, etc. Most DVRs have between 500GB and 2TB of space, which is enough for most users. However, power users may find that they need to connect an additional external hard drive for even more space. Before you buy a DVR, consider your general storage usage habits and think about how often you plan on watching then deleting future content.","It’s also good to know exactly how much space a TV show or movie takes up on a hard drive so that you can plan ahead and buy a DVR that’s the right size for your needs. Also consider whether you regularly consume more HD or SD content. In general, high-definition (HD) and 4K content take up much more space than standard-definition (SD) does. Files for these formats are bigger because they contain more data. Because of this, you won’t be able to record as much HD or 4K content as you can SD content.","For reference, every hour of standard-definition content you record will require approximately 1GB of space on the DVR’s internal hard drive. So, if you have a 500GB DVR, you can store about 500 hours of content. This translates to roughly 1,000 hours for a 1TB DVR, and about 2,000 hours for a 2TB DVR. For HD content, the rate is about 6GB per one hour, and around 12GB for an hour of 4K content. If you want to record multiple shows of varying definition, it’ll be up to you to plan ahead.","<strong>Gray Area: What’s Legal to Record and What Isn’t?</strong>","In this age of rampant piracy, content providers and studios are on guard to protect their content and punish those who attempt – successfully or not – to illegally obtain and/or distribute it. DVRs that come with a satellite or cable subscription let you record any of the content they’ve licensed for as long as you’re their customer. This is justified because you ultimately download the commercials that pay for their content along with the content itself. However, using them to record content outside of the company’s parameters is where things enter a legal gray area. In the United States, the law is really only focused on the source of the content. Beyond the United States, laws may vary.","Content-recording ethics are a bit murkier when you buy a third-party DVR instead of getting one from a cable provider because it isn’t tied to a cable or satellite subscription. If you don’t want to be tied down to a cable subscription, and who could blame you, you can opt for an over-the-air (OTA) DVR, such as the TiVo Roamio OTA VOX, which can legally capture content from free over-the-air channels you can access with a simple, inexpensive antenna. While you don’t have access to all the channels included in a cable or satellite subscription, it may be enough if you just want a little TV to watch every now and then.","It is ultimately a matter of permission, but it also boils down to your intention to distribute anything you’ve recorded, no matter whether it would be free or sold for a price. All DVRs are intended for personal, home use only. If you are unsure what any of the legal limits are, consult your DVR’s provider or legal counsel."]},"id":"c7045fc3-7d85-4cfb-85fc-33b27d47ebfa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f3919332-17b1-4bf7-9129-318cfe8fcfc6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/dish-hopper-review\">Dish Hopper 3</a>","<a href=\"/directv-genie-review\">DirecTV Genie HD</a>","<a href=\"/tivo-bolt-vox-review\">TiVo Bolt VOX</a>","<a href=\"/tivo-roamio-review\">TiVo Roamio OTA VOX</a>","<a href=\"/tablo-dual-lite-ota-review\">Tablo Dual Lite OTA</a>","<a href=\"/tablo-dual-64gb-ota-review\">Tablo Dual 64GB OTA</a>","<a href=\"/avermedia-review\">AVerMedia EzRecorder 310</a>","<a href=\"/tablo-4-review\">Tablo 4-Tuner OTA</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7f83d9c1-bfde-419c-b853-7fa0cdf1ddcb","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_337","url":"/best-dvrs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T22:51:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T22:51:00Z","name":"Best DVRs of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best DVR boxes, ranked by their storage size, 4K video capability, input and output options, and customer service.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best DVR boxes, ranked by their storage size, 4K video capability, input and output options, and customer service.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-27T19:53:55Z","id":"a2RY8AgV8zSAJncBzyjyG6","meta":{"title":"Best DVR Box 2019 -
