The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-bluetooth-headsets\">Bluetooth Headset Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Motorola Moto Hint is by far the smallest Bluetooth headset on the market. It&#39;s almost small enough to be mistaken for a hearing aid. Unfortunately, being small and discreet doesn&#39;t mean it performs where it matters. Despite being one of the most expensive Bluetooth headsets that you can buy, the Moto Hint features below-average call quality and easily falls out of your ear.","In our voice quality tests, almost every Bluetooth earpiece scored 90 percent or higher, but the Moto Hint scored 85 percent. The test consisted of listening to a caller recite poetry while we wrote down what we heard. However, while this headset performed below average compared to other headsets, it&#39;s still considerably better than holding your phone to your ear, which scored 65 percent on the same test.","The Moto Hint didn&#39;t fare much better in the noise reduction test than in the voice quality test. It scored 80 percent, which isn&#39;t the worst score in the test but isn&#39;t great either. For this test, we played common background noises around us as we spoke to our caller. We recorded the caller&#39;s end of the call to see how well the headset filtered out the noises around us. When you consider the diminutive size of the headset, it actually performed better than you&#39;d expect, but our voice still sounded distorted at times.","At 3.3 hours, the Moto Hint has the shortest continuous talk time of any hands-free Bluetooth headset we reviewed. Motorola doesn&#39;t provide a specification for charging time, but our tests showed that it charged in about two hours, which is average. One of the better features is the charging case. It looks a bit like a lipstick case, but the case provides an additional 10 hours of talk time.","One of the biggest downsides to the Moto Hint is the minimalist design. It&#39;s meant to be discreet and unobtrusive, but the fit lacks sufficient support. Without a concha fin or an over-ear hook, the earbud lacks the necessary support to stay in your ear unless you don&#39;t move your head at all. In our stability tests, it scored 25 percent, which means it fell off in almost every exercise we performed. The earbud doesn&#39;t fit into your ear canal like most ear gels. Instead, the earbud rests loosely in your ear with a small portion of the gel directed into your ear canal."]},"id":"6088ecff-b266-489c-b0f6-a5c470691b46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0a7b78ea-e300-4f1c-b73e-42f5e486ba91","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola Moto Hint is the most discreet Bluetooth headset available, which is convenient if you&#39;re self-conscious about being seen wearing a Bluetooth earpiece.
