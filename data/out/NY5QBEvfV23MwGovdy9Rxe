It provides a wide range of power that easily melts butter and chocolate without scorching it to rapidly boiling water. It also offers a handful of safety features to keep you and your family members safe. However, its feature set is very limited, which we were disappointed to see.","This four-burner induction cooktop boasts a range of power from 50 watts to 3,600 watts, one of the widest ranges we saw for the induction cooktops we reviewed. Additionally, this Fagor cooktop features 12 heat settings to ensure your exact cooking need is met. There are also three quick temperature options: low, medium and high.","The four heating elements range in size from 6.5 inches in diameter to 9 inches. We would like to see larger heating elements. Many of the best cooktops feature an 11-inch heating element.  Another drawback of this unit is that it doesn’t allow you to sync two heating elements together to create a larger element so you can use a griddle to cook pancakes.","This cooktop doesn’t offer much when it comes to advanced features. It is missing many of the features found on similar products, including a multi-burner timer, which allows you to set a timer for each specific heat element; pan-sizing capability, which automatically adjusts the size of the burner to match the size of pan you are using; and a control lock feature.","However, this induction cooker provides several safety options, including pan detection. With this feature, if a heating element is turned on but the cooktop doesn’t detect a ferromagnetic pan  or any type of cookware, the burner automatically shuts off. Also, it will not let a burner get above 575 degrees Fahrenheit.","This induction cooktop is covered under a one-year manufacturer warranty, which is average for a cooktop. Should you have any questions or concerns, you can reach a Fagor customer support representative via email or the telephone. You can also access the user manual on the company website in the event you lose your manual."]},"id":"f07ebda5-d8b7-43ef-bf5d-b62b21f7118b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"47651f16-a442-4651-892b-472e7349cd6a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Fagor IFA-80 BN is an excellent product if you want plenty of power and numerous safety features.
