You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Asus Cube offers many of the same features of other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-streaming-players,review-2140.html\">media players</a> that use Google TV, but it&#39;s much easier to use. Google TV has been widely criticized for a complicated and less-than-intuitive  interface, so the Cube is a significant improvement.","This media player has all the same channels, services and apps as other Google TV devices, but it streamlines the interface. The main menu, like the device, is organized in the shape of a cube, and you jump forward and backward to find the app or file you are looking for.","The setup process is not the quickest, but it is fairly straightforward, and you&#39;ll be up and running in 15 to 20 minutes. You simply sign into your Google account, configure your IR blaster and program your personal TV watching preferences. From there, you go to the home page where you can save and access your entertainment in separate, differently named folders.","While the 4.9-cubic-inch box isn&#39;t the most stylish media player, it should blend in with just about any home entertainment center with its compact size and subtle diagonal, black-on-black stripes. More importantly, it is well equipped in terms of connections with HDMI in and out ports (though no HDMI cables are included), two USB ports, Ethernet, infrared (IR) blaster cable and power connections.","It also has built-in Wi-Fi for full internet access. You can use the IR blaster cable to remotely control the functions of your other home theater components, such as your TV. A mobile phone app, included in the package, allows you to use an Android phone as a remote.","At first glance, the QWERTY remote looks similar to that of other Google TV devices, but there are some notable differences. In terms of weight, it is well balanced, since it is designed to hold one AA battery on either side of the QWERTY keypad (two total) on the back of the remote. The only number pad is located along the top of the QWERTY keypad in back, which might take some getting used to. There are no number keys on the front of the remote, just an up and down channel button.","The on-screen mouse pointer buttons are located on the side, exactly adjacent to the track pad on the front of the remote, which makes it easy to accidentally press the keys on the side as you use the track pad. The track pad itself is intuitive and easy to use once you get a feel for the remote overall.","The voice search button, as the name implies, allows you to search for a movie title, channel name, app or website using only your voice. You can instantly access your favorite shows and even live TV if your Cube is connected to a cable box.","The customer service options with Asus are broad. Live chat is available. Company representatives are also available by email or phone. User manuals and user forums are great resources and provide you with even more support.","The Asus Cube is a user-friendly, high-functioning Google TV device and is a solid addition to the market. It&#39;s an intuitive and speedy addition to our home media player reviews. The app selection is good though not great. The voice command feature, as activated by a button on the side of the remote, makes finding your favorite shows and files quick and easy."]},"id":"a719a3f1-ca9d-4967-a94d-d51e071f2f99","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58071","url":"/asus-cube-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-05T21:45:18Z","datePublished":"2013-11-05T21:45:18Z","name":"Asus Cube","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been has been discontinued.
