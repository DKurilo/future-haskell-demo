While its power output isn’t great, it’s not terrible either. At the manufacturer&#39;s price, this home theater receiver is one of the best values on the market.","This surround sound receiver is a capable hub for your entertainment system. It has six HDMI inputs and one HDMI output, which means you can connect six video sources to it and then connect the receiver to a TV. It also has two optical inputs and two analog audio inputs, so you can connect it to a variety of older audio equipment.","Denon lists the AVR-S730H’s power output as 75 watts per channel on 8-ohm speakers and 110 watts on 6-ohm speakers. This is slightly below average, but considering that it’s one of the more affordable AV receivers we reviewed, it’s a good value for the power.","The AVR-S730H has seven audio channels and two subwoofer pre-outs, which is comparable to similarly priced AV receivers. It also includes decoders for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, the most current audio formats, which add overhead channels to the surround sound to give even more depth to the audio. These formats aren’t widely used yet, so it also has the Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD decoders as well as legacy decoders for upmixing stereo tracks to surround sound.","This receiver is equipped with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so you can send audio wirelessly to your surround sound system from your smartphone, tablet or computer. It supports both the AirPlay and the DLNA Wi-Fi protocols, which make it easy to connect your Apple or Android device over your home Wi-Fi network.","Its six HDMI inputs are compatible with 4K and 3D video. It’s also compatible with HDCP 2.2, which is necessary for Blu-rays and DVDs that have content protection encryption.","You can control the receiver three ways: the front panel, remote and app. The panel controls are more complicated than those on many receivers, and few people like adding another remote control to their collection. This is why the smartphone app is the preferred control method for most users. The app is easy to navigate, and you’re far less likely to lose your phone between the couch cushions than a remote."]},"id":"bd712a12-aac6-4e9d-95f3-a26897f68dd5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c08690bf-eec7-403a-9980-c6cfe892f5ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Denon AVR-S730H is loaded with features, and it is a great value at the manufacturer&#39;s recommended price.
