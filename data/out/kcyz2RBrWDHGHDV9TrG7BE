Many solar contractors have thought about this and will help you transfer your solar agreement to the new homeowners once your house sells, which means you won&#39;t be stuck with the solar bill when you move. This does mean you’ll need to find buyers who want to inherit a solar power plan.","According to energysage.com the average cost for residential solar panel installation as of 2017 is $16,800. Federal and state tax credits can reduce this price by a few thousand dollars depending on where you live. Over time, the reduced price of your utility bill can not only make up the difference in cost between a traditional power bill and a solar one, but will also have the potential to save you thousands of dollars in the long run. The most common payment options offered by solar companies are purchase, loan, lease and PPA. Each company&#39;s specific payment agreements will vary, so if you prefer a specific plan be sure to find a solar company that offers it. While some payment methods require a down payment of some kind, many offer $0 down plans.","Purchase – By purchasing the solar panels from the get-go, you will own the energy right away. If you can afford this, there will be no additional monthly payments. Since you are the sole owner of the solar panels, you will get tax credits.","Loan – This situation is much like paying off a vehicle. The equipment is yours but you need to pay fixed monthly payments until the panels are paid off. Depending on the company you go through, you might not need to make a down payment. You will be eligible for tax credits if you choose this agreement option.","Lease – You will get the energy benefits of using the solar panels, but the panels will be owned by the solar company. This method can make your utility bill much cheaper, but it bars you from getting the tax credit for installing the panels. Should something happen to the solar panels, it will be the installer&#39;s job to fix them. Many people will find that the total amount charged for the lease plus the remaining power bill is less than their previous power bills.","PPA – This stands for power purchase agreement. Basically, it means that a developer will take care of the design, permitting, financing and installation of the solar panels on your property at little or no cost to you. The developer will then sell the power that these installed solar panels create to you, usually at a rate that is cheaper than your local utilities. Should something go wrong with the performance of the solar panels, it will be the developer’s responsibility to fix it, not yours. You will not be eligible for tax credits if you choose a PPA.","You can use government incentives to lower the cost of your utility bill each month. Net metering is a credit/debit system used by utility companies that gives you the ability to lower your power bill if you create more power than you use. There are also Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs or RECs), which are earned for every 1,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) your solar panels produce. Unlike net metering, which deals with credit and debit, SRECs are turned into pocketable cash when you sell them back to your utility provider."]},"id":"86a806e9-76bd-4c21-b758-ec3bbcc9fc43","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"On the Grid Vs.
