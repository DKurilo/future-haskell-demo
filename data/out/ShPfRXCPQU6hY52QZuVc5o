This program runs on both Windows OS and Mac OS X, which makes it unusual among defrag software, and it includes a startup optimization process. In our tests, we didn’t find installation or use of the software to be as easy as it was with others, like O&amp;O Defrag.","The software has a feature called Smart Defrag to automate maintenance. It also checks your hard drives and defrags them automatically when they reach a certain level of fragmentation, so you don’t have to start every process manually. Depending on how often you scan your hard drive, you can choose a quick defrag or a full-system scan.","This defragmenter deletes corrupted files and checks files and folders for duplicate data, so you don’t waste room on your hard drive. This feature reduces future fragmentation issues. When you have duplicate files on your drive, you lose valuable storage space, which can slow your computer’s overall performance. If you accidentally delete an important file, you can open the program to recover it.","This defrag application has tools that can help increase your bootup speed, monitor the health of your hard drive and repair damaged files. It can clean your disk of outdated registries and browsing history, and in extreme cases, permanently remove third-party software and wipe hard drives. It also has a restore tool to return a computer to a previous state as far as programs and settings. The system dashboard can lead you through these processes to get your computer running at top efficiency.","For systems running Windows XP, Norton Utilities requires a 233MHz processor and a minimum of 64GB of free storage space. When used for Windows 7, 8 or Vista, the program requires a 1GHz processor; 32-bit systems will need at least 1GB of memory while 64-bit systems need 2GB of RAM to function. Systems running Windows 10 need at least 100MB of free space, SVGA video and an internet connection for updates.","This program is also available for Mac OS 10.1 (and newer). A single license gives you access to the software on three PCs, and you don’t have to subscribe to a monthly or yearly service."]},"id":"14d0f961-82ea-492e-ad4f-c05a79f50280","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49750","url":"/norton-utilities-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-10T17:27:04Z","datePublished":"2010-06-10T17:27:04Z","name":"Norton Utilities 16","synopsis":"Norton Utilities does far more than disk defragmentation.
