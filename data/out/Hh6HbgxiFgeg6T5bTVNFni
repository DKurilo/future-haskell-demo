For a very reasonable price, you will be able to cut, copy and paste your music together in any way you like. You can also add effects such as flange and reverb, and store your music in new ways to save space. This software can help you copy and edit music in older formats – from a CD, for instance – and save it the files on your computer&#39;s hard drive instead.","Acoustic Labs Audio Editor could make audio editing easier though. Some tools are more difficult to find than they should be. For instance, to open music files, you must access them through the file menu as opposed to the simple drag-and-drop method that other applications offer.","Also, the selection of editing tools is relatively limited. The software lacks the tools and abilities that let you preview audio changes before saving them. Instead, you must save the changes first and then preview your most recent work, which is quite an inconvenience for some users. It also lacks the tool that allows you to combine and edit left and right channels.","The application does have some convenient features, though, including a great mouse zoom. However, it does not support preset filters, and the recording options are limited. It will look for open files to record from, but it does not automatically record streaming audio. You cannot burn your edited music to CDs with the software either. If you want the ability to record audio files with the application, you must purchase other products from Acoustic Labs that specialize in this feature. Other products we found offer the ability to burn CDs within the application, and no additional purchases are required.","This audio editor’s help section is somewhat limited. It provides an index for the product guide, but it is not searchable. The Acoustic Labs Audio Editor website does welcome direct contact by email should you need technical advice."]},"id":"b04251b7-f81e-4883-8c21-4a2019c4bbbd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c87104bf-9120-4de2-b318-e6837e5e2f5d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Acoustic Labs Audio Editor has a basic feature set and will help you manipulate your music in a number of ways for a relatively low price.
