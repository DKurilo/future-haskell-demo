One of their key plans includes My Circle, which offers mobile-to-mobile minutes for up to 20 users on or off the AllTel network. The AllTel network now covers the entire U.S., however they still charge roaming fees of $0.59 per minute. Their plans are slightly on the higher side, one plan costing $59.99 for 900 minutes. But they include My Circle, which will let you get a cheaper plan if you talk within “your circle” more often than not. AllTel has extremely extensive coverage on their direct network, augmented by additional roaming areas. <a href=\"http://www.alltel.com/wps/portal/AlltelPublic/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hnP2-DoCBDAwN_HxcnAyNLZ0PLIE9DIN9MPxykA0mFu3eokYFRgFOwWZi7i5GBgQFE3gAHcDTQ9_PIz03Vj9SPMsdpj7uJfmROanpicqV-QXZ2mnO6oiIAUfiTyw!!/dl2/d1/L0lJSklna21BL0lKakFBTXlBQkVSQ0pBISEvWUZOQTFOSTUwLTVGd0EhIS83X0NOSzBSUjEwME9MREIwMjlDMTlSSTExMEc0L1NrX19fMTE!/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_CNK0RR100OLDB029C19RI110G4_WCM&amp;WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/Shared/shared+content/popup/pop_plans/nationalfreedomcoverage\">See their coverage map here.</a>"," "]},"id":"0e00fc07-9fe2-4a98-a44e-c522c6ec2ea3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1267","url":"/alltel-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-16T13:41:08Z","name":"AllTel National Freedom Plan","synopsis":"Editor's Note: Verizon Wireless completed the purchase of AllTel in January of 2009.
