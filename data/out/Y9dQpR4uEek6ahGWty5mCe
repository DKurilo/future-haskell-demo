It s the generation we live in. Instant gratification is our life blood. It only makes sense that our phones, our immediate lifeline, should let us carry our lives with us. With the slide of a finger you are immediately connected to friends and family all over the world. The ease of sharing our lives makes it standard to document every day through your phone&#39;s camera. But, since we also live in a world of stunning, high-resolution images, we expect that quality in all photography. The introduction of iPhone camera lenses is the solution. With an iPhone camera lens you have the technology to take the same stunning pictures you can with a DSLR camera. We ve researched the top products and have written <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">articles on iPhone camera lens kits</a> to help narrow down your search.","<strong>iPhone Camera Lens Bundles: What to Look For</strong>","If you re ready to enter the world of high resolution photography from the convenience of your iPhone, we recommend sifting through the selection of iPhone camera lens bundles with our help. We ve broken down all of the features you can expect standard in the best iPhone camera lens bundles and have ranked our favorites. Our top three iPhone camera lens bundles, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/photojojo-iphone-android-phone-lenses,review-2365.html\">Photojojo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/olloclip-4-in-1-iphone-6,review-2538.html\">Olloclip</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-iphone-lenses,review-2366.html\">Phocus 3 Lens</a>, all include three different lenses as well as other features, and they rank the highest in the following categories:","<strong>Lens Options</strong><br/>When looking for the right iPhone camera lens bundle, make sure the bundle actually include more than one lens. Many of the products we looked into marketed themselves as a bundle but only included one lens. The best camera lens packages included a wide angle, a fish eye and a macro or telephoto lens. The included telephoto lens should magnify at least 1.5 times.","<strong>Compatibility</strong><br/>Compatibility is important for iPhone users planning to upgrade from the iPhone 4 to 4S or iPhone 5. Because of the different versions of iPhone, the cases are different for each one. Most lenses come with a cover for your phone that the lens screws into. Look for an iPhone lens that can fit all of the iPhones or one that can also be upgraded along with your phone. We also favored those lenses that include cases that are tripod compatible.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>As with all purchases, you want to be sure you are buying a product from a reputable company that stands behind its product. Look for an iPhone camera lens bundle that includes a warranty and a company that provides contact information.  The best of the best also have FAQs and tutorial videos to help you learn the ins and outs of your new toy. We also like to see products that have social media outlets   an easy way to connect to the company.","We live in a photo-rich age. Every moment is documented through Instagram, Facebook and Flikr. An iPhone camera lens will improve your phone s built-in camera, thus improving your pictures. There s no reason to settle for anything less.  Your posterity and your Instagram followers will thank you."]},"id":"7fdbff3d-d9f8-4b32-8bfc-0828a2b502a3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"213d5b55-90af-4c15-a750-bd00ae92b260","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/cell-phone-lenses/\">Photojojo</a>","<a href=\"https://www.olloclip.com/shop/lenses/iphone6-4-in-1/\">Olloclip</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=Phocus%203%20Lens%20bundle&linkCode=ur2&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3APhocus%203%20Lens%20bundle&tag=ttr_iphone-lens-kit-20&url=search-alias%3Daps\">Phocus 3 Lens</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=iPro%20Lens%20System%20Series%202%20Trio%20Kit%20&linkCode=ur2&tag=ttr_iphone-lens-kit-20&url=search-alias%3Dphoto&linkId=2RMRQDZWAXRY5UKF\">iPro Series 2 Trio Kit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008A81L52/?&tag=ttr_iphone-lens-kit-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1072[art|NA[pid|56451[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Phocus 2 Lens</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FH3VQS/?&tag=ttr_iphone-lens-kit-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1072[art|NA[pid|56452[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Turtle Jacket</a>","<a href=\"http://www.pixeet.com/fisheye-lens\">Pixeet iPhone Pack</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7151105-11517614-1435800121000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FProduct.aspx%3FItem%3D9SIA1PU0FU1061%26nm_mc%3DAFC-C8Junction-MKPL%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-C8Junction-MKPL-_-Accessories%2B-%2BCamera%2BOther-_-Patazon-_-9SIA1PU0FU1061&cjsku=9SIA1PU0FU1061\">Patazon</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"482a7012-a686-4ab3-acbf-50933dc1a147","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1072","url":"/best-iphone-lens-kits","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"dan-tennant","url":"/author/dan-tennant","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Dan Tennant","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"eocoVhBgsHkCaPAuPbt37k","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-21T12:53:53Z","datePublished":"2013-06-20T14:29:56Z","name":"iPhone Lens Kits Review","synopsis":"Take your iPhone's photo-taking capabilities to the same level as a DSLR camera by using the best iPhone camera lens kits.","review":{},"strapline":"Take your iPhone's photo-taking capabilities to the same level as a DSLR camera by using the best iPhone camera lens kits.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-01-16T00:36:10Z","id":"Y9dQpR4uEek6ahGWty5mCe","meta":{"title":"The Best iPhone Lens Kits | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Which is the best iPhone lens kit for you?
