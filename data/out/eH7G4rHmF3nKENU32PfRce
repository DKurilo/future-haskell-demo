When you compare fruit juicers, you’ll find that most have a removable cup where all of the fresh juice accumulates. The Waring Pro has a 32-ounce stainless steel cup that has measurement marks along the side so you can track how much juice you have. All you need to do is cut up your favorite produce and insert it into the 3-inch food chute at the top of the juicer. A plastic pusher is included to help you guide the food through the juicer. While the food chute is larger than ones you’ll read in our other juicer reviews, to avoid clogging, we’d still recommend cutting the produce up before inserting it."]},"id":"04010fcd-b9fb-4043-9aa2-c8de97f15ea6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/h5Dvmgcm7GmNJoE866nFoA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Waring Pro Juice Extractor has a pretty powerful motor and it can juice anything from carrots to celery to tomatoes. For soft-skinned fruits like peaches and tomatoes, it is suggested to remove the skins first. It will not process grass. So don’t try to add wheat grass or the like to your raw juice. Waring has several recipes in the juice extractor’s user manual to help get you concocting delicious drinks in no time. All of the leftover fiber or pulp from the produce is a great addition to soups, breads or garden compost.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56812-waring-pro-juice-extractor1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h5Dvmgcm7GmNJoE866nFoA.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"h5Dvmgcm7GmNJoE866nFoA","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h5Dvmgcm7GmNJoE866nFoA.jpg","alt":""},"id":"a59b4579-f409-4ed8-9f96-c2cbd1ae1b89","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/WeTDeZHo8t9LcUGMC92B9f.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Each of the juice maker’s removable parts are dishwasher safe but the rest should be washed by hand with a soft rag – avoid metal scrubbing pads.

For brand new juicers, this process is a whole new world. There are specific instructions to help the transition go easier. First of all, Waring recommends ingesting fresh juice in small amounts the first week. Raw juice has cleansing properties that will clean you out, in a good way, but moderation is important in all things. Once your body has adjusted, Waring recommends drinking the raw juice on its own instead of with a meal.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56812-waring-pro-juice-extractor4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bbxbdvqnPMCWoPvMQocsE8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"bbxbdvqnPMCWoPvMQocsE8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bbxbdvqnPMCWoPvMQocsE8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e1750d4e-26fe-4d5c-86bb-8f3317c46ad5","type":"image"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56840","url":"/waring-pro-juice-extractor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-25T01:08:43Z","datePublished":"2013-06-25T01:08:43Z","name":"Waring Pro Juice Extractor PCJ218","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
