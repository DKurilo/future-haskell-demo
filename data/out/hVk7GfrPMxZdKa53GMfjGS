The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS Trackers</a> here.</em>","The SkyNanny GPS is a GPS tracker with a panic button and a very basic tracking application. It has the lowest two-year cost of ownership of any GPS tracker we reviewed, at just under $200.","The first thing you should know about the SkyNanny GPS is that the only way to track it is through an Android application. So, if you don&#39;t have an Android smartphone, this tracker is not a good option for you.","The GPS is about the size of a garage door opener, perhaps a touch larger. Its top cover slides off to reveal the battery compartment, which is where the SIM card is also stored. To activate it, you go through either US Mobile or Liberty Wireless and purchase a text plan. US Mobile and Liberty Wireless both work on the T-Mobile wireless network, so if you have T-Mobile coverage, this tracker will work for you.","Unlike every other tracker we reviewed, the SkyNanny GPS is not set up to record its location automatically. Instead, its default mode is as a ping-only tracker. If you want to know where the tracker is, you use the app to ask for a location update and you&#39;ll receive its coordinates in a text message and be able to see its location on a map.","However, you can set the SkyNanny GPS to continuous mode so it will automatically update its location every five to 255 seconds. Unfortunately, it lacks the ability to update on a more lengthy time interval, such as five or 10 minutes. It doesn&#39;t use any motion-activated tracking either. The combination of these two factors resulted in a poor showing in our battery life test, where the SkyNanny lasted just 30.5 hours, the shortest amount of time of any GPS tracker that we reviewed. SkyNanny does ship two batteries with the device, which helps offset the poor battery life.","The app costs $9. Inside the app, you can set zones, check history, request location updates and set update intervals. We found the app to be not at all intuitive, so if you struggle with technology, this tracker is probably not for you. It took us several minutes to figure out how to set zones and check history, although once we figured it out, the function worked fine.","The hardware quality is also somewhat lacking. The top cover is difficult to put back once you remove it in order to insert the battery and SIM card. Also, the charging port is exposed, lacking a cover of any kind.","The best feature of the SkyNanny GPS is its onboard SOS button. This means your child can press it and you will get a text message alert. This feature is present on many systems that cost twice as much."]},"id":"a3461c01-e15d-403a-ba7b-fb65f6e3eb2e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a9224d1-4ca4-456d-9a81-d471428aa132","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SkyNanny GPS is not a particularly well-designed tracker, either from the app or hardware perspective.
