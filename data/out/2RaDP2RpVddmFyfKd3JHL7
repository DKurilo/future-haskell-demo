If the ISP is qualified on DOCSIS 3.0, the Toshiba PCX2600 will work, however it cannot take advantage of any DOCSIS 3.0 advantages. DOCSIS 2.0 certified cable modems have a theoretical data throughput speed of 40Mbps downstream and 10Mbps upstream. The DOCSIS 3.0 standard supports the bonding of multiple 6MHz channels to support a single data stream. Therefore users of DOCSIS 3.0 certified cable modems in DOCSIS 3.0 cable operator environments sometimes experience a four-fold increase in speed over DOCSIS 2.0.","Since wide-spread deployment of DOCSIS 3.0 qualified cable modem termination systems is inevitable, it might make better sense to start with a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem since it can work in DOCSIS 2.0 cable operator environments until the cable operator upgrades to DOCSIS 3.0. If the cable operator is a couple of years away from upgrading and the price difference between a DOCSIS 2.0 cable modem and a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem is significant, then there might be a case for buying a DOCSIS 2.0 modem. However the DOCSIS 3.0 modems are becoming more competitive in price.","The Toshiba PCX2600 connects to PCs, Macs or Unix computers via Ethernet cable.
