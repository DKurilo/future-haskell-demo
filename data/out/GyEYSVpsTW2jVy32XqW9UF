The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-bluetooth-car-kits\">Bluetooth Car Kit Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Parrot MINIKIT Neo has one of the smallest and sleekest designs of any of the Bluetooth hands-free car kits in our lineup. The comma-shaped body fits snugly on your sun visor without unsightly wires or hooks. It has green and red LED buttons that contrast well with the dark colors. The only other button is a scroll wheel that doubles as a volume knob during calls and a way to navigate the menu of features within the mobile app. However, once you active the voice commands, you can operate the Neo without ever touching it.","The Neo features a single 3-watt speaker that&#39;s capable of HD-quality audio. With HD voice, the frequency range of your caller more than doubles the frequency range you&#39;d get with a Bluetooth car speakerphone that uses the standard audio range for phone calls. This expanded frequency range allows you to hear most of the frequencies your caller&#39;s voice produces instead of just a fraction. The result is a voice that sounds natural and less miscommunication. It&#39;s especially helpful for understanding callers with unfamiliar accents, because it sounds like they&#39;re in the car with you.","To pick up your voice, the Neo uses an omnidirectional microphone. While it works great with voice commands, the noise reduction is too inconsistent. Sometimes the internal digital signal processor, which filters out background noises, will cut out your voice. As a result, your caller will complain of hearing stuttering. Sometimes it can sound like you&#39;re moving away from the microphone even though you haven&#39;t moved at all.","The Neo has all the common Bluetooth profiles associated with Bluetooth car kits except the Audio/Video Remote Control Profile, which allows you to control a playlist on your mobile device. You can stream music and GPS directions with the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile. The Phone Book Access Profile allows the Neo access to your contact list so that you can get vocalized caller ID and voice dial. The Hands-Free Profile is the most important, because it allows you to use voice commands to perform all of the features so that you don&#39;t have to take your focus from the road.","With just 10 hours of talk time, the Neo&#39;s battery life is the shortest we reviewed. However, it can last six months on standby, which is the longest standby time available. If you don&#39;t use it often, you only have to recharge it a couple times a year."]},"id":"14ca11ee-65e4-40ca-9184-bbbf31accac9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"90cf118b-d50d-4d2b-98c5-19db72627cb5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Parrot MINIKIT Neo provides excellent HD voice call quality and comprehensive voice commands that allow you to focus on your driving.
