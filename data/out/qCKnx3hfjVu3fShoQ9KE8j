The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-sports-tickets\">Sports Ticket Websites</a> here.</em>","TicketsToGo is a secondary ticket broker website designed to sell concert, theatre and sports tickets. While there is a larger selection of sports tickets from leagues such as MLB, NBA, NHL and NFL, the focus of the site seems to be on Texas-based teams. While TicketsToGo offers low rates on service fees and e-fees, which are among the best of the sports tickets websites we reviewed, the site&#39;s interface lacks in ease of use and general features included with other sites where you buy sports tickets.","When you are buying cheap game tickets online, a way ticket brokers make money is on service fees. This is a percentage charged to each ticket purchase and can be as high as 25%. TicketsToGo has one of the lowest services fees among sites we reviewed at 6%, meaning that if you find cheap sports tickets on TicketsToGo, there won&#39;t be an abundance of hidden fees.","Where TicketsToGo really lacks is in the site&#39;s ability to provide an easy user interface. The site design is clumsy and amateurish. It is difficult to search and find available games and upcoming events with the sluggish search tools. There is no interactive seating chart of any kind, which makes finding where you would be sitting inside a potential arena very difficult. There is also a lack of options when it comes to reselling your tickets using TicketsToGo. You cannot list your tickets for reselling electronically, like on other sites. You can technically sell your tickets through TicketsToGo, but you have to contact the company through their Contact Us link. This is more like a ticket broker relationship and less of a resale site.","There is no return policy included with the purchase of tickets from TicketsToGo. In the event that the sporting event is cancelled, you can potentially get a partial refund, not including broker fees. Yet, if the event is rescheduled or moved, there is no refund policy. There are help and support options through TicketsToGo. There is a FAQs section of their website, although it is difficult to navigate and less informative than other sports ticket websites. There is email and phone support, but no live chat support offered by TicketsToGo."]},"id":"eeee889f-245c-4c26-9d96-29d502ad8bf2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"334f77c4-f34a-401d-ac45-b4beebcba036","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TicketsToGo does offer low fees for the use of purchasing cheap sports tickets online, but the lack of other additional features found on most other sports like interactive seating charts and ticket listing is frustrating."]},"id":"b6a6ec43-ad00-4362-b832-a38cfb46aaa5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2618","url":"/ticketstogo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","datePublished":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","name":"TicketsToGo","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"verdict":"TicketsToGo&#039;s site isn&#039;t very user friendly, and it lacks many features compared to other sports ticket websites.","pros":["The service fee charged by TicketsToGo for their tickets is among the lowest of sites we reviewed."],"cons":["You cannot list your own tickets electronically for resale on this site."]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-09-23T21:48:21Z","id":"qCKnx3hfjVu3fShoQ9KE8j","meta":{"title":"TicketsToGo Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"TicketsToGo is a sports ticket site that offers cheap game tickets and low services fees.
