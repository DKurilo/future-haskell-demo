However, the image quality and features still represent a fair value. If you’re on a tight budget or are simply looking for an inexpensive unit for a student or as a backup device, this Sanyo is a solid choice for you.","This DVD player is not region free and is locked down to region 1 only. If you want a player that is compatible with DVDs from anywhere in the world, consider the <a href=\"/lg-electronics-review\">LG DP132</a>. However, the player can play rewriteable DVDs and CDs, as well as standard ones. One crucial feature that the Sanyo lacks is an upscaling feature, which has the capacity to boost the image quality of your video up to full 1080p HD. It also lacks progressive scan, which smooths out the video picture. The player’s built-in automatic playback resume feature marks where you leave off in the middle of a movie and resumes from the same place whenever you’re ready to.","In our tests, we found this Sanyo to be fairly easy to set up and use. Its physical design is simple, with the buttons on it and its accompanying remote control clearly labeled. We also tested DVD load speeds. This player loaded a DVD in an average time of 18.26 seconds. Though this didn’t beat the fastest speed of 11.92 seconds, it was still more than two seconds faster than the slowest time we logged – 21.8 seconds.","If you want to watch a movie in a different language – such as Spanish or French – or you want English subtitles on, the player supports that. It also supports Dolby audio with digital stream out, so you can enjoy high-quality sound while you listen to music or watch a movie.","The Sanyo FWDP105F ships with a one-year warranty covering parts and 90 days for labor, which is the standard for this kind of product. The player itself ships with a remote control, which allows you to start or stop playback, navigate a DVD’s menu or adjust other settings without having to leave your seat. Should you ever have any questions about or issues with the DVD player, Sanyo does host a variety of online informational resources on its website, including a user manual. You can also contact the manufacturer’s customer support team directly by either phone or email, whichever you prefer."]},"id":"0c4bf076-f716-4785-a1ff-81f57a9273a6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68874","url":"/sanyo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-12-01T19:41:55Z","datePublished":"2016-12-01T19:41:55Z","name":"Sanyo FWDP105F","synopsis":"Sanyo DVD players are fairly basic compared to some of the products from other brands, and the FWDP105F is no different.
