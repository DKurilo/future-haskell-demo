This <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">microscope for kids</a> offers an outstanding warranty and great optics.","The optics are quite sophisticated. The lenses in this children&#39;s microscope are parfocal, which means they can stay in focus even when magnification is altered. They are achromatic, which means they limit aberrations that cause unwanted colors to emerge. And the lenses are also par centered, so the magnified image stays in the center of the viewing area even when changing settings. This microscope has a six-hole diaphragm, which ensures you are always getting just the right amount of light for each specimen.","This children’s microscope allows you to view 3D specimens lit from above and translucent specimens lit from below. That flexibility is quite valuable for when your child wants to see something – anything – from their surroundings up close, including coins, pebbles, leaves and anything else small enough to view under the scope.","The stage stop is a nice feature with this microscope for students. It makes it impossible to smash through a slide – a common problem with young scientists.","This is not the best microscope for kids who will want a lot of accessories. In fact, the manual gives the idea of making homemade slides with Scotch tape. You do get at least a set of premade starter slides with this kit, and they are interesting and helpful. You will be able to look at a housefly leg, pollen and frog blood, among other things. Unlike some other sets, this one doesn&#39;t come with tweezers, stain or other items.","The basic model of the Home Science Tools Kids Microscope needs to be plugged into a wall to work, which cuts down on portability, but you can upgrade to the cordless model. There is no dust cover or carrying case, which will be a drawback for storage.","We like the support you get with this microscope. There are many ways to contact Home Science Tools, and the warranty is unbeatable – it lasts five years. That is a good sign of the confidence Home Science Tools has in this product."]},"id":"148e1b73-bc9c-491f-aad3-13c7b6919948","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"73c81b6c-cf5b-4959-b3ee-67daf58c60d3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Home Science Tools product is not a complete kids microscope kit.
