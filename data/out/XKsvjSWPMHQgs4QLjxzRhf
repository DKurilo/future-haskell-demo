You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Remington Wrap to Waves is a <a href=\"/best-curling-irons\">curling wand</a> with a unique design. This hair curler features two heated barrels that you wrap hair around to give you loose, beautiful waves. This curling iron features an outstanding 30 heat settings, fast heat-up and temperatures up to 350 degrees. However, it is missing a few features that you will find in similar products, which is why it did not rank higher on our lineup.","This curling wand stands out compared to similar products because of its design. It features two ceramic barrels that you wrap hair around. The two-barrel design helps create waves, instead of tight, spiral curls. The curling wand design is best for thin and fine hair, as thick hair can be difficult to hold around a curling wand&#39;s barrel. When we tested this product, thin, fine and normal hair had an easy time with it and received loose waves. However, testers with thick hair had a difficult time achieving any curl and felt the product took too much effort to achieve the look they desired.","This curling iron reaches temperatures up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. This is plenty hot for thin or fine hair. High temperatures may cause heat damage to fine hair. However, if you have extremely thick and coarse hair, you may want a device that provides more heat to set in the curl and help it stay for several hours.","Another advantage to this device is its 30 heat settings. This means that no matter what type of hair you have, you can choose a heat setting that fits you best. The minimum temperature on this hair styler is 265 degrees Fahrenheit. Furthermore, the barrels on this curling iron are ceramic. The ceramic barrel heats quickly and reduces static and frizz. This Remington hair curler also features automatic shut-off capabilities, so you never have to worry about it being heated for hours at a time.","The Remington Wrap to Waves lacks a digital screen. However, it does include an indicator light to notify you when the curling iron is powered on. Its power cord is only 5.9 feet long, making it one of the shortest cords we saw on this type of device. The best products feature cords that are 8 to 10 feet long and prevent the feeling of being tethered to a wall while you curl your hair.","A heat-resistant glove is also included with this hair curler. You can easily burn your fingers with a curling wand, since you hold the hair into place around the heated barrel. The heat-protective glove included with this is an excellent safety feature, and we are pleased that you do not need to purchase the glove in addition to the iron.","This curling wand is covered under a two-year manufacturer warranty. This is the average amount of time that curling irons are covered under warranty, but we would like to see a longer warranty for this unique curling wand."]},"id":"1def4198-994b-40fa-b30b-431a32d74819","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2ea4c5bb-1054-4538-9833-d8e43b6f6bcb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Remington Wrap to Waves is an easy way to create beautiful waves.
