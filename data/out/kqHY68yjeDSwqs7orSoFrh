You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Midea MAE50-1102-PSS is a versatile and useful <a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">portable washing machine</a> because it features numerous wash settings and convenience characteristics that make it a good  choice if you live in a small dwelling. This affordable and portable washing machine is relatively small and lightweight, so you can store it in a closet when it&#39;s not in use, and it comes with many helpful features that will ensure you get clean clothing at a reasonable cost. This uses only 103 kilowatts of electricity per year with average use, which translates to a cost of approximately $12 per year or $1.00 a month.","This portable washer comes with a few design elements that make it reasonably easy to move around the house as needed. It has one caster on the right front of the machine that allows you to tilt and wheel it into the kitchen or bathroom to hook it up and start using it. It also has cabinet handles to help you carry it where you need it. This stands a bit taller than some portable washers at 37 inches in height, and it is 20.25 inches in width and 20.67 inches in depth. It weighs 68.3 pounds.","This Midea portable washer has a 1.6-cubic-foot washtub, which is about enough to fit one person&#39;s average load of laundry at a time. The machine replaces the agitator of traditional machines with a small pulsating disc that sits at the bottom of the washtub and spins your clothes to force water and detergent through them.","This portable washing machine has six wash cycles and three water and temperature level settings, which gives you a good selection of options when you wash your clothes. The heavy cycle is meant for sturdy fabrics and fully penetrates them with water and detergent, washing them thoroughly. You can use the quick cycle to clean your clothes if time is of the essence. The spin-only feature pulls more moisture out of the fabrics, which reduces the time it takes for them to dry. In addition, there is an air dry cycle that allows air to circulate as the clothing spins in the machine, which removes even more moisture. This portable washer comes with a detergent dispenser, which is always helpful, but it is lacking a dispenser for fabric softener, which is a feature that many consumers like.","You can see how things are faring with your laundry using the cycle status lights on the control panel and you can simply look through the see-through lid to see what’s going on. A helpful feature is the delay start function that allows you to put the dirty clothes and detergent in the machine, program it and then it will begin washing when you want it to, so you can go about other activities and get to the finished, clean laundry when you have time."]},"id":"4c99d4ec-fc1f-47cb-b43d-41133d30103c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ec6619c3-c75a-4201-83ed-e3a1ca623b85","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Midea MAE50-1102-PSS is good portable washing machine because of its convenient  washing features.The six different wash cycles and three water and temperature levels give you versatility and control over how you wash your clothes.This washer does a fine job getting clothes clean, uses little energy so your electric bill won&#39;t bee too high and can fit nicely into a small space so  you can forsake the laundromat and do your laundry at home."]},"id":"18ad2155-337b-439e-a803-82223a4d10b2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69463","url":"/midea-mae50-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-06-14T19:11:08Z","datePublished":"2017-06-14T19:11:08Z","name":"Midea MAE50-1102-PSS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":73,"verdict":"The Midea MAE50-1102-PSS is a fine portable washer because it comes with numerous convenience features and wash settings.","pros":["It offers six wash cycles giving control over how you want your clothes to be washed."],"cons":["You get a detergent dispenser, but not a dispenser for fabric softener."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-06-14T19:11:08Z","id":"kqHY68yjeDSwqs7orSoFrh","meta":{"title":"Midea MAE50-1102-PSS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
