With 10x magnification and a field of view at 114 meters, this pair of binoculars allows you to track wildlife, from small birds to large game, without issue. The objective lenses are 42 millimeters in diameter, which is large enough to produce bright images, even in low-light settings or at dusk or dawn.","While we evaluated all of the binoculars we reviewed, we conducted a survey in which participants rated each pair on its optical qualities and clarity. In general, our participants found the Bushnell Excursion produced decent-quality images, but not quite as good as the very best binoculars. Users found that the images were less clear and slightly shakier with these binoculars. It&#39;s important to note that your experience may differ from our participants&#39; findings.","The Bushnell Excursion HD uses BAK-4 prisms and has multiple coatings on the lenses to help it produce higher-quality images than binoculars without these traits can. Because this set of binoculars uses the roof prism design, making it lighter and more compact than those with the Porro prism design, it requires phase correction coatings to make sure images appear sharp. Roof prisms without this coating can result in blurry or fuzzy images.","Our participants had some trouble adjusting this set of optics to maintain a clear, in-focus image. In general, they found the focusing knob took some time to get used to, so focusing on an object took slightly more time than it did with other binoculars. However, this pair only weighs 23.5 ounces, which is lighter than the average weight of all the binoculars we reviewed, making it more comfortable to hold to your eyes for long periods.","The Bushnell Excursion HD is tripod adaptable, which allows you to get the steadiest images possible. All you need is a binocular tripod adapter, which is sold separately, and you can set up your binoculars for clear, stable images. The binoculars are also waterproof and fogproof, meaning they can survive your outdoor adventures without any issues.","Bushnell offers a limited lifetime warranty on nearly all of its binoculars, including the Excursion HD, which protects you from manufacturer defects. The warranty does not cover any damage that is caused to the binoculars through misuse, abuse or unauthorized repairs. If you have a question, you can check out the FAQs page to find answers to many of your questions. To contact the company for further support, you can find email and phone support on the company&#39;s website."]},"id":"f7cb6742-e7cc-45e6-8928-53e36a2fbc46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b7077386-3b90-4782-a272-5caf96a3c25e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bushnell Excursion HD is a good set of binoculars for experiencing the great outdoors a little closer and in more detail. This set of optics didn&#39;t perform as well in our survey as the very best binoculars, but it still produced decent, sharp images. Our participants found it slightly more difficult to adjust than other binoculars we reviewed, so it can take a little longer to get objects in focus initially. Overall, this is a rugged pair of binoculars that can survive the elements with no issue and is ideal for birdwatching, hunting or hiking on the trail."]},"id":"abd5dd25-eb40-4a4d-b251-813fd52ad43f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59783","url":"/bushnell-excursion-hd-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-19T17:36:00Z","datePublished":"2014-06-19T17:36:00Z","name":"Bushnell Excursion HD","synopsis":"The Bushnell Excursion HD binoculars lend themselves well to a wide range of uses, such as birdwatching, hunting and general outdoor activities.","review":{"rating":92,"verdict":"The Bushnell Excursion HD is a great set of binoculars to use outdoors and in the elements, with its rugged design and comfortable weight.
