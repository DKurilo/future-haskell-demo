It runs Mac’s OS X operating system, and the computer has a very small tower that’s only 1.4 inches high. The slim design fits into more locations in your home than computers with larger towers. It has 802.11n Wi-Fi wireless networking and Bluetooth 4.0 technology, adding to its portable and adaptive nature.","The base configuration of the Mac Mini comes with a 3rd generation Intel i5 processor, with the option to upgrade to a 3rd generation Intel i7 processor. While these chips provide enough power for most home computer functions, they are a generation behind the Intel processors found in similar PCs. The processing speed of the Mac Mini, 2.3-2.6Ghz, is also much lower than other home computers.","The Mac Mini does give better options with the configuration of the hard drive storage. Despite the small size of the tower, you have the option of dual hard drives. The base configuration has a 500GB, 5,400 rpm hard drive, but you can upgrade up to two 1TB, 5,400 rpm hard drives. This will give your enough storage for a good-sized home media library. You also have the option with the Mac Mini to include one or two 256GB solid-state drives (SSDs), which provide much higher data transfer rates than traditional hard drives.","There are fewer ports on the Mac Mini than on other similar desktop computers, but you still get an HDMI output, four USB 3.0 ports, a FireWire port and a memory card reader. You can also take advantage of the Thunderbolt port included on the Mac Mini, which offers transfer rates up to 10Gbps from compatible devices, faster than many internal disk drives. There is no DVD optical drive included with the Mac Mini. You can opt to include a USB optical drive, but it is only an 8x drive, so it writes data much more slowly than drives on other computer systems we reviewed.","The Mac Mini comes with a one-year limited warranty that covers any manufacturer&#39;s defects. AppleCare phone support is included for 90 days with the purchase of the Mac Mini. If you would like additional support after the 90 days, you may purchase up to three years or extended support."]},"id":"d6fbeb17-ff4b-47c6-844e-45edaac5c5b8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1a384f85-59ef-49d9-98cc-9708f8303e06","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While you don&#39;t get the processing performance you would with the best personal home computers, the Mac Mini does have enough power to make it a reasonable alternative to basic Windows-based PCs.
