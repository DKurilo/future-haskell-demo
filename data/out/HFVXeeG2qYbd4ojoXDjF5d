HobbyZone&#39;s Anti-Crash Technology helps stabilize your plane and pulls you out of dangerous dives, making it easier for you to focus on the basic maneuvers. This RC plane comes with everything you need to start flying, including a Spektrum DX4e transmitter, AA batteries for the transmitter, an 11.1V 1300mAh lithium-polymer battery for the plane, a charger and a &#34;Learn to Fly&#34; DVD. With a wingspan of over 47 inches, this RC airplane is larger than most beginner planes. This makes the plane subject to oversize shipping fees. Despite its size, assembly is simple and takes less than an hour. Once you get up in the air, you have up to 12 minutes of flight time on each battery charge.","The Super Cubs&#39; Anti-Crash Technology setting can be helpful. However, once you have mastered the basic controls, you’ll likely want to just turn it off and leave it off. The setting will try to correct when you are doing maneuvers that are more sophisticated and can lead to serious crash landings because you no longer have control. It is a good teaching aid, but once you don&#39;t need it anymore, go ahead and turn it off.","The Super Cub DSM comes with a brushed motor. Brushed motors are inexpensive, but they are inefficient. Some modelers will upgrade to a brushless motor, but the brushed motor can handle basic flight patterns and even power through a few tricks. The brushed motor is good for beginners because it is a little slower; however, if you&#39;re a more advanced flyer, go ahead, pick up a good brushless motor and see the positive difference it makes in the flight characteristics.","A large part of the remote control plane hobby is the maintenance and repairs that come with it. You should expect to replace a few parts, and you can find these online or at your local hobby shop. It isn’t uncommon to go through propellers  with some level of regularity, and you’ll want to purchase some additional cowlings to cover the motor. When you&#39;re first learning how to fly, there will be a lot of wear and tear on the body of the plane. However, as you gain experience, these repairs will become less common.","The 2.4GHz transmitter looks and functions more like a hobby-grade transmitter. Some of the other beginner RC airplanes have transmitters that look toy-like, whereas this follows the more traditional look and feel. The transmitter is easy to use and includes the switch to activate or deactivate the Anti-Crash Technology. It is a four-channel transmitter, so once you have progressed far enough you can add ailerons to your plane for added control. To get you started as fast as possible, the AA batteries for the transmitter are included in the ready-to-fly kit."]},"id":"ffcc93f0-3bff-4f6a-a232-8ef2fbba10be","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"326fcf7d-93f2-467b-a5f7-8192f6d122ca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, this is good beginner RC plane because it is easy to fly.
