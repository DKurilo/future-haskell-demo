The lack of a manual and user forums is disappointing. However, the FAQs and tutorials have a decent amount of information, and you should turn there first if you have questions or issues. If you still need help, you can contact the support team through an email form. While we would like to see better help and support for D3DGear, what&#39;s available will likely be sufficient for most users.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52444-d3dgear9.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUj4ya8Agx5CYati7wFsXE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"aUj4ya8Agx5CYati7wFsXE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUj4ya8Agx5CYati7wFsXE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"cdc05c04-773b-4d29-871c-6b7dff131679","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" "]},"id":"8d4d5af4-c524-489d-a50c-a9a2f2fec3e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0afe3e09-a23c-4ef7-a4af-ca0f95b7426e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["D3DGear offers powerful tools that are easy to use and can handle just about anything you need it to do.
