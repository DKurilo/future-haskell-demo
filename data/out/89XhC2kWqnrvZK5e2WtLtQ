The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\"><em>Meat Grinders here</em></a><em>.</em>","Whether you regularly eat venison, pork, chicken, beef or ham, the Deni 3500 is an ideal accessory for any home kitchen. The <a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\">meat grinder</a> aids you in creating a perfect blend of ground meat for any recipe, equipped with a motor that can grind up to three pounds of meat per minute of use. If you need a device to help make delicious hamburgers, savory sausage or minced meats, this device will prove itself as up to the task.","The Deni 3500 utilizes a powerful yet quiet one-horsepower motor. The efficiency of the motor becomes immediately evident with its ability to grind upward of three pounds of meat per minute. For tougher meats, this process may take longer, though you can expect to grind meat quickly and with minimal blocking. At the heart of the food grinder is a cutting blade and three die-cast plates that moderate the fineness of the cutting. The plates allow for three levels of grinding, from fine to medium to coarse, for a wide range of meat types and recipes.","One of the most common issues of meat grinders for home use is the frequency of blocking. Sometimes the grinderâ€™s blades grow dull over time and need sharpening or the meat is simply tough enough to require multiple passes with the cutting blade. In either case, blockages require you to disassemble the grinding parts to remove the problem meat. The Deni 3500 addresses this with a reverse action motor that not only frees blockages but also removes the need to dismantle the device to clear out food.","As one of the best meat grinders on the market, the device gains much of its popularity from its durable and easy-to-disassemble parts. When not in use, you can quickly remove the plate, blade and screw for easy cleaning and storage. Provided you thoroughly clean and dry each of the accessories, the pieces will avoid rust and provide years of reliable use for whether you use the grinder on a daily or monthly basis.","The Deni 3500 delivers a professional level of performance ideal for your home kitchen. The device assists in delivering commercial-quality meat grinding without the high price tag. The stainless steel meat grinder provides an incredible level of power and is capable of grinding up to 20 pounds of meat within 30 minutes. Whether you want a fine, medium or course grind, the device comes with all of the accessories needed to make healthy and tasty ground meat."]},"id":"a7af93b5-b462-4cc7-bb40-8f51ad03e103","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59255","url":"/deni-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-31T14:01:06Z","datePublished":"2014-03-31T14:01:06Z","name":"Deni 3500","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
