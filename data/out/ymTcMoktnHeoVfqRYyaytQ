The XPO2 by Invacare does just that, so you won’t have to reset your preferences every time you turn it on. This feature is sure to save you frustration, as well as time. Additionally, it runs quietly so you can use it at night or anywhere during the day.","With five pulse flow settings, you can find one that works ideally for you. With its integrated Sensi-Pulse technology, you’ll get the right quantity of oxygen each breath, keeping you saturated. Assuming an average pulse volume of 20 breaths per minute, you can expect to receive roughly 15-42 milliliters of oxygen.","Since the concentrator has been approved by the FAA, you can take it with you on domestic flights, if needed. The device weighs about 6 pounds, making it easy to carry around, especially since it comes with a black nylon carrying case. But it still weighs pounds more than the <a href=\"/inogen-review\">Inogen One G4</a> and the <a href=\"/caire-medical-review\">Caire Medical Airsep Focus</a>. It measures 10 inches tall, 7 inches wide and 4 inches deep, and while there are small concentrators, it&#39;s still compact enough to be discreet. It’s even small enough to fit underneath the seat in front of you on an airplane.","At its lowest setting, the built-in battery can last for 2.5-3.5 hours. Of course, if you run it at a higher flow rate, it won&#39;t last as long. To fully recharge the battery, it takes approximately four hours. You can also purchase an external supplemental battery, which weighs just 1.3 pounds and can provide you with an additional 2.5 hours of run time.","The interface is easy to use with simple and clearly labeled buttons. Here you can increase or decrease your flow rate, view the battery status and gauge, and even review alarms, which will notify you anytime there’s an issue with the device.","Invacare’s XPO2 portable oxygen concentrator can save you time and frustration with its easy-to-use interface and its ability to remember your specific settings even when you’ve turned it off. Its small size and lightweight, compact build make it easy to tote around, and its supplemental external battery can easily provide you with a few extra hours of run time when needed."]},"id":"9ef8b246-75a0-4bd5-87fe-55608c77bcc5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68645","url":"/invacare-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alexander-eriksen","url":"/author/alexander-eriksen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Alexander Eriksen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"hwemruvZsTXWMqRixKJ49","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T20:44:57Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T20:44:57Z","name":"Invacare XPO2","synopsis":"When you’re using an oxygen concentrator on a regular basis, it’s always helpful if it can retain certain settings you spent time creating.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"When you’re using an oxygen concentrator on a regular basis, it’s always helpful if it can retain certain settings you spent time creating.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-28T20:44:57Z","id":"ymTcMoktnHeoVfqRYyaytQ","meta":{"title":"Invacare XPO2 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Invacare XPO2 portable oxygen concentrator remembers your previous settings and has an easy-to-use interface.
