Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because the developer no longer supports this product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","PC Tools Internet Security Suite is an all-in-one security solution that includes virus protection, antispyware, identity protection, antispam, website ratings and file transfer protection. A single license purchase can protect up to three PCs or laptops for one year. However, we researched their most recent third-party test results and did not see the kind of scores we were looking to find in a top <a href=\"/best-internet-security-suites-software\">internet security</a> product.","Though we download and install all of the internet security suites in our own test labs, we also check third-party test results since they can cover a range of years and testing methods to help give us an overall view of how well a security product performs. Unfortunately, PC Tools has not tested well recently. There is no VB100 certification for this product since 2008. We cannot say with confidence that this security software will reliably secure your PC or laptop.","The actual security suite does include the most common components of a full security suite such as file scanning, website ratings, behavior monitors, antispyware, rootkit protection, a browser guard and email protection. It provides helpful site reports that can inform you in advance about the reputation of a website, including download experiences. PC Tools Internet Security also provides identity protection by recognizing phishing scams, blocking cookies and preventing intrusion. To improve performance it also has optional game and fullscreen modes that can pause or delay scans when the PC is in fullscreen mode. This suite does not include parental controls.","We did not encounter major challenges installing and configuring this security software; however, should you need assistance you can contact PC Tools through your account. They do not post customer support phone numbers or email addresses in an obvious location. You have to submit your license number or the email address you registered with to view their contact information. They relate the average wait time for chat is 10 minutes, phone response is 30 minutes and email response is 24 to 72 hours. For indirect support you can view video tutorials, visit their forum, search user guides or read their features articles. You can also follow PC Tools on Twitter and Facebook."]},"id":"250950d9-832a-44aa-9407-cfb0c5739815","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8d465f90-5614-4a2e-bc58-bd315fb45366","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["So many internet security suites outperform PC Tools that we cannot recommend this product."]},"id":"ca4a4f09-89a6-4510-a2e0-3c0cc31b743e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48638","url":"/pc-tools-internet-security-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-01-29T20:03:50Z","datePublished":"2010-01-29T20:03:50Z","name":"PC Tools Internet Security 2012","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because the developer no longer supports this product.","review":{"rating":76,"verdict":"Until we see PC Tools pass a string of third-party tests and provide consistent, reliable internet protection we cannot recommend this product.","pros":["The PC Tools Internet Security one-year subscription can protect up to three Windows-based computers."],"cons":["PC Tools has failed to pass several third-party antivirus tests in the last few years."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because the developer no longer supports this product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-01-29T20:03:50Z","id":"HbmbpeUJF7qKGUHG4qsfzF","meta":{"title":"PC Tools Internet Security 2012 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"How does PC Tools Internet Security measure up to the competition?
