The program has advanced editing and organization tools suitable for professional photographers but is maintained within a simple interface. In our testing, I was easily able to navigate the software and find the tools I needed to organize and edit photos.","This photo organizer allowed me to import photos from multiple sources. It is compatible with RAW files from most major cameras, which makes it more likely to fit your needs. Like most other programs, this software&#39;s nondestructive editing lets you experiment with edits without permanently altering your original image.","This program&#39;s strong sorting tools allowed me to easily organize and later find photos. AfterShot Pro automatically sorts your photos based on standard markers, such as name, date and tags, or you can manually sort your photos using advanced data like ISO, shutter speed and aperture. You can take your sorting one step further by employing flags, star ratings and color-coding to designate favorites and rejects, as well as grouping themed photos together.","You can also organize your photos by location. Unlike most photo management software, this program does not tag pictures on a map. Instead, you have to manually fill in fields about image location in metadata tabs. The most significant file management features I felt it lacked were face tagging and the ability to lock albums. If you&#39;d prefer a program that lets you password-protect your images and albums, you might want to consider <a href=\"/magix-photo-manager-review\">Photo Manager Deluxe</a>.","AfterShot Pro 3 has sets of premade keywords – including topics, genres and subjects, – you can use. I used a variety of tags that include genres like portraits and underwater, as well as tags that mark project status – for example, retouched, in progress, archived or finished. The software even branches off into subcategories to further organize your images.","If you like to share your photos with others in a variety of ways, this might not be the program for you. This photo manager software lacks sharing capabilities. I couldn&#39;t directly connect to social media, send email or burn photos to a disc with this software. While I was able to create customizable slideshows, the program doesn&#39;t let you add music or customize transitions between slides.","AfterShot Pro has several standard and advanced editing tools. I used the cosmetic tools to touch up pictures and later used the clone and heal tool to remove unwanted objects. I was pleased with the results as well as how easy these tools were to use. You can also find advanced editing tools under the Color, Tone, Detail and Metadata tabs. I used these tools to adjust color balance, white balance, exposure, contrast and clarity. I found this program&#39;s distortion correction tools especially nice.","Corel offers several different support options. Tutorials and FAQs are on its website, as well as contact information for technical support’s phone and email address. The website also has a live chat option if you want faster responses.","Pros can learn a lot from Corel AfterShot Pro’s advanced editing, metadata and tagging tools. While this software is more suitable for professional or prosumer photographers, the clean interface and intuitive design still helps beginners navigate the software and learn how to edit and organize photos."]},"id":"09b2742a-2a79-4774-b9fc-1fe170800979","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69845","url":"/aftershot-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-04-11T13:33:11Z","datePublished":"2018-04-11T13:33:11Z","name":"AfterShot Pro 3","synopsis":"AfterShot Pro 3 is good photo manager software for beginning and experienced users.
