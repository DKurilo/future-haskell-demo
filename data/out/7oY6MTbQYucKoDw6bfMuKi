Your children can adjust white balance and shutter speed if they want to be more adventurous in their photo taking. However, this little kids camera is designed for fun!","This child&#39;s camera is lightweight, only weighing 8 ounces, and is only 3 inches long. However, it is a lot tougher than it looks. The plastic used in making the Disney Appclix iPad Digital Camera is pretty thick. It&#39;s not as durable as the best kids digital cameras, but it will be able to handle a few bumps.","The image resolution of this camera is an amazing 7 megapixels. This is among the best image resolution of all the kids digital cameras we reviewed, which makes printing and sharing your child&#39;s photography more exciting.","You can view all the images your child snaps directly on the camera, since it comes with a 1.5-inch view screen. You can also upload the pictures onto your iPad. One great design feature of the Disney Appclix iPad Digital Camera is the attached USB connector. The connector is stored within the body of the camera and simply slides out when you are ready to connect the camera. This camera can only connect to an iPad, however.","Once connected, you can use the free Disney photo editing app available for download from the App Store. This app allows your child to edit photos and add photo effects to make each photo truly unique.","The Disney Appclix iPad Digital Camera comes in several designs that are appealing to both little and big kids. Some of the designs you can choose from are Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Disney Princesses, Tinkerbell, and Phineas and Ferb.","Since the Disney Appclix iPad camera is made by Sakar, there are some good support options available. Both email and telephone support are available. You can access the user guide from the Sakar website. You will also get a one-year warranty on your child&#39;s camera."]},"id":"a75d105e-4026-4219-84a8-f5748609aac8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"460b5e5c-82c4-4b57-b794-fe5780fda852","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Disney Appclix iPad Digital Camera has a lot of fun features and options, though you will have to connect to your iPad to access most of them.
