The company also sells swim spas. Master Spas is one of the largest <a href=\"/best-hot-tubs\">hot tub manufacturers</a>, and its products are all built in the U.S. as well. ","<strong>Pricing</strong>","Master Spas does not list any prices, but the site does allow you to “shop by price”. The site features an undefined system of dollar signs, where more dollar signs equal more expensive. Assuming Master Spas’ system is in line with other hot tub manufacturers’ pricing ranges, Master Spas has six entry-level models, seven mid-level models, five premium models and three luxury models. This spread places more spa models in the less expensive entry- and mid-level ranges than other companies we evaluated, including <a href=\"/sundance-spas-review\">Sundance Spas</a>.","<strong>Models and Collections</strong>","Master Spas has four collections: Clarity, Healthy Living, Twilight and the Michael Phelps Legend Series. We liked the size varieties available in each range and at each price point. For example, the Healthy Living and Twilight lines both have models made for as few as two or as many as eight adults. ","<strong>Jets</strong>","Master Spas has eight spa jet types: massage, pulsating, rotating, pinpoint, directional, cluster, whirlpool and adjustable. Three jet types are used in the Clarity line, seven in the Healthy Living and Twilight lines, and all eight types are available for the MP Legend line. There are between 16 and 72 jets in each tub. Each tub comes standard with a MasterForce Bio-Magnetic Therapy seat and a StressRelief Neck and Shoulder Seat. The Bio-Magnetic seat uses magnet therapy along pressure points in your neck and shoulders. Master Spas is the only hot tub company we reviewed that uses magnet therapy in its products in addition to hydrotherapy. The StressRelief seat includes a headrest and uses downward-facing jets to relieve tension in your neck and shoulders. Master Spas also has a MasterBlaster Foot Therapy jet system available for its two higher-tier lines, which uses 28 nozzles in two jets for a reflexology-inspired foot massage.","<strong>Sanitation</strong>","Master Spas uses its EcoPur Charge Filtration and Ozone systems in all hot tubs, with optional upgrades to its Mast3rPur System and QuietFlo Water Care System, except in the Clarity line. The EcoPur Charge system uses copper and zinc to purify the water and filter out dirt and microorganisms. The Mast3rPur system combines this filter with ozone and UV-C light sanitation as well.","<strong>Additional Features</strong>","All of Master Spas’ products have a standard waterfall feature and light system. You can also add the Fusion Air sound system, Wi-Fi capabilities and mobile app compatibility to any hot tub model. Master Spas hot tubs also include a noise reduction system to decrease pump and motor vibrations by more than 150 percent, compared to industry standards, for a more peaceful soak. ","Master Spas uses a coated wood frame, acrylic shell and icynene full-foam insulation standard in all of its spas, with the option to upgrade to a vac-formed ABS pan bottom except in the MP Legend line, where this feature is standard."]},"id":"89f9d69d-79b1-4ee3-a296-3705999fa588","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8fe99a84-3e7c-4c83-9914-fa91b3457a75","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" Master Spas is a good hot tub manufacturer that builds all products in the U.S. It offers a good variety of spas, especially in the entry and mid-level range, though the best features like the MasterBlaster foot massage system are only available at higher price tiers."]},"id":"0c353be7-6b1e-4f50-96af-ad22d94071ad","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60799","url":"/master-spas-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-15T17:47:34Z","datePublished":"2014-10-15T17:47:34Z","name":"Master Spas","synopsis":"Master Spas has 21 hot tub models across its four model lines, which includes its Michael Phelps Legend series.
