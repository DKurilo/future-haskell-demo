They&#39;re designed to fit easily into your pocket so that you&#39;ll always have them with you.","Modern flagship smartphones tend to have better video quality than pocket camcorders, but they&#39;re expensive and often tied to a two-year contract. Pocket camcorders are relatively cheap and often are shockproof and waterproof. They&#39;re ideal for a child too young for a smartphone, or simply as a backup to the camera on your smartphone.","Our three favorite pocket camcorders are the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-phone-cameras,review-2272.html\">Polaroid iD820</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-phone-cameras,review-2272.html\">GE DV1</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-phone-cameras,review-2272.html\">HTC RE</a>. Keep reading to learn more about these small video cameras, or check out our additional <a href=\"/electronics\">articles on pocket camcorders</a>.","<strong>Pocket Camcorder: What to Look For</strong>","Pocket camcorders all have the same purpose, but they vary greatly in form and design. We broke down pocket camcorders according to the following criteria.","<strong>Video/Image Quality</strong><br/>Image quality is defined by two factors: frame rate and resolution. Resolution \tmeasures the amount of pixels used to compose an image. The higher the resolution, the \tmore detailed the image will be, especially when you zoom in on the picture. Look for a \tcamera with a resolution of at least 1080p.","Frame rate is most commonly measured in frames per second. Look for a camera that   has the ability to shoot video at 60 fps. This will result in a picture that shows the details of quick movements and can be edited into slow motion.","Another thing to look for is image stabilization. This reduces the shaking that commonly ruins home movies, meaning the image will be stable even if you are moving or laughing while filming.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"32147bb0-11aa-4e00-83f0-258caa200d63","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You should also look for a camera with an HDMI output. This enables you to easily \tdisplay your footage on your HDTV.","<strong>Memory/Ports</strong><br/>Pocket camcorders store video on a SD card, which you can eject and insert into a computer. The best pocket camcorders have a built-in USB arm, which enables you to easily connect the entire camera to a computer.","Look for a pocket camcorder that can accept an SD card with up to 32GB of storage. This allows you to store a few hours of footage on the card.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Look for a company that offers phone support. When you&#39;re having trouble with a product, there is no substitute for a helpful phone representative. Additionally, look for a pocket camcorder made by a company that has social media support. Sometimes, this is the quickest way to contact a company&#39;s support team.","A pocket camcorder can help you capture some of life&#39;s moments that you would otherwise miss or forget. What&#39;s more, they&#39;re affordable and have many uses."]},"id":"58212f33-7a72-48a6-ba22-09e42fdb59df","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9f410041-abf7-4caa-bb9f-e3933b4ef8fc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RFA0V4/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|62101[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Polaroid iD820</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044DEEJC/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|56213[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">GE DV1</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NW3AMY6/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|56211[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">HTC RE</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SB1X1C/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|62104[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Coleman CVW9HD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KZ3LW4A/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|56215[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Vivitar DVR 925HD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008B46JV6/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|62105[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Vivitar DVR 426HD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBLJAVC/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|62106[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Bell &amp; Howell Take 1 HD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JIYNOO/?&tag=ttr_pocket_camcorders-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|498[art|NA[pid|56219[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Vivitar DVR 410</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"9b030c0e-4005-4538-aad0-912f445f5e82","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_498","url":"/best-pocket-camcorders","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-13T15:24:45Z","datePublished":"2013-07-22T18:37:38Z","name":"Pocket Camcorder","synopsis":"Pocket camcorders are video cameras designed to be unobtrusive enough to be carried everywhere.
