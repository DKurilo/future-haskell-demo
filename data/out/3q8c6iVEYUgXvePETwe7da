This is mainly because people have obligations during the day to spend time with friends, family and run errands. Keeping a nocturnal schedule can exhaust employees and lead to low productivity. If night shifts are necessary, try to find people that can adjust their life to unusual hours and maintain adequate rest.","<b>Try Temporary Changes and Ask for Feedback</b>","When you make a change in employees&#39; schedules, start out with a trial period. Afterwards, ask for employees&#39; input so you can come up with the best schedule to fit their and the company&#39;s needs.","<b>Keep Regular and Predictable Schedules</b>","Once an optimal schedule is established, keep it regular and predictable. This will not only benefit the employees but will also benefit the company. Employees will enjoy being able to plan vacations and family functions in advance, and the company won&#39;t have to juggle schedules every couple of weeks.","<b>Use Time Tracking Computer Software</b>","<a href=\"index.html\">Time tracking and management software</a> can easily track all of your employees&#39; schedules making it easy to regulate shift hours. The software can also provide valuable reports so you can make informed executive decisions when it comes to employee scheduling.","<b>Avoid Changing Employees Schedules Without a  Break in Between</b>","Changing an employee from a night shift to a day shift or visa versa can be challenging, both physically and mentally. Consider giving employees an adjustment period of at least 48 hours in between drastic schedule changes.","<b>Allow Employees One or Two Free Weekends Each Month</b>","Everyone needs time to spend with their families, to get out of town for the weekend or to catch up on household chores. Employees who generally work weekends should be given a weekend off occasionally. They will value the time off, ask for less time off and come back ready to work without feeling as if they have been denied the opportunity to have a &#39;normal&#39; life."]},"id":"7a84717f-47bd-4f62-bbc2-3562910f086e","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Having happy and healthy shift workers is essential to running a profitable, productive business.
