Its <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">flip down DVD players</a> let you turn your vehicle into an entertainment system on the go. The wireless remote, wireless headphones and infrared transmitters ensure that passengers in the back seat are quiet and entertained on long road trips â€“ but Boss Audio goes further with its overhead DVD players.","You can pack your DVD collection and watch your favorite movies on long car rides with a Boss Audio roof-mounted DVD player. Each one also includes a set of wireless headphones and an infrared transmitter, which lets two people in the back watch a movie quietly and not disturb other riders with the movie audio. However, if the entire road-tripping crew wants to hear the movie, you can set up your overhead DVD player to use the FM transmitter and broadcast the audio through your vehicle&#39;s speakers.","Additional inputs and outputs let you hook up other media devices to your Boss Audio flip down DVD player. You can plug into A/V, USB and SD inputs to play other movies or media from your handheld devices. If you have an internet connection, you can even stream movies from online sources for the whole back-seat group to watch.","Each Boss Audio overhead DVD player includes a widescreen monitor from 10.1 inches to 12.1 inches, and all of them swivel so you can get just the right viewing angle. When it&#39;s not in operation, you can flip the monitor back up and out of the way.","The housing for each flip down DVD player comes in a few different colors: black, silver or taupe. The design of Boss Audio&#39;s in-car DVD players is meant to work with any vehicle&#39;s interior, and each one includes dome lights for illuminating the console and the back of the vehicle. The remote control that comes with each Boss Audio overhead DVD player lets you easily control the system with the press of a button.","Boss Audio flip down DVD players let you screen your favorite movies from your DVD collection on your road trip, but that&#39;s not all. You can also hook up another media device to play other movies, TV shows or videos."]},"id":"4d4886d8-17c1-4ec1-98a2-dea6076d790e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50597","url":"/boss-audio-systems-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-31T14:26:13Z","datePublished":"2010-08-31T14:26:13Z","name":"Boss Audio","synopsis":"Boss Audio Systems is well known for its mobile audio equipment, but it also dabbles in mobile video entertainment.
