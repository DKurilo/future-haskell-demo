Expert advice for creating an investment portfolio lets you mitigate some risks and ensure a comfortable retirement. Companies offering retirement investment services include <a href=\"/fidelity-investments-review\">Fidelity Investments</a>, <a href=\"/prudential-review\">Prudential</a> and <a href=\"/charles-schwab-review\">Charles Schwab</a>. You can also check out our articles on retirement investment services for more information.","Retirement investment companies might broker transactions for consumers, including IRA rollovers and stock purchases. Other common services include developing portfolios, analyzing performance for optimal money-management decisions and working with clients to disburse funds during retirement.","<strong>Retirement Investment Companies: What to Look For</strong>","Financial security in the post-working years is important to anyone, and selecting a retirement investment company to handle your money can be stressful. Understanding your own needs and how an investment firm can meet those needs might reduce anxiety when comparing companies. Some things to consider include the company&#39;s history, fees and income disbursement options.","<strong>Positive Performance History</strong><br/>Probably the top consideration when deciding where to invest money for retirement is whether the investment firm has a strong track record with past investments. You don&#39;t have to take the salesperson&#39;s word regarding a company&#39;s performance history Â  the company should provide you with prospectuses detailing the performance of the funds and accounts it deals with. You can also find information about fund investments online.","<strong>Fees &amp; Expenses</strong><br/>Investment firms and funds charge a variety of fees for retirement planning. Some advisers deliver services based solely on a fee structure or an hourly rate, while others charge a commission on each transaction. Commissions for top companies in the niche tend to be similar, but even a small difference in percentage can result in a large difference in income over the years. When comparing financial services for your retirement, ensure that any fees and expenses are backed by valuable solutions and assistance.","<strong>Customized Income Options</strong><br/>Often, the retirement service you choose to build your wealth with is also the firm that handles how you get paid during the later years. Look for a company that offers custom options, so your income isn&#39;t limited to a single disbursement situation. Annuities, systemic payouts or withdrawals, lump-sum payments and minimum distributions are some income options. If you plan to use estate vehicles, such as trusts, to protect retirement assets, make sure you select a firm that is willing to work with your plans.","<strong>Service Options</strong><br/>Many individuals like the personalized service that comes with a local office, and not every retirement company offers offices in all cities. If you want to work face-to-face with an adviser, check for local offices during your research. Other service options include phone advising, online and self-service. Self-service is a good additional option no matter what service you select, as it lets you make changes to your disbursements or view account progress anytime.","Selecting a retirement investment adviser or firm is a serious decision. Since it can impact your financial stability and comfort later in life, it is important to take the time to research all options."]},"id":"b385689e-ea85-47b4-ad52-cf33ade1d5c9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"bcead0cb-45aa-4c70-a5c4-6bc22723ba8b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.americanfunds.com/individual/planning/retirement-planning.html\">American Funds</a>","<a href=\"http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/accounts/small_business_retirement/company_retirement_account\">Charles Schwab</a>","<a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/open-account/overview\">Fidelity Investments</a>","<a href=\"https://www.principal.com/retirement/ind/index.htm?WT.ac=homePSIndRetirement\">Principal Financial Group</a>","<a href=\"http://www.prudential.com/view/page/public/16326\">Prudential</a>","<a href=\"http://individual.troweprice.com/public/Retail/Retirement\">T.
