It has some of the lowest commissions we saw and has a strong platform with useful tools for monitoring and tracking stocks.","Unlike most of the other platforms we reviewed, Interactive Brokers doesn’t charge a per-trade commission like <a href=\"/fidelity-review\">Fidelity</a> or <a href=\"/td-ameritrade-review\">TD Ameritrade</a>, instead it charges a per-share commission of $0.005, with a minimum commission of $1. This makes it good for high-volume trades. For example, a trade of 1,000 shares would have a commission of $5.00, which is comparable to the lowest commission from brokers charging a per-trade rate.","Options trading is also affordable, with a $0.70 per-contract fee. This is among the higher per-contract costs, but there are no exercise or assignment fees, so the costs balance out. There are also discounts available for high-volume traders.","Be aware that Interactive Brokers has higher limits for trading volume and account balances than other brokers. There’s no minimum amount to start trading, but you’ll be charged a $10 monthly inactivity fee if you have an account balance of less than $100,000 or if you have less than $10 worth of commissions. If you’re an infrequent trader, you may prefer another option that doesn’t charge inactivity fees.","Interactive Brokers has a useful platform, though beginners may find it busy. It doesn’t have as many charting tools as some of the other brokers we looked at, but it has the most commonly used indicators. It also has more options chain tools than most brokers, so you can execute more complicated options trades.","Because it is geared toward more experienced traders, Interactive Brokers offers more than the standard stocks, options and mutual funds. High-level traders with more appetite for risk can also trade foreign stocks, futures, forex and CFDs.","One area where Interactive Brokers is lacking is in the commission-free ETF area. It only offers 45, far fewer than other <a href=\"/best-online-stock-trading-brokers\">online stock brokerages</a>, which offer several hundred. It also doesn’t have a robo-advisor or automated investing program. This makes sense, because the platform geared to experienced traders who don’t do as much buy-and-hold investing as casual investors."]},"id":"05ad78f9-9a5f-4353-bd2f-48d98ffb3e70","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70260","url":"/interactive-broker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-26T15:36:28Z","datePublished":"2018-09-26T15:36:28Z","name":"Interactive Brokers","synopsis":"If you’re an experienced trader or make a high volume of trades, Interactive Brokers is a good choice.","review":{"verdict":"Interactive Brokers has many useful tools and low commissions, but its trading volume requirements make it best suited to high-volume traders.","pros":["Has some of the lowest commissions we saw."],"cons":["The balance minimums are high, and there are trading frequency requirements."]},"strapline":"If you’re an experienced trader or make a high volume of trades, Interactive Brokers is a good choice.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-09-26T15:36:28Z","id":"qiSZw46XsqC5Hvk64GXB6e","meta":{"title":"Interactive Brokers Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
