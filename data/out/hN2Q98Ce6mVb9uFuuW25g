It’s ideally suited for areas with high ceilings. This smoke detector also works well in environments that experience temperature extremes, as it can stand up to temperatures from minus 22 degrees to 131 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, a smoke alarm has a temperature range between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.","To detect smoke, the System Sensor BEAM 1224 uses a reflected beam instead of a smoke chamber like other types of smoke alarms. This helps the smoke alarm provide coverage of a large area with minimal cost. It has a transmitter/receiver unit and an 8-inch reflector. When smoke enters the area between the unit and the reflector, it causes a reduction in the signal. The alarm activates when the smoke level reaches a predetermined threshold that you choose with the transmitter/receiver unit. You can test and reset the alarm with switches on the unit, but you can only access the local reset button by removing an outer trim ring, which can be difficult if it&#39;s installed on a high ceiling.","As with many beam smoke detectors, there are several sensitivity settings. This smoke detector has six sensitivity levels you can choose from. There are four standard sensitivity selections and two additional settings, in which the smoke detector automatically adjusts its sensitivity. The unit uses a software algorithm to find the optimum sensitivity for the environment it’s in.","The System Sensor BEAM 1224 measures 10 inches tall and 7.5 inches wide, and has a depth of 3.3 inches. You can paint the trim ring with enamel or acrylic paints so the smoke detector blends in easily. As with other hard-wired smoke detectors, a qualified electrician should install it.","There are three LEDs on this smoke alarm to let you know its status. In normal or standby mode, a green LED flashes every five seconds. A solid red LED indicates an alarm and a blinking yellow LED indicates trouble. The yellow LED blinks in specific patterns to help diagnose the issue.","The System Sensor BEAM 1224 is designed to work well in open areas with high ceilings. With adjustable sensitivity settings, you can find the optimal sensitivity for the area where the unit is mounted. This smoke detector&#39;s price point is significantly higher than other smoke alarms, but it is a good choice if you’re looking for a reliable fire detection for high ceilings."]},"id":"d6d04ede-b92d-435f-83a1-ae58822bdf0a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60830","url":"/system-sensor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-15T21:41:38Z","datePublished":"2014-10-15T21:41:38Z","name":"System Sensor BEAM 1224","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
