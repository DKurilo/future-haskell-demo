Instead, it is a matter of combining multiple approaches with an ever-changing plan to engage and attract consumers. Crucial to these approaches is reducing unsubscribes and increasing the relevance of your marketing message. The following seven tips outline some industry best practices for tightening your <a href=\"/money/small-business\">email marketing</a> strategies.","<strong>Drive traffic through online interactions</strong><br/>Before you can convert subscribers into sales opportunities, you must first get them to subscribe. A popular strategy to increase awareness of your brand is guest blogging. Rather than trying to organically increase traffic to your email list, you can instead use existing digital spaces with dedicated followings to create content that establishes you as a thought leader in your industry. Many professional blogs are willing to accept guest bloggers, provided that the content of your post is useful information rather than just a sales pitch."]},"id":"d9309391-42b5-4327-ac1d-d8fc908b607a","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Convert visitors by offering incentives</strong><br/>Once you begin attracting traffic to your website, you need to incentivize visitors to actually give their email to you. This is called permission-based marketing, where you offer consumers a prize or benefit in return for them sharing their email. This can be anything from free product samples to coupons, but it must be something a consumer can actually use or immediately benefit from.","<strong>Make your intentions clear</strong><br/>To further encourage website traffic to join your email lists, explain the value of signing up. Let subscribers know what interactions they ll receive from your company as part of this list. When consumers know they ll receive something specific, like deals, promotions and information, then they ll be more likely to sign up.","<strong>Engage subscribers by personalizing interactions</strong><br/>Many consumers have strong reservations about joining email marketing lists because of how impersonal they are. And once you do convince them to subscribe, you have a very limited window in which to keep their attention. Rather than sending generic emails to all of your subscribers, you should instead engage in strategies of reaching the right people with the right marketing emails.","<strong>Give your message a human personality<br/></strong>Email marketing messages shouldn t sound like press releases, but rather like a message written by an actual person. Provide copy to your email subscribers that is relatable and relevant to their needs, written in language that sounds personal.","<strong>Create strong subject lines</strong><br/>When sending emails, you want to tease the content of your email, but keep the subject line short. Depending on your audience, many email opens occur on mobile devices with a limited viewing screen. The key to a strong subject line is to avoid spamming techniques, such as using all caps.","<strong>Test your strategies</strong><br/>Rather than just sending emails with the latest deals, you should create a plan of strategies with clear goals and objectives. For example, you might try sending emails with the goal of gaining additional information about subscribers. In other instances, you may simply want to test ways of increasing interaction with your email list. Either way, test strategies so you can change how you use your email list to increase the chances of subscriber interactions."]},"id":"681e6fb5-1e24-46ff-84c0-5cdfb6a7d8cf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9186","url":"/7-things-you-should-know-about-building-your-email-marketing-list","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-27T04:51:45Z","datePublished":"2015-02-27T04:51:45Z","name":"7 Things You Should Know About Building Your Email Marketing List","synopsis":"Building your email lists is a complex strategy where no one winning formula exists.","review":{},"strapline":"Building your email lists is a complex strategy where no one winning formula exists.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-27T05:02:15Z","id":"jZJrLrbvHVa8DbQ2hiunuQ","meta":{"title":"7 Things You Should Know About Building Your Email Marketing List","description":"Improve your company&#039;s email lists with our seven tips about email marketing.
