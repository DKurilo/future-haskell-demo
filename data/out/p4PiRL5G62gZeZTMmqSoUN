product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Epson Expression Home XP-430 Small-in-One is considerably larger than most of the mini printers and <a href=\"/best-compact-printers\">portable printers</a> in our review. Nonetheless, it’s a well-designed printer scanner combination that’s much smaller than the average printer. If your ideal small printer still includes premium features like a flatbed scanner and the ability to print directly from media cards, then the Epson Expression Home XP-430 Small-in-One may be the best home printer you can buy.","The Epson XP-430 measures 15.4 x 11.8 x 5.7 inches, which is larger than most compact printers but is still on the small side for a regular inkjet. This is most clearly seen in its weight; the 9-pound XP-430 is considerably lighter than home and office printers, which can weigh 20 pounds or more. That said, it is far from portable and is meant for stationary use in a home or office. If you&#39;re looking for a more mobile printer with the same scanning and copying features and a battery pack, you might try the <a href=\"/hp-officejet-all-in-one-review\">HP OfficeJet All-in-One 250</a>.","However, this color inkjet printer has pretty good print quality. In our print tests, its print samples had minimal spotting, but we did see a few alignment issues – instances where the print head didn’t line up quite right with each pass, resulting in uneven edges and bands of color. It also seemed to struggle with the color mix for several shades, most notably purple. While every inkjet printer produces mixed colors that can be seen as a pattern of dots under high magnification, the XP-430 produced greens and purples that were visibly speckled to the naked eye. Quality aside, the printer’s speed was pretty good, printing black-and-white documents at a rate of 7.69 pages per minute. It printed color documents noticeably slower at 3.4 pages per minute.","The XP-430 uses Epson’s DuraBrite pigment inks, with four individual ink cartridges (black, cyan, magenta and yellow). The standard-size cartridges break down to a per-page printing cost of 26 cents, which is high for both a compact printer and a standard inkjet printer – full-size inkjet printers have an average printing cost of roughly 15 cents a page. Epson’s high-capacity cartridges are much more affordable; they have higher page yields, so the average cost is 18 cents per page.","The printer’s all-in-one functionality is its biggest draw, and it easily surpasses the limitations of most mobile scanner printers. Its scan and copy functionality make it a Jack of all trades, especially when compared to most portable printer models, which only print. The XP-430 has a spacious flatbed scanner you can use to scan flat objects and pages from bound books, something you simply can’t do with a page-fed scroll scanner.","It also boasts all of the connectivity and compatibility you might want, with USB and Wi-Fi connections as well as support for mobile printing via Apple AirPrint, Google Cloud Print and Epson’s own iPrint mobile app. In addition, it has an SD card slot, so you can print directly from storage.","The Epson Expression Home XP-430 Small-in-One is covered with a standard one-year warranty. Epson also offers tech support via phone, live chat and email. Online you’ll find a number of helpful support materials, including an online manual and FAQs."]},"id":"66f81da0-1026-48b6-9be6-eee48bb6b5c5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e8d99642-99b0-4f10-9a26-335067cd7f92","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Epson Expression Home XP-430 Small-in-One may not be the diminutive size you expect when you look at mini printers, but the average compact printer can’t match its print quality and features.
