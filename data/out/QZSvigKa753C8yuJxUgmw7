This machine offers five levels of shiatsu massage so you can choose exactly what will make your tired feet feel terrific again.","Just like the <a href=\"/human-touch-review\">Human Touch Reflex Pro,</a> the Miko Foot Massager uses heat and air pressure. You slide your feet into the separate foot chambers to get the bottom and sides of your feet massaged and experience air pressure all over your feet. You can benefit from this machine’s deep kneading, gentle vibration and comfortable rolling effects. You operate it via an easy-to-use central control panel. You simply touch the buttons on top and select the type of massage you want.","You can personalize your <a href=\"/best-foot-massagers\">foot massage</a> by choosing such things as what level of kneading you’re looking for, the pressure you prefer and how warm you would like it to be so you get the most comfortable massage for whatever ailments your feet have. Overall, this foot massager is powerful and tends to offer an invigorating massage even on its lowest settings, which is a boon for people who stand on their feet all day. Some individuals with extremely sensitive feet might find it a bit too strong, but many people with weary feet will find it just right.","Aside from the benefits for your feet, the sensation of a foot massage from the Miko Shiatsu Home Foot Massager can relax your entire body as you sit back and let the machine do all the work. The heating levels on this machine are relatively low so there’s little chance your feet will become overheated. It also operates with a 15-minute timer, which works nicely if you become so relaxed you fall asleep in your favorite chair while enjoying a foot massage.","This 12-pound charcoal gray machine is compact so you can store it easily in a closet or under a bed or even a couch when you aren’t using it, similar to the <a href=\"/ucomfy-review\">uComfy Shiatsu Foot Massager with Heat.</a> In addition, the cloth cover is easy to remove and clean so you can rest assured your feet will be revived in fresh, clean chambers.","If you long to soothe your tired feet after a long day, the Miko Shiatsu Home Foot Massager has the adjustable features that provide kneading, pressure and warmth so your feet can feel wonderful again."]},"id":"20b94a12-60e9-4749-9aac-5402f3ab9953","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69539","url":"/miko-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-18T21:31:27Z","datePublished":"2017-07-18T21:31:27Z","name":"Miko Shiatsu Home Foot Massager","synopsis":"If you’re plagued with aching feet or poor foot circulation, the Miko Shiatsu Home Foot Massager can revive your feet and help you feel more relaxed and comfortable.","review":{"rating":87,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you’re plagued with aching feet or poor foot circulation, the Miko Shiatsu Home Foot Massager can revive your feet and help you feel more relaxed and comfortable.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","id":"QZSvigKa753C8yuJxUgmw7","meta":{"title":"Miko Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Miko Shiatsu Home Foot Massager provides relief and relaxation for tired, stressed muscles and improves circulation.
