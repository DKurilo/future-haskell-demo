Genius was certainly targeting the budget gaming wheel market with the Speed Wheel 6 MT, as there aren&#39;t as many features or customization options as we&#39;d like. Still, the Speed Wheel 6 MT provides you with a decent gaming experience.","We&#39;re impressed that Genius was able to pack force feedback into a budget gaming wheel. The Speed Wheel 6 MT is capable of simulating road conditions with its dual-motor force feedback. This is a major boon to the immersion factor that the best racing wheels bring to gaming. This PC steering wheel comes with two C-clamps to secure it. You don&#39;t want it to slip around while you&#39;re cornering in your racing games.","The Speed Wheel 6 MT comes with pedals that are pressure sensitive, which means that the harder you push, the faster you go. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t a clutch to go along with the pedals; however, there is a stick shift built into the wheel housing. This is impressive, but without a clutch, it almost feels like an afterthought. There is also a D-pad built into the wheel itself – useful for changing camera angles and a myriad of other things.","This racing wheel does many things right, but it&#39;s sorely lacking in the customization area. You can&#39;t adjust the feedback levels, which can get annoying if it&#39;s too strong or weak. There isn&#39;t any headset support or adjustment dials. The Speed Wheel 6 MT&#39;s overall design isn&#39;t very impressive, but it still beats using a keyboard and mouse or regular console controller when playing racing games."]},"id":"9e196d80-bdfd-4ece-af65-8f267a9c53c7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29bfcd66-2c77-4749-a7f8-2f36ca4ea266","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Speed Wheel 6 MT offers several useful features and is a decent PC steering wheel, it&#39;s certainly not the best PC steering wheel on the market.
