The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-electric-razors\">Electric Razors</a> here.</em>","The Remington R8150 electric razor has plenty of features that will create a close shave. The R8150&#39;s design is robust and appealing in its muted colors. The handle provides you with plenty of grip, and the shaving head is well-equipped to make your face look and feel smooth. A trimmer is incorporated into the design so you can do any fine-tuning after you finish shaving.","The R8150 is an excellent travel companion. After 90 minutes of charging, you can use this electric shaver for up to an hour before it runs out of energy. The LCD display will tell you how much battery life remains so you won&#39;t ever worry about the razor dying in the middle of a shave. Even if the battery is low, you still have a couple of options. A quick charge feature allows you to charge the device for a short time and get enough energy for a single shave. Or you can use the included cord for an unlimited amount of run time. This Remington is equipped with worldwide voltage, which means you can use virtually any outlet in the world to power it.","Everybody&#39;s face is different, and Remington designed the R8150 to be adaptable. The shaving head on this electric razor has three rotary blades that can move independently of each other, and the entire head can swivel a full 360 degrees. Whether you&#39;re shaving your chin or neck, this device will give you a complete shave. The blades in the shaving head are coated with titanium, which gives them enough strength to last for years of quality shaving.","Cleaning the R8150 is easy. All you have to do is flip the shaving head up and run water through it. The process is quick and painless. This electric razor is not completely waterproof, so you should be careful. Immersing it in water may cause damage or impair its functionality.","Ease of use, a close shave and comfort are hallmarks of the best electric shavers. The Remington R8150 is certainly easy to use with its intuitive design and quick cleaning. The shaving head ensures you will receive a close and complete shave. With its combined features, this electric razor is sure to give you several years of quality shaving."]},"id":"73f4e468-07ae-4380-987d-703c522c7be5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58055","url":"/remington-r-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T20:02:52Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T20:02:52Z","name":"Remington R8150","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":29,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-30T20:02:52Z","id":"UuWVFc4NHb6cPZWFVUknob","meta":{"title":"Remington R8150 Electric Razor Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
