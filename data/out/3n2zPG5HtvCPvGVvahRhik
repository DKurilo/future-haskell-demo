You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When you only have a narrow space to place your laundry machines, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity or efficiency for the sake of an <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">all-in-one washer dryer</a>, the Whirlpool LTE5243DQ may be for you. It’s a stackable appliance with separate washing and drying units to maximize your laundry cleaning capabilities.","If you can’t fit anything deeper than 27 inches, then the Whirlpool LTE5243DQ will prove immediately useful. It’s narrower than many combination washer dryer sets with a top-loading washer and front-loading dryer. The device measures 24 inches wide, 72 inches tall and 27 inches deep. Due to the compact nature of the appliance, however, its volume capacity suffers in comparison to other models, offering a mere 1.5 cubic feet for laundry loads.","As is common among stackable combo washer dryer sets, the appliances require the use of a 240-volt electrical outlet. Smaller all-in-one models typically work with standard wall outlets, but Whirlpool&#39;s device will require the availability of an outlet reserved for dryers. This is largely because it needs the added voltage for the dryer appliance in addition to the lower-energy washer.","In addition to running both devices at the same time, you also have several cleaning and drying options to pick from, depending on fabric types. The washer component offers five presets, whereas the dryer offers three temperature options. This isn’t as many as other devices, but still caters to most typical laundry.","While this washer dryer combo offers a rather restricted capacity for cleaning clothes, it ultimately saves you trips to the laundromat for everyday cleaning. However, it may prove incapable of handling larger jobs like bed sheets. When loading the washer, you&#39;ll want to take special care to evenly distribute your laundry, as the device unbalances quite easily.","The Whirlpool LTE5243DQ is one of the best washer dryer combos on the market. It proves itself an ideal device for confined living spaces where every inch counts. It&#39;s much more compact than other stackable appliances, and while this reduces its capacity, it doesn’t affect its ability to efficiently clean and dry."]},"id":"b2074ffe-bdfe-4492-a2d9-3837c4f4bb4d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58681","url":"/whirlpool-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-23T15:05:12Z","datePublished":"2014-01-23T15:05:12Z","name":"Whirlpool LTE5243DQ","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
