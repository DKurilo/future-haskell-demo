However, the video had noticeable distortions when recording moving objects, a problem we rarely encountered with other smart doorbells.","The best description of RemoBell&#39;s nighttime video is that it&#39;s strange. This is because the camera uses IR LEDs to illuminate objects in near darkness, but appears to record color video simultaneously, giving everything a pink-ish hue. This is consistent with the doorbell camera lacking a working IR cutoff filter, which normally blocks visible light in nighttime recordings. Other than the color issues at night, the clarity was still one of the best in our comparison."]},"id":"d125e33f-36e2-44f7-8071-ff7d23fc93b3","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/YRykkGtYYAi75jyGHFUaK7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/70140-remobell3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRykkGtYYAi75jyGHFUaK7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"YRykkGtYYAi75jyGHFUaK7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRykkGtYYAi75jyGHFUaK7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"90affb40-8962-4f87-9cb1-8a78fd337648","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is one of the more difficult video doorbells to use, and it&#39;s the only product we tested that lacks the ability to stream live video to a smartphone. In fact, the camera only records video when it detects motion or if someone presses the button, so you can&#39;t check in on your home remotely. Overall, the app isn&#39;t very intuitive, which can make it difficult to find and adjust the doorbell&#39;s settings.","RemoBell uses six rechargeable AA batteries with a battery life of four months, which is lower than the six to 12 months offer by Ring&#39;s battery-powered units. The AA batteries also contribute to the bulkiest design in our comparison, which may be difficult to fit on a narrow doorframe. This isn&#39;t as much of a problem since RemoBell is the only battery-powered video doorbell we tested that doesn&#39;t replace your existing doorbell, so you can install it on any flat surface with the included screws."]},"id":"f881d9cd-e6f7-4694-a0f6-b246a2a37a7e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/nSDX6vUqeUJVTBNGL45ksS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/70140-remobell2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nSDX6vUqeUJVTBNGL45ksS.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"nSDX6vUqeUJVTBNGL45ksS","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nSDX6vUqeUJVTBNGL45ksS.jpg","alt":""},"id":"446f4d57-fbfa-430c-af40-6eda9be05de4","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Installing RemoBell takes around 10 minutes, but you need to provide you own screwdriver, level and battery charger.
