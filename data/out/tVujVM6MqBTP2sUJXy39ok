It’s also relatively bulkier. At a width of 4 inches and depth of 2.7 inches, this unit is nearly twice as thick as some other devices, which will make it harder to store. Though bulky, the external design is simple and attractive. Unlike most competing sous vide circulators, this unit is available in black and white. Both colors versions include a wide 2.4-inch touchscreen display, bordered by a green knob to adjust settings. The combination of this large display and a front-facing clip design make it especially easy to access the controls while it’s in use and to view the temperature from across the room. You can find this device available for around $200, which is less expensive than many other devices on the market.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68467-nomiku11.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyVHccCo5ArPE8zsauvHQd.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"dyVHccCo5ArPE8zsauvHQd","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyVHccCo5ArPE8zsauvHQd.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1931fb01-3957-4029-a078-f691c084fa45","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/TLsvzuPqPvV4Hiotn6FuyH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This unit not only looks good, but we found that it performed well in both our chicken and steak tests. The meat wasn&#39;t as tender as the <a href=\"/chefsteps-review\">ChefSteps Joule</a>, but it did create satisfactory results. With a 1,100-watt heating element, the WiFi Nomiku quickly heats water to the temperatures required for sous vide cooking. This includes an accuracy of ±0.2 degrees Fahrenheit and a range from 32 degrees F to 203 degrees F so you&#39;ll be able to cook your foods at the temperature you want. Any water container can be used with this unit, as it has a large water level range of 4 inches and a 10-gallon capacity, which is more capacity than most other sous vides we tested. This means that it can cook a number of dishes at once so you can feed a decent amount of people.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68467-nomiku7.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLsvzuPqPvV4Hiotn6FuyH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"TLsvzuPqPvV4Hiotn6FuyH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLsvzuPqPvV4Hiotn6FuyH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7271d0df-00fe-4cbf-bee6-d16c3b936b50","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Convenience &amp; Safety</strong>"]},"id":"bd2bbcc5-615d-4a19-9870-ff5155c93df7","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/4FGfpjYuDZ3GT5YGQfVgR5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"When you are done cooking, you can remove the bottom half of the device and place it in a dishwasher for convenient cleaning.

Once connected, this app enables you to control the machine from anywhere from your smart device. You can select specific recipes from the Tender app and the Nomiku device will immediately set itself to the proper temperature and time.
