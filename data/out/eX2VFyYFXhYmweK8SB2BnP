While the name sounds dangerous, it usually isn&#39;t a bad thing. It just means that there is something about your business that qualifies it as a high-risk investment for the merchant account provider.<br/>The first thing to remember is that there is nothing wrong with high-risk merchant accounts. It is not an insult to your business. There is a formula that is applied to all merchant accounts that determines their risk level. Several factors come in to play. To determine your risk level, ask yourself the following questions:","<strong>Is your business online, home-based or real world?</strong>","One of the first things that could make a provider list your company as high risk is if you do not have a concrete place of business. If you do not own a storefront or office space, the riskiness of your business increases. If you work out of your home, or if your business is entirely online, your risk level will certainly go up.","<em>Why this increases risk</em>: Without a location and ties to the community, your business has greater liability. While you might be very successful, if a business does not have a location, there is more chance of that business disappearing and defaulting on any merchant accounts that are tied to it.","<strong>What is the financial history of you and your business?</strong>","Naturally, your credit history and the credit history of your business are going to be important in determining your liability to the institution providing your merchant accounts. If your business has bankruptcy in its past or has failed to pay off credit cards, your threat level will automatically increase. For sole proprietorships, your personal finances will also be taken in to account and could affect your rating as well.","<em>Why this increases risk</em>: Naturally, a company that has had difficulty making payments in the past is a danger to any provider. They want to know that your business will be able to pay the fees attached to the account.","<strong>How many sales do you make and what is the average amount of each sale?</strong>","Ironically, businesses that have a high volume of sales, or those that sell very expensive items, are also going to accrue more risk than less-successful businesses. As a result, their merchant accounts will reflect this. If your company makes several hundred sales over the course of a day, or if it sells items that are very expensive, your merchant accounts are more likely to be high risk.","<em>Why this increases risk</em>: Companies with very high revenue streams are more liable to have corruption, fraudulent credit card processing, embezzlement and conspiracy. While it might not be true of your company, the fact that these things happen more commonly in businesses with larger revenue streams adds to their liability.","<strong>What kind of business do you have?</strong>","While business profiling might not seem fair, there are certain types of businesses that start quickly and end just as quickly. They fluctuate extensively and are the most likely to file for bankruptcy. While the policy might be biased, the following types of business are usually categorized as high risk:"]},"id":"0ed1792a-dda9-4c84-960f-d24804bd9767","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Internet service providers and web-hosting services","Online dating services","Online auction sites","Online casinos","Online and offline adult entertainment","Online and offline travel agencies","Businesses specializing in sale or discount products"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1a52982f-8e83-45be-8933-7e1c25f628b0","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is no hard and fast rule for these businesses.
