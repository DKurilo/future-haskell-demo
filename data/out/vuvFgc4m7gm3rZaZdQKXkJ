It can cool a room up to 250 square feet in size and includes three fan and three cooling settings. Additionally, the FFRE0633U1 is one of the most compact models we reviewed. It’s also Energy Star qualified and has a decent Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER).","<strong>Efficiency</strong>","This AC unit generates up to 6,000 British thermal units (Btu) of energy, so it can cool a room of approximately 250 square feet. Furthermore, it removes up to 1.3 pints of moisture from the air per hour and has an airflow of 147 cubic feet per minute, which is good, though not among the best ratings we saw.","This window air conditioner is Energy Star certified, with an excellent EER of 12.1. In addition, when we estimated how much it costs to run the Frigidaire FFRE0633U1 per year, we found it was cheaper than many other energy-efficient window air conditioners. By our estimate, its costs $48 per year to run this AC unit.","The Frigidaire FFRE0633U1 is UL Listed, which means it passes public safety standards and has been tested by Underwriters Laboratories. It is also AHAM certified, so it has been tested and approved by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. Both organizations use independent laboratories to make their assessments.","<strong>Convenient</strong>","Like all the window air conditioners we reviewed, the Frigidaire FFRE0633U1 comes with a remote control that makes it easy to adjust the unit’s settings and temperature from across the room. The remote has controls for a variety of settings, a timer and a power button.","When the air conditioner is on a cool setting, the fan and compressor run together to cool the room. You can also use one of three settings that run the fan without the compressor to circulate air without cooling it. Additional modes include an auto mode and an energy-saving mode.","It also features a sleep mode, something not all window air conditioners include. When the unit is in this mode, it lets the temperature gradually rise throughout the night so the room isn’t too chilly in the morning. Once the room reaches this new temperature, it remains stable for up to seven hours before the unit automatically switches back to its original temperature setting.","Unfortunately, the Frigidaire FFRE0633U1 doesn’t have a dedicated dry setting to remove excess moisture and humidity – a valuable mode to have if you live in a humid place. If you need a window air conditioner with a dehumidifier setting, the <a href=\"/danby-dac060bguwdb-review\">Danby DAC060EUB5GDB</a> is a good alternative.","<strong>Design &amp; Warranty</strong>","Another one of this unit’s highlights is its compact size – it measures 12.75 x 18.5 x 15.7 inches and weighs only 44 pounds. Many similarly powerful window air conditioners are much larger and bulkier.","The Frigidaire FFRE0633U1 is covered by a one-year limited appliance warranty and a five-year sealed system warranty. If you come across problems, you can speak with a company representative via telephone or email. There is also an online manual and a FAQs section on the company website that may help answer your questions.","The Frigidaire FFRE0633U1 is easily one of the best window air conditioners available. It is powerful enough to cool a room of up to 250 square feet. In addition, it’s one of the most energy efficient units we reviewed and costs less to run than some similar air conditioners. Furthermore, it is compact, saving space in your home."]},"id":"2a3e6c2a-45ff-4d2c-86b5-21b9684403d8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69965","url":"/frigidaire-ffre0633u1-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-21T18:15:20Z","datePublished":"2018-05-21T18:15:20Z","name":"Frigidaire FFRE0633U1","synopsis":"The Frigidaire FFRE0633U1 is one of the best window air conditioners available.
