However, these games did little to show people what it is really like to play the guitar and bass. Ubisoft noticed this failing and published Rocksmith, the first video game that teaches you how to play an actual guitar.","The franchise continues to evolve with Rocksmith 2014, the best guitar learning software we tested.

When you&#39;ve mastered the technique, you become part of the band and have to play every note and chord that the guitarist would play.","Finally, Rocksmith offers a Sessions mode, which teaches you the principles of improvising. This is a crucial skill for any musician, as it allows artists to get to know each other through music and helps a budding rock star write a new song.","Unfortunately, there are some missing lessons, including how to take care of your guitar.
