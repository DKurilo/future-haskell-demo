Both slides and 3D objects at all magnification levels were crisp and easy to see. We were able to view small details that most other microscopes struggled with. While the average optical score of all microscopes was 67 percent, this one earned an impressive score of 99.5 percent.","In addition to our own testing, we invited a group of children to come use the microscopes for themselves. We encouraged them to interact with each instrument, and we then gave them a short form to share their experiences. The children’s consent regarding the OM117L was unanimous. They loved it.

We had no problem adjusting or setting it up. This scope has the standard traditional design, so there’s not a spectacular difference in the overall look or setup compared to similar models. However, it simply does everything right. For instance, the dials used to adjust the height of the platform were exceptionally smooth – significantly better than the dials on other microscopes we tested. Other dials felt clunky, making it difficult to move the platform up and down. The Omano OM117L did not have this issue. Moving the platform was easy enough for a child to accomplish.","Be aware that this microscope doesn’t come with carry case. This is only a minor inconvenience though, as the microscope has a carry handle built into the design. The sturdy design also allows you to transport the device without worry about damaging it.
