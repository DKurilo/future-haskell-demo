Users should be able to complete multiple projects and continue to use the programs for a long period. Professional producers will need specialized programs, but beginning and amateur musicians should judge audio editing software on the following criteria."," ","<strong>Audio Editing:</strong> Beyond cut, copy and paste functions, top-rated audio editing software features equalizers, mixers, filters and effects. Beginners will use basic editing tools, but as they become more comfortable with the software, advanced tools allow the program to remain relevant and usable."," ","<strong>Filters/Effects:</strong> Filters help to pull out undesired sounds or highlight specific elements. Effects build a professional sound with echoes and reverbs. The audio editing software for beginners will offer several presets and tools for both.","<strong>Recording/Burning:</strong> When recording, audio editing software should import files from the computer and allow live capture from a line-in audio source. At the end of the process, most programs will export a project into a digital file, and the best will also include CD or DVD burning software.","<strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The interface of an audio editing application must be approachable and understandable. As users learn how to use effects, shortcuts cut down on the production time of a project.","<strong>Help/Support:</strong> In-program tutorials offer the most help in learning how to use the software, but audio editing software without in-program help must at least offer FAQs and forums online as well as customer and technical support through phone, email or live chat. It&#39;s important to be able to contact the manufacturer easily in case there&#39;s ever a question or problem with the software","Musicians trying to create a demo or restore or clean up album collections will find flexibility by using audio editing software.
