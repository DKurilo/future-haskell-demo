The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-beat-making-software\">Beat Making Software</a> here.</em>","Propellerhead&#39;s Reason Essentials 8 is beat making software that has some added perks. Reason Essentials 8 added a browser window to the workstation that was previously made up of the sequencer, mixer and rack. The browser window is where all sounds, loop and audio data are stored within the program. You can now easily locate a sound or loop by searching in the browser window and apply it by simply dragging and dropping it into the rack unit.","The browser window is certainly not a new thing in this beat making software, but its new location in the top right corner of the interface improves workflow. The Reason Essentials 8 update is primarily dedicated to the improvement of workflow. The browser window places all of the sounds, essentially the lifeblood of Reason, out in front and makes it easily available.","The entire Reason interface got redesigned from versions 7 to 8. The overall design has been stripped down to look cleaner with flat matte colors that are aesthetically pleasing. The new design makes this program more usable compared to previous versions.","Reason is one of the most unique beat creator programs. The rack unit is a representation of its hardware counterparts, meaning the rack units are designed to look and work like physical hardware. The rack unit is a unique take on plugin and virtual effects within the software. Reason Essentials 8 boasts seven total plugins and six virtual instruments. Although Essentials is limited comparatively in total plugins to <a href=\"/logic-pro-x-review\">Logic Pro X</a>, the software boasts a large loop library of over 3,000 loops and 4,000 instrument patches. The sounds were created and inspired by groups like The Black Eyed Peas and Kill the Noise.","You can expand the plugins available on this beat software by purchasing rack expansion packages through Propellerhead. There are many rack expansion packages to choose from. However, you can&#39;t use third-party plugins with Reason; they have to be Propellerhead expansion format.","The mixer is one of the most impressive parts of Reason. The mixer is a carbon copy of the classic and revered SSL 9000K mixer. In Reason Essentials 8, there is only two-band EQ on the mixer, but the full version of Reason boasts a multi-band mixer so you can go more in-depth with the quality of your sound. One of the key features of the mixer is the master bus compressor. This compressor is a fast way to add more volume, polish and punch to your music. When the master compressor is armed, it automatically makes your recorded audio sound fuller and better in quality.","If you like Reason Essentials 8 so much that you want to upgrade to the full version, you can download an upgrade on the Propellerhead website. Reason Essentials 8 works on both Windows and Mac platforms."]},"id":"dac41efd-d3e4-447c-b768-3fe5a3e1a681","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"99b293ed-407d-40d5-997f-0ad8ab2caff5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Reason Essentials 8 has a great design that promotes a fluid workflow and an aesthetically pleasing work environment.
