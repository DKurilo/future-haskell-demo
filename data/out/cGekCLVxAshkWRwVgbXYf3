Not only will it save you money in the long run, but in case of emergencies or economic crisis, you will always have a little extra food to help sustain your family. The Kenmore Elite 28093 <a href=\"/best-freezers\">upright freezer</a> is one such method of keeping your food storage stocked. It has amazing storage capabilities with innovative space-saving functionality built in.  The Kenmore Elite 28093 upright freezer earned our Top Ten Reviews Silver Award for its amazing forethought in interior organization enhanced by its aesthetically pleasing exterior."]},"id":"7a48ffa5-1fd3-4f36-b2ce-6386f86ee2bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Cost &amp; Efficiency"},"id":"f16f794d-0237-42c8-815d-45a9271cc31a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Organization is paramount in the Kenmore Elite 28093. With eight door bins and baskets, four inside shelves and three inside baskets, this upright freezer has a capacity to hold 20.6 cubic feet of food, equivalent to 711 pounds. With that much space, it would be easy to pack the freezer full of groceries and still not know what you have stored. Kenmore foresaw this problem and also includes a few features to help organization triumph. Plastic bookend-like contraptions slide into place, keeping boxed items like frozen dinners lined up to maximize space. A tiny floating shelf resides under the top shelf, thin enough for storage of flat food like frozen pizza, allowing those thin items to be up from under larger, heavier items that need to be on a shelf. Below the second shelf, pull-out wire baskets are a perfect storage area for small items or food in soft wrapping. On the door, a tilt-out basket makes it easy to store more items in the door than would normally be possible. Even if you don’t organize as outlined above, upon opening the door, a bright interior light will illuminate your search through all of the stored food, making it easy to find what you’re looking for– however unorganized it may be.","The Kenmore Elite 28093 has a stamp of approval from Energy Star, which means that it is energy efficient, at least 10 percent more so than the average upright freezer guidelines outlined by the government. This particular upright freezer is so efficient it has an estimated yearly operating cost of only $74, or about $6 per month. Credit should be given to the exterior temperature monitor for most of the energy conservation that makes this freezer so cheap to operate. From the outside of the Kenmore Elite 28093 you can adjust the temperature, make sure the freezer is working properly and receive read outs, documenting if the internal temperature has been above 23 degrees all on an easy-to-read LED display."]},"id":"8b6b969b-82ae-4a6d-9d69-1cd6083a8d16","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Dimensions &amp; Warranty"},"id":"a2da5e86-81a9-4578-9dfc-91c7cba5bf21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["To add to the functionality capabilities, the Kenmore Elite 28093 upright freezer also has a long list of top-of-the-line features that have earned it a spot in our top three products."]},"id":"e42a9f2e-2b23-4e04-a105-147b8e99f953","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Temperature Monitor Alerts – Audible alerts will warn you of temperature anomalies inside the upright freezer.

This hasty freezing process locks in freshness and is perfect for freezing large amounts of food.","Frost Free – This feature eradicates the stigma of freezers needing to be manually defrosted. By automatically melting excess frost off of the sides of the freezer, icy buildup is impossible.","Power On Light – With a quick glance, you can tell that the power to your freezer is on. This light may seem redundant when considering the temperature monitor alerts, but if the power did go out, those alerts would not be functioning.","Soft Freeze Zone – A special area for items that need to be frozen at a slightly higher temperature.

Looks really aren’t that important, but durability is, and a stainless steel finish will prevent rust and other deteriorating elements.
