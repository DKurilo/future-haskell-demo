You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Orb Audio Mod1 <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater system</a> is an all-American surround-sound alternative that will raise eyebrows for both its look and sound. These distinctive orb-shaped speakers are also available in the widest array of colors we&#39;ve seen on the home theater speaker market to date. Color options include metallic black and pearl white as well as hand-polished looks in steel bronze and copper.","These surround sound speakers perform great, with a wide frequency range of 28Hz to 20kHz. While the lowest bass tones will still be missed, the Orb Audio comes much closer to capturing them all than most surround sound speakers, so even bass lovers will enjoy the low frequencies this home theater speaker package provides. All the high tones will be captured, though, since the maximum frequency response matches that of human hearing,","Everything about this home theater speaker system is compact, from the 12-inch subwoofer to the orb speakers themselves. What sets these speakers apart is solid, high-quality construction. A steel sphere that measures slightly more than 4 inches across encloses each speaker. Behind a non-removable grille, there is a 3-inch full-range driver made of polypropylene – a material that Orb Audio certifies for long-term, hi-fi performance.","The sound quality is clear, crisp and surprisingly loud given the speakers&#39; small size and unique shape. The speakers work together to create a quality sound stage for watching movies or listening to music with your home theater system.","The speakers are not too difficult to set up, but they aren&#39;t incredibly easy either. They don&#39;t come ready to mount on the wall, but wall mounts are available for purchase on the company website. If you find the set-up process confusing, there are help videos available online. Orb Audio also has a FAQs section on its website as well as traditional phone and email support available.","The Orb Audio warranty covers the satellite speakers for five years and the subwoofer for one year. You should know a few important oddities. First, you must contact Orb Audio before you send in your damaged or broken speakers for a replacement. If the company receives your speakers without notification, the warranty will not apply. Furthermore, Orb Audio must perform all repairs to your speaker system. Any unlicensed attempt to open and repair the speakers will void the warranty. You are responsible to pay to ship the speakers to the company, and Orb Audio will pay to return the repaired speakers or replacements to you."]},"id":"4dc2fb34-92ba-4931-a73a-f9af101b39b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1c6b21f6-edd2-4391-a596-4eed95e9bedb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We love the Orb Audio Mod1 home theater speaker system for its style and the company for the high-performance speakers it produces.
