The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\"><em>Mac DVD Copy Software</em></a><em> here.</em>","In our review of the best DVD copy software for Mac, Mac DVDRipper Pro makes a respectable showing. It’s fairly simple to learn, use and operate; anyone familiar with the Mac operating system should be able to duplicate a DVD on the first attempt. It has almost all the tools and features we look for in software in this category. What keeps this application out of award-winning territory is its limited options for burning new discs.","Immediately after launch, Mac DVDRipper Pro is ready to get down to business. All you have to do is insert the DVD you want copied and select what type of task you want to perform. You can choose to rip all the content from the disc, including menus and bonus features, or only rip the main movie. You can create a full disc image or convert the DVD movie to a format that’s playable on mobile devices such as tablets, smartphones and Apple TV.","All those options are great and the quality of the copy is on par with the original movie on the disc. Where this Mac DVD copy software falls down is in its truncated options for burning new discs. There is only one option on the main menu that allows you to create a new DVD from the original. That option is “Full disc image and burn a copy.” You don’t have the ability to customize the new disc whatsoever. If you want to copy a movie, you have to take the menus, trailers, extra features and everything else that comes on the original disc.","The lack of customization options when it comes to burning a new disc is problematic at best. Most DVD movies that come out of Hollywood are DVD-9 – meaning they hold about 9GB of information. However, most of the recordable DVDs available on the market today are DVD-5s – meaning they hold about 5GB of information. So, you can’t fit all the content found on most DVDs onto their recordable counterparts unless you invest in the more-expensive and harder-to-find DVD-9 recordable discs (also known as DVD-DL).","It’s also confusing that this DVD copy application would offer custom ripping options but leave out the ability to burn them onto a disc. If the “movie only” option on the main menu had the ability to then burn only the movie onto a disc, the usability of this application would increase a great deal. We are puzzled that Mac DVDRipper Pro would include customization options for ripping and converting, but not for burning."]},"id":"7bf2974c-efe8-4b2a-ab92-889331de4bde","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"169a507f-1490-4594-95ab-6179a7f659e4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All in all, Mac DVDRipper Pro is a solid, intuitive application that is great for ripping and converting your DVD movies.
