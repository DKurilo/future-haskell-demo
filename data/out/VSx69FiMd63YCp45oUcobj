The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-indoor-electric-grills\">Indoor Electric Grills</a> here.</em>","The Zojirushi EB-DLC10 is an indoor electric grill that does an average job. It scores low because it has terrible splatter and a lengthy cook time compared to other models. It also lacks some cooking capabilities of other products we reviewed, like the ability to make paninis and pancakes. The grill has an open style rather than the conventional clamshell design that presses down, grilling from both sides. It also doesn&#39;t feature a griddle, which other products like the <a href=\"/cuisinart-review\">Cuisinart Griddler</a> include. These design setbacks lower the value, especially considering the high price of this grill.","Other factors that hurt the Zojirushi&#39;s score include its lack of dishwasher-safe parts and no cleaning tools. However, it does have a nonstick surface and heat-resistant handles. With a nonstick surface, you want to be careful to only use rubber or plastic utensils and no abrasive cleaning tools that can scratch and peel the coating.","For the best results, a grill should have consistent temperature across its surface. This model had varying temperatures and four cold spots, which makes for uneven grilling. More than an annoyance, this can increase the risk of serving undercooked meat.","We tested chicken and hamburgers using the grill, and it collected less oil than other indoor electric grills we reviewed and had longer cook times. However, the flavor was better using this Zojirushi than using a frying pan.","The Zojirushi model had among the worst splatter of the products in our indoor electric grill review, reaching a foot away. That makes for laborious cleanup of surrounding surfaces. It also had one of the longest clean-up times, clocking in at over six minutes. This may not seem like a long time, but since it has to be washed by hand, that time can add up and make using the product less enjoyable.","This model does have a quick assembly time of only two and a half minutes, and it heats up quickly. It has an above-average cooking area, so you can fit quite a bit of food on the grill, but with the uneven temperature distribution, this can be hit or miss. The product also has a one-year warranty."]},"id":"8b987cfd-e783-45e2-97a3-3d82592a7cb6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fa921d05-f177-4d48-8426-e30ae06f9f68","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When it comes to indoor grilling, you don&#39;t want to be second guessing your food; you&#39;d rather be confident in what you&#39;re serving and eating.
