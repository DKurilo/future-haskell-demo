Therefore, the spreadsheet software you choose should be able to read and write XLS and XLSX files and render them correctly. Choose software that allows you to easily convert your files into PDF format if you want to ensure your spreadsheets cannot be easily altered without leaving an electronic footprint. Creating PDF files also reduces file sizes and lets you easily add password protection. If you create spreadsheets that you want to publish online, choose a program that lets you easily convert spreadsheets into HTML.","<strong>Versatility</strong>","How versatile your spreadsheet software should be depends entirely on what you want to use it for. If you’re a student or a professional wanting to impress with your presentation or data collation, you need to be able to integrate graphics and alter the fonts, colors and other aesthetic qualities. If you want simple visual representations of your collected data, you need to be able to easily create charts from your entries.","Consider whether you need remote or mobile access to your spreadsheets. If so, you need an easily shareable or cloud-compatible application. For those who work collaboratively, it’s important to have spreadsheet software that allows simultaneous editing and multi-user functionality. If all you want to do is save, email and print spreadsheets, a desktop-only program will suffice.","<strong>Features</strong>","The best spreadsheet software programs have extensive formula selections that are easily accessible. Your software should also have a variety of templates on hand for common spreadsheets so you don’t have to lay out budget sheets, calendars and planners from scratch every time. If you’re sharing or collaborating with other people, make sure you can lock or freeze specific columns so others can’t accidentally edit or overwrite them.","Also note how many rows and columns a spreadsheet can accommodate. Some are unlimited, while others restrict you to just 250. If you deal with complex or large quantities of data, choosing a spreadsheet application that features pivot tables makes sense, as they provide an easy way of summarizing data.","<strong>Support</strong>","Whether you’re an advanced user or a novice, it&#39;s invaluable for your software to have a solid support system, including plenty of tutorials, step-by-step instructions and FAQs pages. Having email, phone and forum support at your disposal helps to ensure you don’t get stuck without a solution."]},"id":"57d428d3-4352-4cb6-bd68-65527560f245","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"591c5411-6e01-4182-b265-9b169156b03d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Cty0dj6o3sg&subid=&offerid=452112.1&type=10&tmpid=6075&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoftstore.com%2Fstore%2Fmsusa%2Fen_US%2Fpdp%2FExcel-2016%2FproductID.323021400\">Microsoft Excel</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ability.com/sales/officepro.php?ln=en\">Ability Office</a>","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id361304891?mt=8&at=1l3v52U\">Apple Numbers</a>","<a href=\"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/\">Google Sheets</a>","<a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/\">LibreOffice Calc</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softmaker.com/en/softmaker-office-windows-planmaker\">PlanMaker</a>","<a href=\"http://www.wordperfect.com/en/product/office-suite/?sourceid=wpox8-xx-ppc_brkws&gclid=CIjRhez8jNACFYKHfgodiuYM0w\">WordPerfect Quatro Pro</a>","<a href=\"https://shopper.mycommerce.com/checkout/cart/add/28469-15?affiliate_id=22430\">WPS Spreadsheet</a>","<a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/docs/sheet.html\">Zoho Sheets</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"15535046-e7e5-4f6b-959a-fd4ec5974e66","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_410","url":"/best-spreadsheet-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-10-26T18:45:15Z","datePublished":"2016-11-03T21:40:06Z","name":"Spreadsheet Software Review","synopsis":"Simple to-do lists, complex formulas and large-scale data are all made easier with quality spreadsheet software, helping you or your business stay organized.","review":{},"strapline":"Simple to-do lists, complex formulas and large-scale data are all made easier with quality spreadsheet software, helping you or your business stay organized.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-02-28T15:55:33Z","id":"RLYJLK45SS6EktFnK2qDpV","meta":{"title":"The Best Spreadsheet Software | Top Ten Reviews","description":"We rank the best speadsheet software with side-by-side comparisons.
