And while it doesn’t have all the tools we look for in the best <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD burning software</a>, it has enough to warrant your consideration as you decide which program is right for you.","The most impressive thing about this DVD burner is the speed at which it duplicates the discs in your library. In our tests it took about half an hour to compress a commercial disc onto a smaller-sized blank DVD and about forty minutes to make an uncompressed copy. Only program on our side-by-side comparison chart","Most of the DVD movies you buy are distributed on DVD-9s, which are discs with 9GBs of storage space. However, the most common and less-expensive blank discs only have about 5 GBs of space. Magic DVD Copier has the ability to compress the content found on DVD-9s so they fit onto a DVD-5. However, if you choose this option, you will notice drastic quality loss.","In our tests, this product rendered one of the lowest-quality compressions in our review. However, you also have the option to only copy only the feature presentation, which should fit, uncompressed, onto a DVD-5 in most cases.","One of the tools found in the best DVD burning software that is absent is Magic DVD Copier is the ability to save or burn from an ISO file. Sometimes known as an ISO image, this file is basically the blueprint for your DVD.","When you save an ISO file to your hard drive, you essentially have the DVD without the disc; it can be played in the software application, and you can use it to burn a new copy without needing the original. DVD Copier’s sister program Magic DVD Ripper has this ability; it’s strange, though, that they omit it from their DVD copy application."]},"id":"57bff9e5-4aa9-4bc1-abde-86933e000ec5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a4a5f132-0c0c-4381-ab9a-4f894f6901d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While this program has some useful tools and can burn exact copies of your DVD movies, it lacks some of the critical components we look for in the best DVD burning software.
