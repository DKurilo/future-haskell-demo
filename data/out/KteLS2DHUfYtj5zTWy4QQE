For Mac users, our testers prefer Safari even though both Chrome and Firefox are compatible with Mac computers.","<strong>How We Tested<br/></strong>","We downloaded each internet browser to as many devices we could to check the compatibility. Even when a device or operating system wasn’t listed on the browser’s homepage, we still attempted to locate it in the Google Play and Apple store just to make sure we didn’t miss it. And if we couldn’t find an official app, we attempted to download the program from each browser’s homepage.","After downloading the browsers to our test computers, laptops and mobile devices, we recorded the time it took for the browser to navigate from one page to another, and the time it took to completely load the page. As part of this test we navigated to a variety of sites including search engines and content-heavy pages like news sites. We repeated this several times so we could get a good average time for each browser to compare against all the others we tested. Of course, load times can affected by the time of day, type of internet connection and the number of devices connected at once. Still we got a good idea of how reliable each browser is. For the most part there isn’t a lot of difference between the more well-known internet browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Opera.","The biggest difference we saw, and one that is important to consider when choosing an internet browser, is how well each recognized and blocked malware. This includes virus downloads, phishing schemes and untrusted websites that are known to harbor malicious files. We tested internet browsers for security using live malware samples.","For our security tests, we didn’t change any browser settings, using only the default security setup. While we know adjusting some settings will result in better protection, many users are not tech savvy enough to do this effectively. We feel it is better to test the default security settings since this is what the majority of users will use.","After testing how well the internet browsers detect and stop malware on their own, we installed <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus software programs</a> and performed these tests again. This allowed us to see how well each internet browser works alongside these programs to provide optimum online security to you and your family. It also let us see how each browser behaves with browser extensions.","<strong>FAQs About Internet Browsers</strong>","How do I install a new web browser?","Your new computer or smartphone should have come with a web browser already installed. On most Windows desktops, this will be Microsoft Edge; Safari is the default browser on Macs. You can search for the browser you want to use in any other web browser. For example, you can search for Google Chrome in the Edge search bar. Once you find the site for the browser you want to use, click the download button and give the permissions for the download and installation when prompted. The web browser will download and install itself on your device.","You can download, install and use multiple web browsers at once. Just know that each browser takes up a lot of memory on your device and requires still more to operate correctly. Chrome tends to use the most resources.","If your computer doesn’t already have a web browser, there are a couple of ways to get one installed. If your computer has a disk drive, you can order an installation disk for your preferred browser. However, since most computers are now made without a disk drive, it is a challenge to find an available installation disk.","The other option is to download the web browser program to an external drive. Most web browsers will fit on a flash (or thumb) drive. This will have to be done from a computer that already has a browser installed since you’ll need to browser to download the program file. Once the file is saved to your external drive, you can connect it to your computer to upload and install your preferred web browser.","Whichever method you choose, just be certain you are visiting the legitimate web browser’s webpage in order to avoid accidentally downloading a malicious file. Several <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus programs</a>, like <a href=\"/trend-micro-review\">Trend Micro</a>, use web detection technology to ensure you are visiting a safe site.","Can I have more than one web browser on my computer?","Yes, you can have more than one web browser installed on your computer. We have found that some websites and programs work best in a particular browser. And there are some software programs that won’t download from certain web browsers. But keep in mind that you need enough hard drive space to house more than one browser on any device. Chrome is a 30MB program, but Google suggests having at least 100MB of hard disk space available for its browser to install and operate properly. Mozilla doesn’t disclose exactly how big the Firefox download is, but several users have reported needing at least 50MB of available space in order to download it, and Mozilla does suggest allotting 200MB for Firefox to run.","What are browser extensions, and do I need to pay for them?","Browser extensions are program shortcuts that are designed to work alongside your browser to enhance your online experience, much like the apps you download to your smartphone. In the past these extensions cost about $5 per year, but most are now free. We had a hard time finding any paid extensions. We did notice that the most popular browser extensions Firefox users downloaded were adblockers and expense trackers, while most Chrome users downloaded educational apps, like Grammarly, and games. Keep in mind that Microsoft Edge doesn’t support third-party browser extensions.","Is Microsoft Edge safer than Chrome?","When we tested internet browsers, we noticed Edge did a decent job of warning us of dangerous sites and of stopping malware from downloading. However, there were still several threats that snuck through because Edge didn’t recognize them. These same threats were quickly stopped by both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.","Most antivirus software requires you to enable a browser extension to help it monitor your online activity and keep threats at bay, but  Microsoft Edge doesn’t allow third-party browser extensions. In other web browsers, the antivirus extensions helped block malicious downloads when a threat wasn’t recognized by the browser’s security settings, and the web browsers, in turn, tapped into the antivirus malware databases through the extension to stop threats they didn’t recognize on their own.","Overall, Microsoft Edge, though decently secure, is not as safe as either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. We did discover a couple of antivirus solutions, such as <a href=\"/trend-micro-review\">Trend Micro Antivirus+</a>, that use web recognition technology and will warn you within the Microsoft Edge browser of potential threats without the use of an extension. You can learn more about antivirus programs that are compatible with Microsoft Edge in our comparison of the <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">best antivirus software</a>."]},"id":"2c4ac1e9-0129-4273-aaa7-660f694d3d25","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_298","url":"/best-internet-browser-software","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-25T17:11:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-25T17:11:00Z","name":"Best Internet Browsers of 2019","synopsis":"We tested the security of each browser, including how well each detects and stops malware.
