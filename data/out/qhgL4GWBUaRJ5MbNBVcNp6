You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Harman Kardon AVR 1600 is a mid- to high-range <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receiver</a> that isn&#39;t too expensive. The problem is that you have to sacrifice quality to save those extra few bucks. This seems a little odd coming from the company that supplies the majority of audio systems for companies like BMW, Harley-Davidson and Mercedes-Benz. Names like those suggest high quality and a hefty price tag. In this case, you get low quality and a fairly low price tag.","This product is rather poorly conceived and therefore didn&#39;t match up well against the competition. The original idea may have been good, but the execution seems to have flopped. For that reason it ranked right near the bottom. Like the Marantz NR1501 and Sherwood R-904N, this AV receiver looks good at first, but as you dig deeper you&#39;ll find flaws and inadequacies.","The signal-to-noise ratio at 100dB looks good. The level of harmonic interference is average at 0.08%. The frequency response is even an impressive 10Hz to 130kHz, which is a broader range than any other AV receiver we reviewed. However, this 7.1 surround system only puts out about 50 watts per channel, which is about half what the leaders in this category do.","Most AV receivers have a built-in amplifier to help increase output without consuming a lot of power and driving up your electricity bill. That doesn&#39;t seem to be the case with this one, however. The Harman Kardon AVR 1600 consumes around 540 watts, which isn&#39;t proportionally the most but it is still high compared to most of the other competition. If you&#39;re looking for something &#34;green,&#34; this is one of the worst choices.","Aside from those points, most everything else isn&#39;t bad. There are three HDMI inputs on this AV receiver at your disposal. You will also find a couple component video inputs as an alternative HD option. There are also three optical and coaxial inputs. A handful of composite AV inputs and outputs can be found as well on the back side. There is a front panel audio section with a 6.3mm headphone jack.","There isn&#39;t audio for a second room or zone on this AV receiver. Also, there aren&#39;t any radio ports at all – not satellite or even regular AM/FM radio. Anyone who enjoys listening to the radio over their home theater system will be disappointed. It does, however, include iPod compatibility, which is typically more widely used at home than radio.","This Harmon Kardon AV receiver doesn&#39;t have THX support. It does support the full range of Dolby Digital and DTS, however. It also supports Dolby&#39;s Pro Logic II technology, just not the latest version.  Harmon Kardon may provide an update to bring that up to speed we were unable to find one presently."]},"id":"b4cb9e41-4f36-4883-80e2-f9b170c4cfa3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"68d996ed-c996-414d-a456-e4e9574f72ef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are a substantial number of features missing from the <strong>Harman Kardon AVR 1600</strong>.
