This means the program didn’t have the most recent threat information to properly identify and protect against new malware. So, we followed the instructions to update this module. However, each time we tried, the download was interrupted before the updates completed. After several attempts, we checked the online knowledgebase on ESET’s website and Googled for a solution. Following the steps for some of the suggestions we found didn’t help, so we ultimately reached out to the ESET tech support team.
