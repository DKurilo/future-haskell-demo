The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-hot-tubs\">Hot Tubs</a> here.</em>","The South Seas Spas online design tool lets you build your own custom hot tub starting with one of its 15 basic models. Designed specifically for leisure, you can choose a small spa for two people or a large model to hold up to eight friends. Each spa is equipped with stainless steel jet streams with options to help make your relaxation an overall pleasurable and inviting experience.","All of South Seas Spas’ hot tub models come standard with ArcticPac insulation. ArcticPac wraps your spa shell in a double layer of reflective sheets and then is coated with Icynene foam. You can opt to upgrade to the full foam energy efficient insulation package that uses foam to completely cover space between the spa shell and the outside panels to more efficiently retain heat, maintain water temperature and conserve energy.","The South Seas Spas’ Ozonator is a water purification device that is added to the standard pump and filtration system that comes with your hot tub. The Ozonator uses oxygen to clean and purify your water, reducing the need for harsh chemicals, such as chlorine. While every pump is “ozone ready,” there are some spas that cannot be upgraded to use the Ozonator because of their specific designs and positions of the jet streams.","Pillowfall water features are visually beautiful but also provide soothing sounds as you relax in your hot tub spa. The waterfall is surrounded by a soft, pillow-type material that allows you to rest your head on it while the water spills down your neck and back for a unique relaxation feeling. Some spa models allow you to add a lighting package, such as the multicolor LED lights, to the Pillowfall to give a more stunning, visual display.","South Seas Spas models range from small, 3-person units to 8-person spas. Units are designed for leisure more than massage therapy, though the stainless steel jet streams still provide an enjoyable, relaxing environment. Here are a few of best models offered by South Seas Spas:","<strong>519 P:</strong> The 519 P is a small hot tub that can seat up to four people, so it’s best for a single person, a couple or a small family. Because of its small size, it’s easy to fit in a small backyard or on a small porch. The 519 P has a total of 19 jets with top jets positioned to hit your neck, shoulders and upper back and streams near the bottom to help massage your legs and feet. This unit doesn’t come with a lighting system, but it is available as an upgrade option to give your hot tub a multicolor glow after dark.","<strong>627 M:</strong> The 627 model is a small round hot tub, though it is capable of seating up to five people. This hot tub comes standard with 27 stainless steel jets, includes the Pillowfall water feature and is constructed with South Seas Spas’ ArcticPac insulation. You can upgrade this spa to include the Ozonator, a sound system and an LED multicolor lighting package.","<strong>965 L: </strong>This large, 8-person hot tub includes a lounging seat so you can be reclined while relaxing. It features 65 jets, ArcticPac insulation and the Pillowfall feature with LED lighting. The system is able to accept the add-on Ozonator, can be upgraded to the Full Foam Energy Efficient Package and can include a wireless sound system that can play music from a number of sources, including the radio and MP3 devices.","The leisure designs of South Seas Spas help create a relaxing atmosphere. Models range from 2-person hot tubs to eight seater spas and come standard with stainless steel jet streams. Many models can be upgraded to use the Ozonator or a wireless sound system that is capable of playing music from the radio or an MP3 device."]},"id":"16d288ce-6488-446f-8cc4-32271656e72d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60800","url":"/south-seas-spas-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-15T17:50:11Z","datePublished":"2014-10-15T17:50:11Z","name":"South Seas Spas","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
