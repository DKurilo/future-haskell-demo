You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The affordable Infinuvo Hovo 510 is a powerful <a href=\"/best-robot-vacuums\">robot vacuum</a> that removes stubborn dirt and clingy pet hair from hardwood floors, tile and low-pile carpeting. With two rows of spinning brushes, it easily lifts debris with its powerful suction motor.","Although this robot vacuum cleaner does not have many cleaning patterns, its random mode works well by making multiple passes over the area it is cleaning. If it misses a spot, you can use its handy remote control to guide it for touch-ups. You get the added bonus of a UV light that can sanitize your floors. This device also includes a mopping capability so it can wet clean as well as vacuum up dust, dirt and pet hair.","Its spot-cleaning mode focuses extra attention on high-traffic areas and embedded dirt, ensuring cleaner floors. There are no dirt sensors, however, so you need to make sure you set it on a spot without relying on it to find its own way over the mess. Although this robot vacuum cleaner does not have a HEPA filtration system, it removes fine dust effectively.","This robotic vacuum is easy to use. You can program the times you want it to clean, whether you are home or away. You just set the days and times you want it to run, and it will vacuum until its battery is low. Then it returns to its charging station on its own, so you do not have lift a finger to prepare it for work after the initial set-up.","The one included virtual wall prevents it from entering rooms where you do not want it to go. You place the device at the entry of the room you want the cleaner to avoid, and the vacuum robot&#39;s sensors detect the emitted signal and turn it around. This cleaner is also equipped with cliff sensors than can detect a drop-off, which prevents this robotic vacuum cleaner from falling down stairs, something none of the best robot vacuums do when in working mode.","This robotic vacuum cleaner measures 12.6 inches in diameter and weighs 6.8 pounds. It is 3.6 inches tall, so it can easily clean under your bed and couch. This cleaner can reach places an upright cleaner cannot. However, it lacks automatic height adjustment, which means it could get stuck when transitioning from bare floors to raised surfaces, like rugs.","You get a typical one-year warranty with this robotic vacuum cleaner. The company offers a telephone number in case you want to speak with a live customer service agent. You can also contact representatives by email and browse FAQs on the manufacturer&#39;s website. Video tutorials are available online, and there is a live chat service, which is always a great help if you need answers quickly."]},"id":"cd169d8c-620f-4c60-ad95-a3b471b5042d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0ca26d4f-870d-483d-b2a9-977f7613acf3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Infinuvo Hovo 510 has efficient, scheduled cleaning and powerful suction, and it effectively rids your floors of dirt and pet hair despite its lack of sensors.
