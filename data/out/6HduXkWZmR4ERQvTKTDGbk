MiniRider high-performance four-wheel scooter is easy to maneuver and assemble. The four wheels make this model stable; however, it still has a tight turning radius. Additionally, this <a href=\"/best-power-scooters\">power scooter</a> only weighs 115 pounds, so most users can transport it with ease.","This power scooter has one of the longest operating ranges of the scooters we reviewed, making it a good choice for all-day events and long excursions. Using this scooter, you can safely travel 15 miles before needing to recharge the battery. This is better than high-end power scooters like the <a href=\"/riderxpress-review\">EV RiderXpress</a> and the <a href=\"/luggie-review\">Luggie</a>. It takes anywhere between six and 10 hours to recharge the battery, which is standard.","Since the scooter has a weight capacity of 275 pounds, most people can use this electric wheelchair scooter to carry additional items with them as they ride. The scooter has a maximum speed of 5 mph, making it one of the faster models in our review. With its long operating range, high weight capacity and fast maximum speed, this scooter performs well on long rides outdoors.","Even though this medical scooter has four wheels, it has a turning radius comparable to a three-wheel model. Its 35-inch turning radius allows you to make tight corners and maneuver around your house or a store with ease. The manufacturer lists the maximum recommended incline at 10 degrees, so you can climb steep hills and ramps safely. It also has solid tires, so you do not have to worry about flats.","The scooter’s low ground clearance makes it stable when you climb on and off; however, it limits the terrain you can drive over. The MiniRider performs best on flat surfaces and can incur damage if used on uneven terrain.","The scooter weighs 115 pounds assembled, but each of the components is a much more manageable weight, with the heaviest only weighing 37 pounds. Most riders should be able to assemble and transport this portable scooter with relative ease.","This mobility scooter’s deep seat cushion provides proper support. The scooter has a standard handle that requires some upper-body strength to steer. It does not have adjustable armrests, which come in handy when adjusting the scooter to your height and weight.","Compared to the top-rated scooters in our review, EV Rider offers a standard warranty. The frame is covered for three years, and the drive train and electronic components are covered for one year. The battery has a short warranty, only backed by EV Rider for two months after purchase."]},"id":"ae08374b-90fb-4b07-a60e-38f89195a07d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b9deddaa-dc13-4a0b-be6e-b5ddb54b9396","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The EV MiniRider scooter provides top performance and maneuverability.
