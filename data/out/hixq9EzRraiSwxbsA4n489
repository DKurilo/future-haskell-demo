It has a stylish body with a bendable stand. You can use the swivel neck to turn the camera whichever way you want, and with this design, it can serve as a document camera in the classroom. Unfortunately, its highest resolution is 720p; while that counts as HD, if you watch 720p content on a 1080p screen, the image tends to look grainy or pixelated. It has a few features that make it good for video chatting, but many of the features we look for in the best webcams are not available in this one.","Most of the web cameras in our lineup offer 1080p resolution, but the Hue HD Camera peaks at just 720p. While this is technically HD, it’s just the bare minimum to qualify as such. Only offering 720p is disappointing, especially given that 4K displays are becoming more and more common. Fortunately, this camera is able to maintain its resolution of 30 frames per second, a natural capture speed for the human eye.","The Hue HD has a few features, but not as many as other units on the market. Its ability to correct the lighting in real time allows you to swivel the camera without worrying about over- or underexposure. It also has automatic noise reduction, allowing you to make video calls without fretting over background sounds interfering with your voice. But we’d like to see more features, like face tracking or one-click uploads. Also, it does not have any sort of digital zoom.","This PC camera’s best feature is its stylish design. The Hue HD is available in a variety of colors and it comes with a long swivel neck. Thanks to this flexible neck, you can easily reposition the camera however you need it. For this reason, Hue recommends this camera for classrooms as both a webcam and a document camera. Last, the lens is made of glass, which is preferable to plastic, and the USB cord is 6 feet long."]},"id":"744857b1-737d-482d-83fe-c237a0cf99c4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a59c9f0f-b552-46e4-bffd-212927a87fdd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hue HD Camera is a low-priced webcam with excellent design, but it lacks full 1080p resolution and many of the features we look for in a webcam.
