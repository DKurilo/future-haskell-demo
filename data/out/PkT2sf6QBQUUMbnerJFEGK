At nearly four feet long, the RC helicopter is a massive addition to the remote control helicopter industry. But don’t let the size of this helicopter intimidate you; it&#39;s built to be used by flyers of all skill levels and ages. The big and bulky size is particularly attractive for first-time flyers. It doesn’t have the same ability to perform tricks and stunts as some other similar units, and it’s missing some of the advanced flying features, such as ultrasound alerts.","This monster helicopter features a single rear motor for precision movement, and as most Gyro RC helicopters do, it includes increased stability to ensure you’re time flying is spent exactly on that – flying – rather than worrying about trying not to ruin your investment with a crash landing. When it comes to direction, it can just about do it all, going forward, backward, up, down, left, right and hover.","The radio-controlled helicopter is missing some of the more advanced features that some other similar models offer. It cannot perform some of the sophisticated stunts, such as figure eights and barrel rolls, that other helicopters perform with ease. Also, there is no camera and no sensors, and you won&#39;t hear sound alerts before a crash.","The Colossus comes ready to fly straight out of the box, no assembly required. Instead, just grab eight AA batteries and you are ready to fly the world’s biggest Gyro remote control helicopter. You’ll also be able to fly in style thanks to the modern design and LED lights that make flying in the dark a breeze.","The hard-shell exterior is made from a hard plastic polymer that allows the helicopter to remain lightweight and still protects the engine and other vital parts. There are always crashes involved when learning to fly a remote control helicopter, and with the Colossus Gyro you can rest assured it will be able to crash and still fly.","Both children and adults will love flying this helicopter. It is very easy to use, but the controls are precise enough to let you try out intricate twists, turns and tricks. Also, a really helpful tip is that if you find your helicopter isn’t flying forward as fast as you would like, try fitting heavier batteries to the helicopter to give it extra momentum. With every 30 minutes of charging time you will get about 10 minutes worth of flight time, so make sure that you fully charge the battery before take-off."]},"id":"a4e88440-cc26-4cdf-a886-d6f3408622af","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"287ab459-af76-4f5f-9a47-e91b33d9646d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Colossus Gyro remote control helicopter is massive.
