Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Danby DDR7009REE dehumidifier is a model that combines high power and energy efficiency. This <a href=\"/best-dehumidifiers\">dehumidifier</a> is capable of removing excess moisture from entire homes and floor levels. While it is missing some standard features that make the maintenance of a dehumidifier easy, the unit effectively dehumidifies rooms and requires minimal supervision while in operation.","This Danby model removes up to 70 pints of moisture daily, if you have that much excess moisture in your home. The unit covers a staggering 3,800 square feet. This dehumidifier is effective whether you want to dehumidify your entire home or a large living area. Considering its capacity and size, the unit comes with a smaller bucket that only holds 14.2 pints of water. While this makes the entire unit lighter, you may find you have to empty the bucket often.","This unit is built to withstand cool temperatures. It can be used in areas that dip to 41 degrees Fahrenheit. The model has an auto defrost feature that prevents water from freezing over, which means you can use the device as a basement dehumidifier. The model also has a user-friendly design with a digital display. You can control the humidistat, the timer, the auto restart and fan speeds through the digital display panel.","This dehumidifier lacks some standard features found on comparable units. It will not automatically shut off unless you are using the timer. You also cannot see the water levels of the collection reservoir, which means you will be checking on your unit more unless you utilize the continuous draining feature. However, the dehumidifier comes with a drain pump, so you can place it anywhere in your home and have the water pumped into a drain.","Given the dehumidifier’s capabilities and capacity, it is surprisingly energy efficient for its size. The dehumidifier uses 770 watts when running and is certified by Energy Star as an energy efficient dehumidifier. The unit comes backed by a two-year warranty. It is one of the only dehumidifiers to have such a long warranty, indicating it was built to last.","The dehumidifier is a large and heavy unit. It weighs 43 pounds and comes with four caster wheels to help with mobility. Thus, it will likely take up a good corner in your room. If you set up the unit for continuous draining, it will require placement by a drain. On its lowest setting, it is a quiet dehumidifier. However, when you use the high-speed fan, the unit can be loud while it works to extract moisture from your home."]},"id":"831cba1d-4f8d-40e1-a0aa-ed3dbdeba27c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"578561e2-689b-4e21-8320-faa77b2a7d3f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Danby DDR7009REE dehumidifier effectively removes moisture from your home, even in the basement.
