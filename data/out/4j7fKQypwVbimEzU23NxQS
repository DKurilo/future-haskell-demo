Peer-to-peer lending companies like Lending Club offer online personal loans at competitive rates and flexibility. <a href=\"/sofi-review\">SoFi</a> and <a href=\"/upstart-review\">Upstart</a> are other peer-to-peer lenders we reviewed. Lending Club is one of the biggest names in peer-to-peer loans, having financed over $20 billion in business or personal loans.Â ","When using a peer-to-peer lender like Lending Club, you apply as you would with any <a href=\"/best-online-personal-loans\">online loan company</a>. Like most online personal loan lenders, you can check your rates without impacting your credit score. The application process is easy, and you can upload any supporting documents you need via the site, or you can fax them.","If you qualify, the lender gives you several possible loan scenarios, and you select the one that works best for you. From there, Lending Club&#39;s investors review the basics of the loan package and decide whether to finance the loan or not. Investors do not see your personal information, and you do not interact with individual investors. However, it may take time for your loan to fully fund. Because it&#39;s a peer-to-peer lender, another possibility is that if your loan is approved, it may not be for the amount you requested.","Lending Club offers some flexibility with its loans, including the terms and repayment options. For example, you can pay online or via check. If you encounter hardships that affect your ability to make your minimum payments, you can contact them to see if you can work out a temporary arrangement to avoid defaulting on the loan.","We found the telephone customer service helpful and thorough. Although Lending Club offers support via email, we only received a generic response to the email we sent, and it did not answer our questions. Once you receive a loan with this company, you may receive a dedicated account manager, however, so you should have a personal point of contact.","Lending Club can offer you a variety of online personal loan options. It has flexibility, both in terms of the loan terms and your repayment options. However, it submits your loan request to its investors for consideration, which could result in delays or you not getting all the money you asked for."]},"id":"9eab2bb9-d6c6-4fe9-aa95-7ce892930f52","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67912","url":"/lending-club-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-05-24T17:02:20Z","datePublished":"2016-05-24T17:02:20Z","name":"Lending Club","synopsis":"Editor's note: Lending Club is currently the subject of an FTC lawsuit alleging it charges hidden fees and deducts double payments.","review":{"rating":39,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's note: Lending Club is currently the subject of an FTC lawsuit alleging it charges hidden fees and deducts double payments.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-04-25T00:00:00Z","id":"4j7fKQypwVbimEzU23NxQS","meta":{"title":"Lending Club Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lender of online personal loans, with good payment flexibility and customer support.
