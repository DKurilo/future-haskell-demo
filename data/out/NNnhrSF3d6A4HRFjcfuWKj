The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</a> here.</em>","The Sharp R-1405 ranks low on our lineup of over-the-range microwaves because of its lack of features, below average power and limited interior capacity. However, it is also one of the least expensive models on our lineup, so the lack of competitive features may be worth the savings for many buyers, especially with the impressive warranty.","Despite the lack of impressive functions like convection and sensor cooking, the Sharp R-14 still has basic features that are standard in most microwaves. This over-range microwave has a number of convenient, pre-programmed cycles. The four cooking cycles include baked potatoes, frozen entrees, fresh vegetables or frozen vegetables. If you need to defrost your meat before you cook it, this microwave has programs for ground meat, steaks and chops, and bone-in or boneless poultry. And if you&#39;re a fan of leftovers, you&#39;ll appreciate the reheat options with cycles for a dinner plate, beverages, breads and soup.","This over-the-range microwave oven also has some other useful features. The child lock prevents unapproved use of the microwave and makes cleaning the keypad easier because you won&#39;t press any buttons when you&#39;re wiping it clean. If you aren&#39;t a fan of the imposing ding when your food finishes cooking, you can turn off the end-of-cycle signal.","As mentioned above, this built-in microwave has less interior capacity at only 1.4 cubic feet, even though it has a standard-sized exterior. However, this microwave does include a rack to increase your cooking space. This unit also has less power than many other over-range microwaves with only 950 watts.","The ventilation system also has less power and capacity than most over-range microwaves. The fan only has one setting, which vents the air at 240 cubic feet per minute, well below the average among the models we reviewed. A nice feature is that the fan will automatically start when the microwave detects smoky air coming from your stovetop. The hood also has lights to make it easier to see what you&#39;re cooking on your range. The lights have two settings, and the low setting works as a nightlight.","This microwave has a very simple design that looks bulky and boxy. It comes in black or white, so it will fit many kitchens&#39; color palettes. The keypad is basic and easy to clean due to its flat buttons. This microwave&#39;s installation allows for exterior venting. If your kitchen can&#39;t support exterior venting, the fan will still filter and recirculate the air in your kitchen.","The warranty on this over-range microwave is the only part of this microwave that is above average. In addition to the standard one-year warranty on parts and labor, the manufacturer also offers a seven-year warranty on the main component in your microwave â€“ the magnetron. The extra warranty shows the manufacturer&#39;s confidence in its product."]},"id":"97d54f62-96de-4448-a547-dd6d60ecb6c4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a0fb8820-dc39-4cb9-a886-4b0ef59ffbe9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While a few of the Sharp R-1405&#39;s features are impressive, they do not make up for the lack of power and space in this microwave.
