Boost gives you twice as much hotspot data, but everything else is equal. Both give you HD streaming and unlimited talk, text and data. For an individual, Boost charges $60 a month for its Unlimited Plus plan and Sprint charges $65 for its Unlimited Freedom plan. For four lines, Boost costs $180 while Sprint costs $160. Unless you’re planning on using all of that 20GB of hotspot data per line, we’d recommend sticking with Sprint over Boost for unlimited options.","Boost Mobile’s performance is limited by its reliance on <a href=\"/sprint-pcs-review\">Sprint’s</a> network. Sprint currently has the slowest network of the Big Four carriers in the U.S, according to multiple third-party studies, such as those from RootMetrics, OpenSignal, Ookla and Tom’s Guide. Though the company is working on network improvements, it still hasn’t caught up with the competition.
