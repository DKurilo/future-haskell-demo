You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You may not always be looking for the next big thing in <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TVs</a>. Sometimes you’re just looking for a simple TV that you can watch your favorite movies and shows on. If you don’t need the greatest picture quality, features like built-in Wi-Fi, gesture controls or 3D compatibility, you might consider the Element LED TV. It does all the basics, but you won&#39;t have to pay an arm and a leg.","This Element LED TV may not have the greatest of scores in black level and color accuracy, but it still touts a full high definition 1080p display. Comparatively speaking, the picture of this TV will not look as bright and crisp as top-ranked LED TVs; however, you probably won’t notice a huge difference once you bring it home from the showroom floor. This TV only has a 60Hz refresh rate. Most high definition content can display at 120Hz with no problems, and 240Hz refresh rates are great for live sports and video games. The lower refresh rate means that during some fast action scenes you might see some objects blur out of focus. On the flip side, some people don’t like the “smooth camera soap opera effect” that you get with 120Hz. If you’re one of those people, you may actually prefer a TV like this Element brand.","Unlike top-quality LED TVs, the Element lacks features like wireless internet, 3D compatibility and gesture and voice control, which allow you to change settings and channels without using your remote control. While these features are nice to have, if all you’re looking for is a secondary TV, you may not use these features on a regular basis. In that case, you definitely don’t want to fork out the extra cash for them. A basic unit like the Element LED TV is perfect for you.","One fear you may have about an off-brand TV is reliability. Buying a lemon is not a common occurrence when buying a TV, but it does sometimes happen. It could happen when you buy a top-ranked TV as well. To protect your purchase, Element offers a standard one-year parts and labor warranty. If you need further assistance, you can check Element’s site for a toll free number or email support. Even though Element does not stand out as a name brand, having these support options will give you more piece of mind."]},"id":"32cbc14b-3f20-49ba-8660-c8cfd27c8a70","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"44e92830-bff7-4777-8d29-c8d5ed494a2c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Non-name brand LED TVs can work just as fine as high-end LED TVs, depending on your needs.
