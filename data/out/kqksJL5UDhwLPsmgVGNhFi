NFC and a passive mode make pairing and using these headphones much less complicated than comparable models. The touch-sensitive remote and free equalizer app are just a few of the extra features that put the Jabra Revo headphones above the competition.","The Jabra Revo Wireless headphones sound great whether you&#39;re commuting around town, on a flight or just at home enjoying an audiobook. High sensitivity and a wide frequency response give you a balanced sound with strong bass and warm trebles. The 40 mm driver produces better sound than other headphones with smaller drivers. Although these headphones don&#39;t support noise cancelling, they do work in passive mode so you can listen wired or wirelessly, which is convenient.","Many Bluetooth headsets can last through a full workday on one battery charge. The Jabra Revo Wireless headphones can last 12 hours in active mode and an impressive 240 hours in standby mode. The Revo Wireless headphones lasted longer than any other set we reviewed and the standby option helps extend the battery even further. The on-ear design isn&#39;t as comfortable as other headphones, but since this set weighs a little more than 8 ounces, they are much lighter than other bulky headphones.","The one-button remote is touch sensitive and easy to use once you read the manual. Pushing the center button pauses and plays your music while a double tap to the right or left will skip or repeat a song. Volume control works like a dial so swiping your finger clockwise around the center button will raise the volume.","Connecting the headphones to your phone or music device is simple. NFC (near-field communication) makes it even easier with a tap instead of a long connection process. A helpful voice through the headphones also walks you through the process. The wireless range of the Revo Wireless is 33 feet, which is about average for top Bluetooth headphones. When you want to listen with a wire instead of wireless, the included detachable cable allows you to continue listening when your battery gives out. The bright orange braided cord of the headset we reviewed was long and extra durable.","The included app makes the soundscape of the Jabra Revo Wireless more customizable. The free app allows you to adjust the equalizer, create playlists and listen in virtual Dolby surround sound. Very few Bluetooth headphones have this app option so itâ€™s an impressive addition to these headphones.","Similar to most Bluetooth headphones, a one-year warranty covers the Revo Wireless from defects. Jabra also offers email and phone support for your technical questions. If you want to peruse the help section on your own, you can also take a look at the FAQs or included user manual."]},"id":"7f0bd847-6f1c-409c-ad81-9567d2bf7358","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3873021d-bd0f-4b2e-97e8-e91edf95e1d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jabra Revo Wireless are some of the best Bluetooth headphones due to the large number of convenient features including passive listening, NFC connection and a touch-sensitive remote.
