Based on our research, the price for a well-built model with essential features such as a heavy flywheel, cushioned pedals and a connected console averages $1,500. Cheaper ellipticals tend to be less durable, have shorter warranties and fewer features. We reviewed elliptical machines with MSRPs ranging from $899 to $3,399.99. While MSRPs are steep, many machines are available at a discount.","As you’re considering the space you have available, make sure to allow for several inches around the machine. Some manufacturers also provide a recommendation for how much ceiling space you’ll need for the machine based on the height of the tallest user.","Shopping<br/>Once you’ve outlined your fitness goals, determined your budget and evaluated your space, finding the best elliptical for your home can be an exciting process. If you’re ordering online, thorough research can help you make a rewarding decision. If you’re visiting storefronts, visit more than one retailer and spend at least 10 minutes using each machine. This can help you find the right stride and identify which features matter most to you.","<strong>Advantages of an Elliptical Versus a Treadmill </strong>","The <a href=\"https://www.acsm.org/\">American College of Sports Medicine</a> recommends participating in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for a minimum of 30 minutes, five days per week. Treadmills and elliptical machines both offer a safe and easy way to raise your heart rate in the comfort of your home, but elliptical machines have a few significant benefits, especially for beginning-level runners.","Low-Impact Exercise<br/>Because your feet are constantly connected to the pedals on an elliptical machine, there&#39;s not as much stress on joints, ligaments and bones as running on a treadmill. Elliptical machines also remove issues with posture associated with running on a treadmill with a belt thinner than your natural gait.","Full-Body Workout<br/>All the elliptical machines we tested have arm handles in addition to pedals. Pushing and pulling on the arm handles provides a challenging workout for core muscles and your upper body. Any added movement in the upper body and core increases your ability to burn more calories and fat.","Reverse Pedaling<br/>Running backward is not a natural motion, so we recommend trying reverse strides at a slow pace to start. Pedaling in reverse is an effective way to put more emphasis on the rarely-used parts of the quads and hamstrings, and when you ratchet up the incline setting, it targets the glutes.","<strong>Fitness Tracking Apps for Runners </strong>","The best elliptical machines we tested track metrics like distance traveled, heart rate and calories burned. If you want more comprehensive tracking and an archive of all the exercises you complete, a fitness tracking app is a good option. These apps work best in conjunction with wrist-worn tracking devices, but you can manually enter info and share your achievements across social media platforms without one. If you decide to leave the comfort of your exercise room to run in a more scenic venue, these apps track your route and offer additional motivation through music and virtual coaches.","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nike+-running/id387771637?mt=8\">Nike Run Club</a><br/>This was the precursor to all other run tracking apps and still provides the most comprehensive tracking and motivational features. It’s free to download on iOS and Android devices, including the Apple Watch and Android-compatible wearables. Nike Run Club includes audio guided workouts with professional trainers, athletes and entertainers like Kevin Hart to help improve your personal records, while still having fun. You can join the Nike Run Club community to participate in weekly and monthly distance challenges and receive trophies and badges for breaking personal time and distance records.","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/running-walking-endomondo/id333210180?mt=8\">Endomondo</a><br/>This run tracking app has similar tracking features and compatibility as the Nike Run Club app, but it has a unique interface which adds goals and lets you participate in challenges that include prizes. The free version has a great selection of tracking features, workout goals and social media integration. Endomondo Premium costs $6 per month and adds personalized training plans, interval training and removes the ads. If you don’t plan to use a wearable heart-rate monitor, this is the best app for elliptical workouts because it is the easiest to manually log workouts.","<strong>Fitness Trackers That Don’t Break the Bank </strong>","The best elliptical machines we tested have pulse grips to monitor your heart rate during workouts, but if you want more accurate readings and comprehensive fitness feedback, a proper fitness tracker is the best option. Here are a couple of our favorite budget-friendly fitness trackers.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTN21JL/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Fitbit Charge 3 - $149</a><br/>The latest version of the Fitbit Charge has a larger screen and is lighter than its predecessor. Once you start running, the Charge 3 automatically monitors your activity and sends important heart-rate and calorie-burn information to the Fitbit app or any compatible third-party fitness-tracking app. It also has a sleep-tracking function that includes a silent-alarm mode to gently wake you at the optimal time without disturbing your bedmate. The battery lasts up to seven days on a charge, and there are five color options.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvosmart-Activity-Fitness-Tracker/dp/B07GM7WHBG/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Garmin Vivosmart 4 - $129</a><br/>The Garmin Vivosmart 4 isn’t as attractive as the Fitbit, but the slim design and comfortable silicone strap make it the perfect companion for an elliptical workout. It has a Pulse Ox sensor to estimate blood oxygen saturation, a heart-rate sensor and a unique Body Battery energy-monitoring feature that tells you when your body is ready for activity and when you need to rest. Unlike some other wearable fitness trackers, the Vivosmart 4 does not have a removable band – the silicone strap is permanently attached to the device – so take some time to choose among the four color options. The battery lasts up to seven days and takes only an hour to charge. However, if you use the Pulse Ox sleep-tracking function, expect to charge the Vivosmart 4 every five days or so.","<strong>Elliptical Training Apps </strong>","The best elliptical machines we tested have more than 30 built-in workout programs. However, if you get bored with those programs or want a change of scenery while you work out, you can use mobile apps with interactive personal trainers. Here are some of our favorite training apps with specific workouts for elliptical machines:","<a href=\"http://www.motiontraxx.com/\">Motion Traxx</a><br/>This cardio training app uses the popular HIIT (high-intensity interval training) program delivered by fitness experts with a wide range of professional accomplishments. One unique aspect of Motion Traxx is the Action Sync feature, which pairs a music soundtrack with a workout to create the perfect pace and flow. The music is curated by Deekron, a fitness DJ and endurance athlete. You can get Motion Traxx for Android or iOS devices for $10 per month or try five sessions for free.","<a href=\"https://www.bitgym.com/\">BitGym</a><br/>BitGym uses the front-facing camera on your phone or tablet to sync your pace and intensity with the visually stunning interface. This app has more than 100 tours that are designed to make you feel like you are running on a mountain trail network, secluded beach or other scenic location. The high-definition video has accompanying audio motivation from virtual trainers. There’s a free trial for iOS, Android and Amazon devices, and a subscription costs $8 per month.","<br/><strong>Best Smart Water Bottles </strong>","Proper hydration is an important component of any successful exercise regimen. Here are some smart water bottles to use in conjunction with elliptical machines to ensure you get every drop from your daily exercise routines.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hidrate-Spark-2-0-Smart-Bottle/dp/B06XRL8RS5/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Hidrate Spark 2.0</a><br/>This smart water bottle has a sensor that tracks how much water you drink and sends the tracking information to the Hidrate companion app or other popular fitness apps, such as MyFitnessPal, Apple Health and Google Fit. This water bottle isn’t ideal for jogs through the neighborhood because the sensor requires you to put the bottle on a hard surface between sips. However, that doesn’t affect its functionality when it&#39;s used with an elliptical machine with cupholders. The sensor is attached to a straw that&#39;s mounted on the lid of the bottle. It has multicolored LEDs to remind you when to take a drink, and the lights flash when you meet your daily hydration goals.  ","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HydraCoach-2-0-Hydration-Mediterranean-Flexitarian/dp/B07FYQ4Q1C/\">HydraCoach 2.0</a><br/>The HydraCoach doesn’t sync wirelessly with fitness apps like the Hidrate smart water bottle does, but it uses similar tracking sensors to monitor your water intake. There’s a removable drink monitor that displays the amount and percentage of water consumed relative to your personal hydration goal. When you remove the drink monitor, you can easily clean the BPA-free plastic bottle, which is dishwasher-safe. The durable bottle fits in standard-size cupholders, and because the HydraCoach is clear, you can easily see when you need to refill it.","<br/>","<strong>More Exercise Equipment Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"a99833f1-7ce1-4dee-ba5d-bfdb9eddb1a0","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-home-gyms\">The Best Home Gyms</a> ","<a href=\"/best-exercise-bikes\">The Best Exercise Bikes</a>","<a href=\"/best-bike-trainers-review\">The Best Bike Trainers</a>","<a href=\"/best-treadmills\">The Best Treadmills</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"78f0a259-e06f-43d5-b464-44f7e33820c5","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"4a8b2c05-0730-4f5f-957f-e529ec04df3d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/nordictrack-review\">NordicTrack C12.9</a>","<a href=\"/bowflex-review\">Bowflex BXE216 Elliptical</a>","<a href=\"/nautilus-e618-review\">Nautilus E618 Elliptical</a>","<a href=\"/nordictrack-c9.5-review\">NordicTrack C9.5</a>","<a href=\"/proform-smart-pro-review\">ProForm Pro 12.9 Elliptical</a>","<a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm SMART Endurance 920E</a>","<a href=\"/schwinn-470-review\">Schwinn 470</a>","<a href=\"/sole-e35-review\">Sole Fitness E35</a>","<a href=\"/sole-e95-review\">SOLE E95</a>","<a href=\"/horizon-evolve-5-review\">Horizon Evolve 5</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"27a4ad11-3cde-4c3d-87a8-66f75889fe18","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_30","url":"/best-elliptical-machines","authors":[{"email":"jchristensen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-05T03:56:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-05T03:56:00Z","name":"Best Elliptical Machines of 2019","synopsis":"We jumped on a dozen elliptical machines and talked with trainers and a physical therapist to rank 10 elliptical trainers from best to worst.","review":{},"strapline":"We jumped on a dozen elliptical machines and talked with trainers and a physical therapist to rank 10 elliptical trainers from best to worst.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-05T18:49:14Z","id":"JYKK3wSusDCy7gn9Gcy5v8","meta":{"title":"Best Elliptical Machines 2019 -
