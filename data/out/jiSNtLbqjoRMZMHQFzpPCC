Learning about the differences between them will help you choose the right one.","<strong>Humidifiers vs. Vaporizers</strong><br/>Vaporizers use heat to boil water and release steam into the room. Cool mist humidifiers, on the other hand, disperse water into the air at cooler temperatures by means of evaporation, rotating disks or ultrasound vibrations.","<strong>How to Use a Humidifier</strong><br/>It is important to keep humidifiers very clean, as bacteria can build up in any moist environment. If the humidifier releases bacteria or other contaminants into the air, infections can occur. Minerals contained in tap water can also be released by a humidifier. Physicians recommend that parents use distilled water to fill cool-mist humidifiers for this reason. If a vaporizer is used, it should be placed out of the reach of children, due to the potential burning hazard from hot water and steam."]},"id":"a8a0bf57-bf56-437b-90aa-06ee13e5bc9b","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Humidifiers for Babies: What to Look For</strong><br/>Some physicians recommend steam vaporizers and evaporation humidifiers because these models don&#39;t spread minerals and bacteria throughout the air.
