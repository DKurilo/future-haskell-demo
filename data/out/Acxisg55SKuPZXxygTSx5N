Or, you ve been assigned to complete an employee s performance appraisal, but how do you provide an objective judgment? You need a <a href=\"/best-nanny-cams\">nanny cam</a>. With so many options available, however, how do you choose one?","A nanny cam or spy camera is an effective way to observe your employees or babysitter when they think they aren t being watched. Disguised as a variety of everyday objects, nanny cams secretly record video with a hidden camera. Often used by curious parents or employers, nanny cams can be applied to a number of other situations such as supervising in-home cleaning services or providing security while you re away.","Not too long ago, nanny cams were complicated to set up and install, and they required wires for power and a recording signal that you also had to hide, but times have changed. Modern spy cameras record video in two basic methods: <strong>Built-in DVR Recorder vs. Wi-Fi Enabled Nanny Cams</strong>. Here we ll discuss the main differences between these two types of cameras and highlight the drawbacks and advantages of each option.","<strong>Wi-Fi Enabled Devices</strong>","Wireless cameras connect to a computer or other recording device over a wireless connection. These systems provide a range of recording capabilities and durations. You can place a Wi-Fi enabled camera anywhere in your home or office as long as it has a Wi-Fi network, eliminating the need to run wires throughout your home. This makes installation easier than an old-fashioned wired surveillance camera. One major drawback of a Wi-Fi enabled camera is the need for special software and additional devices. With these systems, you need a computer or other device to record and view your footage. A simpler alternative is a DVR recorder that has a built-in storage device.","<strong>DVR Devices</strong>","A DVR camera is an alternative to complex Wi-Fi systems. DVR recorder systems have a built-in recording device   usually an SD card. Since a DVR recorder has the ability to record footage internally, the entire device is self-contained and does not require wires or external receivers. Portability and ease of use is why we recommend a DVR recorder device.","To watch the recorded footage, most devices come with easy hookups in the form of an RCA cable to connect the camera to a TV, or a removable SD card that you can insert into your computer. Recording space may be limited, though, because most DVR devices have a fixed amount of memory, but many devices on the market have substantial memory capacities.","<strong>Our Pick</strong>","We ve selected the <a href=\"/dvrdmdc-alarm-clock-review\">DVRDMDC Alarm Clock</a> as our <strong>TopTenREVIEWS Gold Award</strong> winner because of its ease of use, portability and recording options. As a DVR recorder, this nanny cam doesn t require wireless accessories or extra hookups. This means you can place the camera anywhere and immediately begin to gather video evidence in color.
