The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-car-battery-chargers\">Car Battery Chargers</a>Â here.</em>","The CTEK Multi US 7002 is an automatic car battery charger that has a surprising amount of power despite its small size. This 12V charger comes equipped with an intelligent microprocessing unit that utilizes four different modes for charging and an overarching, automated, 8-stage recharging sequence.","Operating this auto battery booster is simple, as all you do is connect the clamps to your battery posts and select a mode using the push button controls. You can also just let the automated sequence decide what to do with the battery. The four modes you can choose from are &#34;Normal,&#34; &#34;Snowflake&#34;, &#34;Supply&#34; and &#34;Recondition.&#34;","In Normal mode, a battery will go through seven phases of charging beginning with the desulphation phase and ending with the maintenance-charging phase while being charged at 14.4 volts. Snowflake mode is for charging in colder weather, while Supply is used for batteries that must maintain a high capacity at all times, including batteries for golf carts and floor sweepers. Recondition is specifically designed to recover deep discharged and flooded batteries using a constant current charge of 1.5 amps and a maximum voltage level of 15.7 volts.","While the CTEK Multi US 7002 is an effective charger, it does lack the function of being able to jump-start batteries installed in a vehicle.","One of the best features of this car battery charger is its ability to charge nearly every battery type available. This includes the common acid-lead batteries found in most automobiles and boats, but the CTEK Multi US 7002 can also successfully charge deep-cycle, gel-cell and automated glass mat, or AGM, batteries.","Because this battery booster automatically analyzes the charge and type of battery you connect it to, you can charge the batteries for your car, truck, marine vehicle, lawn mower or golf cart without worrying about using an incorrect setting or overcharging your battery.","The CTEK Multi US 7002 includes all the safety features the best car battery boosters feature, such as insulated, spark-resistant clamps. The automated charging feature of this unit is programmed to prevent overloading your batteries, and the charger will automatically sense when the maximum charge has been delivered, then stop supplying power. The CTEK Multi US 7002 also features a reverse polarity warning light that turns on if you have placed the clamps on the incorrect battery post.","While it is not truly equipped to be portable, the small, compact size of the CTEK Multi US 7002 makes it easy to store and even install permanently in your garage or shop. This battery booster requires a wall outlet to function, and it is recommended that you use an extension cord, as the power cord is not very long."]},"id":"a327db4d-29ea-4e18-9fc3-79768d2a393f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"25d65cf2-156d-44cd-b42e-8b9486db4240","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When it comes to charging your vehicle batteries, the CTEK Multi US 7002 is a powerful, capable unit.
