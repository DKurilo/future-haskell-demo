This versatile laser printer makes it easy to print from anywhere.","This mono laser printer prints a speedy 35 pages per minute after it takes about 8 seconds to warm up. Many laser printers we reviewed took much longer to warm up, and they printed at a slower pace. The print speed from the HP LaserJet Pro is impressive.","This is a monochrome laser printer unable to print in color. Its black-and-white prints boast a resolution of 1,200 dots per inch (dpi), producing sharp text documents and decent black-and-white images.","Cutting printing costs is an important part of any printing operation. The standard toner that comes with the LaserJet Pro M401dw has a toner yield of 2,700 prints. This means that it can print an average of 2,700 pages before you run out of toner. You can buy replacement toner with a higher toner yield for a little extra money but it will save you replacement costs in the long run. This printer also has an automatic duplexer so you can cut your paper costs in half by printing on both sides of the paper.","The LaserJet Pro holds 250 pages of paper in the standard tray and 50 pages in the multipurpose tray. With the multipurpose tray you can print an array of different sizes of media including prints as small as 3 x 5 inches. You can add another tray that holds up to 500 sheets of paper. This printer’s total paper handling capacity is 800 pages.","Your network can wirelessly connect to this laser printer via Wi-Fi. You can also wirelessly print using the LaserJet Pro M401 via the HP ePrint app or Apple AirPrint. Both are applications for mobile phones that allow you to print directly from your phone to the laser printer without the use of any cables or flash drives.","This HP laser printer is covered by a one-year warranty. If you have any issues with your printer, you can contact HP via live chat, phone or email."]},"id":"628b6e9d-54b9-418d-a861-a356f579b30e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3432bc8b-078d-40b4-9957-e8fd26d5a6a8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP LaserJet Pro M401dw is a speedy monochrome laser printer with a handful of wireless capabilities.
