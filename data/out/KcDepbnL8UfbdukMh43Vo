If you’re not trying to create a gourmet kitchen setup at home, consider the KitchenAid® 30-Inch 4-Element Induction Cooktop, Architect® Series II KICU500XBL. It offers all of the basic functions you’d expect in the best induction cooktops, without the extra cost-raising features that you might not need.","This induction cooktop has nine heat levels, much like your average conventional electric cooktop. But it also has a boost function that increases the power temporarily to boil water faster, as well as a simmer function and a “melt and hold” setting that gently melts things such as chocolate or butter, then stays at a low temperature to keep them melted without burning.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"4f6937c2-4106-43f0-bc59-5e0a44905b38","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/GpCmgDv2fuauR4Xf93yecH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This all-black ceramic glass cooktop will seamlessly integrate with any kitchen, though if you have other stainless steel appliances you may want to consider the model that features a stainless steel border. But this induction cooktop isn’t just about form and aesthetics; its convenient design places the larger burners in the back and toward the center of the unit, with the smaller ones in front and toward the outer edges. This means that even if all four burners are in use, you should never have a problem reaching the food you’re cooking.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57630-kitchenaid-30-inch-4-element-induction-cooktop-architect-series-ii-kicu500xbl2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GpCmgDv2fuauR4Xf93yecH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"GpCmgDv2fuauR4Xf93yecH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GpCmgDv2fuauR4Xf93yecH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e40d27de-22a0-404a-b46e-944daae23d23","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have customer service or technical support questions, you can contact KitchenAid staff via live chat, phone or online email form.
