Email is simply not up to the task of project management. Task management software, on the other hand, not only lets managers delegate specific assignments but also creates a cloud-stored project base where the entire team can see the steps needed for completion, track progress, load and collaborate on files, and communicate with each other within the project. With mobile and computer-based interfaces and cloud storage, task manager software makes it easy to keep the team in the loop and on track to make your next big project a success.","All of the programs on our list have task delegation tools and collaboration features that make them suitable for program management in small or large businesses or other organizations. Each has additional features that made it stand out. For example, with <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/todoist/\">Todoist</a>, you can set reminders not only by time, but also by location, making it handy for companies who have projects whose parts are in multiple locations. A couple applications include a rewards system for giving quick kudos, while some have Gantt charts for visualizing timelines and core processes. Nearly all of these come with a free version, but the paid versions have more features and allow for greater interaction among team members.","Nonetheless, the products listed here are simpler versions targeted at project completion rather than full-out project and employee management. A few, such as <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/hitask/\">hiTask</a>, also have timers and accounting features like the ability to record billable hours. However, if you need a truly robust system that includes budgeting, request management, portfolio management, and employee scheduling and tracking, check out our <a href=\"/money/small-business\">online project management reviews</a>.","<strong>Task Management Software: What to Look For</strong>","Each business has different processes and thus different needs for a task management solution. However, regardless of whether you create in-depth marketing for a client or design custom bicycles, you need software that lets you communicate easily, tracks your progress, holds important documents and responds to collaborators and clients. Thus, you should consider these aspects when evaluating a task manager program:","<strong>Simplicity</strong><br/>No matter how many exciting tools a task management program has, it&#39;s worthless unless everyone can use it. The best software is easy to work, with the most common tasks readily available, plain-language scheduling, and clear menus and search functions. Most have a simple to-do list/project organization, but some have different approaches. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/droptask/\">DropTask</a>, for example, employs a mind-mapping approach that is colorful and visually appealing. Several, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/basecamp/\">Basecamp</a>, can store projects as templates, so that if you have specific products you create again and again, you can call up the template rather than reinventing it.","Several, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/asana/\">asana</a>, allow you to not only have a team section for assigning tasks but also a personal section for errands and home projects. This not only allows you to clear your mind of tasks that need to be done later, but it also keeps them in one central interface so you don&#39;t have to switch programs or lists between work and home.","<strong>Task &amp; Reminder Setting</strong><br/>Task creation, delegation and reminders are the core of any program, so look for the interactivity and convenience tools that best suit your needs. Some, like DropTask, let you tie a task to multiple projects so when you cross off one task, you see the project&#39;s progress toward completion. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/mavenlink/\">Mavenlink</a> lets you set alerts so that if a task is dependent on the completion of another task, the person responsible gets pinged when the required item is completed.","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/workboard/\">Workboard</a> takes tasks and projects one step further by aligning them to company goals and metrics. That way, employees see how their daily action items contribute to the overall health of the company as a goal.","<strong>Collaboration with Employees &amp; Customers</strong><br/>Most productivity experts say the key to <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5352-smart-leadership.html\">effectively managing your time is to delegate tasks</a>. You can find plenty of articles about choosing which tasks are best to delegate and how to motivate your employees and coworkers. Team task management tools help you practice those principles. They let you create tasks, assign them to others, set deadlines and include notes. They store all the necessary electronic materials, such as files, charts, images and videos, in the project or task itself so things are easy to find and access.","The best task management software should also provide ways to communicate among team members, and some allow communication outside the team. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/producteev/\">Producteev</a>, for example, allows you to set followers who do not have editing capability but can see the team progress and participate in conversations. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/flow/\">Flow</a> uses a unique function similar to Facebook&#39;s Like button so people can acknowledge they have read a notification without having to comment on it.","<strong>Reports &amp; Status Updates</strong><br/>While all task management software tracks project completion, businesses need more: a way to send status updates managers or clients, report generation tools to display overall progress and identify stopgaps, and charts that show deadlines and the relationships between tasks. Most of the software we profiled have some form of reporting, and a few have several report types plus export features so you can use the graphics and data when presenting to a client or briefing at your monthly update meeting. In fact, some of the companies we looked at suggest that with these tools, bosses can generate the reports at will and forego the meeting altogether.","<strong>Integration with Other Software &amp; Mobile Devices</strong> <br/>Experts say that one issue with mobile devices is that people always feel pinned to their job, receiving pings about this or that task while they&#39;re unable to do anything about them. This is because often the tools they need are locked in the office computer, or the individual needs a specific program or contact they don t have on hand. By keeping everything stored in the project itself, task management software allows you to get the information you need to finish urgent tasks or to create or pass on a reminder to complete the action item the next business day.","Since the goal of task management software is to have everything needed for a project in a central location all collaborators can access, it&#39;s important that it works with third-party programs. Nearly all have functionality with Google programs like Gmail and Google Drive, but many integrate with Outlook, Dropbox, Evernote, and the best integrate with the most-used business software like QuickBooks and Salesforce. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/wrike/\">Wrike</a>, in particular, is a powerhouse with 35 integrations.","<strong>Conclusion</strong>","Email collaboration is losing its efficiency in the cloud-based and increasingly mobile business environment. Task management software meets the needs of modern businesses by providing an easy-to-use and widely accessible platform for planning and collaborating on projects. With the right software, your company can save time, improve the quality of its work and make your customers happier."]},"id":"58487d95-1067-449d-9fea-6b5c1abb2f24","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"108555c2-9dea-4e33-be22-ede63662e09c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://asana.com/pricing\">Asana</a>","<a href=\"https://basecamp.com/start\">Basecamp</a>","<a href=\"https://www.droptask.com/pricing\">DropTask</a>","<a href=\"https://www.getflow.com/pricing/\">Flow</a>","<a href=\"https://hitask.com/tour\">hiTask</a>","<a href=\"https://www.mavenlink.com/pricing/project-management-software-comparison\">Mavenlink</a>","<a href=\"https://www.producteev.com/pricing\">Producteev</a>","<a href=\"https://en.todoist.com/\">Todoist</a>","<a href=\"http://www.workboard.com/pricing/\">Workboard</a>","<a href=\"https://www.wrike.com/price/\">Wrike</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"db968dc8-def0-4f5d-b087-72717bb45ce9","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1820","url":"/best-task-management-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-17T16:29:02Z","datePublished":"2015-10-06T17:50:42Z","name":"Task Management Software Review","synopsis":"Whether your project team is scattered across the globe or gathered in a single office, projects work better when you have a central area for task delegation, file storage and communication.","review":{},"strapline":"Whether your project team is scattered across the globe or gathered in a single office, projects work better when you have a central area for task delegation, file storage and communication.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-06T17:50:42Z","id":"mU4KH5hdjvPcDVVY7szUST","meta":{"title":"The Best Task Management Software | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Our teams have compared the best task management software for 2017.
