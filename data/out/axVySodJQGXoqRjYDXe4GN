We identified this <a href=\"/best-truck-rental-services\">truck rental service</a> as the best value because of frequent promotions and competitive daily and mileage rates. If you get a cheaper quote from another truck rental service, Budget might also match or beat the price.","There are three different truck sizes: 12-foot, 16-foot and 24-foot. This is a smaller selection than most of the services we reviewed, but should cover a variety of moving situations. <a href=\"/u-haul-review\">U-Haul</a>, however, has the best selection of truck sizes. Budget’s smallest moving truck only has seating for two people, but the two larger trucks can seat three people. The two larger trucks also include a loading ramp and the ability to tow a vehicle. You can rent a tow dolly for front-wheel-drive cars, or a car carrier, which is best for four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles.","Budget also rents furniture pads and hand trucks to help you move heavy furniture and protect it from the metal interior. Budget sells boxes, which is an advantage because when you buy boxes from a moving truck company, all the boxes are the same size, which makes it easy to stack and pack them.","Budget uses the same algorithm other truck rental companies use to estimate truck rental rates, but Budget often has a promotion or coupon code that can save a significant percentage off your quote. Prices are often lower if you make a reservation as far in advance as you can, and if you reserve a truck between Sunday and Thursday because weekends are busier. Special discounts apply for senior citizens, military personnel, students and more, so ask about those discounts before you finalize your reservation. If you get a better quote from a local truck rental company, Budget can often match a competitor&#39;s price.","It&#39;s important to remember that Budget does not offer a guarantee on reservations for rental trucks. The company claims it doesn’t overbook, but overlapping is sometimes unavoidable. The truck you plan to rent may not be ready for you when you&#39;re ready for it, but the managers can work with you and offer a different size truck or a new pickup time. If you need to cancel your reservation, do so at least 48 hours before the pickup time to avoid a $50 fee.","Budget has several supplemental insurance options that covers you, your belongings and the truck in case of an accident. All the coverage options include roadside assistance and coverage for the truck, but the more comprehensive packages add coverage for bodily injury and your cargo.","Budget is our pick for best value truck rental service due to frequent coupons and promotions, and price matching. The truck selection isn’t as varied as the best services we reviewed, and the lack of guaranteed reservations is inconvenient. However, for a cost-effective truck rental for one-way or local moves, Budget is the best option."]},"id":"a84bab48-ecc5-4664-80ec-84876fabb2cc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50314","url":"/budget-truck-rental-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-09T17:33:48Z","datePublished":"2010-08-09T17:33:48Z","name":"Budget Truck Rental","synopsis":"Budget Truck Rental has more than 1,100 locations in all 48 contiguous states, and a great selection of additional equipment and services.
