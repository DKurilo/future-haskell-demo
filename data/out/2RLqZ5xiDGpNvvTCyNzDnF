You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Although Comcast is primarily a telecommunications company, it also offers <a href=\"/best-home-security-monitoring\">home security monitoring</a> through its Xfinity Home service. The company has reasonable monitoring fees and contract terms. For monitoring services, it offers a decent set of features and customer support. However, the company doesn&#39;t offer security for businesses and lacks email as a support method. If you&#39;re already a Comcast internet or cable customer, you can add this service to your contract.","In terms of starting costs, monthly monitoring fees and the equipment return policy, there&#39;s not much difference between Xfinity Home and the competition. However, the company offers a better contract term of two years, whereas the industry average is three years. The company&#39;s cancellation policy requires a prorated fee that starts at $660 and goes down $30 for every completed month of service. This works out to around 75 percent of the total contract cost and is comparable to the policies of the <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">best home security companies</a>.","Xfinity Home offers two home security monitoring plans, Secure 300 and Secure 350, which you can bundle with any of Comcast&#39;s other services, such as a cable or internet subscription. Most alarm monitoring companies offer three monitoring plans, so Xfinity Home doesn&#39;t give you as many starting options. As with other home security companies, you can customize each plan&#39;s equipment offerings with devices such as security cameras, but this adds to your price. Xfinity Home also offers takeover monitoring that works with most existing security systems, so you can use its service with equipment you already own. Only about half of the companies in our comparison offer such a service.","While you don&#39;t need to buy internet from Comcast to get security monitoring, Xfinity Home requires a broadband internet connection. You also need to be within Comcast&#39;s service area, which isn&#39;t nationwide. This is a definite disadvantage in relation to most home security companies in our review, which have nationwide service areas.","At the beginning of your contract, Comcast sends a technician to your home to install your security equipment. You can control this equipment using the Xfinity Home mobile app on Android and iOS smartphones. The equipment warranty varies based on the plan you choose with a limited warranty on Secure 300 and a lifetime warranty on Secure 350. For an additional fee, you can get a lifetime warranty on Secure 300 as well. If you need to contact Comcast for customer support, you can do so by phone or live chat; the company does not offer email support."]},"id":"1f5b6be6-4667-48d9-adcd-5e9ded25b1fb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"988cd3f8-89f8-46ef-9ecb-58cbdc4f5147","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Xfinity Home&#39;s contract terms, especially contract length and cancellation policy, are very good.
