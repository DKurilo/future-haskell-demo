This means whether you need a small or large bed, you can enjoy the comfortable feel of this mattress at a price and size suitable to your needs.","The Sealy Posturepedic Gel Series Kitchener is among the best mattress options available as it includes a number of interesting and unique features, foremost among them being the tied coil system with a dual stage design. The first stage reacts to the curves of your body and contours to it, whereas the second stage of padding gives significant support to your back. By distributing your weight evenly, the presence of the springs under the pillow top becomes much more subtle and allows for a deeper sleeping experience at night.","The dual stage system is complemented by the Sealy CoreSupport Center with gel memory foam. Below the pillow top element is a reinforcing layer with gel memory foam that provides the utmost comfort for sleepers. A common problem mentioned in the best mattress reviews is the presence of a chemical smell in memory foam mattresses, but due to the limited amount of memory foam used here, you won’t notice the smell much at the start.","In addition to this memory foam layer, another layer of gel memory foam in the pillow top reduces the need for tossing and turning. Another benefit of this added layer of gel memory foam is that it helps the mattress retain its shape for longer and prevents gradual indentation that occurs with prolonged use.","The Sealy Posturepedic Gel Series Kitchener pillow top bed has all the comfort components to give you a good night’s rest. It provides significant support to the lower back and successfully combines both pillow top foam and memory foam layers into a sturdy and cushioned top."]},"id":"9cbaa6f3-9475-4ba2-ab80-5215470870af","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57305","url":"/posturepedic-gel-series-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-27T01:19:02Z","datePublished":"2013-08-27T01:19:02Z","name":"Posturepedic Gel Series","synopsis":"The desired purpose of a pillow top mattress is to create a soft and supportive sleep surface.
