The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-baby-video-monitors\">Baby Video Monitors</a> here.</em>","Infant Optics&#39; DXR-5 is a simplified version of the DXR-8 model. While it&#39;s functional as a video baby monitor, it lacks many of the features that make the best video baby monitors convenient. That said, the DXR-5&#39;s audio monitoring is good and the support options are strong. What this video baby monitor lacks in features, it tries to make up for in mobility and functionality – and it mostly succeeds.","You can expect a pretty good transmission range from the DXR-5. Infant Optics advertises the range as 800 feet, but your mileage may vary because the signal is likely to pass through walls in your home. There are also other interfering issues to consider. But that&#39;s something that all video baby monitors have to deal with.","One of the biggest disappointments with the DXR-5 is its small screen. At only 2.4 inches and with a resolution of only 320 x 240, the screen just doesn&#39;t give you much detail. Yes, you&#39;ll be able to see your baby, but it may be difficult to make out facial expressions or much else. However, the DXR-5&#39;s infrared night vision does a pretty good job of keeping your baby visible even when it&#39;s dark.","As far as audio monitoring is concerned, the DXR-5 puts several useful tools at your disposal. We&#39;re big fans of the two-way talk feature that the best video baby monitors include, and the DXR-5&#39;s implementation is excellent. This allows you to soothe your baby, even when you&#39;re not close to him. We also looked at voice activation, or VOX, in all of our baby video monitor reviews. The DXR-5 activates itself when it hears noise in the baby&#39;s room.","We were disappointed with this baby video monitor&#39;s battery life. At only four hours of consecutive use, the device needs to be recharged more frequently than is convenient. Any mobility the DXR-5 has is negated when you have to plug it in. That means you have to spend more time around an outlet, rather than doing whatever you want."]},"id":"23a7099b-1add-4498-bee5-f4775f61aec1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a2d09e74-ffdb-4681-94c9-957f82b60315","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Infant Optics DXR-5 is a decent video baby monitor, but it lacks many of the features that you&#39;d find in the best video baby monitors.
