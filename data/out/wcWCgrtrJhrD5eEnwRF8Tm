With Square Cash, it offers the same convenience and security but with funds transferred directly to and from bank accounts â€“ no card reader required. You can use Square Cash for both <a href=\"/best-p2p-payments\">person-to-person (P2P) payments</a> as well as business transactions.","The Square Cash app works on both iOS and Android operating systems. It even works on Apple Watch. If you want to pay someone from your computer, you can go to the Square Cash website and pay there. You need the person&#39;s email or phone number or his or her cashtag. You put in the information, the amount and a note, if you wish.","To use this service, you need to link a Visa, MasterCard or Discover debit card to your Square account. Payments are deposited directly to your bank, so there&#39;s no third-party account to worry about. Transactions can take seconds to complete. Most P2P payment systems require a processing time of one to five days.","Square Cash can work for peer-to-peer payments, such as paying back your friend for the ski tickets he got for you, or it can be used for business transactions. Personal transactions made using your debit card are free. Personal transactions made using a credit card and business transactions come with a fee, but it&#39;s a convenient way to send and accept payments using your phone.","Both businesses and individuals can get a cashtag ($YourName), which you can link to your Square Cash account. You can share this tag with your friends and family members in order to make it easier to receive money from them or to use when you need to get a payment from someone but don&#39;t necessarily want to share your phone number or email.","Square Cash transactions are PCI-DSS level 1 encrypted, which is the same level of security Square uses for its commercial accounts. Transactions are secured by a passcode. It has optional touch ID verification and CVV entry. Square also offers fraud protection against unauthorized charges and has chargeback protections up to $250 per month.","Square is making it easier for businesses to do transactions by adding Square Cash, which allows customers to pay directly from their bank accounts using an email, phone number or cashtag. This same service is available for person-to-person payments. If you are looking for an easier way to send or receive money among friends and family, this is a secure and convenient service."]},"id":"d4d8d425-4768-4b38-a162-ba867daaabbe","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67662","url":"/square-cash-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T17:41:55Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T17:41:55Z","name":"Square Cash","synopsis":"Since 2009, Square has been helping small businesses, solopreneurs and individuals process non-cash payments with its credit card processing service.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Since 2009, Square has been helping small businesses, solopreneurs and individuals process non-cash payments with its credit card processing service.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-02-05T17:41:55Z","id":"wcWCgrtrJhrD5eEnwRF8Tm","meta":{"title":"Square Cash P2P Payments Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Square Cash&#039;s P2P payment system works for both individuals and businesses and offers secure sending and receiving of money.
