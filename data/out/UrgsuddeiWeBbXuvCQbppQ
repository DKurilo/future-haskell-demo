Our goal in choosing the best overall product was to find a reliable device that makes the cooking process convenient. We brought the best machines into our test kitchen so we could try them for ourselves and make informed comparisons.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","In our testing, we compared nine waffle makers by cooking more than 240 waffles. After all was said and done, we spent over 50 hours researching, testing and comparing. We wanted to determine the convenience and reliability of each product and did so by making a list of each device&#39;s features and comparing them against each other.","More points were awarded to products that feature an audio beeper since this allows you to focus on other things instead of constantly monitoring your waffle maker until it is done cooking. We measured the accuracy of each waffle maker&#39;s light and sound indicators. Points were also awarded to devices that made waffles that were 7 inches wide or larger since this gives you more food.","We determined our design ratings based on how much space the unit takes up on a countertop. Smaller products that can store upright with cords wrapped up scored higher since this saves more room. Waffle makers with heat-resistant handles were also awarded more points since they are less likely to burn you.","We timed the heat-up, cooking and clean-up times of each device and awarded more points to the machines that save you time. Since clean-up can be a tricky and unpleasant process, we also awarded more points to units that feature a no-drip design and non-stick surfaces. The standard warranty for waffle makers covers one year. We awarded more points to products that had longer than average warranties.","<strong>How Much Does a Waffle Maker Cost?</strong>","There are waffle makers on the market to fit every budget—ranging between $20 and $60. Most of the waffle makers we tested were around $50 but there are some as much as $130. We recommend buying a mid-priced model to get a longer device lifespan and cooking quality, as you get the same results you would from a high-priced model.","<strong>How to Choose a Waffle Maker</strong>","Because these appliances perform a simple task, we wanted to pick ones that are easy to use. We whipped up a traditional homemade batter and made multiple batches with each waffle iron to see if they could produce consistent results. We also tested each machine with a blueberry batch and a chocolate chip batch to see how well each device handled mix-ins.","In our research, we looked for some tried and true recipes for waffle batter and were surprised at just how creative people all around the country got with their waffle makers. Some of the recipes we wanted to try in future testing (or just at home) included <a href=\"https://www.purewow.com/food/how-to-make-an-omelette-in-a-waffle-iron\">omelettes</a>, <a href=\"https://kirbiecravings.com/waffle-grilled-cheese/\">grilled cheese waffles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/wafflemaker-hash-browns-3721250\">hashbrowns</a>. If you&#39;re thinking of experimenting beyond the classic waffle mix, check out some of the fun recipes you can find on websites such as <a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/search/waffle-iron-\">Food Network</a>, <a href=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/1316/breakfast-and-brunch/waffles/?page=2\">Allrecipes</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.yummly.com/recipes/waffles?maxTotalTimeInSeconds=900&amp;excludedIngredient=spice&amp;gs=glzyzw\">Yummly</a>. There are even gluten free waffle recipes you can try out from <a href=\"https://amyinthekitchen.com/gluten-free-waffles/\">various blogs</a>.","To better understand the lifespan and reliability of these appliances, we spoke with the general manager of a popular breakfast food franchise to see how often waffle makers in his busy establishment needed to be replaced. He told us that the machines themselves last long periods, but that the waffle plates need to be replaced every six months for optimal waffle making. While it’s unlikely that you’ll use your waffle maker as often as a busy restaurant, the material your waffle plates are made of will determine how long they last and how easy cleanup is.","We spoke with Alexus, an appliance associate at Best Buy. She told us that the best waffle makers use cast iron or cast-iron-blend plates. “You can tell by how it feels if it is a quality material. It also makes the waffle maker easier to clean.” In addition to lasting longer and being easier to clean, cast iron materials make it easier to remove waffles from the warm griddle.","Most modern waffle machines come with a light or a buzzer, or both, to indicate when the surfaces are hot enough to cook and another light or alarm to indicate when the waffles are done. We observed whether these indicators could accurately tell when the appliance was ready to work and when the waffles were actually ready to eat. We also made note of which waffle makers were the fastest.","One reason waffle makers are generally only given countertop space on the weekend is their reputation for being difficult to clean. It can be hard to keep the batter from running over the sides during the cooking process and to clean everything up afterward. We timed how long it took us to get everything clean following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions.","We paid attention to how easy the waffle makers are to assemble as well. Most come fully assembled, but any that were difficult to get from box to waffle-making received lower scores."]},"id":"4d390560-d1c8-421d-8d4e-94e8f0bac927","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_244","url":"/best-waffle-makers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T21:39:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T21:39:00Z","name":"Best Waffle Makers of 2019","synopsis":"We used homemade batter and made multiple batches with each waffle iron to see if they could produce quality on a consistent basis.","review":{},"strapline":"We used homemade batter and made multiple batches with each waffle iron to see if they could produce quality on a consistent basis.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-17T22:42:53Z","id":"UrgsuddeiWeBbXuvCQbppQ","meta":{"title":"Best Waffle Makers 2019 - Belgian Waffle Maker Reviews","description":"We used homemade batter and made multiple batches with each waffle iron to see if they could produce quality on a consistent basis."},"products":[{"slug":"all-clad-classic-round","url":"/product/all-clad-classic-round","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","name":"All-Clad Classic Round","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"EzzY95amhWAyMSfLNejMYG","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"cuisinart-wmr-ca","url":"/product/cuisinart-wmr-ca","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","name":"Cuisinart WMR-CA","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"RJT6FSqBdnK9gQkK8qURYf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"black-and-decker-3-in-1","url":"/product/black-and-decker-3-in-1","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","name":"Black & Decker 3-in-1","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"LLJ29jahzhtgavx6TfXG2C","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"hamilton-beach-belgian-waffle-maker","url":"/product/hamilton-beach-belgian-waffle-maker","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","name":"Hamilton Beach Belgian Waffle Maker","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"p69cHjseDEhpeZHHKprVmM","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BsBEWva2cZPzKYE2SQZuHC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Waffle-Makers-001.JPG","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/C/L/748245/original/Hero-Waffle-Makers-001.JPG","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"BsBEWva2cZPzKYE2SQZuHC","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BsBEWva2cZPzKYE2SQZuHC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Waffle Makers of 2019","description":"We used homemade batter and made multiple batches with each waffle iron to see if they could produce quality on a consistent basis."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BsBEWva2cZPzKYE2SQZuHC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Waffle-Makers-001.JPG","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/C/L/748245/original/Hero-Waffle-Makers-001.JPG","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"BsBEWva2cZPzKYE2SQZuHC","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BsBEWva2cZPzKYE2SQZuHC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Waffle Makers of 2019","description":"We used homemade batter and made multiple batches with each waffle iron to see if they could produce quality on a consistent basis."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"specialty-appliances","url":"/kitchen/specialty-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","name":"Specialty Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:51Z","id":"pjGYR2Qzeeo67PAvh7vTML","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
