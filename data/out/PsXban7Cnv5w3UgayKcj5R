Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-gas-cooktops\">Gas Cooktops</a> here.</em>","The Wolf Transitional CG365T/S is an impressive gas cooktop with precision flame control, a modern control panel and great customer service. It has a long list of features, including porcelain-coated cast iron, backlit glass knobs and control panel, and two-tiered burners. It has a nice feature package and overall functionality, making it was of the best-rated gas cooktops in our buying guide.","The Transitional has five burners with an average of 11,500 Btu. Each burner is stacked. There are two round burners, one on top of the other. A low heat setting uses only the lower tier burner at a low temperature, meaning your pan is further away from the lower burner and there’s less danger of scorching. You can melt delicate ingredients without scorching them or simmer at very low temperatures. If you want high temperatures, both tiers of burners can run, giving higher output than a single burner.","The primary burner reaches 18,000 Btu. This gives you quick boiling. This gas stovetop has no dedicated simmering or melting burner because every burner has the capacity to run only the lower burner section to achieve low temperature simmering. There is a 12,000 Btu burner and three 9,200 Btu burners. The burners are sealed, which means any spills or boil over can’t get beneath the cooktop surface.","The control panel takes up a sixth of the cooktop surface in the front-right block. The stainless, heavy-duty knobs have black caps that match the glass control panel. The knobs have clearly marked directions for separate simmering and regular heat. The benefit to this layout is that the knobs don’t come close to any pans, and there’s less danger in getting burned while operating the gas cooktop. The backlit knobs only show up when the burners are engaged, so you don’t have to look below to make sure the flame is still on under low temperatures, and the control panel has an uncluttered appearance when it’s not in use.","The continuous grates allow you to easily slide heavy pans on and off of burners without much effort. The cooktop below is one seamless panel in a recessed pan, which holds spills in place so you can easily wipe up spills once you’re done.","The grates are porcelain-coated cast iron. You can easily wipe off spills, and the grates can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleanup. If you use liquid propane, you can convert the Wolf Transitional into an LP cooktop. While there’s no separate hot surface indicator, the backlit knobs alert you to running burners. Wolf doesn’t include a built-in griddle; however, there is an optional wok grate which will allow you to get the wok up closer to the flame to cook stir fry thoroughly and evenly.","The Wolf Transitional does include automatic reignition. The cooktop recognizes if the flame is running and relights if it is ever extinguished. Rather than sparking all the burners when you turn a burner on, only the burner in use will be ignited.","Wolf offers the best warranty of all the cooktop brands we evaluated. The Wolf Transitional has a full two-year warranty, which covers parts and labor to replace or repair any defects. In addition, a limited five-year warranty covers the burners. Wolf’s customer service is located near the factory and has direct access to products and technicians, rather than an offsite call center. Representatives are available 24/7 by email or phone. All warranty information and existing manuals are available on Wolf’s website.","The product website has a searchable knowledgebase and list of FAQs. You can register the cooktop online. There’s also a library of videos for getting started, cleaning and troubleshooting. Wolf also offers a recipe database to take full advantage of the cooktop’s capabilities.","The Wolf Transitional CG365T/S is one of the most impressive cooktops we evaluated. Wolf’s customer service, searchable help center and warranty are the best available. The dual-tiered burners offer uniquely gentle melting and simmering, and the combined burners offer quick boiling and quick carmelization. The control panel’s unique glass finish with backlit knobs is safely placed away from any burners, and the porcelain-coated grates are easily separated and cleaned in the dishwasher. Overall, Wolf has made one of the best gas cooktops on the market."]},"id":"0f9d50ab-b525-4158-9991-714db2179ced","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57804","url":"/wolf-gas-cooktop-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-16T13:19:35Z","datePublished":"2013-10-16T13:19:35Z","name":"Wolf Transitional CG365T/S","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
