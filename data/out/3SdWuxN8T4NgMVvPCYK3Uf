This convenient <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> fits into some of the most popular Britax strollers, and its stay-in-car base has an anti-rebound bar to reduce the force of front and rear collisions. It offers extra reinforcement around the head, and the no-thread adjustable harness makes it easy to fit the shoulder straps to your baby&#39;s height. It is also easy to install with its LATCH connectors or with a standard seatbelt. The Britax Chaperone is larger than many other car seats, but it has some excellent features.","Like all retail baby car seats, the Britax Chaperone meets federal crash safety regulations. The base comes equipped with an anti-rebound bar, which helps to lessen the force of front and rear collisions. This extra safety feature does increase the size of the car seat, so if you own a smaller vehicle, you will feel cramped with the Chaperone in the back seat.","This infant car seat supports premature babies as light as 4 pounds, thanks to the foam insert. As your child grows, you can reposition the head support and shoulder straps with its simple harness adjustments. Your baby will fit in the car seat until she is 30 pounds or 32 inches.","The Chaperone is compatible with some Britax strollers, including the B-Ready, B-Nimble, B-Scene and B-Agile. If you buy the Britax Click &amp; Go adapter, the Chaperone will fit with even more strollers. There is plenty of space between the carry handle and the canopy, although the canopy has a tendency to collapse on its own. The only major complaint we have with this car seat is that it lacks machine-washable cushions. If you lose your user manual, you can download a new one on the Britax website. You can also find a local retailer on the website."]},"id":"680d3d28-e21a-4ee3-8ffc-3fcee739630d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3c6b9e58-598b-484f-b5f2-07a8fc6c6f42","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Britax Chaperone is a convenient baby car seat with some interesting safety features.
