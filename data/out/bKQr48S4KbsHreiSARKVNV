You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","There was a lot of hype around <strong>Joost </strong>when it came out because it was supposed to be the premier place on the Internet to find your favorite TV shows. Unfortunately, Joost never really lived up to the hype.","Don’t misunderstand, Joost is a good resource for <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">Internet TV</a>, but it doesn’t have a lot of shows that you’d expect to see. In fact, we found very little in the way of popular programming that you see on major networks. When you look at the major networks that Joost does have, you probably won’t recognize the vast majority of them.","Another strike against Joost is the special video player that you must download and install before you can watch Joost videos. It’s just annoying and unnecessary when plenty of other sites can play video as soon as you get there. ","When you take a look at the most watched videos on Joost, it becomes apparent that the vast majority of Joost users are probably male. The most watched category is dominated by videos of girls in bikinis and original Star Trek episodes. That’s actually a fairly good representation of all of Joost’s content.","There isn’t really anything new that’s popular right now. Joost is simply a repository for old martial arts movies, bikini babe clips, anime and classic sci-fi. Sure it sounds like a dreamland for some guys, but Joost just won’t cut it for the average user who wants syndicated network TV content. While there is some interesting stuff, there just isn’t much to keep the majority of viewers interested.","We have some serious reservations when it comes to using Joost. You must download and install a separate video player, which is quirky and not very intuitive. It has all the options we need but it took a while to get used to the interface.","One thing we liked was the ability to preview clips in the background while we kept searching for other clips in the foreground.","Joost uses video commercials spaced periodically throughout the episodes you watch. We were pleasantly surprised that Joost didn’t rely on image ads plastered about the video player or periodically layered over the video. Don’t get too excited, you’ll still have to put up with the occasional promotion for other shows that appear in the screen.","While the Joost player is a bit quirky, it still does offer some good features. You can share videos and save favorites, like other Internet TV sites, but Joost does far more to create a community and promote connectivity.","The Joost player allows you to use several widgets in your player. You can do everything from change your settings to setting up a live chat with other Joost users about what you’re watching. Other interesting widgets include a news ticker and a widget for blogging about your videos.","Joost offers a FAQ and email support to help you in case there are problems with the videos or with the Joost player. One of the best resources for help is the Joost forum. There other users can offer solutions for problems."]},"id":"576d6b53-24fe-4f30-82d8-d37b0fa3c2dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3fd83ea1-87e2-4ba0-a2cc-9ee0b91f816c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Joost is an internet TV site that offers its user a more simplistic version of what the top ranked products offer, it is not going to be the first choice for those who want to see everything from their computer or laptop but will do the job just fine.
