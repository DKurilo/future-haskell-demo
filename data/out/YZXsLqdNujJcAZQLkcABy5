This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/652-best-drawing-apps.html\">Mac drawing app</a> has a solid feature set and an easy-to-use interface. It gives you the tools to create good drawings directly from your computer or graphic tablet. You can choose from pens of various shapes and sizes, and it lets you customize your tools.","This drawing app for Mac lets you work in layers. This way, you can control different parts of your drawing while leaving other sections unaltered. You can also blend different layers. These tools help you transform your drawings, because you can add different filters to each layer. If you add a layer and adjust its color settings or texture, you can save it. You do not have to recreate the image; you can simply add the layer from your saved files.","While PhotoDonut offers a solid set of brushes and pens, it lacks annotation tools, which would let you take notes directly on your drawings. It is also missing tools to let you trace over existing images. Tracing tools are incredibly beneficial if you want to mimic a certain style or practice a drawing technique. If you want to use real images, you can import them into PhotoDonut, as long as they are in a common file format like PNG or JPEG.","The interface is easy to use. The even spacing helps create an efficient workflow. It lets you draw in color with its colored pencil and marker tools. The quality brushes in PhotoDonut look lifelike. When you print your images, you may not be able to tell the difference between your digital drawing and one that you actually created using pen and paper.","For help operating PhotoDonut, you can visit the FAQs page or contact customer support via email. There is no live chat or phone option, though. For further help, you can view the tutorials and participate in the user forum.","PhotoDonut offers tools that help you create lifelike drawings. It doesn’t offer tracing tools, but it does let you import images into your drawings. If you can’t find a brush tool you like, you can edit existing ones. You can also save filters that you’ve edited and add them to different drawings. This app is a good tool for freehand drawing."]},"id":"80587af2-17ad-4829-87d4-2ab0d7a03b03","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68558","url":"/photodonut-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T13:58:04Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T13:58:04Z","name":"PhotoDonut","synopsis":"You can produce lifelike sketches, doodles and drawings with PhotoDonut.
