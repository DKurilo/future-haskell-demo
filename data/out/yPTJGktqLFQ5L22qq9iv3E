Although the two companies currently operate independently, both will eventually operate exclusively under the ADT brand. When ADT and Protection 1 complete this brand integration, we will update our home security reviews to reflect that information.</em>","Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most prevalent causes of accidental death in the home. Statistics from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention show that nearly 400 Americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning each year. Your greatest safeguard against this threat is to have a carbon monoxide monitoring service in your home.","Our review compares the best carbon monoxide monitoring services to help you find the service that fits your needs. The most impressive carbon monoxide services are <a href=\"/frontpoint-security-review\">Frontpoint</a>, <a href=\"/protect-america-review\">Protect America</a> and <a href=\"/livewatch-review\">LiveWatch</a>. For more information, feel free to peruse our <a href=\"/home-and-garden\">articles about carbon monoxide monitoring services</a>.","<strong>Carbon Monoxide Monitoring Services: What to Look For</strong>","Carbon monoxide, often called the silent killer, is an odorless, colorless gas formed when fuels do not burn completely. Carbon monoxide comes from gas space heaters, chimneys, furnaces, gas water heaters, generators, automobile exhaust in the garage and tobacco smoke. Whether your home is old or brand new, carbon monoxide is a risk.","When looking for a carbon monoxide monitoring service, examine your options carefully. No matter which options you choose, the level of home monitoring that you receive and how the service reacts in an emergency are important to keep in mind. Look for a system that has a range of alerts, monitoring services, security equipment and customer support options.","<strong>Alerts</strong><br/>When an alarm goes off, a service alerts the household and dispatches emergency services to your home if you need additional assistance or if you do not answer a follow-up phone call. Look for a service provider that responds to various threats such as natural gas leaks, elevated levels of CO, smoke and fire, flooding, power failure, intrusion, and temperature changes. These services also have personal safety alerts to help you monitor your children or family members with medical conditions. Each alert usually requires a corresponding piece of equipment, which may cost extra.","<strong>Monitoring Services</strong><br/>Look for a service that can monitor your home 24 hours a day, follows up when an alarm goes off and connects to your security system via a cellular or internet connection. Many services also offer interactive monitoring, home automation and online account access, which let you access and control your security system with a smartphone while you are away, but these features typically do not come with basic service plans. Systems with two-way intercoms allow you to speak with a trained representative using the system control panel.","<strong>Security Devices </strong><br/>Most wireless carbon monoxide monitors connect directly to your <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security system</a>. In addition to carbon monoxide detectors, look for companies that sell a wide range of wireless security devices with which you can customize your home monitoring system. These include sirens, personal security devices, panic buttons, motion sensors, door and window sensors, garage door sensors, glass-break sensors, recessed door sensors, and pet-immune sensors. Many companies also offer security cameras, but only as part of an advanced service plan.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>The best carbon monoxide monitoring services offer customer support via phone, email, and live chat as well as online tutorials, alarm history reports and FAQs. A home security system that monitors the carbon monoxide threat in your home will be long-term fixture in your home, so make sure it has a long warranty. While some companies require professional installation, others send the equipment to you for DIY installation. Relocation options let you take the system with you when you move, but they may require you to renew your contract.","A carbon monoxide monitoring service can help you keep your home a safe place for you and your family. However, it is up to you to decide which route to take when choosing a carbon monoxide monitoring service. By choosing an effective home monitoring service, you can keep your home and family safe from a variety of dangers."]},"id":"f19bb658-3074-4170-9936-c24c168b858b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"39622589-9e8a-4a5f-83f0-0eafc8bc112e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://safe.frontpointsecurity.com/CarbonMonoxideMonitoringServicesReview\">Frontpoint</a>","<a href=\"http://www.protectamerica.com/a02675\">Protect America</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7060599-11725211\">LiveWatch</a>","<a href=\"http://www.yourlocalsecurity.com?kbid=47465 \">ADT</a>","<a href=\"http://www.vivint.com/offer3?ckm_key=Vyk76aJZpo&ckm_campaign_id=118&exid=165172&utm_source=purch&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=TopTenReviews.com&s2=CarbonMonoxide\">Vivint</a>","<a href=\"http://www.protection1.com/home-security-systems/shop/alarm-systems/packages/\">Protection 1</a>","<a href=\"http://www.monitronics.com/online/complete-home-security?rdnaLabel=Partner_-_Top_Ten_Reviews&salesForce_campaign=701E0000000bpSU\">Monitronics</a>","<a href=\"http://www.guardianprotection.com/existing-homes/solutions.aspx\">Guardian Protection Services</a>","<a href=\"http://www.alarmforce.com/\">AlarmForce</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"318a128f-4ca8-4b0c-be82-e88b85ca3bcb","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1039","url":"/best-carbon-monoxide-monitoring-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-25T14:41:18Z","datePublished":"2016-07-01T19:15:40Z","name":"Carbon Monoxide Monitoring Services Review","synopsis":"Many home security companies offer carbon monoxide monitoring services as part of a complete home security system.
