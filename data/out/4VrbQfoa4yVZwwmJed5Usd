You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","Although it is ranked number three in our <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a> reviews, the Pioneer BDP-330 is still a good Blu-ray player. It is one of the most expensive Blu-ray disc players in our lineup but doesn’t have appropriate audio output for surround sound. This player is also not DLNA certified.","To allow for the best possible home theater experience, the Pioneer BDP-330 is equipped with the top video technology out there. Most DVD players are unable to play content at the frames per second rate that movies are filmed at, sometimes speeding things up from 24fps to 30fps to be in sync with the television. This adjustment makes the film image seem disproportionate. Now, the Pioneer BDP-330 has, excuse the pun, “pioneered” new technology that plays every Blu-ray disc at 24 frames per second in full HD 1080p resolution, allowing you to see the movie in its original form.  Then Deep Color technology will enhance the original picture to make the color more intense and well, deeper, by increasing the number of colors you see from millions to billions. This Blu-ray player will also upscale all of your DVDs. We find this across-the-board compatibility to be refreshing because you won’t have to repurchase all of your favorite movies.","When you connect the Pioneer BDP-330 Blu-ray player with a Pioneer A/V receiver, a special feature called the HDMI Precision Quartz Lock System (PQLS) will make sure that Blu-ray discs, audio CDs and DVDs are played with precision. This feature, along with Dolby True HD, dts HD and LPCM, will make your ears sing praises.","Thanks to the iPhone app, IControlAV, you can turn your iPhone into a remote for the Pioneer BDP-330 Blu-ray player. The iPhone-turned-remote can adjust the sound, control menu functions and play or pause video. With the provided remote, you can pull up BD-Live interactive games and bonus video from compatible Blu-ray discs. The picture-in-picture feature, BonusView, is also available.","Although the specifications on the Pioneer BDP-330’s website say it is Wi-Fi ready, you still have to purchase either a USB Wi-Fi adapter or an Ethernet cord to really get things working. Before you check out online or in a store, make sure you have the necessary accessories.","I/O Ports Available:"]},"id":"8851d2da-a5a3-40a3-8ce2-808a7d41b245","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Component Video","Ethernet Port","HDMI Output","Optical Digital Audio Outputs","One SD Card Slot","One USB Port"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6a245058-13d9-42e2-ac87-742ff756cccd","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Do you see a glaring downside to this list of I/O ports? You’re correct: there is no 7.1 channel audio output. This means that the Pioneer BDP-330 Blu-ray player is designed to only connect via a 2 channel audio output, making surround sound impossible. This oversight is disappointing because even though most media file types are compatible with the Pioneer BDP-330(DVD, JPEG, MP3, Audio CDs, etc.), you won’t be able to hear them in surround sound."]},"id":"fcbcc8ae-c0cf-4baa-995c-56d47f4ebcc5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a293f8e-2a3d-482e-9c84-da72ef4c3685","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are going to invest in a Blu-ray player, you want to make sure that it has all of the bells and whistles that make home theater entertainment somewhat comparable to a movie theater.
