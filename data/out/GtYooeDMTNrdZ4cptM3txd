Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Bushnell’s BackTrack GPS is a unit that can help you find your way back to a homebase, such as your house, car or tent if you’re out walking or hiking. It’s not made for monitoring your teen driver, child or runaway pet, like many of the <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS trackers</a> we reviewed, but it’s a quality personal tracking device to get you back to your homebase.","The Bushnell BackTrack’s main feature is being able to mark and store up to five locations, such as your car, home, tent, etc., then forget about it while you go hiking. Then, you use this GPS tracker to find your way back to your homebase. While it’s great for hiking or walking in a park, you can also use it to find your car in a packed parking lot, when you’re traveling in a new city and want to explore – anytime you&#39;re in unfamiliar territory.","Other features include a digital compass, which will allow you to find points of interest, along with the current time, temperature and altitude. It uses two AAA batteries, and if you keep it turned off when you don’t need it, you can get over 20 hours of continuous use with the Bushnell BackTrack GPS tracker.","Before you head out on your first hike with the BackTrack GPS, you’ll need to calibrate it properly. Once you’ve marked your homebase location, you can do your hiking or go to work, shopping, etc., and when you’re ready to head back to your home or car, the BackTrack GPS will check your current location then use arrows and a distance meter to get you back. It’s that simple.","You can also use the digital compass and a map to find points of interest while you’re in a historic area, or visiting a new city. Of course, doing so will drain the batteries a little quicker than if you’re just marking a location to return to later.","Bushnell offers several quality help and support features for the BackTrack GPS tracker, including a user manual and a FAQs page on their site, along with written and video tutorials. It’s important that you properly calibrate this GPS tracking device before use, so they include a video tutorial specifically on how to do just that.","If you have further questions or need technical support, you can reach Bushnell by email or telephone. Also, if you’re in need of a repair, you can fill out a form on their site and then check on the status by entering in your repair number. That’s a pretty cool help and support feature.","This GPS tracking device is very simple to use, after you do an initial calibration to get the unit ready to go. Let’s say you’re out camping and you’re ready to go hiking and fishing. You can mark the position of your campsite on the BackTrack and set off hiking and looking for a stream to fish in. Once you’re ready, the device will tell you how to get back."]},"id":"6ea364b4-af1d-44f3-a2b4-d188e15d7156","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9781fd1a-0cda-487e-9889-ca24870dc6ad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Bushnell BackTrack GPS is a quality personal GPS tracking device which will help you find your way back home when you’re hiking or traveling.
