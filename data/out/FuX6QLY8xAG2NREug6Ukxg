The key to using the features within this application is signing up for a new account, which is no different than what you would have to do to sign up for a free email account. However, it&#39;s odd that software would require you to provide your email address and create a nickname and password. One should be wary if an application wants you to provide personal information. Based on our analysis, it seems like a lot of the application&#39;s functions go through the company&#39;s website.
