You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE Café CGP650SETSS is a great <a href=\"/best-gas-cooktops\">gas cooktop</a> with a unique design, easy cleanup and high Btu. The Café has a wide array of features, including heavy-duty knobs, dishwasher-safe grates, an integrated griddle and a child lock.","The Café is a noticeable upgrade to the boxier, stripped-down cousin, the Profile. Instead, it spreads out the control panel toward the front and staggers the burners for a less modern but more artistic design. Like the Profile, it has a stainless steel and black cast-iron finish, but it adds several features, including an improved primary burner.","The Café’s burners average just under 11,000 Btu. The primary, center burner offers the most flexibility. GE’s Tri-Ring burner has a center tiered burner and a doughnut-shaped outer burner with three heat settings. You can perform gentle simmering and a blistering 20,000 Btu on the same burner. The Tri-Ring Burner also evenly heats the pan, rather than a single ring shape just larger than the burner shape. The center burner is ideal for quick boiling. It also ensures quick recover – meaning once you add a large steak to the pan, it will return to temperature quickly.","The two left burners both run at a maximum 9,100 Btu. The right-rear burner is a dedicated simmering burner and is limited to 5,000 Btu to ensure delicate heat for melting and simmering. The front right is a decent 11,000 Btu. The knobs have numbered stops so you can set it exactly where you want. It looks a little busy on the control panel, but the extra settings help you make precise adjustments.","The burners on this gas stovetop are spaced nicely so there’s little problem with pans bumping or making oversized pans fit. The continuous grates are a unique starburst pattern that emanates from each burner location.","While the control panel is a bit busy, the knobs are logically placed and have a pleasant stainless steel finish that give it a substantial feel. The knobs also have an attractive LED blue backlight so you know when the burners are on. If you want a simplistic cooktop appearance to go with your kitchen decor, try the <a href=\"/maytag-review\">Maytag Dual Stack MGC9536DS</a>.","The continuous grates allow for oversized pans and unusual configurations. They also are spaced well so you can effortlessly move heavy pans off of burners. Like other gas cooktops that don’t include downdraft, the Café requires another source of ventilation, like a vent hood.","The cast iron grates divide into sections that remove easily and can be run through the dishwasher. The deep-well pan captures any spillover, and the seamless finish makes wiping up spills simple. One of the other standout features is an included griddle. The Lodge griddle has a non-stick cast iron finish that integrates into the cooktop surface. The griddle lays flat and conforms with the shape of the cooktop, giving you a cooking surface that gets closer to the flame than any pan could. If you’d find yourself frequently using a griddle, it could easily be left on, and it fits well with the style of the rest of the cooktop. If your kitchen runs on liquid propane, GE includes an LP cooktop conversion kit.","The only feature we were disappointed to lose from among the high-end cooktop brands was a flame sensor and automatic reignition. Few things are as frustrating as simmering a stew for hours only to find an extinguished flame.","GE offers the industry-standard one-year limited warranty. The company will replace and repair any part of the cooktop that is defective within the one-year period.","Through GE’s website, you can search through product-specific Q&amp;A and FAQs, register your appliance, order parts, read the owner’s manual, and access customer support by phone or email. You can also schedule appliance servicing online 24 hours a day. GE also offers a live chat option to speak to a salesperson or troubleshoot your cooktop. The product website has a video series for getting help with cleaning, troubleshooting, solving burner issues and operating the controls. All the warranty data is available as well.","GE’s Café has a wide selection of features and a professional build at a midlevel price. While the warranty isn’t as good as the high-end cooktops, and stove lacks automatic reignition, it has all the cooking flexibility we were looking for. The Café’s Tri-Ring burner gives you delicate simmering and the highest Btu on a single burner. The layout is phenomenal – the cooktop accommodates oversize pans and multiple pots without crowding the top, and the design is quite unique. The integrated griddle allows you to get really close to the heat. GE has made this one of the best available gas cooktops."]},"id":"9c9fb144-e5e1-4301-bb35-b4ff0a5821d2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57807","url":"/ge-cafe-gas-cooktop-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-16T18:23:22Z","datePublished":"2013-10-16T18:23:22Z","name":"GE Café CGP650SETSS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":91,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-10T00:00:00Z","id":"hMmuVFjv5anWQT65SmgqE4","meta":{"title":"GE Café CGP650SETSS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The GE Caf&#233; has the most complete feature package of any gas cooktop on the market.
