It has a good maximum airflow of 290 cubic feet per minute and three fan speeds – low, medium and high.","The system is a good option if you live in a humid climate because it can remove up to 3.8 pints of moisture from the air per hour. However, it doesn’t have a dehumidify-only mode, so you have to run the air conditioner if you want to bring down the humidity in the room.","This Friedrich AC has an Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of 10.5, and it carries Energy Star and Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) certifications. It’s estimated this in-wall AC costs about $99 per year to run. That’s quite good, but some wall ACs we reviewed, such as the <a href=\"/koldfront-review\">Koldfront WTC8001W</a>, cost even less to run.","You can use the included remote to control the air conditioner from anywhere in the room, though you can also program it from the interface on the unit itself. If it’s not hot enough to warrant cooling the air continuously, you can use a fan-only mode to create a breeze or run the unit in its energy-saver mode.","This in-wall AC has a programmable timer that lets you set when you want the unit to run and for how long. There is also an automatic restart feature, so the air conditioner automatically turns back on after a power outage. This unit is missing a few modes the best wall air conditioners have, including a sleep mode which automatically adjusts the temperature while you sleep so the room isn’t too cold when you wake up.","Using the unit’s six-way directional air louvers, you can choose where you want air to blow in the room. Most in-wall AC units have four-way louvers, so the Friedrich Uni-Fit US12D10C is better at circulating air overall. The device’s antimicrobial filter is easy to clean, and the active defrost controls keep it from freezing up.","The Friedrich Uni-Fit US12D10C weighs 80 pounds and measures 14.4 x 18.5 x 24.6 inches. It has a universal-fit trim ring, so it can replace almost any in-wall air conditioner.","Friedrich’s website hosts a digital copy of the air conditioner’s owner manual. You can talk with a customer service representative via email or telephone. However, the company does not have a live chat support option, something many AC manufacturers offer.","The Uni-Fit US12D10C comes with a one-year appliance warranty and a five-year compressor warranty, which is pretty standard coverage for an in-wall AC. You can also pay more for an extended warranty.","The Friedrich Uni-Fit US12D10C wall air conditioner can keep a room of up to 550 square feet cool. It does a good job of removing moisture from the air, though it doesn’t have a dehumidify-only mode. It’s also missing a sleep mode. Still, it has the most important features, including a high maximum airflow."]},"id":"d6891422-0f60-4c37-a21d-d135381f438c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65028","url":"/friedrich-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-21T18:06:26Z","datePublished":"2015-05-21T18:06:26Z","name":"Friedrich Uni-Fit US12D10B","synopsis":"The Friedrich Uni-Fit US12D10C wall air conditioner can cool a room of up to 550 square feet.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"The Friedrich Uni-Fit US12D10C is a moderately energy efficient, powerful in-wall AC unit that can effectively cool and remove moisture from a 550-square-foot room.
