Its size and weight give it unmatched stability, even in moderate winds, letting it glide through the air with a welcome grace. It’s not the most agile plane – without ailerons, the Super Cub S can’t roll. This limits its turning ability to the rudder alone. You can soar through the air in slow, graceful turns, but you can’t execute barrel rolls.","The Cub’s battery cell is both impressive and disappointing. With a charge time averaging almost 90 minutes, it takes longer to recharge the Super Cub S than any other plane. However, it’s also one of the longest-lasting fliers, consistently offering nine minutes and 25 seconds of air time before beginning to stutter and lose altitude. In our testing, we found that nine minutes is long enough to have plenty of fun flying and feel satisfied with the experience, but 90 minutes is far too long to wait between those flights. We definitely recommend buying additional battery cells from HobbyZone."]},"id":"0af87dbf-4bef-4eb6-abe5-88dbb8c372e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Flight Features"},"id":"308b5a3a-f65e-4471-a6d8-0c3a94362553","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/vKYyfd4MpJiLL7yxsMrRW8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60383-hobbyzone-super-cub-s2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKYyfd4MpJiLL7yxsMrRW8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"vKYyfd4MpJiLL7yxsMrRW8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKYyfd4MpJiLL7yxsMrRW8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"baba5eb3-145d-49e3-af26-21863047d012","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like our other top picks, the Super Cub S is equipped with SAFE flight assistance technology. Along with an onboard gyroscope system that automatically stabilizes the plane in windy conditions, SAFE offers three flight modes: beginner, intermediate and experienced. In beginner mode, the Cub’s movements are heavily restricted, keeping you from nosing down in a dangerous dive or pulling up in a potential stall. Intermediate mode is a little more lenient, letting you gather more speed from dives but preventing vertical drops. In experienced mode, all restrictions are removed; you can yaw-twist the aircraft in corkscrews if you’re skilled enough to manage it.","SAFE also allows for panic recovery at the press of a button. The Super Cub S is big and stable, but if you lose control of it, its slow response time could spell disaster – something one of our test pilots found out firsthand. So long as you keep enough altitude off the ground, you can always squeeze the panic button if you start losing control. The Cub immediately levels out, even from steep or inverted dives."]},"id":"9ccf43a9-6dfd-4222-bdd9-0c9c45e62499","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Transmitter"},"id":"3b76f963-7466-4692-b1fd-7556babfe211","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/CXym4sQRAdmJGGKQTnaQ7T.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60383-hobbyzone-super-cub-s1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CXym4sQRAdmJGGKQTnaQ7T.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"CXym4sQRAdmJGGKQTnaQ7T","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CXym4sQRAdmJGGKQTnaQ7T.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b372c6a2-0b7d-44ad-8728-33ce5c8c899a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Each RC airplane kit we tested came ready to fly with an included transmitter.
