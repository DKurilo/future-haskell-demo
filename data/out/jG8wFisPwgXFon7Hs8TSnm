The UPS Store entered the market early with a pilot program offering 3D printing services in six stores. It has proven so popular that the company is now in the process of expanding to 100 stores by the end of 2015. Small businesses and consumers can use its services to design prototypes. By using 3D printers at the UPS Store, you can avoid the expense of operating your own professional-grade printer and save time.","The UPS Store’s custom 3D printing can help small businesses turn their ideas into reality. Utilizing 3D modeling can reduce the time to market for new products by quickly creating prototypes and shortening the design process. Printed objects are often affordable and, depending on the complexity of the design, can be turned around in as little as a day. Since the UPS Store prints locally, you can quickly modify your projects without having to ship items back and forth.","The UPS Store uses the Stratasys uPrint SE Plus printer in each of its stores. A 3D .stl CAD file is needed to print your item, and once you supply the file, a UPS Store representative can provide an accurate quote. One thing to keep in mind is that the amount of material your print requires largely determines the final price, so a small but dense item could cost more than a larger lightweight item.","UPS&#39; 3D printers can print parts up to 6 x 6 x 8 inches in size and in a range of colors. Each printer uses ABSplus, or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene filament, a thermal plastic that changes shape when heated and keeps its shape once it has cooled. ABSplus is tough and flexible; it can be used to create fully articulating parts by using soluble materials to create it, so there is no assembly required.","The downside, however, to ABS is that it comes from petroleum, so it is a non-renewable resource. It is not biodegradable and is difficult to recycle. It also has a strong smell. This plastic is most commonly used for commercial applications due to its strength and stability over time.","The UPS Store lists all the locations that offer 3D printing on their website. Printing services vary by location. Some locations only offer 3D printing while others have design engineers that can work with you to create a 3D image file. You&#39;ll want to check with your local UPS store to verify the services that are available and to receive a quote for your project.","Having local access to affordable 3D printing is a huge asset for consumers and small businesses alike. 3D printing is growing in popularity and having the ability to begin using it, even if you can’t afford a professional printer, is a great way to experiment with new product or concept or to see what this burgeoning industry is all about. The high quality, reliability and durability of prints made with the uPrint SE Plus makes the UPS Store’s 3D offering a company to consider if you are interested in bringing your designs to life."]},"id":"62457c7c-02eb-45ef-aadf-40476d6ca8e6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66933","url":"/ups-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:54:35Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:54:35Z","name":"The UPS Store","synopsis":"The UPS Store has a long history of providing 2D printing services to businesses nationwide and now the company is leveraging its print-management expertise to branch out to 3D printing.
