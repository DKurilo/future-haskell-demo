One benefit to installing a digital media receiver is that often the units have a much more shallow mounting depth, adding versatility that traditional CD playing head units don&#39;t have. The Kenwood KMM-100U has a surprisingly shallow mounting depth of 3.94 inches, allowing you to install this head unit in places that traditional ones won&#39;t fit. In addition, because there&#39;s no CD player – and thus no moving pieces that can wear out or get damaged over time – this unit has a longer lifespan than traditional car audio systems.","The Kenwood KMM-100U plays the most common music files, MP3 and WMA, as well as the less common FLAC. While the Kenwood KMM-100U gives you better sound and access to your music players, it will not let you expand your stereo system very much. There is only one set of RCA outputs, but the set does include a low-pass filter, which is convenient if you want to run a subwoofer through an amplifier. This built-in crossover will help protect your subwoofer should you choose to use one.","The Kenwood KMM-100U features a front auxiliary port, which means that it can play music from any MP3 player or cell phone that has a 3.5 mm auxiliary jack. Another nice feature is that it has a front USB port, as well. Using a USB connection, you can control an iPhone or iPod using the head unit. You can also control your Pandora app from the Kenwood KMM 100U, giving you versatility with your music. Kenwood does offer an app you can download for Android devices allowing you to organize and play music files from the head unit.","Kenwood offers a one year limited parts and labor warranty on the KMM-100U and lists several phone numbers and email addresses on its website should you have any questions or concerns about your product. The company also has active Facebook and Twitter accounts so that you can ask questions or post comments for the company to address. The website features a small but thorough FAQs page, and you can find an online copy of the user manual for the KMM-100U."]},"id":"87a6d956-ec06-499a-9618-709d16318203","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0c167afc-0cf9-4b15-89fb-fe459042a3d7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenwood KMM-100U is a basic digital media receiver that lets you play FLAC files and control Pandora from the head unit.
