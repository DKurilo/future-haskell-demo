Combined, this bright light and great coverage mean you can sit comfortably and reap the full benefits of light therapy.   <br />\n   <br />\nFor light therapy to be effective, your eyes need to perceive a brightness of about 10,000 lux – the brightness of a standard day. In my tests, the Day-Light Sky measured 10,000 lux at 12 inches away, with a luminous intensity of 1,165. By comparison, most lamps dipped under 10,000 lux after just 6 inches, which means you have to sit really close to them to get the full benefits of the light. Since it is so bright 12 inches from this lamp, you can sit further from it.    <br />\n   <br />\nIn addition, since the lamp and its lightbulbs are significantly bigger than most I tested, the light coverage is superior. With smaller lamps, you can lose a lot of the brightness by moving your head just a little. For example, it only takes about an inch difference for a light's luminosity to decrease by 1,000 lux. This wide coverage also helps minimize discomfort from the heat output, which is particularly important for this lamp, as it gets hotter than others.","<a href=\"/day-light-sky-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"b23d084d-0cd3-4661-8e7e-678fe6b1d1b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"b00e6f11-ccf5-4e72-a84e-3f57f2d3c000","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/aeD9LaVpB5qyQ3hWD28nTE.jpg","link":{"href":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-light-therapy-lampsnature-bright-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/W/R/809883/original/NatureBright-SunTouch-Plus.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aeD9LaVpB5qyQ3hWD28nTE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"aeD9LaVpB5qyQ3hWD28nTE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aeD9LaVpB5qyQ3hWD28nTE.jpg","alt":"NatureBright SunTouch Plus"},"id":"b54d45d0-19b0-46ca-b823-bc0cd78d1ddd","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"NatureBright SunTouch Plus\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":80,"url":"/best-light-therapy-lampsnature-bright-review/","name":"NatureBright SunTouch Plus","id":"1700"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/best-light-therapy-lampsnature-bright-review/\">NatureBright SunTouch Plus</a>","pros":["Affordable","Good coverage","Four timer settings"],"cons":["Minimal adjustability","Very hot","10,000-lux reach of only 7 inches"]},"id":"d9458f56-cf97-4d08-84de-3d92f9b5dc8f","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nature Bright Sun Touch Plus is my pick for best value because it has above-average brightness and good coverage, and it costs just $50.

You just need to be able to comfortably read or work on a computer while receiving the light without having to look directly into the lamp.","How Does Light Therapy Work?","While there is still some debate over the physiological causes of seasonal affective disorder, the scientific consensus is the lack of sunlight. The sun is literally an antidepressant because it helps regulate our circadian rhythm. It&#39;s also our primary source of vitamin D, which helps our brain&#39;s serotonin production. The light therapy industry, both from a manufacturer and a mental health practitioner perspective, focuses on therapy designed to alleviate the symptoms of a disrupted circadian rhythm rather than the conversion of UVB radiation to vitamin D.","In other words, these light therapy lamps aren’t going to give you a tan. They are all UV-free. In fact, you shouldn&#39;t visit a tanning salon to treat seasonal affective disorder, as it doesn&#39;t work. Those lights emit UV-A radiation – the cause of tans, sunburns and skin cancer. If you suspect you have a vitamin D deficiency, you should talk with your doctor about supplements instead of seeking UV lamps, as there are safer ways of getting vitamin D into your system.","Why Does Brightness Matter?","According to <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~mt12/blt.htm\">Columbia University</a>, a therapeutic level of light illumination may reduce melatonin levels in the blood. Melatonin is a natural hormone created by the body to help regulate sleep and waking patterns. During winter months when the days are shorter, people tend to have excess melatonin in their system. This can make it difficult to wake up completely and leads to a type of hibernation-like state among people with seasonal affective disorder. While the light sensitivity of melatonin is understood, the Columbia University study admits the science is not clear on how light helps reduce melatonin in your bloodstream, as simply exposing your skin to the light doesn’t work.","However, Dr. Helle Madsen of the University of Copenhagen has studied the correlation between light exposure and the photosensitive cells of the retinas. She explains how studies in seasonal affective disorder patients suggest &#34;their retinas are less sensitive to light. This sub-sensitivity has been shown for both rods and cones, and the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.&#34; She even points out that people with severely reduced eyesight are three times more likely to suffer from seasonal affective disorder.","<strong>When to Use Light Therapy Lamps</strong>","You can use light therapy lamps whenever you feel you need to. However, there are specific times and situations when it’s especially beneficial to use a sun lamp. For example, they are particularly useful during certain seasons, and they are good for people living extremely far north or south of the equator. Doctors also recommend therapy lamps for people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or spend much of their time indoors.","Winter is the most popular time of year to use light therapy lamps, as days are shorter and you are ultimately exposed to less sunlight. Getting extra light from a sun lamp can bolster your mood and regulate your sleep patterns. That’s because sunlight affects the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that dictates your circadian rhythm and moods. The hypothalamus is in charge of releasing melatonin and serotonin, and it depends on light to regulate and distribute these hormones. When you don’t have enough sunlight, this process gets disrupted, which may lead to depression and insomnia.","For the same reason, therapy lights are good for people who live really far north or south of the equator, especially during the winter months when their location is furthest from the sun. Countries like Norway, Finland, Sweden, Estonia and Iceland have vastly shorter days on average during the winter. As such, it’s common for sun lamps to help citizens in these regions get the recommended amount of light.","<strong>What Are the Risks of Light Therapy? </strong>","According to the <a href=\"https://cet.org/bright-light-exposure-risks/\">CET</a>, light therapy is not recommended for people with the following pre-existing conditions because of the way it affects the skin and eyes:"]},"id":"f5fd6109-af4a-4cb8-b8d6-5918f765bb04","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Retinal dystrophy","Age-related macular degeneration","Porphyria","Lupus erythematodes","Chronic actinic dermatitis","Solar urticaria"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2db0cbe7-2ac1-4879-a0da-4e38581b2653","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You should also avoid light therapy if you&#39;re taking medications known to photosensitize skin:"]},"id":"82fc371f-369b-4f6c-a579-019df0d70f85","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Psychiatric neuroleptic drugs","Psoralen drugs","Antiarrhythmic drugs","Antimalarial and antirheumatic drugs","Porphyrin drugs","St. John&#39;s Wort"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a786ebe5-27fd-4131-8c9b-cb9b28d5cdae","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In addition, <a href=\"http://psycheducation.org/treatment/bipolar-disorder-light-and-darkness/light-therapies-for-depression/\">PsychEducation.org</a> warns about using light therapy if you have bipolar disorder.
