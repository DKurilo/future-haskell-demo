Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Droid Pro is a <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> ideal for your business needs. This cell phone offers both a touchscreen and QWERTY keypad along with all your basic multimedia features and the Android 2.2 operating system. Unfortunately, this cellular device lacks 4G technology and has poor memory.","This smartphone features a compact design with a 3.1-inch touchscreen and a QWERTY keypad. Having these two design features gives you more versatility when navigating around the phone. The touchscreen includes a virtual keypad, but because of the small touchscreen the keys are small and difficult to push. The touchscreen often has difficulty responding and you may encounter a significant amount of lag time.","Additionally, the display on the Droid Pro is a mediocre 320 x 480 pixel resolution, so the images are not as clear and crisp as we wanted to see on a Droid device. Even with both keypads on the front of the device, this smartphone is compact and durable. It is also lightweight, weighing only 4.7 ounces.","The Droid Pro doesn’t offer any advanced multimedia features. The music player lets you play MP3s, along with creating and managing your playlists. There is a 5MP (megapixel) camera on the device, which worked well, but we were disappointed to see the megapixels so low. There are several camera features to help enhance your photos such as autofocus, low-light capability and touch-to-focus. There is no video chat capability or HD video recording.","All of the vital call features are available on the Droid Pro. The speakerphone on the cell phone is loud and there is little static. Conference calling, emergency dials and call waiting are also available features, along with speed dialing and automatic redialing. You can customize your contacts with pictures or assign specific ringtones.","The quality of your phone conversations can be hit or miss on this device. At times, there are no problems and conversations are loud with no static in the background. Other times, the phone will drop calls or there is so much background noise, you can’t hear the person on the other end of the phone.","There are up to 480 minutes of talk time battery life available on the Droid Pro. This amount of battery will give you a full day’s use on a single battery charge if you don&#39;t use the phone excessively. The battery will stay charged for up to 330 hours of standby. However, if any of the phone’s displays are active, the battery is used much faster, so manage your phone use wisely.","The biggest drawback to this cell phone is the small amount of memory offered. There is only 2GB of memory available on the device, which is slightly enhanced by a 2GB microSD card that&#39;s also included. This gives you little space available for an assortment of music, applications, contacts, photos or videos. Luckily, if you are looking to store a vast amount of content on your device, the phone can support a microSD card up to 32GB.","The Droid Pro offers the same features you would find in most smartphones currently on the market. There is Bluetooth connectivity, web access and Wi-Fi connectivity. You can use this phone as a mobile hotspot, where it will connect up to five devices to the internet. This device is also compatible with Adobe Flash so browsing the web on this device is enjoyable, and you can access and view more content. Also, to improve your productivity, there is a calculator, calendar and alarm clock to keep you right on schedule. There is no 4G technology available, which is a drawback to this smartphone."]},"id":"e413cc69-ad32-494e-b355-262ae1b17cfd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a0dec038-d0f3-4dba-bf42-42c38e54ceed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We were disappointed with the amount of memory available and the lack of 4G technology on the Droid Pro.
