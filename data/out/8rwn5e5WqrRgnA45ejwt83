You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","<em>Editor&#39;s Note: Magix Music Maker 2017 is now available. Clicking the Buy button will take you to this version for purchase. The manufacturer lists the new version as offering the following features: 5,000 new loops; 11 virtual instruments; 99 tracks to create and mix projects. We will evaluate, rank and review the 2017 version when we next update the Audio Editing Software reviews. Meanwhile, enjoy our review below about Magix Music Maker 2015. </em>","MAGIX Music Maker 2015&#39;s innate strength is its ability to help you create compositions through a simple drag-and-drop arrangement window. It also has a vast library of more than 3,000 sounds and loops. The program has a variety of virtual instruments that you can use via MIDI controllers to create audio tracks.","The multitrack recording capabilities that this <a href=\"/best-audio-editing-software\">professional audio editor</a> possesses can&#39;t be denied. It is one of the few audio editors that we reviewed that allows you to record multiple audio sources at once. This means you can record your single audio source podcast or even multitrack an entire band. Recording is a strength of the MAGIX Music Maker software.","This audio editor is set up like a digital audio workstation (DAW). You have a multitrack arrangement window that includes your transport, file manager and other tools located at the bottom of your window. The interface is cleanly arranged and easy to navigate. MAGIX Music Maker doesn’t bombard you with a cluster of editing tools and buttons atop your window like other audio software does. The presentation of the interface is manageable, especially considering the amount of effects and filters MAGIX Music Maker contains.","This audio editing software has one of the largest effects and filter libraries compared to its competition. The program has an array of reverbs, distortions, compressors and other effects that you can apply to your recordings or loops once they are in your arrangement window.","We tested file compatibility by importing a wide variety of audio file extensions into each audio editing program. Out of all of the audio formats that we imported, MAGIX was only unable to import the Mac-based audio file extensions – MP4, M4A, AU and AAC. This isn&#39;t a surprise, considering MAGIX Music Maker is not compatible with Mac operating systems. MAGIX is compatible with all Windows operating systems we tested for, including Windows 7 and 8.","Many audio editors boast various tools for audio restoration, such as click and pop reducers and other noise removers. When it comes to audio restoration, Music Maker is lacking on all fronts. Audio restoration is a large part of audio editing, especially for those looking to digitize a vinyl or cassette collection. While you can import these to your MAGIX software, you will not have the tools to remove the noise associated with analog-style recordings.","If you need help discovering all that this program is capable of, you can view the tutorials and user forums on the company&#39;s website. MAGIX&#39;s website also includes a support section and information about installation."]},"id":"65864907-7fdd-4c83-a844-6da94a884d66","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"63e59903-465e-4199-baac-491fbf687ea5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MAGIX Music Maker offers the tools to create interesting and unique compositions from its large library of sounds and its various recording capabilities.
