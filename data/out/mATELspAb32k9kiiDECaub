You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool WEG760H0DS affords you plenty of flexibility with its five-burner cooktop and sizeable convection oven. If you enjoy cooking with gas flame burners, this <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">slide-in range</a> is clearly a good choice for you. Two large and multi-faceted cast iron grates cover the stovetop&#39;s porcelain coated steel exterior, and the sturdy grates let you put pans anywhere. You can remove the grates for cleaning and put them in the dishwasher if you choose.","The oven boasts 5.8 cubic feet of space with three oven racks and seven rack positions, allowing you to re-arrange the oven&#39;s interior as you need to depending on the type of pans or casseroles you are using for a particular meal.","With the extra-large oven window, you can easily see inside. Although this comes with helpful oven controls, the big window lets you trust your instincts and personal cooking skills to determine if those ramekins of Crème brûlée are browned just right and are ready to take out of the oven. There is no need for a kitchen torch to caramelize the tops – just sprinkle brown sugar on top, place the ramekins under the broiler and keep a close eye on your desserts.","One thing lacking is a warming drawer, which would be a nice touch for keeping foods you&#39;ve already cooked warm as well as breads or rolls. The oven also lacks a temperature probe that would be a useful to ensure meat products have been cooked to safe temperatures.","This oven also comes with a lock for safety and an auto shutoff function that turns the appliance off after 12 hours.","If you keep kosher, you will welcome the fact that this slide-in range offers a Sabbath mode that you can program so the oven continues its baking at the temperature you select to keep foods warm until you choose to turn it off.","As far as cleaning, the Whirlpool WEG760H0DS employs its own steam cleaning capability that safely cleans the oven&#39;s interior. You remove oven racks, possibly take a plastic scraper to a few areas that have tough baked-on debris and then pour 1.75 cups of filtered or distilled water onto the oven floor. Set the controls and the oven does the rest. When the cycle is done and the oven is cool, you can use a sponge or soft cloth to wipe up remaining liquid. If debris remains, you can lift it off with a plastic scraper or sponge that is intended for scrubbing but won&#39;t damage the oven&#39;s surface.","This stylish slide-in stove comes in three colors, stainless steel, black or white, and can suit any decorating theme you have in your kitchen. You get a one-year warranty on parts and labor with this range. If you need help, the phone support is excellent, you can email the manufacturer. The website has an online user manual you can download.","You do not get a warming oven or temperature probe with the oven on this slide-in range, but its hearty size and the versatility provided by the number of oven rack positions make this oven a flexible and helpful choice for anyone who does plenty of baking and roasting. Any cook who likes gas burners will enjoy this cooktop as well."]},"id":"4a5cd751-259f-4d28-9645-972c9080e494","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63912","url":"/whirlpool-weg760h0ds-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-02T19:53:27Z","datePublished":"2015-04-02T19:53:27Z","name":"Whirlpool WEG760H0DS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":89,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-02T19:53:27Z","id":"mATELspAb32k9kiiDECaub","meta":{"title":"Whirlpool WEG760H0DS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Whirlpool WEG760H0DS.
