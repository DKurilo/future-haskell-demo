Both the refrigerator and the freezer portions have adjustable shelves and full-width drawers to maximize the interior capacity, which is relatively large for counter-depth models. You can choose from three attractive color schemes to have a functional and aesthetically pleasing <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a>.","The Whirlpool Gold GSC25C6EYY provides 24.6 cubic feet of interior space, which is more than the average counter-depth model. The refrigerator has 14.33 cubic feet and the freezer has 10.24 cubic feet, and both have adjustable shelving to maximize the space. As far as capacity in counter-depth models is concerned, these are some of the best side-by-side refrigerators.","The refrigerator portion has four shelves, three of which are adjustable and spillproof. The MicroEtch shelves also provide up to 25 percent more space than standard shelves. You can store your fruits and veggies in the climate-controlled crisper drawer or in the two full-width standard drawers. The door also has two adjustable gallon-sized bins and two adjustable 2-liter bins.","The GSC25C6EYY uses Whirlpool&#39;s 6th Sense technology to keep your food at the proper temperature. Built-in sensors detect rises in temperature and automatically pump extra cool air to restore temperature. If you accidentally leave the door open, an alarm sounds after five minutes to remind you to close it. You also can use the 6th Sense function to freeze new food additions to your freezer at a more rapid rate. When you select this option, it runs for 24 hours or until it is deactivated.","The freezer has adjustable, full-width shelves and full-width drawers. These ensure you get the most out of the freezer space. The in-door icemaker frees up precious space above the shelves. It dispenses crushed or cubed ice, and you can easily remove the ice bin for filling large glasses or pitchers. The water dispenser uses the Pur water filtration system to provide you with clean water for up to six months.","The Whirlpool Gold series is less impressive than other side-by-side refrigerator and freezers when it comes to energy efficiency. Although these refrigerators are counter-depth models with smaller interior capacities than other side-by-sides, they use an above-average amount of energy; the estimated yearly energy use is 576 kWh, costing an estimated $61 annually. Whirlpool&#39;s warranty is not impressive either, simply covering parts and labor for one year.","If you need help or support with your refrigerator, the website is a good resource. You can find user manuals, a FAQs page and tutorials. If you need to contact customer service, you can call the toll-free telephone number, use the live chat option or complete an email request form."]},"id":"2f5ce48f-173c-41e6-8f9a-6238f3d63d4b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c72a99a4-059d-4763-8a0e-941673ab1d8d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Gold models are counter-depth side-by-side refrigerators with a solid list of features.
