Professionals can install water heaters correctly and safely while taking less time overall. They also often have water heater suggestions for your home. Furthermore, some brands only sell through installers.","To find the best plumber in your area, take some time to look at their online customer reviews on Yelp, HomeAdvisor, Angie&#39;s List and similar websites. If they don&#39;t clearly outline their pricing and estimated completion time and provide a written quote, don&#39;t use them, even if they are the lowest bid.","<strong>How Much Does a Tankless Water Heater Cost?</strong>","At the time of this writing, the tankless water heaters we reviewed cost anywhere from $130 to $1,300 – the least expensive model is the <a href=\"/chronomite-review\">Chronomite SR-20L/240</a>, and the most expensive model is the <a href=\"/rinnai-review\">Rinnai RUC98iN</a>. Our favorite tankless water heater, the <a href=\"/ecosmart-review\">EcoSmart ECO 27</a>, falls right in the middle at $449. The average price for the tankless water heaters we compared is $478.","Keep in mind that you have to pay for installation on top of the price of the water heater itself. If you’re proficient in plumbing and electrical work, you may be able to install your water heater yourself. If not, it&#39;s important to find a professional to do it for you. The cost of installation varies widely depending on where you live.","<strong>Electric Vs. Gas</strong>","Tankless water heaters use one of three power sources: electricity, natural gas or propane. In some cases, the type you buy is dictated by the power source available in your home, so you won&#39;t have a say in the matter. Still, it&#39;s good to know what your options are if you have more than one power source.","You can expect electric models to have lower operating costs but be more expensive to buy. In contrast, natural gas and propane models cost less to buy and have slightly higher operating costs. Gas models also work when your power goes out.","<strong>Size &amp; Flow Rate</strong>","The tankless water heater’s size generally impacts its hot water delivery rate. For example, if you need hot water for your entire home, you need a larger unit to keep up with the demands of people using multiple faucets. Smaller models, with a flow rate of around 0.5 gallons per minute (gpm), may only work for a single bathroom or faucet, though they can also serve to supplement a traditional water heater or add hot water to a garage sink outside your home.","Tankless water heaters can only provide a fixed amount of heating based on the temperature of the water flowing through them. As such, if you live in a colder climate, you need a larger model with a higher flow rate to produce the same amount of hot water a smaller one can in a temperate climate.","<strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>","On the whole, tankless water heaters use less energy than conventional water heaters, though some models are more efficient than others. To maximize energy efficiency, look for one that is Energy Star qualified. However, keep in mind that the most efficient water heaters, like the <a href=\"/best-tankless-water-heatersrinnai-review\">Rinnai RUC98iN</a>, usually have the highest prices. The Rinnai is not only efficient, it runs off both natural gas and propane, and has multiple venting options.","<strong>Traditional Water Heaters</strong>","Most homeowners choose traditional gas or electric storage-tank <a href=\"/best-water-heaters\">water heaters</a>, which cost less than tankless water heaters. However, these units are also bulky, making them more difficult to transport and install. They&#39;re also not nearly as efficient as tankless water heaters.","<em><strong>Contributing Reviewer:</strong> Noel Case</em>"]},"id":"486a445b-1699-4cb1-8f2f-94ce8ca74411","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"871bc2d7-33f2-4fbc-864a-b5b8ff1fc6c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">Chronomite</a>","<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">Eccotemp</a>","<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">EcoSmart</a>","<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">Marey</a>","<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">Noritz</a>","<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">Rheem</a>","<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">Rinnai</a>","<a href=\"https://www.networx.com/plumbers?se=9807\">Stiebel</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"bbfa47bd-dc88-4caf-a552-aab0c2687a81","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1734","url":"/best-tankless-water-heaters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:19:04Z","datePublished":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","name":"Best Tankless Water Heaters","synopsis":"Tankless water heaters help you reduce energy costs, are better for the environment than traditional water heaters and provide hot water whenever you need it.","review":{},"strapline":"Tankless water heaters help you reduce energy costs, are better for the environment than traditional water heaters and provide hot water whenever you need it.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","id":"focusVEM3y9jyVX9xmpFwF","meta":{"title":"Best Tankless Water Heaters 2019 -
