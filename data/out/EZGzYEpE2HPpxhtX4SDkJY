With an MSRP of $799, it compares with the <a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm 8.0 EX</a> and <a href=\"/nordictrack-gx-4.4-pro-review\">NordicTrack GX 4.4 Pro</a>.","The Diamondback has 20 workout presets and 16 levels of resistance. Its handlebars are adjustable to fit your body type, and they have integrated pulse grip sensors to help you monitor your heart rate. Like seven of the exercise bikes we reviewed, the 510Ub Upright has a maximum weight capacity of 300 pounds. The range among all 10 machines on our site is 225 to 400 pounds.","This exercise bike has a user height range of 5’4” to 6’5”. You can adjust both the height and the fore/aft saddle positioning of its seat, along with the viewing angle of its console. While its pedals aren’t equipped with straps or clips, they are textured for better grip. If clips are a must, Diamondback’s website says you can easily switch the pedals out with upgrades from your local bike store. Similarly, some consumers say the seat isn’t comfortable, but it can also be replaced.","The 510Ub Upright’s comfort and convenience features include quickset programming keys, scrolling instructions during setup and a water bottle holder. Its console has a blue LCD display and a built-in media center that includes multispeed cooling fans, speakers, a headphone jack and a fold-out reading rack. If its lack of Bluetooth connectivity is a deal breaker, we recommend the ProForm and NordicTrack bikes, along with the <a href=\"/nautilus-u618-review\">Nautilus U618</a> – our best overall pick.","While some consumers say this exercise bike is difficult to assemble, others say the process is straightforward. Once you get it put together, the assembled dimensions of this machine are 41 x 23 x 58 inches (length, width, height). It weighs 76 pounds, which is about average, and it has transport wheels to make moving it less difficult.","Diamondback Fitness guarantees the 510Ub Upright with a five-year warranty on its frame and brakes, three years on parts and electronics and one year of labor coverage. The company provides consumer support by phone and email, and its representatives responded promptly to our inquiries."]},"id":"28aaaffb-b447-4029-bc33-5186888973ef","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65509","url":"/diamondback-fitness-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-09T22:34:02Z","datePublished":"2015-06-09T22:34:02Z","name":"Diamondback Fitness 510Ub Upright","synopsis":"The Diamondback Fitness 510Ub Upright is one of the higher-end exercise bikes we considered.
