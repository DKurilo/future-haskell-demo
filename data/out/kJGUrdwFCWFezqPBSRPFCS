You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The  CatEye Stealth 50 is a low-cost <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-bike-gps\">bike GPS</a>   that provides all of the features essential for a serious cyclist, without any of the extras that drive the cost up in comparable models. It will calculate your speed, the time you&#39;ve been riding and the distance you&#39;ve gone, and it will display that information on the screen.","The Stealth is also compatible with 3rd-party ANT+ sensors, like heart rate or cadence monitors, so you don&#39;t have to buy additional sensors if you already own some. ANT+ is a low power, close distance wireless connection system that allows the Stealth to communicate with the sensors wirelessly. Seeing the data the ANT+ sensors can communicate can help you train at optimum levels and improve more quickly as a cyclist.","You control the Stealth with four buttons: power, menu, reset and mode. The power, menu and reset buttons are all on the back of the device, and the mode button is the only button on the front. You won&#39;t need to access any of the buttons other than the front mode button when you&#39;re riding.","The Stealth has GPS tracking, so you can upload ride information online. When you connect the Stealth to your computer via USB and synchronize it with a cycling website, such as Strava, it will display data gathered from your GPS and your sensors, and it will show your route on a map. This gives you an easy way to analyze your ride and track your progress.","The Stealth has a simple LCD screen, which is backlit so you can read it easily at night. This backlight can be programmed to turn on at certain times, which is especially useful if your ride early in the day or late in the evening. The Stealth is waterproof to 20 meters  (65 feet),  and it has a tough, low-profile, plastic shell. Its 10-hour battery life  is disappointing, especially in a bike computer as simple as the Stealth, as many comparable bike computers have a battery life of 12 hours or more.","One of the better features that CatEye provides is a helpful online video tutorial, which helps you set up the cycle computer for the first time. This is useful because it can be difficult to figure out how to synchronize the Stealth with your ANT+ sensors."]},"id":"d8bed329-c3d1-4d63-88a1-be7129eb6cf3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cb2bc92b-96db-480f-943f-07e418d6ef6c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Stealth does a good job with sensor information, but it should be considered a bare bones bicycle GPS due to a lack of a color screen, touchscreen interface or in-ride map support.
