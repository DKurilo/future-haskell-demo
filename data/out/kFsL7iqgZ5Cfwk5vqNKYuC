The oval burner in the center of the stovetop can accommodate roasting pans, griddles and oversize pans. However, unlike some of its competitors, this <a href=\"/best-gas-ranges\">gas range</a> doesn’t include an integrated griddle. The range’s slightly recessed cooktop and sealed burners keep spills from spreading or falling below the surface, so it’s easy to clean up messes. In addition, its full-coverage, continuous grates make it easy to slide heavy pans from burner to burner, and you can pop them in the dishwasher when they get dirty.","This Kenmore gas range has an average-size, 5-cubic-foot convection oven. The broiler has a respectable 13,500 Btu heat output, and the oven reaches temperatures up to 550 degrees Fahrenheit. On its lower temperatures, you can use the oven to melt and warm food and raise dough. However, it doesn’t have a proofing mode, which can produce much lower temperatures and doesn’t dry out or prematurely bake doughs. The oven comes with three porcelain-coated racks that slide into six positions.","As with most ovens, the Kenmore 74233’s self-cleaning mode uses high temperatures to reduce food remnants to ash, and you can run it in two-, three- or four-hour cycles. The oven also has a timed shutoff, delayed start and Sabbath mode. You can prevent kids from playing with the oven by setting the child lock. Also, the storage drawer is a good place to keep cookie trays, pots and pans so they are readily available when you need them. The Kenmore 74233 is a budget-friendly gas range, but if it’s still out of your budget, the <a href=\"/amana-review\">Amana AGR6603SFS</a> is another good option.","Kenmore’s warranty covers parts and labor 13 months, which is average. Warranty issues are handled by a call center that schedules repairs. Kenmore’s customer service representatives are easy to contact by phone or email, and the owner manual and warranty information are available on the company’s website."]},"id":"e3f9df7d-6b88-4384-a0b9-019a7f7a62a6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70284","url":"/kenmore-elite-74233-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-16T16:46:02Z","datePublished":"2018-10-16T16:46:02Z","name":"Kenmore Elite 74233","synopsis":"The Kenmore Elite 74233 has an impressive 18,200 Btu primary burner, and its remaining four burners output 14,200 Btu, 10,000 Btu, 9,500 Btu and 5,000 Btu of heat.
