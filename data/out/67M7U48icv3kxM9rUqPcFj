You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Quorum Turino 63565-44 is a beautiful <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fan</a> that combines the splendor of Italian countryside designs with the standard performance of modern fan motors. Though it offers an average level of performance in terms of fan speed, it achieves sufficient airflow for large rooms through its five-blade design. Combined with a low level of electrical consumption and a compatibility with dimmable lighting, this fan is manufactured with longevity for all of its hardware.","This is one of the best ceiling fans with lights due to its elegant design and performance levels. Its five reversible blades come with a rosewood and walnut finish on each side to achieve a desired look. It achieves a 56-inch span at a 14-degree pitch to encourage wide-reaching air circulation throughout a room. Its lighting kit consists of an Indian scavo glass, giving lighting in a room more texture.","This quiet ceiling fan comes with a 188 by 25 millimeter motor that achieves circulation levels of 5482 cubic feet per minute. At its highest speed, the fan consumes 69 watts, contributing to an energy efficiency of 79 cubic feet per minute per watt. The fan operates at three different speed levels, in addition to a reverse function, all of which can be manipulated through an included wall control. This control panel further handles light dimming with dimmable bulbs, helping you to further curb electrical expenses with the fan and extend the life of your bulbs.","Along the top rim of this ceiling fan is a series of ironwork details intended to create the look and feel of an Italian countryside home. It accomplishes this through beautiful floral and flourishing engravings to give it an appearance that coincides with a garden, making it ideal for rooms full of living plants or country furniture arrangements. The ceiling fan further works with ceilings of varying heights through its included four and 16 inch downrods and 80 inches of lead wire.","The Quorum Turino 63565-44 offers a standard level of performance in a non-standard design. Its appearance makes it quite appropriate for homes with an Italian countryside appearance, and its performance levels make it ideal for large rooms. The ceiling fan operates with an included wall control panel that gives you full operation of its multiple speeds and reverse capabilities, in addition to dimmable lights. The end result is that you’re able to quickly find a desirable speed setting and lighting level that uses less electricity and conserves the life of your fan and bulbs alike."]},"id":"693776dd-f189-4a02-976a-556e0031fc63","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66311","url":"/quorum-turino-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:06:09Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:06:09Z","name":"Quorum Turino 63565-44","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-22T17:06:09Z","id":"67M7U48icv3kxM9rUqPcFj","meta":{"title":"Quorum Turino 63565-44 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
