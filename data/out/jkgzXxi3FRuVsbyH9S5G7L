You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Modern Fan Torsion is designed to meet the varying needs of each home by offering a variety of customization options for this ceiling fan’s overall appearance. This ranges from wood type to lighting kits to downrod lengths, helping to achieve the look you desire in any room. In addition to a quiet overall operation, it achieves a high level of airflow circulation and efficiency for greater results in breaking up air pockets in a room.","This is one of the best <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fans</a> with lights because it comes with multiple options for lighting kits. If you simply need a fan, you can purchase it without the light for both a cost and vertical footprint savings. Or, you can purchase it with compatible halogen or compact fluorescent light kits, which adds up to five inches to the length of the fan. Both the fan and lighting can be controlled remotely through a separate handheld remote and wall control panel.","A critical feature of even the top ceiling fans is energy and airflow efficiency, and this fan operates on par with industry expectations. At its highest airflow setting, it circulates 6247 cubic feet of air per minute while consuming 66 watts. This equates to a final airflow efficiency of 84 cubic feet of air per minute per watt. The fan achieves this through a 14-degree blade pitch on its three plywood blades, which are available in sizes ranging from 42 to 62 inches in length.","This quiet ceiling fan epitomizes the look and feel of contemporary and minimalist fans. It comes with three plywood blades available in a variety of finishes from bright nickel to white. The blades themselves are fashioned from several options of wood, including maple and mahogany to give you customization options best-suited to your decorating needs. In addition, the unit comes with two downrods measured at five and 17 inches in length to achieve an overall height between 12 to 24 inches.","The Modern Fan Torsion is a contemporary option for many homes in need of ceiling fans, offering numerous customizations to its appearance. You can pick between multiple finishes, wood types, heights and lighting kits to achieve the desired look and feel. In addition, you can expect a high level of air circulation and energy efficiency for minimal impact to your electrical bill, all while increasing airflow in any room."]},"id":"a2d62826-4286-4ea2-a5a2-91f8cd58ed70","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66309","url":"/modern-fan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:05:52Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:05:52Z","name":"Modern Fan Torsion","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-22T17:05:52Z","id":"jkgzXxi3FRuVsbyH9S5G7L","meta":{"title":"Modern Fan Torsion Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
