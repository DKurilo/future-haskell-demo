You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sony has been a brand name in consumer electronics for years. For an inexpensive but high-quality radio <a href=\"/best-alarm-clocks\">alarm clock</a>, the Sony AM/FM Clock Radio is a great budget unit with a brand name. If you need a simple and functional alarm clock radio, then this is the alarm clock to get.","The clock runs on AC power, but it comes with a button cell battery pre-installed for backup. The manual has picture diagrams to help you replace the battery if you need to. The battery will keep your clock and alarm settings even if the power goes out.","Instead of a backlit display, the numbers and other indicators are green LED, and you can adjust the brightness. The display defaults to showing the time. However, you can view the year and date by pressing the snooze button.","The snooze option on this alarm clock is probably one of its best features. The bar is on the top of the unit at the very front, a standard place for it. However, unlike some other clocks, it has raised dots on the edge, so you can feel for it when you&#39;re tired and not mistake it for one of the buttons around it. The default snooze time is 10 minutes, but you can increase the snooze in increments of 10 for up to one full hour. You just press and hold the snooze button.","Unlike some of the newer radio alarm clocks higher on our list, this unit comes with both AM and FM analog radio. However, you can&#39;t set station presets. You can listen to a station with the sleep timer, which automatically turns off the radio after a set period ranging from 15 to 90 minutes. Or you can choose between the radio and a beep for a wake-up alarm.","This alarm clock has a limited warranty of one year. For product support, you can contact Sony directly by the phone number listed on the company&#39;s main site. Sony also has a dedicated support website with phone, email and live chat option. You can find a digital copy of the manual on the support site in case you misplace yours."]},"id":"3fe1b4db-a837-4a80-87cc-7ad89fb02f29","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f281c42c-77ab-4e7f-aaaf-bc8c95d6eaa9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony AM/FM Clock Radio is a great digital alarm clock with AM and FM radio.
