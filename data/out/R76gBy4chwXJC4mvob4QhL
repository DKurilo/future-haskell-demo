Functionally, however, this player does seem to have issues with overheating.","When Blu-ray technology first launched, the average consumer could not afford the upgrade. Companies like Toshiba have now made this technology affordable to the masses. For the same price as a normal DVD player, you can be privy to Full HD 1080p and picture adjustment from the comfort of your couch. The Toshiba BDX2700 also has 24p True Cinema which means that the movie plays at 24 frames per second, the same rate at which movies are filmed. But our favorite feature is Deep Color where the color spectrum is increased from millions to billions of colors.","Toshiba’s BDX2700 Blu-ray player is functionally able to handle a surround sound speaker system with a 7.1 channel audio output. If you can afford a speaker upgrade as well, this setup is the best way to take advantage of the audio technology the Toshiba BDX2700 has to offer:  Dolby True HD, dts HD and LPCM. These features are specifically designed to enhance your home entertainment experience. Music file formats like MP3 and Audio CDs are playable on this Blu-ray disc player as well.","While you’re contentedly sitting back enjoying the crystal clear picture and amazing sound effects of your movie, the Toshiba BDX2700 Blu-ray player also has the functionality to access BD-Live content and internet streaming video. With BonusView built right into the player, you can experience picture-in-picture content with most BD-Live Blu-ray discs; pull up the director’s commentary and watch it over top of the movie.","This Blu-ray player is energy efficient, with an Energy Star qualification to its name. It’s also Wi-Fi ready and has the appropriate connections, either by Ethernet or USB.","I/O Ports Available:"]},"id":"f2471bb4-91fc-45b3-bd15-a71162fbe482","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["7.1 Channel Audio Out","Component Video","Ethernet Port","HDMI Output","Optical Digital Audio Outputs","One SD Card Slot","One USB Port"],"type":"ul"},"id":"55feacf8-6d6f-4885-9098-4c94f6e3f976","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although the Toshiba BDX2700 Blu-ray player has every I/O port possible, the only cable included with the package is the composite video/audio cable.

Others don’t mention this problem at all. If you do run into this problem, Toshiba has a 90 day warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. They will exchange your defective Blu-ray player for a new or refurbished player at no cost to you. After those 90 days are up, they will exchange defective players for a new or refurbished player at a small fee."]},"id":"c54cd300-607c-440a-8955-edc2ab01b7d2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"899318a8-d778-4d20-b7a9-ba46c98322f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We’ll admit, the user reviews make us a little nervous to purchase the Toshiba BDX2700 Blu-ray player.
