The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-wireless-routers\">Wireless Routers</a> here.</em>","The first thing you’ll notice about the ASUS RT-AC68U is its stylish looks. Unlike most of its competitors, the RT-AC68U stands upright, displaying a pattern of diamond shapes. Everything, including a sleek wall plug, is meticulously designed to make this wireless router a piece of equipment that you won’t have to tuck away in a dark corner of your home. Unfortunately, its tall design could make it difficult to tuck it away even if you wanted to.","But good looks aren’t the only things this premium wireless router has going for it. It’s also incredibly fast. Built with the latest in Wi-Fi technology, the RT-AC68U grants industry-leading speeds, strong wireless connections and powerful networking tools.","The ASUS RT-AC68U features three substantial antennas that can be angled to provide an optimally directed Wi-Fi signal. On the backside of the device, you’ll find a series of ports and buttons that allow for internet connectivity and add useful functionalities to the router.","Most importantly, the RT-AC68U features a gigabit WAN port for connecting to your modem. It also includes four gigabit LAN ports. These allow you to hardwire devices like desktop computers, gaming consoles or other HD media-streaming devices to your network for the fastest speeds.","For remotely accessing network storage devices or shared printers, the RT-AC68U also features a USB 2.0 and 3.0 port.","Near these ports is a series of useful buttons including a master power button, a Wi-Fi on and off button and a WPS button for securely connecting devices without using a password. Perhaps the most interesting inclusion, however, is an LED on and off switch. The ASUS RT-AC68U features a helpful LED panel that displays network information. However useful, these indicator lights can be distracting when they’re not being used, so an on and off button is a welcome inclusion.","As with all the best units, the RT-AC68U is a dual-band router. This means that it broadcasts both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Two bands on separate frequencies means that you will have fewer devices competing for bandwidth and improved overall speed on your wireless network.","The 2.4GHz networks have been around for quite some time and will be compatible with all of your older Wi-Fi enabled devices. The 5GHz band on the other hand, is newer and compatible with the new 802.11ac standard, meaning the router might be inaccessible to your older devices.","On the 5GHz band, you’ll benefit from the new 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard. This Wi-Fi standard boasts speeds up to three times faster than the previous generation at 1300 Mbps. While it’s unlikely that you’ll reach these speeds in the real world, 802.11ac is always going to be significantly faster, and buying a router that supports it is a great way to future-proof your network.","The ASUS RT-AC68U offers an extensive list of features and tools that rival or surpass most other wireless routers. As you’d expect from a router of this caliber, it also has a full set of security features. It includes both SPI and NAT firewalls to help protect you from malicious attacks while you’re online. For further security, your wireless network can be secured using the latest and most effective encryption method: WPA2.","Connecting network devices to your secured network is easy thanks to a WPS button located on the side of the router. Rather than having to input the network password on devices like Wi-Fi enabled printers, you can simply push the WPS button on your device within two minutes.","The parental controls on the RT-AC68U are fantastic. Using a scheduler found under the parental controls tab, you can block out specific times for specific devices, thus limiting the amount of time your kids spend online. If you’re so inclined, you can also block specific URLs and keywords to help protect your kids from inappropriate content.","Unlike some other options, the RT-AC68U doesn’t come with a preconfigured network. For this reason, it requires a little more time to set up than other options. You can configure your router by either plugging into a LAN port or joining an unsecured “ASUS” network and simply following a set up wizard.","Once configured, you’ll have access to one of the most compressive browser-based router interfaces that we’ve seen. Although the sheer number of adjustment options can be a little daunting, we found navigating the interface to be quite intuitive.","Power-users will appreciate the depth of customization that this router allows, from port forwarding to fine-tuning the power of your wireless signals, you’ll be able to set up a wireless network that is specific to your needs.","ASUS backs up this exceptional wireless router with a two-year warranty against defects in workmanship and materials. For support, you need look no further than the ASUS website. There you’ll find FAQs, drivers and user manuals. If you’d rather correspond with an ASUS representative, you can use phone, email and live chat support.","Overall, the ASUS RT-AC68U is one of the best premium wireless routers available. With an impressive maximum throughput of 1300 Mbps, best-in-class security features and a plethora of network configuration options, it’s hard to imagine a home-networking scenario in which this router wouldn’t excel."]},"id":"3e139e7e-bc5a-4997-a8c3-8fe43baadaae","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69358","url":"/asus-rt-ac68u-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-24T16:00:47Z","datePublished":"2017-05-24T16:00:47Z","name":"ASUS RT-AC68U","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
