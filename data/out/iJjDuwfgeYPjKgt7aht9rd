You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Panasonic Arc3 ES-RT77-S is designed to give you a close cut whether on your face or your head. This <a href=\"/best-electric-head-shavers\">electric head shaver</a> features a pop-up trimmer, Multi-Flex Arc foils, a pivoting shave head and cordless capabilities. This device includes a five-setting comb so you can trim and shave your head.","This electric razor stands out with its shaving technology. The shaver is designed with Multi-Flex Arc foils that easily cut your facial hair. Three nano-polished blades can cut through all hair types, and they are gentle enough that sensitive skin should not become excessively irritated and red after use. The blades are positioned at a 30-degree angle to easily reach all contours and areas of your face and head, without any difficulty and without sacrificing your comfort while shaving. The shaving head on this product also pivots and rotates which, you would think, should help you shave hard-to-reach areas.","After testing this Panasonic electric shaver, we found it provided a smooth cut but wasn’t as consistent as similar products on our lineup. Our testers found it awkward to hold and reach areas in the back of the head. This product didn’t cover much surface area, making shaving your entire head a timely process.","A pop-up trimmer is built into this Panasonic electric shaver. The trimmer features 45-degree blades to ensure you get a precise cut. The trimmer is ideal to get straight lines and the shape you desire on your necklines, sideburns and facial hair.","This is a cordless electric head shaver. On a single battery charge this product will last approximately 50 minutes, which is a bit shorter than average in our comparison. Many similar products will last an hour or longer without the need to recharge the batteries. With this Panasonic device, it takes approximately one hour to fully recharge the batteries. This is the shortest recharging time we saw on this type of device.","Unfortunately, this electric shaver does not include a charging stand. Shavers that do come with a charging stand, like the <a href=\"/panasonic-es-rt97-s-review\">Panasonic ES-RT97-S</a>, allow you to quickly and easily recharge the product. To recharge this device, you must use the included power cord. However, this device does include a five-setting comb that you lock onto the shaving head. This allows you to cut and trim hair instead of shaving it. This gives you more options with your hair and allows you to cut hair between 1 mm and 7 mm."]},"id":"5b0e96c3-cade-47f5-9458-68546d35ffdf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2992bf59-6d09-498c-8e30-7064c729cad9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic ES-RT77-S is an electric shaver with outstanding shaving technology.
