The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-bluetooth-headsets\">Bluetooth Headset Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Jabra Storm features a balanced, behind-the-ear design similar to other Jabra Bluetooth headsets, which provides excellent support and comfort at an affordable cost. However, while the voice quality is comparable to the best Bluetooth headsets, the noise cancellation is among the worst we tested. If you find yourself in the middle of a storm during a call, your caller will definitely know it.","The Storm scored a 90 percent in our voice quality tests, which is average. When you consider that the standard way of talking on the phone – holding the phone to your ear – scored 65 percent in the voice quality test, the Storm is a significant improvement, even though it didn&#39;t score as well as the best Bluetooth headsets. The difference is in the frequency contrast. With the Storm, your caller&#39;s voice sounds flatter and more distant than it would with better hands-free Bluetooth headsets.","The biggest downside is the lack of effective noise cancellation. In our noise reduction tests, which tested the Bluetooth earpiece&#39;s microphones by playing common background noises during a call, the Jabra Storm scored 65 percent, which was the lowest score. Our phone&#39;s microphone scored 50 percent on the same test. If you&#39;re in a noisy environment, your caller will ask you to repeat yourself more often with this Bluetooth headset than with others. However, it does come with a windsock that dampens the sound of wind passing over the boom microphone, which is more effective than the noise reduction.","The fit is comfortable and secure, which is important. The behind-the-ear design performed extremely well in our stability tests. It never fell off or needed to be adjusted, even when we shook our heads vigorously. The one downside to the comfort features is the lack of earbud options. It only comes with two earbuds. The best Bluetooth headsets come with five or six earbuds.","One of the best features of the Storm is the 10-hour battery life, which is the longest among the hands-free Bluetooth headsets we reviewed. It requires two hours to fully charge, which is slightly longer than the best Bluetooth headsets take. It&#39;s also the only headset that can last through a full eight-hour workday without receiving a charge. The only downside to the battery performance is the lack of a charging case, but with such a long battery life, you don&#39;t really need one.","The behind-the-ear design provides all-day comfort that most Bluetooth headsets can&#39;t match, because you can move around as freely as you like without jostling it from your ear. Since it wraps around your ear, the earbud doesn&#39;t need a concha fin. You have three earbud options, the standard small, medium and large. However, it lacks a carrying case and moisture protection, which is ironic considering the name."]},"id":"0fd39127-cddf-40a8-9354-18ad4d94b0d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d5d0c0f6-63d6-4789-b302-9af390d65d4a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jabra Storm is the most affordable Bluetooth headset in our review, and it shows in the low quality of the noise reduction.
