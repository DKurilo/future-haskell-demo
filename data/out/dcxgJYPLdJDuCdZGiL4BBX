Knowing that, you can purchase an affordable <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> with the confidence that your child&#39;s seat passes rigorous safety tests. The Cosco Light &#39;n Comfy Elite offers many of the safety and convenience features that we look for, and its low weight minimum makes it great for premature babies. However, it is not natively compatible with any strollers, and it doesn&#39;t offer energy-absorbent foam.","As mentioned above, the Cosco Light &#39;n Comfy Elite passes federal crash safety tests. It offers an adjustable five-point harness and side-impact protection. It includes LATCH connectors for easy installation and is even FAA compliant. However, it does not have energy-absorbent foam.","The Light &#39;n Comfy Elite is rated to support children between 4 and 22 pounds. Most premature babies are born below 5 pounds, so this is a great option for preemies. Unfortunately, the average child will outgrow this child within the first year of life, and you&#39;ll have to buy a new rear-facing car seat.","The infant car seat comes with a light stay-in-car reclining base. The base feels flimsy in comparison to other car seats we reviewed, but it is easy to install and use. The carrier is not natively compatible with any strollers, a major drawback if this is your primary car seat. Also, the cushions are not machine washable, so if your baby makes a mess, you&#39;ll have to clean the seat by hand. There&#39;s an excellent amount of space between the adjustable carry handle and the canopy, so it&#39;s easy to carry.","Cosco supports the Light &#39;n Comfy Elite with a one-year warranty. Customer service is available by telephone and email. We were never able to make email contact, and when we called, the lines were busy. Fortunately, you can leave your phone number, and a representative will call you as soon as possible, usually later the same day."]},"id":"91fe1622-21f7-43e0-b005-e02556398233","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b3f9cf25-fb22-4e0e-a886-49a7b3b04245","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cosco Light &#39;n Comfy Elite is an affordable baby car seat with all the features that you need.
