You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","GottaPlay is just a cut below our top three services in the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/988-best-gaming-services.html\">online video game review</a> category. Though they still provide good service overall, GottaPlay only has 4000 games - the same as Gamemine but well below GameFly and Gamerang. Apart from having a relatively small game selection, their available plans are also lacking.","Perhaps our largest complaint with GottaPlay is their site’s organization. We found searching through their library to be a bit cumbersome. You have to be specific by narrowing your search through genre; you cannot simply choose to browse through all the games offered for a particular platform.","GottaPlay has the basic framework for a good website, but there are many parts of the site that seem incomplete. The New Releases section is empty. The Coming Soon page only has three games (at the time of this review). The individual game pages often lack screenshots and the demo videos don&#39;t actually work. The game reviews we found were helpful, but many games don&#39;t have any reviews.","If you are happy with a one or two-game plan, GottaPlay has the lowest monthly fees of the services we reviewed. However, they don&#39;t offer plans for renting three or four games at a time, which doesn&#39;t suffice for those serious gamers out there. We would like to see them add at least a three-game rental plan to their repertoire.","On the positive side, this service does have nine distribution centers across the country. Not surprisingly, they guarantee faster shipping than anyone else in the business. GottaPlay advertises average arrival time to be between two and seven days. However, it is very rare that it will take all seven days to receive your games. Additionally, they have a trading program designed for gamers to trade with other members as part of the service.","One of our favorite GottaPlay features is the ability to track your games through your account. This feature is great if you are really anxious about your deliveries because it helps reduce lost games.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"34e91741-a638-41d1-95fc-15620ac85f23","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like most online game rental sites, GottaPlay does not charge late fees or have due dates and offers free two-way shipping on both rentals and trades.
