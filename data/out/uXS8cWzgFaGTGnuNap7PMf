Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The Klipsch HD Theater 500 <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker system</a> will transform your sitting room into a heart-pounding cinematic haven. Klipsch is a well-known and trusted company in the speaker industry, and they have constructed a solid product that should hold up for a long time. This home theater speaker system belongs to a big family with a long history of great home audio.","These home theater speakers produce frequencies between 36 and 20,000 Hz. Although the range is reasonable, it is narrower than the other speaker systems we reviewed. The subwoofer produces strong bass, but audiophiles may note a lack in range.","The low-pass crossover covers a wide frequency range, spanning from 60 to 200 Hz. Low-pass crossovers allow you to choose which frequencies go to the subwoofer and the mid-range drivers. The broader the low-pass crossover&#39;s range, the more control you will have over the sound of your home theater speakers.","This home theater speaker system comes with five small satellite speakers and a subwoofer. With the exception of the subwoofer, all of these speakers come with magnetic shielding and removable covers. We like the modern design of the satellite speakers in particular, which look great with or without their covers attached. The satellites come equipped with 0.75&#34; aluminum dome tweeters and 2.5&#34;drivers. To produce louder mid-range frequencies for dialogue, the center channel speaker features an additional 2.5&#34; driver.","We like also these speakers for their lifespan. So long as you follow the guidelines set forth in the user manual, you can expect the speakers to outlast your flat screen TV or other elements of your home theater. In the user manual, Klipsch states that their speakers are built to last for a lifetime. You can expect them to live up to that.","These speakers sound pretty good, like you would expect from Klipsch. As always, they will perform best in a smaller room. The subwoofer is really the star of the show. Built into an 11&#34; x 13&#34; x 17&#34; enclosure, it packs a lot more power than you might expect. You can expect better performance from these speakers with home theater than with music.","We were disappointed with the use of spring-clip terminals in place of binding posts. They do not admit banana plugs, which leaves bare speaker wire as your only viable wiring alternative. If you are uncomfortable with handling bare wire, this will add an unwelcome layer of complication to the setup process. Fortunately, the spring-clip terminals are still easy to use. Adhere to the instruction manual for wiring up your speakers and you will not have any trouble.","Each speaker also features a threaded insert in the back for easy wall mounting (though you will need to attach a special brace to the wall first). They also look great on bookshelves, desks and tables.","The folks at Klipsch guarantee this surround sound system for up to five years. If any problems arise from faulty workmanship or manufacturing, the speakers are eligible for repair or replacement. The warranty does not cover accidents, nor will it cover damage incurred during shipping or as the result of misuse. Any cosmetic damage (such as scratches or paint chips) is considered incidental to the warranty and will not be repaired.","The warranty includes a commendable two-year guarantee on the subwoofer and amplifier. Competing speaker systems typically provide amp coverage for half that length of time."]},"id":"3d898655-9b1b-4649-b396-019d6f917ad1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91f369c7-735f-47b3-beab-d61ffc744f41","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We recommend the Klipsch HD Theater 500 for a great combination of durability, sound quality and smart design.
