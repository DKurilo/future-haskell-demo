You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Instant Pot IP-LUX60 is a <a href=\"/best-food-steamers\">6-in-1 programmable cooker</a> that can be used as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, food steamer and warmer. You can also use it to sauté and brown food.","Aside from its numerous functions, it is also very energy efficient. It has 10 micro-processor controlled programs, so these a setting designed specifically common items you&#39;ll cook. It has delay timer for up to 24 hours, so you can time your meal according to your schedule. It has an automatic keep-warm feature, which is great if you are delayed. That way, no matter when you&#39;re ready, you&#39;ll have access to a warm meal.","The Instant Pot IP-LUX60 is great for cooking foods efficiently in a short amount of time. For instance, you can cook a whole artichoke in half the amount of time that it takes with a stovetop vegetable steamer – just 10 minutes at high pressure. You&#39;ll also want to allow about 10 minutes for the pressure to release before you serve it.","There are presets to cook poultry, meats, stews, puddings, soups, chili, rice and other grains. It can be used as a steam cooker to cook meats, poultry, seafood and any kind of vegetable you can think of. Best of all, there is no stirring or tending necessary, so you can do other things while your dinner cooks.","The Instant Pot is designed to be smart. Its state-of-the-art microprocessor monitors the pressure and temperature, keeps time and adjusts heating intensity and duration. Even the volume of food is taken into consideration. All this helps to ensure consistency. The cooker is UL and ULC certified, so even though it cooks under pressure, it is certified for safety.","This is a great all-in-one cooker that saves time and energy and produces delicious meals. This model is likely more than you&#39;ll need if you just want to steam some vegetables occasionally; however, if you want one appliance that does the work of many and saves energy at the same time, the Instant Pot is a great choice."]},"id":"11295ee5-1077-4b38-a5a1-fa0d494ed52c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60882","url":"/instant-pot-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-20T21:53:52Z","datePublished":"2014-10-20T21:53:52Z","name":"Instant Pot IP-LUX60","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
