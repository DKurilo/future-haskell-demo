The Prestige II – Gemini harnesses the trusted, familiar power of a gas grill and combines it with the lightning fast heat and cooking times of an infrared grill. When placed side by side these heads give you the freedom to cook how you want. It is almost a perfect metaphor when you are grilling steaks and burgers on Independence Day. Its sleek look, solid construction and dual grill heads make it a worthwhile infrared grill."]},"id":"2d6a8248-9678-4882-a9ca-228c5bb3aa5e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Grilling Experience"},"id":"72b2e6f9-15fc-4856-8e8d-8b73e10ef521","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Just looking at the Prestige II – Gemini gives you some indication of the power the infrared grill encloses. When you combine all seven burners together, this infrared grill boasts 107,000 BTUs in total cooking power.","The grill located on the right is a conventional gas grill head. However, there is nothing conservative about the cooking power the gas portion of the grill harnesses. The four burners on the gas portion of the grill pack a whopping 42,000 BTUs. Preheat and cooking times on this grill head are among the lowest of any stand-alone gas grill available.","The grill head on the right is where all the infrared magic happens. Although the infrared portion of this grill is the secondary feature, it is among the best infrared grills made. Even if the Prestige II – Gemini had no gas grill head, it would still rank quite high on our infrared grill comparison chart. The two 30,000 BTU infrared burners on the Prestige II – Gemini enable you to achieve restaurant style grilling in just a few minutes.","The burners on the infrared portion of the grill heat to temperatures in excess of 700 degrees in less than seven minutes. Short of grilling on an active volcano, there aren’t many products that tout that kind of barbecuing power. These high temperatures are ideal for searing thick steaks quickly. The less time a cut of meat is on a grill, the more flavors the meat retains when the time comes to eat it.","Aside from the dual-head grills, the Prestige II – Gemini also comes equipped with a side burner that draws 13,000 BTUs for cooking side dishes and appetizers. The side burner is excellent for boiling potatoes or carrots to go along with your steaks and burgers. Additionally, this infrared grill comes with a four-fork rotisserie. Now you will not have to buy those rotisserie chickens from under the heating lamps at the grocery store deli.","Napoleon employs their patented WAVE stainless steel cooking grids on both heads of the Prestige II – Gemini. In addition, this infrared grill employs LIFT EASE roll top lids for convenient access. The electronic ignition and ergonomic knobs for temperature control round out the particulars of the grill’s cooking features."]},"id":"348cbf79-2bc0-49cd-bf41-808b0cf99f5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"c55b313b-005a-4bc0-b999-22e331cfe689","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This infrared grill’s primary cooking area measures 750 square inches. Keep in mind that number applies to the gas portion of the grill. The actual infrared grilling space on the Prestige II – Gemini measures 406 square inches. That is not quite as much infrared grilling space as some of its competitors. However, combine those two numbers and you get a whopping 1,156 square inches of red-hot cooking space. No other grill on our lineup comes close to giving you that much space to work with.","Another grill feature the Prestige II – Gemini possesses is wheels. Considering the size and weight of this grill, moving it around without the benefit of wheels would be a daunting and dangerous chore. While you should still move the grill with extreme caution, the wheels bring the number of bodies required to move the grill down to just one.","There are a few options available for Napoleon customers interested in buying a Prestige II – Gemini. Add-ons for this infrared grill include a durable weather cover, smoker box, side burner, charcoal tray and more. These niceties are optional because not everyone uses them. So when you’re buying your grill, make sure that it has all the bells and whistles you generally use in your barbecue."]},"id":"0f56d086-b632-4017-ae0e-be4800ee3d6c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Heating"},"id":"13beef2d-db81-45aa-8a4d-12310eaa4e05","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As we mentioned before, this is a heavy grill.

This is where you can store things like condiments, utensils, outdoor flatware and barbecue tools such as spatulas.
