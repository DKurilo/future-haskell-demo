This <a href=\"/best-water-coolers\">water cooler</a> and heater combination unit includes a universal spillproof water guard system, with a child safety lock on the hot water faucet to keep young ones from scalding themselves from the electric heating system. The anti-electric shock protection mechanism provides additional protection, making it safe to keep the unit in the home or in a public space.","This water tank features a sleek white rectangular configuration, with a stable base that can handle inadvertent bumps or a shaky tank-mounting process. Ragalta recognizes that some people struggle with the tank transfer process, which can be a little more difficult than it looks, and built a sturdy unit. In case you manage to overcome the spillproof feature and end up with an overflow on the floor, the unit sits on four legs to keep it slightly elevated, so you don&#39;t need to worry about water getting trapped under the tank.","The hot and cold water cooler has a cooling power of 75 watts and a capacity of half a liter per hour. At its coldest, you can expect to sip on water below 59 degrees Fahrenheit. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Ragalta can heat your water to between 185 and 203 degrees Fahrenheit at a rate of 5 liters per hour. The LED status indicator gives you a reading on your heating and power levels. An extra storage compartment is included in the frame, which you can use for your extra cups.","The unit meets North American safety standards and has received the ETL Mark as a compliance indicator. The ETL Mark is administered by Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJs) in the United States and Canada as a means of measuring the quality and safety of consumer products. This approval spans a year on the water dispenser.","The Ragalta Thermo Electric Hot and Cold Water Cooler is an affordable alternative to relying on your faucet as your primary water source. It&#39;s also a sturdy and safe unit for your home or workplace."]},"id":"0826a4ff-aaed-4f79-a054-bbff142040a7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61794","url":"/ragalta-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-22T23:43:57Z","datePublished":"2014-12-22T23:43:57Z","name":"Ragalta RWC-195 Purelife Series","synopsis":"The Ragalta Thermo Electric Hot and Cold Water Cooler is an efficient water reservoir stand capable of holding a 3- or 5-gallon water tank.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Ragalta Thermo Electric Hot and Cold Water Cooler is an efficient water reservoir stand capable of holding a 3- or 5-gallon water tank.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-22T23:43:57Z","id":"o8TmQcCDWEF8mcUqAKqg8f","meta":{"title":"Ragalta Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Ragalta Thermo Electric Hot and Cold Water Cooler is an efficient water reservoir stand capable of holding a 3- or 5-gallon water tank.
