You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Lynx Roman from American Medical ID is a bracelet that allows you to store all of your critical medical information with you on to go. This eliminates the need to carry around a small paper document. The Lynx Roman bracelet features a low profile design that looks similar to a watch or piece of jewelry, much like the <a href=\"/hera-review\">Hera Stretch</a> and the <a href=\"/lifetag-review\">LIFETAG</a> bracelets.","This durable <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">medical alert bracelet</a> is a cross-link stainless steel chain bracelet with a large flat area that can be engraved with pertinent medical or personal information. The front of the piece features the rod of Asclepius symbol, a universal symbol the represents medicine and health care that is recognized all over the world. This symbol ensures that emergency health care workers can easily identify the piece as a medical alert bracelet.","By using this type of ID bracelet, you are limited to how much information you can put on it. You can only engrave a few lines, and these usually include your name and any medical information that first responders should know. For example, if you have a heart condition and take blood thinners, you could engrave the bracelet with your name, &#34;heart patient&#34; and &#34;on Warfarin.&#34; If you have any life threatening allergies, such as a food allergy, you should also include that information. It is a good idea to include emergency contact information as well.","Although the Lynx Roman is a traditional medical ID bracelet, American Medical ID offers an upgrade called MyIHR. This feature allows you to keep your medical conditions, medications, insurance and other valuable information in an interactive digital health record. If you choose this option, your medical alert bracelet will still feature the rod of Asclepius symbol and be engraved with your name, vital medical information and more. It will also include a notice that lets physicians know they can find more information at the MyIHR website by entering the user ID and PIN engraved on the piece.","You have complete control over your personal medical file on the website, and you can include information such as complete medical information, care instructions, emergency and physician contact information, insurance information and more. You can also upload copies of files, such as scans and X-rays, so everything is in one place. This is an ideal way to ensure the information that won&#39;t fit on your medical ID is available whenever it&#39;s needed.","The Lynx Roman medical ID bracelet is a good midrange piece that offers the advantage of a traditional engraved bracelet with the option of compiling a more thorough medical history that medical professionals can access during an emergency. Because the most valuable information is engraved on the piece itself, medical staff will have the most vital information they need to treat you, regardless of whether they have access to the internet or a computer."]},"id":"815fafa0-a6cd-487c-b4b2-7768684ba08a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63669","url":"/lynx-roman-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:09:42Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:09:42Z","name":"Lynx Roman","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-24T19:09:42Z","id":"8wC2Y5Ptf7iFUrxTST5jg3","meta":{"title":"Lynx Roman Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Lynx Roman from American Medical ID is part of the Lynx collection of traditional engravable medical alert bracelets.
