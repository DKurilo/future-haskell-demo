You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With the Nuvyyo Tablo 4-Tuner OTA, you can record four programs simultaneously. Opting in to its subscription service gets you access to organization and scheduling options, extensive guides, filters, and mobile viewing options. However, it lacks internal storage and can’t access streaming or cable content. Without a subscription, its functionality is greatly limited, which is why it is the lowest-ranked <a href=\"/best-dvrs\">DVR</a> on our lineup.","Unlike other DVR recorders on our lineup, the Nuvvyo Tablo doesn’t have an internal hard drive to which you can store anything you record. Instead, you have to provide your own external storage. You can skip commercials in any recorded content, and you can also view the TV guide to look for programs to watch or to set a recording schedule.","As its name implies, the Tablo 4-Tuner OTA can only access free over-the-air TV content. While you don’t need the DVR recorder at all to watch any of this – only a simple antenna – it can record your favorite basic cable shows so you can rewatch them any time. However, the unit cannot access or record any content sourced from cable, satellite or streaming services. If you do want access to those sources, consider a different DVR, like the <a href=\"/dish-hopper-review\">Dish Hopper 3</a>.","Purchase of the DVR includes a free 30-day subscription to its service. Once your trial period ends, you can choose a monthly, yearly or lifetime subscription. The company doesn’t require you to have a subscription to keep using the DVR at that point, but if you opt out, you’ll miss out on lots of functionality, including a 14-day TV guide, filters, cover art, and extensive search and organization capacity. Additionally, you won’t be able to access the out-of-home streaming feature that lets you view your recorded content on a mobile app from anywhere in the world.","The digital video recorder only has two ports: one for Ethernet and a USB 2.0 for your external hard drive storage. Though its lack of input and output options may be a turn-off for advanced users or those wanting to get more out of their DVR, the simple design is ideal for those less familiar with the technology or wanting to eliminate cords from their lives.","Because it doesn’t bother with internal storage or extra ports, the device is small and easy to store. It measures just 6.8 inches wide, 4.5 inches deep and 1.6 inches tall, and it weighs under 1 pound.","You can contact technical support via email or telephone. You can also check out the company’s blog, knowledgebase, user forums, FAQs and general support section on its website."]},"id":"44df6770-0b39-4f5f-b085-9bef39bb6fd0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"af47f2a6-a08d-451e-926e-529056cb90fc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It is difficult to understand how Nuvyyo justifies the cost of its Tablo 4-Tuner DVR, given its lack of an internal hard drive and  accessible content options, as well as its semi-requisite subscription service.
