You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Alliant Credit Union is an online credit union with banking services that are similar to those offered by the top<a href=\"/best-online-only-banks\"> online only banks</a>. It extends a full range of loans for mortgages, home equity and autos to its members and provides credit cards, including a rewards card, as well as deposit accounts. Because it&#39;s a credit union, membership is required. If you don&#39;t meet the employment or residential qualifications for membership, you can make a $10 charitable donation to join Foster Care to Success. Your membership with this charity then qualifies you for credit union membership. For these reasons, Alliant Credit Union receives our Top Ten Reviews Bronze Award.","For its deposit accounts, Alliant Credit Union pays interest rates that are average when compared to internet-only banks. It&#39;s free checking account is a good option because it doesn&#39;t levy a monthly service fee, doesn&#39;t require you to make an initial deposit of a certain amount and doesn&#39;t require you to maintain minimum balance. However, in order to earn interest on this account, you have to opt out of paper statement and have a money electronically deposited into your account each month. Its online savings account requires a $5 opening deposit and minimum balance, and you must maintain a minimum balance of $100 if you want to earn interest. Alliant Credit Union doesn&#39;t have money market accounts. Its shortest term for CD accounts is one year and its 60-month CD is on par with some of the highest interest rates provided by the top online banks in our review.","Your money is safe in Alliant Credit Union because it is NCUA insured, which is the credit union equivalent of the FDIC. It protects your online accounts using two-factor authentication, and you can set up notifications and alerts that will help you monitor your account activity. You can call customer service 24 hours a day, seven days a week and can also email the credit union using the form provided on its website.","Alliant Credit Union offers mobile online banking; its app is available from iTunes and Google Play. Free transfers are available, and it takes just one to two business days for your deposited funds to be accessible, which is better than average among internet-only banks. It partners with a robust collection of ATM networks to offer you access to over 80,000 surcharge free ATMs nationwide, including Alliant, Alliance One, Allpoint, Bank of the West, Co-op Network, Credit Union 24, CU Here and Publix Presto. Additionally, it reimburses up to $20 of ATM fees per month."]},"id":"5d4f4998-62f8-44ec-8c37-77042f5f179e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"86d05304-ff0f-45f5-b172-6fe70d2243d8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although its interest rates for deposit accounts are average, it has very accessible terms for its checking and savings accounts, making it a good choice for internet banking.
