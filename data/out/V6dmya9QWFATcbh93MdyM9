The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">Floor Standing Speakers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The MartinLogan SLM series of floor standing speakers is ultra thin and can stand freely on the floor or mount to your wall. Considering their small size, these speakers have strong sound output, though you will get more powerful audio from some larger speakers in our lineup.","The design of these speakers is remarkable. A single speaker only weighs 6.5 pounds. That’s 20 pounds lighter than the next lightest stereo speaker we reviewed. The SLM name suggests that these speakers are not only lightweight, but slim as well. These home speakers are less than 2 inches thick. They weigh less and are nearly as slim as the thinnest LED TVs, and they complement modern TVs aesthetically.","To keep the MartinLogan SLM series so petite, the drivers had to be relatively small. Underneath the grill you will find two 4-inch woofers and two 4-inch passive bass radiators to help boost the low-end frequencies. Even with the two passive bass radiators, the frequency response range doesn&#39;t dip very deep into the low tones. The speakers produce sounds from 25kHz on the high end to 100Hz in the bass range. This is by far the highest low-end frequency response rating in our lineup. You will probably want a separate subwoofer to deliver powerful low tones for movies and bass-heavy music.","These are among the most efficient floor speakers we reviewed, with a sensitivity rating of 94 decibels. This means they don’t require much power to produce sound. Generally, the more efficient a speaker is the better it is going to sound.","You can adjust the nominal impedance between 4, 6 and 8-ohms. This means you can plug these speakers into virtually any amplifier or receiver without having to worry about damaging your speakers with too much power. You just need to know the wattage of your amplifier so you can adjust the impedance accordingly."]},"id":"3eab9676-7240-4a31-a750-c78d8b659614","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c4a9dfce-e140-4db3-8da9-3c0d507a4877","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MartinLogan SLM series speakers are a modern work of art.
