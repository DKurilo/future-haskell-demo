Weight, you re not finished!</strong>","You ve created the perfect marketing postcard (brochure, flyer, or whatever). Your copy text is compelling, your graphics are amazing (you know, the type that say a thousand words), and everything comes together. Your project may seem complete, but it s not <em><strong>finished</strong></em>.","It s a common mistake to <strong> gloss </strong>-over the finishing touches and just print on the cheapest paper, but how your document looks and feels is a <strong> matte </strong>r of huge importance. The finishing touches on your project will speak measures about the overall quality and importance of your document, and may very well be the difference between your efforts ending up as customer sale or in the trash can.","Let s briefly overview the various paper stocks, weights, and finishes offered by online printing services:","<strong>Paper Stocks</strong>","<strong>Paper stocks</strong> are measured by point size and weight. Common paper comes in 10 or 12 pt, and cardstock often comes in 14 or 15 pt. The point size is how thick the paper is (in thousandths of an inch).","<strong>Paper weight</strong> (not to be confused with a paperweight), is measured as how many pounds a ream (500 sheets) weighs (in the paper s native size). So if paper has a 100# weight that means that 500 sheets of that paper would weigh 100 lbs.","Each printed product has a couple of typical paper stocks and weights. The general consensus is that thicker is better. A nice heft signifies importance and quality. Of course you re not going to print your resume on cardstock, but you get the idea.","<strong>Finish/Coating</strong>","<strong>Gloss</strong>","The lustrous finish adds a bit of weight and shine and smooth finish.","<strong>Matte</strong>","Matte finish provides a flat satin finish that provides vivid color and is fingerprint resistant. Matte finish is a dull, glare-free finish.","<strong>UV</strong>","UV coating is high gloss, providing a reflective gloss. The coating is actually applied in a thin layer and cured by ultra-violet radiation. Some printers provide UV spot coating, which applies the UV finish to certain parts of your print, adding a dimensional and eye-catching impact to certain elements of your design.","<strong>Aqueous Coating</strong>","Aqueous coating is a semi-gloss (not as glossy as UV coating). It adds a bit of shine and durability, and is still able to be printed on with inkjet printing. Aqueous coating water-based and dries fast, providing added durability and fingerprint resistance.","So before you settle for the cheapest printing solution, consider the finishing touches. They say a lot about the overall quality of the document. Adding a product-appropriate finish to a high-quality paper can create an additional element of professionalism, the feel of quality, and a sense of overall value. The easiest way to take your design and prints from amateur to professional is to look the part. Don t just end; finish.","Taking your prints to the next level is easy with a great online printing service.
