With a twist of the steam wand, it can become a cappuccino or latte maker, too. You get cafe-quality espresso with this <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a>, since it uses bar-pump pressure to brew the ground coffee beans instead of steam pressure. It lacks some conveniences, but it&#39;s a great device on the whole.","As with the best home espresso machines, the crema on top of the espresso from this machine comes out thick, creamy and full of flavor. Since it is a bar pump, the machine is noisy while you use it, but it takes under five minutes to heat up and brew a delicious cup of espresso.","The unit comes with separate measuring and tamping tools. This means you can prepare the coffee grounds for the espresso to get your preferred taste. The tamping tool is fixed to the espresso machine, which doesn&#39;t allow you the same flexibility as a hand tamper, but it saves you the trouble of looking for the tool every time you want espresso. If you prefer to forgo the tamping, you can brew using premade espresso pods instead.","The DeLonghi BAR32 features a removable water reservoir that is easy to fill before each use. However, you must hand-wash the reservoir and the drip tray on this espresso machine, since these parts are not dishwasher safe. Unlike some of the best espresso machines, this device does not include a frothing pitcher for whipping the milk into creamy topping for your brew. On the plus side, it weighs in at just over 6 pounds, making it one of the lightest espresso machines we reviewed.","DeLonghi has several support options available for its BAR32, including a standard one-year warranty. Even though DeLonghi is an Italian-based company, it has service centers and support personnel available throughout the United States. You can contact DeLonghi with questions or concerns through email or telephone 24/7. You can also browse troubleshooting questions and recipes on the DeLonghi Facebook page."]},"id":"40e61c9d-3c27-40fd-b80e-9372c4350118","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bc93a382-0db0-4272-b16c-d8f5188a3bdf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can easily turn any espresso into cappuccinos, lattes and more with the DeLonghi BAR32&#39;s adjustable steam wand.
