Clicking the Buy button will take you to this version for purchase. We will evaluate, rank and review the newest Panasonic rice cooker when we next update the rice cooker reviews. Meanwhile, enjoy our review below about the SR-DE103.</em>","The Panasonic SR-DE103 is a 5-cup <a href=\"/best-rice-cookers\">rice cooker</a> that offers advanced cooking options. This small rice cooker offers fuzzy logic capabilities, and the egg-shaped cooker is only 8 inches tall. It does not have the smooth and sleek design of stainless steel models, but it holds its own in making fluffy, consistent rice. If you’d like a rice cooker that is more aesthetically appealing because it will sit out on your countertop, you might consider the <a href=\"/aroma-12-cup-review\">Aroma 12-Cup Sensor Logic</a> rice cooker.","The first difference you’ll notice between the Panasonic SR-DE103 and other fuzzy logic rice cookers is its no-frills design. Similar products are hard to tell apart, often boasting the same black lid and stainless steel body. The egg-shaped Panasonic SR-DE103 is made of white plastic and has a picnic-style handle. Plus, the locking lid lacks the usual exterior button. The interior pot can hold five cups of uncooked rice and yield 10 cups fully cooked. The menu options aren’t as easy to comprehend as other brands, and the instructions can feel a bit daunting.","While it&#39;s not as aesthetically sleek as other models, the functionality compares with the best rice cookers on the market. The fuzzy logic micro-computer adjusts to all conditions, making perfect, fluffy rice that is consistent throughout the pot. The menu includes separate options for white, brown and sticky rice, and there are additional options for steaming, slow cooking and cakes. The delayed timer gives you the capability of setting the machine up to 24-hours in advance. This is one of the longest delays on the market. The power cord is detachable, and the unit itself is light, making it very portable.","Like most rice cookers, the Panasonic SR-DE103 includes a steam tray, a rice measuring cup and a serving spatula. The domed lid design and detachable moisture cap help prevent the cooker from boiling over. While the top lid doesn’t detach, the inner pot comes with an inner lid which can be removed and is easy to clean. Be aware that the warming feature tends to cook the rice more than other models, and will begin toasting the bottom rice if you don&#39;t remove it after about 15 minutes.","What the Panasonic SR-DE103 lacks in form, it makes up in function. The model is as proficient as other fuzzy logic rice makers, and its unique design makes it more portable and less clunky on your countertop. Plus, its price tag provides a multitude of features at an affordable expense."]},"id":"c366abcd-cb8b-4d16-8fb0-676d0d67e16c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60300","url":"/panasonic-sr-de-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-22T20:31:51Z","datePublished":"2014-08-22T20:31:51Z","name":"Panasonic SR-DE103","synopsis":"Editor's Note: While the SR-DE103 has been discontinued by the manufacturer, the comparable SR-ZG105 is available.
