They allow you to record your experiences, whether they are from sports, your daily life, parties or anywhere else. Wearable cameras usually clip on to an article of clothing such as a shirt, belt, harness, hat or helmet. Body cameras like the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/gopro-hero4-silver-action-camera,review-3043.html\">GoPro HERO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/garmin-virb-ultra-30,review-4033.html\">Garmin VIRB Elite</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-action-cameras,review-3046.html\">Narrative Clip</a> work in a variety of situations, including recording video for personal video logs, recording YouTube videos and filming first-person views of extreme sports.","Wearable cameras range from small, low-resolution options for use as life cameras to full HD sports camera for professional video. Knowing what to look for allows you to choose the right one for your needs.","<strong>Wearable Cameras: What to Look For</strong>","Wearable cameras come with a number of different features and functions that suit different types of users. With HD video, mounts for attaching onto helmets and bikes, and clips for attaching to a shirt or jeans, there are wearable cameras to fill very different needs. Examining what you want from a camera as well as the important features available can help you find a camera that fits your lifestyle.","<strong>Video Quality</strong><br/>Video recording is an important consideration, even if you just want a life camera. Some wearable cameras don&#39;t have the ability to capture video; instead they take still photos wherever you are. Others include full HD recording at 1080p, which is suitable for creating high-resolution video for a YouTube channel or for other video productions.","<strong>Camera Size</strong><br/>While all wearable cameras are small, they do vary greatly in size and weight. Generally speaking, the higher the photo and video quality, the larger and heavier the camera is. For example, some clip easily onto your collar or a belt loop, while others are meant for attaching onto a halter or a helmet.","<strong>Photo Quality</strong><br/>Not every wearable camera takes still photos, and some only take photos. Picture quality varies from 5MP to upwards of 15MP, so depending on the camera you choose, you can print photos of the images you capture. Some options also offer quality still photos from video screenshots, which is a good option if you don&#39;t have time to stop and snap a photo during your activity.","<strong>Connectivity &amp; Streaming</strong><br/>Connectivity options include Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Bluetooth allows you to connect the camera to your phone for viewing photos, streaming and using the phone as a remote control. Some wearable cameras instantly sync with Facebook, YouTube or Google Hangouts for live streaming. Depending on your preference, you may or may not want these features.","<strong>Storage Capacity</strong><br/>Most of the time, wearable cameras use SD or microSD cards for storage. Depending on the model, they support anywhere from 4GB to 120GB, allowing you to gather different amounts of data. This is a convenient option because you can switch cards for additional storage. Some include a small amount of internal storage so that you can use the camera without a card.","Knowing which features are available in a wearable body cameras can help you to choose an option that fits your lifestyle and your recording needs. When properly chosen, having a wearable camera means never missing an important moment again."]},"id":"96de8b31-2f3a-4a90-aa08-2f28d5db2a5e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"fdd0c1fd-8782-4db3-bbda-2d3b9e5411b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D740J5W/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64235[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Contour+2</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EOHUVTU/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64237[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Garmin VIRB</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NIYNUXO/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64230[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">GoPro Hero</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G4Q9EBU/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64233[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ISAW</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY6SSYW/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64236[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">JVC ADIXXION</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NP61ACS/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64231[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">MeCam HD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K962E0O/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64228[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Narrative Clip</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LJDNDGA/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64229[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Pivothead Kudu</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NW3AMY6/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64232[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">RE Camera</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HNJWSH4/?&tag=ttr_wearable-cameras-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1607[art|NA[pid|64234[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony POV</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"9819864e-ed85-4962-856b-4fe0ebba1c0f","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1607","url":"/best-wearable-cameras","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-27T16:24:38Z","datePublished":"2015-05-21T03:50:56Z","name":"Wearable Cameras Review","synopsis":"Record your daily life with wearable cameras.
