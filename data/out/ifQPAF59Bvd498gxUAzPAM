It’s not available as a stand-alone program, but in case budget is an issue, the WPS suite is available free, so long as you don’t mind pop-up ads every time you open an application or select certain functions. For an ad-free experience, you’ll need to choose the yearly subscription or lifetime purchase options, both of which are competitively priced.","While the free option is a popular choice for a basic <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-microsoft-office-alternatives\">spreadsheet program</a>, it has a few more limitations than the purchased options. It doesn&#39;t include email support or the ability to convert, split and merge PDFs. This is a desktop-based application and doesn’t offer any real remote or cloud-based services, although some editions do come with a small amount of private cloud storage. With this option, provided you have WPS installed on other computers or mobile devices, you can access and in some cases edit your files. WPS Spreadsheet doesn’t support other cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox.","Collaboration features aren&#39;t truly present. WPS states that its tracked changes and in-line comments function as collaborative tools, but this is a bit of a stretch. Multiple users cannot work in the same file at the same time and have all the changes made to a single document, so a team cannot simultaneously edit a file in real time. Users cannot communicate in real time either. So it’s not really collaborative software, although the co-working tools are functional enough for an editor to look over the spreadsheet, leave comments and feedback, and track a writer’s changes.","WPS Spreadsheet is compatible with the majority of common file formats, including XLS and XLSX, and the vast majority of formulas, functions and layouts convert and render perfectly. You can easily integrate charts and graphs, choosing from common and traditional chart types. Although the most contemporary chart types are missing, including a 3D chart, this isn’t a deal-breaker. While the options are fairly traditional, they are functional and easily understandable. This spreadsheet software supports pivot tables to help you visualize and simplify large quantities of data, and it offers a number of worksheet templates for common tasks.","If you’re not on a premium plan, support is restricted to self-help tutorials and FAQs in the knowledgebase, or you can head over to the community forums. If you have a premium edition of the software, you can email for assistance."]},"id":"0e64c64a-99f2-403e-b48e-0e22a72de190","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68701","url":"/wps-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-03T16:48:12Z","datePublished":"2016-11-03T16:48:12Z","name":"WPS Spreadsheet","synopsis":"WPS Spreadsheet is one of three programs you get with the WPS office suite.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"WPS Spreadsheet is one of three programs you get with the WPS office suite.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-03T16:48:12Z","id":"ifQPAF59Bvd498gxUAzPAM","meta":{"title":"WPS Spreadsheet Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"WPS Spreadsheet is free, user-friendly and widely compatible spreadsheet software.
