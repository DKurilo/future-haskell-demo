This makes it so you can easily sketch tall buildings, landscapes or character poses accurately and dynamically.

And since it focuses on being a basic drawing program, there are no premade characters, backgrounds or props for you to use.

A cheat sheet even explains what symbols to use to specify dialogue, prologue and sound effects.
