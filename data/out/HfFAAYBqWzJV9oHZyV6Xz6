Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Presto Dual Basket ProFry is a wide-mouthed deep fat fryer with plenty of capacity. Unfortunately, the chicken strips and fries we tested in this fryer came out below average in terms of texture and taste. The submerged 1,800-watt heating element managed to heat 2.8 liters of oil to optimal temperature in just 10 minutes, faster than all but one other <a href=\"/best-deep-fryers\">deep fryer</a>. It also recovered its temperature quickly; after our first batch, we were able to fry our next one in under two minutes. We were also able to fry the largest batches – 6.3 pounds of chicken strips and fries – in the ProFry versus the other deep fryers we tested.","Even if you don&#39;t do a lot of frying but maybe there are one or two foods your family has a hankering for, this electric deep fryer is easy to use. You just fill the fryer to the fill line with oil and turn the dial to the desired temperature. A signal light notifies you when it’s ready for frying. The ProFry comes with dual baskets, which make it easy to work in small batches or cook two different foods at the same time.","There are some handy features missing from the ProFry. A built-in timer would have eliminated the need for us to set our own watches, and a viewing window would have helped us track the progress of  progress of our food without having to watch the clock and lift the lid to peek. There also isn’t an easy method for draining, storing, or filtering oil. Once the oil is completely cooled, you can lift the non-stick removable container from the fryer and pour the oil out from one of container&#39;s corners.","The Dual Basket ProFry has the same safety measures found in the best deep fryers: a removable lid to prevent splatter, a breakaway magnetic cord and skid-resistant feet. However, the biggest concern is that the exterior isn’t insulated. If you accidentally touch the outside of the fryer, you could easily get burned. We measured the exterior temperature of the fryer while it was fully heated, and according to our readings, the exterior registered 248 degrees Fahrenheit. You may want to keep young kids out of the kitchen while you’re using the ProFry deep fryer. Even though there are plastic handles on either side of this fryer, we don&#39;t recommend moving it once you&#39;ve plugged it in and turned the temperature dial. The <a href=\"/delonghi-review\">DeLonghi D677UX</a> has the best safety features of any fryer we tested. Its exterior temperatures stayed at around 100 degrees.","Presto warranties the Dual Basket ProFry for one year, which is typical for compact countertop fryers. If, though, any problems with the deep fryer develop during that first year, you can return or exchange it. You can also find replacement parts and accessories on Presto’s website as well as the warranty and product manual. Also on the website are cooking videos and care instructions. We were able to easily quickly contact Presto’s customer service by phone and email."]},"id":"67ff9543-90ee-4744-87d3-8c23cbd1c142","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"05f46f4e-b271-4582-847e-40335516e09a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the food we tested with the Dual Basket ProFry wasn’t among the best we tasted, the heating speed, capacity, and versatility were excellent.
