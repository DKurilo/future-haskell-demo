You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Digital Studio from Broderbund contains four programs, MovieShop, Photo WorkShop, CD Label Creator and NTI CD-Maker. Using MovieShop the first time is a bit difficult and you may have to use the help menu to figure out what to do. The first step is to configure capture setting but the program did not automatically detect our video camera the first time. After capturing is set up, you have to choose a format and the only option is QuickTime.","Using the Storyboard is easy and it divides the clips and shows the order. However, the timeline will not let you add text or audio clips. Editing from the timeline is difficult and the program does not support right click edits.","The four programs work independently of each other and you have to use one and import to another to complete many edits. This collection would have placed higher in the review if it were easier to use and if the separate sections worked together better."]},"id":"7b3c3a34-e044-4b41-9bae-6413c730d115","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1166","url":"/digital-studio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
