Because sleep affects mood, memory and health, sleep trackers can help you to become healthier by ensuring that you get enough rest. Many also come with other functions, such as step or activity tracking, blood pressure tracking, and keeping a sleep diary for you to compare your sleep habits. Some models, like the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/jawbone-up24,review-1997.html\">Jawbone UP24</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/polar-loop,review-1998.html\">Polar Loop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/garmin-vivofit,review-2061.html\">Vivofit</a>, offer sleep tracking, activity tracking and options like alarms and activity coaching.","<strong>Sleep Trackers: What to Look For</strong>","Sleep trackers offer a variety of functions, including sleep tracking, movement alerts, alarms, REM sleep tracking and fitness tracking. Finding a model that suits your needs means choosing the right features, setting a budget and picking a model that fits easily into your lifestyle. While many sleep trackers include fitness and activity functions, you can also choose models with limited or no activity monitors. Deciding what you need in advance allows you to settle on the best model for your lifestyle.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>Choosing the right features is the easiest way to find the best sleep tracker for your needs. With options including simple sleep tracking and buzz alerts on a plain wristband to full LCD and LED screens with apps and notifications, choosing the features you want allows you to select a model that offers everything you need in a sleep-tracking device.","<strong>Primary Technology</strong><br/>Sleep trackers use a lot of different technology. Some use motion sensing to detect when you move, which allows the tracker to make estimates on when you are sleeping. Others are sensitive to pressure, your breathing and your heart rate and may use heat sensors. Some have a primary function of tracking your sleep and others offer it as a secondary function.","<strong>Versatility</strong><br/>Some sleep trackers only track sleep, while others offer a full range of fitness tracking and coaching functions. You can choose between models that you wear around the wrist, models that clip on and models that slide under the sheets on the bed. If you want a sleep tracker that works for other things, that you can easily take with you or that you don&#39;t have to worry about forgetting, you have to consider the type of sleep tracker you are buying. Basic wristbands are usually the most versatile because you can wear them 24/7, except when showering. Options that you put on your bed are the easiest to use because you cannot forget them, but they are also more difficult to take with you.","Sleep trackers help you assess the quality of your sleep and many have activity and fitness options. Using the data from these devices, you can work to improve your health, general wellbeing and sleep quality. Because of the importance of your health, it&#39;s essential you know what type best meets your lifestyle needs."]},"id":"7a265611-3c07-4716-b671-9f222da6e519","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"bedfdab7-0bc7-4301-b072-243f5b17b226","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095PZHYU/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66327[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Fitbit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D8JIPJI/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66330[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">iHealth</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GQB1JJ8/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66325[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Jawbone</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KO6X8L8/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66334[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">LifeTrak</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FDWN8RM/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66331[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Misfit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FEQ6TVO/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66328[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Polar</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TYU9LL6/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66333[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">RBX</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NP52QE0/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66326[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ResMed</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFPOX9C/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66332[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Vivofit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LC2VWJI/?&tag=ttr_sleep-trackers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1602[art|NA[pid|66329[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Withings</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"044e5fed-cc84-4398-ad9f-7f13df722541","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1602","url":"/best-sleep-trackers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-26T17:49:42Z","datePublished":"2015-08-21T18:02:40Z","name":"Sleep Trackers Review","synopsis":"Sleep trackers record and analyze your sleeping patterns and habits to help you improve your lifestyle.
