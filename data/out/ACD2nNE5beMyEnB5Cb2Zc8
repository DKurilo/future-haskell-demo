It also provides data on your speed, distance, time and altitude. It even offers a barometric altimeter for more accurate altitude readings. Through our research we found that cyclists who used the DeLorme Earthmate PN-60 as their bike GPS were very impressed not only with the quality of the maps but with the number of maps they received as well.
