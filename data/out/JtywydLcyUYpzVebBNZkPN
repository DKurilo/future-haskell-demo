href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">Budget 3D printers</a> are generally small in stature, offer only one filament option and require tethered printing. However, the Robo 3D R1 +Plus is an exception, as it offers a large print capacity, ABS and PLA printing, and can print via a microSD card or a tethered connection. It is a great budget 3D printer option and our choice for the one of the best budget 3D printers for its easy-to-use design, great software and cost effective filament options.","The Robo 3D R1 +Plus is especially easy to calibrate. A multipoint auto leveling feature ensures you get excellent prints with very little effort. You can also adjust other settings and calibrations yourself from the software. When you have your printer calibrated perfectly, you&#39;re more likely to print precise and accurate models.","Each model we printed was highly accurate, and it was nice to have the option to choose a print resolution between 0.1 and 0.3 millimeters from the software. Our models did require a little bit of cleanup, which is common for even more expensive 3D printers. Wispy filament strands are easy to clip and remove from your finished parts. The print bed is also larger than most budget 3D printers’ at 8 x 9 x 10 inches.","The Robo 3D R1 +Plus is a uniquely designed printer with a large print bed and easy-to-use infrastructure. Each version of this well-built, cheap 3D printer is better than the last, with each improving the faults of the one before. There is very little installation needed, and set up mostly revolves around inserting the filament into the print head.","This inexpensive 3D printer is shaped like a covered bridge, with the bed moving back and forth and the covering protecting wires, connections and the print head. While the print bed is large and accommodates large models, you need about an extra foot of space both in front of and behind the printer to allow for print bed movement past the chassis itself. This can be a problem you need to account for when choosing a space for the printer. This 26-pound plastic machine is easy to move around your home or office and has a nice backlight glow to it when turned on. Although there is no onboard navigation screen, it&#39;s easy to control the printer from the included software.","We found that while the printer design has many advantages, some disadvantages kept getting in the way. Namely, the cords that lead away from the print head are wrapped, but not safely secured. We had to hold them out of the way of the print head and the heated platform, as they kept getting stuck underneath. However, a loose zip tie can easily solve this problem.","This machine is open source, which means it&#39;s great for expert modifications but not so helpful for beginners. While we did have some issues with the temperature sensor on our machine, this inexpensive 3D printer is easy enough to fix on your own with a few alterations.","ABS and PLA are both compatible with the Robo 3D R1 +Plus. The heated glass print bed helps prevent warping, and we found that either a bit of printer&#39;s tape or glue stick on the platform allowed for the best adhesion.","A filament cartridge holder perches on the back of the machine and accommodates both proprietary and universal filament cartridges. The Robo 3D R1 +Plus is one of the most affordable 3D printers because of its low-price filament options. If you purchase your filament from the manufacturer, there are about a dozen colors to choose from for a very reasonable price.","The software included with this low-cost 3D printer is actually great. MatterControl allows you to resize and optimize your 3D models, save files to the microSD card, start and stop prints, and calibrate your printer. When you save files to the microSD card you can print wirelessly. Robo also provides one free year of AutoDesk, should you want a more powerful software.","To start a print, you save files to the card, plug the card in the printer, select the file on the card from the software, start your print, and unplug the USB between your computer and the printer. While the tetherless process is longer than most and the microSD card is hard to insert, it&#39;s still more convenient than leaving your computer on and tethered to your printer for the duration of your 3D print. Maintenance tools and a USB cord are provided with your initial purchase, as well as 300 grams of filament, which is enough for a few small prints.","The R1 +Plus comes with a six-month warranty to protect it from defects. Most budget 3D printers offer at least 12 months, but six months should be enough to make sure you have no problems. Robo 3D also provides a manual and tutorials to show you how to get going with your new inexpensive 3D printer. However, the printer is so easy to assemble and use that you probably won&#39;t need much else. Email and phone support information is provided on Robo 3D’s website as well, should you have any tech support questions."]},"id":"e439c044-661f-4a55-9163-a3c140a23642","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ac05b55e-b91d-4636-8355-1979d052aadd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although the Robo 3D R1 +Plus doesn&#39;t offer Wi-Fi printing or an onboard screen, it&#39;s still one of the best budget 3D printers.
