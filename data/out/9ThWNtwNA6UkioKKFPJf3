VideoSecu ML531BE is the best full motion TV wall mount. Not only is it extremely popular and affordable, but it’s rated to support TVs up to 55 inches and weighing up to 88 pounds, which is plenty sturdy. It extends up to 20 inches and only has a 2.2-inch profile. You can tilt it forward and backward and swivel your TV left or right up to 180 degrees.","The best full motion <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">TV wall mounts</a> need to be capable of holding your TV while providing excellent mobility – a long extension, low profile, deep tilting and full panning. The VideoSecu ML531BE achieves all of this and costs less than $30. This is why it’s the most popular and highly rated TV wall mount on Amazon.","This VideoSecu mount can support up to 88 pounds, which is on the low end of TV mounts. In addition, it only fits TVs up to 55 inches. Many TV wall mounts including the <a href=\"/ut-pro310-large-tilt-wall-mount-review\">ProMounts UF-PRO310</a> are rated to support twice as much weight. However, most TVs don’t weigh 88 pounds, so it’s unlikely that your TV weighs too much. If you have a larger TV, VideoSecu has additional TV mounts that hold more weight.","This TV wall mount has universal VESA complaint brackets up to 400 x 400, which means it fits almost all TV brands up to 55 inches. Still, it’s important to double-check your TV&#39;s VESA requirements before purchasing a TV wall mount.","You can extend your TV from the wall by 20 inches, which is farther than most full motion TV wall mounts excecpt for the <a href=\"/omnimount-review\">OmniMount PLAY40</a>. Perhaps even more impressive is the 2.2-inch mounting profile, which makes it one of the slimmest full motion mounts as well. At full extension, you can pan your TV 180 degrees left or right. Of course, this is minimized with larger TVs. You can also tilt your TV by 15 degrees, which is ideal for finding the perfect viewing angle and for minimizing glare from lights or the sun.","This is one of the few TV wall mounts in our review that doesn’t require two studs for the installation. Rather, the mount only requires one stud, which also makes it ideal for corner installations where studs are often at irregular distances. It also has a cord management system to keep your cords organized.","If you’re looking for a full motion TV wall mount, the VideoSecu ML531BE is an excellent option. Made of heavy-gauge steel and capable of supporting TVs up to 55 inches, it provides better mobility than most full motion TV wall mounts at a better price."]},"id":"e47ded74-4590-4cfb-9f28-753a044a7e56","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69087","url":"/videosecu-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-02-24T15:46:27Z","datePublished":"2017-02-24T15:46:27Z","name":"VideoSecu ML531BE Full Motion","synopsis":"The VideoSecu ML531BE is the best full motion TV wall mount.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The VideoSecu ML531BE is the best full motion TV wall mount.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-02-24T15:46:27Z","id":"9ThWNtwNA6UkioKKFPJf3","meta":{"title":"VideoSecu ML531BE Full Motion Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The VideoSecu ML531BE is a full motion TV wall mount that supports TVs up to 55 inches.
