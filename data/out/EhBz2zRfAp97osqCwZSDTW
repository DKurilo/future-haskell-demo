This one may have a low price point, but it still contains all of the perks associated with a Sealy mattress. The mattress itself is on the soft side due to its plush top, which consists not only of a luxurious knit cover, but also an added amount of foam for increased levels of luxury. While this model isn’t available as a king size pillow top mattress, the queen size still proves quite popular due simply to the emphasis on softness.","Warranties are a critical part of any mattress purchase, and this bed doesn’t disappoint. With a 10-year warranty, it protects against manufacturing defects in addition to any dipping that may occur gradually from use. You can thus expect more out of this mattress and make it into the long-term investment any bed should be.","The pillow top bed contains 660 individually wrapped coils contained within a SitRight edge system to keep the sides of the bed supportive. Above the coil layer are multiple layers of foam to create the incredibly soft pillow top. In addition to 2 inches of Sealy’s SuperSoft SealyFoam, the topper also includes an inch of memory foam. The combination of both foam types creates a mattress that conforms to your body’s contours and supports at points of pressure that might ordinarily cause discomfort during the night.","The Birchmere Plush Euro Queen receives glowing mattress reviews due to its low price and high quality. Sold solely through Costco, this mattress achieves its main objective of helping you become and stay comfortable throughout the night. Where pillow top mattresses are concerned, this bed combines the right layers of comfort with an ideal makeup of coil support to get you the best night’s sleep possible."]},"id":"f2ff851f-902a-406a-ba66-3119c668ce62","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57312","url":"/birchmere-plush-euro-queen-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-27T01:20:01Z","datePublished":"2013-08-27T01:20:01Z","name":"Birchmere Plush Euro Queen","synopsis":"The Birchmere Plush Euro Queen takes its inspiration from its firmer counterpart, the Birchmere Ultra Firm, but employs a pillow top mattress to soften its approach to comfort.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Birchmere Plush Euro Queen takes its inspiration from its firmer counterpart, the Birchmere Ultra Firm, but employs a pillow top mattress to soften its approach to comfort.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-08-27T01:20:01Z","id":"EhBz2zRfAp97osqCwZSDTW","meta":{"title":"Birchmere Plush Euro Queen Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Birchmere Plush Euro Queen achieves high levels of comfort and quality without driving up price.
