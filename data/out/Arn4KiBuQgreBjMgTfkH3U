Oco offers low-cost cloud storage and works with independent online service IFTTT to allow smart home integration. However, while it produces decent daytime video monitoring, and great motion recording, but its nighttime video has the lowest quality of any <a href=\"/best-security-cameras\">security camera</a> we tested.","When you monitor during the day or in a well-lit room, this home security camera produces mostly clear video. Motion recorded smoothly in our tests, without any of the glitches we saw with some cameras. In fact, the Oco rivals the best security camera in this area. But the nighttime video is where this camera comes up short. While you can still see basic details, the image quality isn&#39;t as sharp as that of our top nighttime performer, the <a href=\"/belkin-review\">Belkin NetCam HD+</a>.","Oco&#39;s collaboration with the online management system IFTTT allows you to connect to a variety of smart home products. This is one of Oco&#39;s biggest strengths, as it allows it to work in sync with other security products to enhance what this wireless security camera offers. For instance, the Oco starts to record if it detects movement, and the smart light activates, creating proper light to record what is happening. It could also deter someone from breaking into your home. Another positive feature is the easy setup. We were able to get the Oco up and running more efficiently than we could just about any other camera we tested. Also, the app is one of the best we used. It&#39;s simple, straightforward and easy to navigate.","You can also use the cloud to view recorded events from the past 24 hours free of charge and view the live video stream from the app at any time. You can upgrade for better cloud service. The least expensive paid service for this camera lets you keep motion- and sound-triggered video in the cloud for 24 hours. This wireless camera comes with a standard one-year warranty. If you have questions or concerns after buying this Wi-Fi security camera, you can reach customer service through email, phone or live chat on the Oco website."]},"id":"0850ed2c-8303-41ef-8473-eb2d34a5939f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e3cd7d9-b95e-4275-be67-6873b70d8cef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Oco has several useful features that make up for some of its weaknesses, like smart home integration, simple setup and a straightforward, easy-to-use app. Oco also gives you limited cloud storage free of charge.
