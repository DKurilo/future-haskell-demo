You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Free-Light Disc Solar Pathway Lights have a sleek, contemporary design and concentrate their light output in a downward direction to light your way along a dark path or walkway. Two <a href=\"/best-solar-lights\">solar path lights</a> come with this package; however, if you choose to buy additional lights, the pricing for each one goes down.","These outdoor solar lights mount by using spikes in the ground. This feature makes them a versatile choice since you can place them wherever you want, whether it is in a garden bed alongside a sidewalk or in the grass along the edge of your lawn to light a patio area. The height of these lights is also adjustable because of the use of the spikes. The maximum height you can place the solar landscaping lights is 20.5 inches. Along with the two lights in this package, it comes with the stakes, connectors and necessary mounting posts.","Unlike many solar lights, the brightness of these lights does not diminish with time. The downward facing design not only projects a directed light but also provides additional protection for the interior works with its weather-resistant top. Glass covers the solar panel to keep it safe while special circuitry provides additional protection for the batteries. This built-in protection for the battery and solar panel lets the lights work for as long as 20 years without needing replacement. The included 1.2-volt batteries are long lasting, as well, and should work for about two years. Replacing the batteries, when needed, only takes a few minutes.","A thermoplastic polymer composes the body of the lights and is strong enough to provide impact resistance. The outer lenses are clear acrylic. Power for this solar lighting comes from six LEDs in a natural white light that, while bright, is not glaring. These lights gather solar energy during the day, turn on when it gets dark and provide six hours of light. While some individuals may prefer solar lights that stay on all night, the long lifespan and bright, focused lighting of these solar landscaping lights may make them worth considering.","Disc Solar Pathway Lights provide a bright, directed light to use for walkways, garden areas, along tree lines or anywhere else you want to place solar lights. Because of the added protection for the solar panel and batteries, they can last for many years."]},"id":"ae0e06b0-9c37-44ae-b280-36db779fb059","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67021","url":"/free-light-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-18T18:50:48Z","datePublished":"2015-09-18T18:50:48Z","name":"Free-Light Disc","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-18T18:50:48Z","id":"Weop5J87gQwKTokkbZuKbc","meta":{"title":"Free-Light Disc Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Disc Solar Pathway Lights by Free-Light provide your garden paths and walkways with bright light and can last for many years.
