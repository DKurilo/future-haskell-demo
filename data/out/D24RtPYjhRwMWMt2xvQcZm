You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Cinemin Swivel<strong> </strong>from WowWee has a unique design. Though it may not work for a business projector, it definitely has a few things going for it. This <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">mini projector</a> gives more viewing angles and options than any other product we looked at, and it is easy to position as well.","This mini projector has the most unique design of all of the ones we looked at. The pico projector, measuring only 4.7 x 2.1 x 0.9 inches, has a hinge near the middle of the device which provides an easy way to change the angle of the image on the wall or even project it on the ceiling. This device is only meant to be used up to 8.5 feet away and the maximum image size is 60 inches. The picture quality of this unit is just okay. The resolution is 480 x 320 and the brightness only 8 ANSI lumens. We were pleased to see that the contrast ratio was 1000:1, which isn&#39;t bad. The aspect ratio is an unusual 3:2.","The ports on this mini projector include a USB, composite AV and a headphone jack. The USB port is only used for charging (via a computer), and it can&#39;t be used to connect devices or transfer data. The composite AV port can be used for connecting to a media player, but it is more geared for connecting to an iPod or iPhone. While it is possible to connect devices like a laptop or netbook, the low resolution makes these devices somewhat cumbersome to use.","The lamp life of this mini projector is about 20,000 hours. The built-in speaker is 0.5W, but it is only monophonic. You can add speakers through the headphone jack, though. The battery life is a little over two hours, which means you can make it through a couple of presentations before you have to recharge it. This mini projector is intended for more recreational than a professional use, but it will definitely be useful if you keep your presentations on your iPod or iPhone.","This mini projector is meant to be a plug-and-play product, which reduces the hassle of trying to work it. The hinge in the middle of the unit was the most useful aspect of the micro projector. You also have the option of using the pocket projector to project an image from behind a screen. Additionally, the manual focus is a valuable feature. This mini projector is easy to use because of the design. We were pleased with how much control we had over a few of the settings, but we had little control over automatic image settings such as brightness and color."]},"id":"41189a1f-e0c0-42b8-a0d2-703bf30d3747","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"55170e2d-867f-43bc-bc2d-cf43d2ef7378","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cinemin Swivel from WowWee has a unique in design, but it&#39;s somewhat limited in function.
