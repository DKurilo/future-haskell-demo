While Erie may not offer nationwide coverage, they do an excellent job of providing comprehensive <a href=\"/best-homeowners-insurance\">homeowners insurance</a> for traditional homes, condominiums, renters and mobile homes.","Erie Insurance began in 1925 as an auto insurer and has since grown to be a multi-line insurance provider. This company is a profitable Fortune 500 company and has over 9,000 agents that provide help and support to their customers. In addition to house insurance, Erie insurance offers auto, life and business policies.","The level of help and support provided by the Erie Insurance site is great. They have responsive claim service and a website locator to help you find an agent for such things like getting a home insurance quote. They also offer telephone, email and mail support as well as a comprehensive commonly asked questions page. They don’t supply an online chat option, but you can submit a callback request to have an agent call you at your convenience. This can be very helpful if you don’t want to be on hold or have the time immediately to speak with them. It allows for more flexibility and convenience for you.","You cannot add endorsements online at this time, but you can call your agent at your convenience to arrange the additional insurance. Erie Insurance has a dedicated app that allows you to find an agent, print temporary insurance cards and pay your insurance bill. You can also access your account online or file a claim at any time from the company website.","Some of the available discounts from Erie Insurance include multiple policy discounts, having fire and burglar alarms or an automatic sprinkler system. While Erie does not have as many discounts listed as the major insurance companies, your agent may be able to find more discounts depending on your home and situation.","Even if you have good home insurance to cover your home, there are certain hazards that are not included in the base policy, such as floods and earthquakes. Erie Insurance has many other endorsements you can add for an additional cost to help protect your home even more. Some of these policies cover windstorms, mold, floods and earthquakes. An Erie Insurance agent can help you decide what policies would benefit you and your home the most, depending on your location and the common hazards of your region."]},"id":"a33fd26d-3208-4430-8796-c45ba94f5ba2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a74c542-9bdb-454f-9672-13f7991b115e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although Erie Insurance didn’t top our list of online homeowners insurance sites, they are financially solid and offer an extensive list of insurance options that are competitively priced.
