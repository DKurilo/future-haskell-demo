The Dynam A-10 Thunderbolt II is an electric ducted fan (EDF) jet, and requires an intermediate skill level pilot. Beginners should not use this style of <a href=\"/best-remote-control-airplanes\">remote control airplane</a>, and even intermediate level pilots should practice on a simulator before actually flying one. This RC plane makes a good first EDF plane because the Dynam A-10 is a slower moving jet, and this RC jet mimics that behavior. You can increase the speed, but you will need a bigger battery than the one included, and you will need to upgrade other elements of the plane to handle the extra power.","The plane comes  with all the accessories required to get the plane in the air right out of the box. Most of the plane is pre-assembled, but you’ll need to put together a few pieces like the wings and the vertical stabilizers. The retractable landing gears are preinstalled and you can control them from the transmitter. You can pull up the landing gears for a more realistic flight and then lower them again for landing. The package contains the transmitter, the battery and the charger, which is typical of ready-to-fly (RTF) RC plane kits. The battery takes an hour or two to charge and will yield a flight time of about five minutes.","The two 64mm ducted fan motors are brushless and pre-installed in the engine mounts. All of the major parts, such as the wing and the fuselage, are made of expanded polyolefin (EPO) foam, which is durable and holds the painted design well. The decals are also included and pre-cut to make it easier to apply. The included 2.4GHz transmitter is a four-channel transmitter and has a few nice features, such as the protection switch and the ability to adjust the servo control."]},"id":"9f7036e2-769c-4454-bb6d-bb01c12ed80e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8bb50bf2-c2be-42ba-b7d0-c46d2d2c4c9a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dynam A-10 Thunderbolt II is ideal for intermediate and advanced pilots.
