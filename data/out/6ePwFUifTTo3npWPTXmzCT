What we love the most is, although these three applications serve different purposes, their workspace and creative layout is basically the same. You have your toolbar menu to the left, your palettes to the right and the rest of the feature tabs on top. Simple. Streamlined.","InDesign has done a stellar job of making page layout a simple process (once you get over that learning hump). When you&#39;re creating a multiple-page document, you can use Master Pages. When you are ready to print your document, you can use the preflight and package production tools. During this process, InDesign will list all of the errors in your document, including unlinked layers and images, as well as textural and color management errors."]},"id":"96d561af-126c-422d-a8d3-2d3e731b65ee","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Illustration Tools"},"id":"e0037452-53e5-43c1-b1c9-0f3b4a659568","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/FM7pdCpxXhxD6DUgwZiXBS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Whether you’re a designer or photographer, Adobe Photoshop CS5 is the undisputed champion of photo editing and retouching.

You can take a shot-by-shot view of the landscape and then, in Photoshop, stitch them together, creating one beautiful image. The 360 panorama allows you, if you choose, to wrap your image around a sphere to create quite the conversation piece.","<strong>Filters and effects</strong> – With hundreds of filters and effects, from the basic filters like Artistic and Blur to the more advanced painting effects and Puppet Warp, you have the power to totally alter any image. Puppet Warp, for example allows you to reposition elements in your photos. Adobe gives the example of an arm or flower stem. Using this tool, you can straighten the limbs to make the picture more aesthetically pleasing.","<strong>Mobile support </strong>– Adobe has a Lava Color Mixing app, an Eazel painting app and a Nav Productivity app all available for the iPad.","<strong>Content-aware fill</strong> – The park, your little girl&#39;s dance recital, a trip to the ocean, every photograph that you take has sentiment and beauty. You can customize these images by removing unwanted items, details or objects. The Content-Aware Fill tool, according to Adobe &#34;matches lighting, tone and noise, so it looks as if the removed content never existed.&#34;","<strong>Black-and-white conversion</strong> – Add drama to any photo by converting it from color to black and white.

Include video and audio in your eBooks, as well as images that resize to fit virtually any screen.

The Bristle Brush tool lets you turn strokes into realistic-looking brush strokes. Graphic styles, advanced path controls and appearance editing all work together to make vector drawing even more intuitive than before. We are most impressed with the Perspective Drawing options.
