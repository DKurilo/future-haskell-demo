You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Husqvarna Viking H Class E20 <a href=\"/best-sewing-machines\">sewing machine</a> serves as an effective sewing machine for beginners. It has all the necessary features and tools for basic sewing projects. With 32 stitch patterns and adjustable width and length, you can easily find a stitch that will fit your project. The sewing machine sews at 600 stitches per minute, and you have the ability to adjust the speed of the machine to fit your preference.","This beginner sewing machine has several automatic features that help as you are learning to sew. With an automatic needle threader and bobbin winder, the sewing machine completes common sewing tasks on its own. It also has a built-in thread cutter located on the machine. However, you have to control the tension of the sewing machine manually using a dial, which can be difficult for inexperienced sewers.","This sewing machine as several features you can use to make clothing. This unit creates one-step buttonholes, meaning the machine will automatically make the buttonhole after you indicate where you want it. However, it only creates one buttonhole style. It does work with twin needles, which is great for hemming clothing quickly.","Since this model weighs just 15 pounds, you can use the H Class E20 as a portable sewing machine. While it does not come with a carrying case, the machine is lightweight and easy to tote around. Because of its size, the sewing machine only has a 6-inch throat, making it hard to sew large projects or quilts. It also lacks an extension table, which makes working with heavy fabrics difficult. However, this machine has adjustable feed dogs that you can lower for free motion quilting.","This mechanical sewing machine has several standard design features that most other machines have. It comes with a sewing light, free arm and foot controller. The sewing machine has a standard bobbin holder, rather than the newer drop-in bobbin style. Also, it only lets you sew with the foot controller, rather than a start and stop button.","While it lacks some features found on comparable units in our sewing machine reviews, it comes with a wide variety of accessories. The machine has seven presser feet, including an all-purpose foot, zipper foot, satin stitch foot, buttonhole foot, quilting foot, free-motion foot and a blind hem foot. Additionally, it comes with a pack of needles, bobbins, a screwdriver, seam ripper, brush, oil bottle, dust cover and seam guide.","This Husqvarna sewing machine carries a 10-year warranty on mechanical parts and a one-year warranty on electrical parts. If you&#39;d prefer a machine that has a longer warranty, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/singer-7258-review\">Singer 7258</a>. If you need help with your machine, the Husqvarna Viking website has both a phone number and email address. Unfortunately, the site does not have a FAQs page for this sewing machine or tutorial videos on how to use it."]},"id":"a08d9ec4-32cb-4677-9bbf-811fda431039","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"45c554b0-b9c6-44a3-888a-864ee778ed03","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Husqvarna Viking H Class E20 sewing machine serves as a quality machine for beginners to learn on even if it is not the most sophisticated.
