These are obstructions to television signals since the signal doesn’t have direct line of sight to the antenna. This was a good test for the HDTV antenna to see how well it could obtain signal with obstructions around.","The HD digital antenna was able to receive 18 channels in our office. Some other models were able to get as many as 32 channels while others received as few as 12 channels, placing the FlatWave near the middle of the pack. This was a little surprising considering that this long-range HDTV antenna reaches out farther than any other in our comparison. It searches in a 50-mile radius, best in our comparison, but this didn&#39;t translate to stellar performance.","In our office we weren’t able to pick up CBS, and NBC had really poor quality. We were able to pick up ABC, but it looked more like standard quality as opposed to HD. PBS came in with great HD quality. The FlatWave also didn’t pick up many of the subchannels that others like the <a href=\"/clearstream-eclipse-review\">ClearStream Eclipse</a> usually receive. It seems as though the obstructions surrounding our office caused the FlatWave to struggle with reception a bit more than other antennas.","The antenna posted much different results in the apartment testing. The apartment is on the second floor, and there are no obstructions outside the window – just an open field. Here the HDTV digital antenna was able to receive 36 channels – significantly more than it did at our office. This was also far more than most antennas in our tests managed to pull in.","The reception was good on the majority of the channels. Here, we were able to receive all the major networks including CBS, ABC, NBC and PBS. The stations were streaming in good HD quality with little to no breakup in the signal. Most of the bad reception came from subchannels of major networks, which is a common occurrence. Keep in mind that the number of channels and what channels you receive will vary based on your location. In our experience, this antenna is great as long as you don’t live in the heart of a downtown area."]},"id":"f5d10a1f-16a2-49f5-873d-13d7829ea88a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"63749606-de3a-4276-8836-1e9327390988","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/NDMUtLyCW2yKBMDDGSMnag.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Winegard FlatWave is an amplified model.
