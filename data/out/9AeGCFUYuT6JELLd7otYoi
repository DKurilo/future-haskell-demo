The mirrors we chose can all be used hands-free and range in style, since we wanted to find products that could work in a variety of homes and situations. We chose to look at mirrors that varied in size from handheld compact mirrors to full mounted mirrors. The lighting provided by a mirror was especially important in our evaluation. Mirrors that offer non-glare, ringed lighting help protect your eyes and light your face without leaving excessive shadows to distort your facial features. Above all, we wanted to select and compare products that offered the most convenience for users.","<strong>How We Evaluated<br/></strong>While we did not test lighted mirrors ourselves, we did look heavily into user reviews to determine how well a product performed. We initially chose lighted mirrors based on their Amazon ratings. Once we selected a varied group of mirrors, we made a list of each product&#39;s attributes and compared them against one another to see which offered the best options.","Standup mirrors with small bases scored better than mirrors with large bases, since they take up less space. Wall-mounted mirrors and compact mirrors also don&#39;t take up as much counter space, so they were graded higher than mirrors with large bases. The mirrors were also scored based on the lighting they provide. Mirrors with glare-free, ringed light scored highest while products with only one light scored lowest.","Lighted mirrors use an electrical cord or batteries to obtain power. We didn&#39;t score mirrors based on their power source, but we did couple this information with the mirror&#39;s size to determine whether or not it was a good traveling companion. For instance, mirrors that could run off of batteries as well as a power cord scored higher since they could be used in just about any situation.  Products that could be packed and stored easily, scored higher than products that couldn&#39;t. While aesthetics are always a matter of preference, we took it upon ourselves to grade each mirror based on its design. Products that looked more elegant scored higher.","<strong>How to Choose a Lighted Mirror<br/></strong>Depending on the lighting in your bathroom and how much counter space you have, there are a variety of lighted mirrors to consider. You may want one that sits on a counter or something small that you can carry in a handbag. Mounted mirrors should match your decor, and energy-efficient ones not only consume less energy, but typically don&#39;t burn as a hot. Here are some things to consider when making a purchase.","Countertop or Wall-Mounted<br/> If your bathroom vanity is already crowded, consider getting a wall-mounted mirror. These are typically hardwired into the wall and never need batteries. If you want a mobile option or like the look of a vanity mirror, look for a model that can sit on your counter. There are also some models that mount to other mirrors or glass with suction cups, making them less permanent and saving counter space.","Design &amp; Aesthetics<br/> While rounded, dual-sided mirrors are the most common, they do come in a variety of finishes and shapes. If you have a more contemporary home, you might look for a chrome or satin nickel finish. Brass and oval shapes mimic a more antique look.","Energy Efficient Lighting<br/> LED lighting has become commonplace in almost every home appliance, and lighted mirrors have followed suit. If you prefer the look of halogen lighting, you can still find a mirror to suit your needs. However, LED lights have a longer life, are more efficient and do not put off as much heat. Also, because of their efficiency, LED lights do not drain batteries as quickly. Fluorescent T5 bulbs also consume less electricity and reduce radiant heat when compared with halogen bulbs.","Size<br/> If you are planning on applying makeup, you may be able to use a mirror as small as 5 inches in diameter. However, if you plan on using your mirror to style your hair or want a wider view of your face, neck and shoulders, consider a model that has a diameter of at least 8 inches. If the mirror is going above a vanity, ensure that you measure the area prior to purchase.","Lighted mirrors can simulate daylight and help you apply cosmetics. Magnification helps give you additional accuracy when tweezing eyebrows or inspecting your eyeliner. LED and fluorescent bulbs offer additional efficiency and keep your workspace nice and cool.","id:1785"]},"id":"676674fa-b5be-44e6-ae36-01865072e342","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_179","url":"/best-lighted-mirrors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-01-23T20:52:05Z","datePublished":"2018-01-23T20:52:05Z","name":"Best Lighted Mirrors of 2018","synopsis":"Lighted mirrors can simulate daylight and help you apply cosmetics.
