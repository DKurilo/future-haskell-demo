The original review is below, but check out our current top</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Bosch Axxis WAP24201UC front-load washer has 15 wash cycles. These options include damp, dry and extra dry cycles for both cotton and permanent press items. This machine also has special cycles for delicate items.","This front-load washer is ENERGY STAR qualified, but not National Sanitation Foundation certified. It is an energy-efficient machine, with annual power costs of about $21. It has the lowest annual water costs of any washer in our lineup at less than $8.","While it is efficient enough to get the ENERGY STAR qualification, it is not the most efficient machine in our lineup. The lower annual water costs are linked to the fact that this is a low-capacity washer with a drum size of just 2.2 cubic feet. However, it also uses more gallons of water per cubic foot than any other washer in the lineup.","The main advantage of its lower capacity is that it’s more compact. It is also stackable with the matching dryer. If you need a washer and dryer that will fit into a limited space, this may be just what you need. We wish that the price also reflected its low capacity. While it’s not the most expensive washer in our lineup, it’s certainly not the cheapest. Its price point should be more reflective of its capacity limitations.","This washer has an internal water heater, which is an uncommon feature that contributes to its efficiency. Having an internal water heater is an advantage because certain protein stains, like blood, dairy products and mud, respond best to low temperatures. Applying heat too early can cause permanent stains in such cases. However, high temperatures are needed for most other washing needs. Many stains will be removed when the water heats up, and most bacteria will also be killed at high temperatures. It is an advantage to have a machine that will do both types of cleaning in the same cycle.","The warranty on this machine is on the short end. It has a typical parts warranty of one year, but the tub warranty is only a year, while the motor’s warranty lasts two years. The tub and motor warranties are substantially shorter than the best washers in our lineup. If you have questions for customer service, the company is available via phone and email, but not live chat. There is a user manual available online, which will help answer many of your questions."]},"id":"6bb25e29-a6de-40fb-b30c-9e5ad1d8978c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5a9fccfe-686a-47e4-9a7e-40984556ad76","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch Axxis WAP24201UC front-load washer is a compact, low-capacity washer with stacking capabilities.
