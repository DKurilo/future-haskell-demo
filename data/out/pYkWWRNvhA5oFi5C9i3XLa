New reports released in 2011 indicate that thieves stealing banking information from people who swipe their cards at fuel pump processing terminals continue to increase at an alarming rate. Here s what you need to know about fuel pump identity theft   also sometimes called skimming   and how you can protect yourself.","<strong>How Thieves Steal Your Info at Gas Stations</strong>","Thieves who snag your information at the fuel pump get it by installing what s called a skimmer, which is a small electronic device that they place on the outside   and sometimes inside   the credit card processer in gas pumps. These skimmers save all digital information scanned at the pump, which means that they are able to record every credit card number, expiration date and verification code for every consumer who uses a card to pay for gas at that pumping station.","These thieves even install pinhole cameras on the skimmers so they can watch consumers enter their PIN codes for their bank account into the <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> machine. Many of these thieves work part-time jobs at gas stations solely for the purpose of being able to easily and secretly install these skimming devices at the fuel pumps.<br/>Once they&#39;ve installed a skimmer at a fuel pump, the thieves leave it there for a month or several months. They then uninstall the skimmer and access hundreds to thousands of card numbers and names from debit cards and credit cards. The thieves can then sell this banking information online or make duplicate, fraudulent cards and drain the bank accounts themselves.","At one busy gas station in Washington, D.C., a group of thieves left a single skimmer at a fuel pump for 11 months. When they retrieved the skimmer, they emptied hundreds of bank accounts in just one weekend. Overall, authorities estimate that thieves stole between $1 million and $3.5 million dollars with fuel pump scams in 2010.","<strong>How to Protect Yourself at the Fuel Pump</strong>","First, do not use your debit card to buy gas; only use your credit card. If a thief gets a hold of your debit card info and has you on camera typing your PIN code into a fuel pump&#39;s credit card processor, that thief has direct access to your bank account. Most banks do not provide 100 percent debit card protection, which means that if someone steals your banking info and withdraws cash from your account through an ATM, there is no way for you to recoup your money.","If the criminals are caught, prosecuted and convicted, you may have you funds returned. However, there is no guarantee this will happen, and even if it does, it will likely take several months. Since your bank is truly not at fault here, it will most likely not reimburse you. However, your credit card inherently offers more consumer protection since it s not linked to your bank account, and card companies allow you to dispute fraudulent charges.","You should also try to use the fuel pump stations closest to the building or cashier. Thieves are more likely to install skimmers at a fuel pumps that are farther away from security cameras, cashiers and customers. Also, be aware of anything odd about the credit card processing machine at the pump. If it looks different, funny or suspicious, don t use it. Finally, be sure to check your credit card statements regularly to quickly detect any fraudulent activity."]},"id":"49ebe3bb-894f-4889-8b7e-250d24a5dbe0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6120","url":"/trying-to-find-the-in-between","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-drew","url":"/author/jessica-drew","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Drew","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"rhh7ib7xwNCRKbyjPJTKmB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-10T18:04:57Z","datePublished":"2011-06-10T18:04:57Z","name":"Identity Theft at Fuel Pump Credit Card Processing Terminals","synopsis":"Identity theft at the fuel pump is a growing problem in the U.S. and in Europe.","review":{},"strapline":"Identity theft at the fuel pump is a growing problem in the U.S. and in Europe.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-05-31T17:10:32Z","id":"pYkWWRNvhA5oFi5C9i3XLa","meta":{"title":"Identity Theft at Fuel Pump Credit Card Processing Terminals","description":"Identity theft at fuel pumps is on the rise and could leave you with an empty bank account over night."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:57:48Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/xAs8eJc3nVE3DETF2xcekJ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"6120-trying-to-find-the-in-between.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6120-trying-to-find-the-in-between.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:48Z","id":"xAs8eJc3nVE3DETF2xcekJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xAs8eJc3nVE3DETF2xcekJ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Identity Theft at Fuel Pump Credit Card Processing Terminals","description":"Identity theft at fuel pumps is on the rise and could leave you with an empty bank account over night."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/xAs8eJc3nVE3DETF2xcekJ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"6120-trying-to-find-the-in-between.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6120-trying-to-find-the-in-between.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:48Z","id":"xAs8eJc3nVE3DETF2xcekJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xAs8eJc3nVE3DETF2xcekJ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Identity Theft at Fuel Pump Credit Card Processing Terminals","description":"Identity theft at fuel pumps is on the rise and could leave you with an empty bank account over night."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/trying-to-find-the-in-between","label":"","tags":[]}
