It offers a decent 0.75-gallon fuel tank that allows you to till substantial areas without having to stop and refuel. However, it lacks an easy electric start, using a more traditional recoil start instead, which can make starting the machine a challenge, particularly in cold weather. In spite of the pull-cord start, this model is still fairly easy to use, weighing only 100 pounds and coming complete with a reverse gear option, making it easy to maneuver and control.","This garden tiller from Husqvarna offers three tilling width adjustments of 12 inches, 24 inches and 26 inches, dramatically increasing versatility. With three width options, the Husqvarna FT900 is suitable for tilling between rows as well as for general maintenance and, on the highest setting, considerably speeds up the process of tilling large areas. You can also adjust the tilling depth in six increments between 4 and 6.5 inches, giving you the freedom to achieve the depth you need for tasks such as shallow tilling for weed control between rows and deep tilling across empty beds and virgin ground.","The Husqvarna FT900 power tiller has a vertically adjustable handlebar, allowing you to raise or lower it to find a comfortable tilling position that reduces the strain on your back. However, one downside is the lack of safety shields around the blades and the lack of bumper around the machine.","The wheels are only 8 inches and are transport wheels rather than agricultural wheels that provide balance and traction, so the machine may bounce and vibrate somewhat in heavy soils and lacks traction in wet conditions. This is offset somewhat by the presence of the drag bar, which provides extra weight, balance and stability.","While it can handle most tilling tasks, when using the FT900 on virgin or very tough ground, you may have to make several extra passes to achieve the finest till, largely due to the light weight and small tires. It is, however, a good choice if you need a balance of power, versatility and maneuverability.","This model is a no-frills, entry-level gas tiller that provides adequate power for most garden tilling tasks. While it offers no truly outstanding features for a midrange tiller, it does deliver versatility, durability and reliability."]},"id":"3673fd1e-5fb4-4df0-8d4b-d00a6eb816c2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62712","url":"/husqvarna-ft900-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T22:15:59Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T22:15:59Z","name":"Husqvarna FT900","synopsis":"With a 205 cc Briggs and Stratton engine, the Husqvarna FT900 is a reasonably powerful gas tiller with forward-rotating, front-facing tines.
