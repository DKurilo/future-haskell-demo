Our evaluation techniques were specifically designed by our expert reviewers to address the needs of average users. ","<strong>How Much Do Hedge Trimmers Cost? </strong>","Hedge trimmers come in many shapes and sizes. Some have blades only a few inches long, while others have 4-foot long blades attached to even longer poles for reaching the highest branches. Here&#39;s a breakdown of the prices for hedge trimmers:"]},"id":"62934011-76c8-406b-842a-f776269b51a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Electric Trimmers are the most common consumer models and cost between $20 and $180 depending on the blade length and quality of build.

The best cordless trimmers cost between $200 and $300. They can go anywhere and there&#39;s no risk of accidentally cutting a cord.","Gas trimmers cost between $160 and $650. These are the best performing trimmers and have the most power, but they are the heaviest trimmers and often require heavy-duty ear protection due to the volume of the engine. These trimmers are ideal for professional landscapers, but may be too expensive and unwieldy for small and medium yards. "],"type":"ul"},"id":"d506ec7d-e929-4993-b7ed-7c54fe3d87cc","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How We Picked the Best</strong>","To find out which models are the best, we combed through each product’s user manuals, watched online videos, consulted user reviews and compared specifications. We evaluated trimmers in a few categories, the most important of which was design. We considered how much power each hedge trimmer delivers; how heavy it is; how long it lasts on a tank of fuel or full battery charge; the length, sharpness and durability of the blades; how much noise it makes; and how well it cuts branches and shrubbery. Other considerations included handle design, durability and versatility. None of the trimmers we evaluated have all the features we looked for, but our top pick came the closest to striking the perfect balance in all these areas. ","<strong>Gas vs. Electric Hedge Trimmers</strong>","A power hedge clipper makes trimming hedges an infinitely easier process than using manual clippers. With the right trimmer you can create clean, straight lines on varied foliage including conifers and privet hedges and any kind of shrub or bush. The right model will have all the power you need and will be safe and comfortable to use.","The type of vegetation in your yard and your degree of strength will help you determine which trimmer will work best for you. You can choose between gas and corded or battery-operated electric models. Gas hedge trimmers have considerable power but are much heavier than electric and will put added strain on your body. Gas models are well suited for large areas and heavy-duty tasks. Professional landscapers will often opt for gas because they don’t have to worry about recharging batteries. ","Electric trimmers are not only lighter but easier to use overall. An electric trimmer provides ample power for most tasks around the yard, and they run quieter, are easy to start up and you don’t have to worry about filling the air and your lungs with emission fumes. Corded models are often less expensive than battery-powered models since you don’t have to pay for expensive batteries. They also have unlimited power since they plug into a wall, but mobility is limited.","<strong>Things to Consider When Buying Hedge Trimmers</strong>","There is a lot to take into consideration when looking for a hedge trimmer, and all the choices can make it difficult to decide. Knowing what to look for can help you buy the right one. Here are some features to keep in mind:","Power Source<br/>To find a hedge trimmer that’s a comfortable weight, you may have to look for one with a shorter blade or consider a corded model, which tend to weigh less than battery-operated and gas machines.","However, the type of hedge trimmer you choose should also depend on the type of vegetation you plan to cut. For heavy-duty tasks, you likely need a gas model. On the other hand, a corded or battery-operated machine is fine for light maintenance.","If you need to cut through tough, woody branches that are 3/4 of an inch or wider, a hedge trimmer might not be the right tool for the task. Instead, consider a manual pruning saw or even a chainsaw to groom especially thick-stemmed vegetation.","Blade<br/>Hedge trimmers use blades with sharp metal teeth to slice away at vegetation. The single-sided variety of blade has teeth that face away from you as you work, a worthwhile safety measure. The double-sided models work in both directions, so you must be alert while using them, but they let you complete your task fast.","When it comes to blade length, bigger is not always better. The longer the blade, the faster you can cut your hedge. However, a trimmer with a longer blade is heavier and more cumbersome, so not only do you need more strength to hold it, but you also have to take greater care to operate it correctly to get the results you want.","In general, hedge trimmer blades extend somewhere between 13 inches and 40 inches. Trimmers sporting 16-inch blades are best suited for small or average-size hedges. Eighteen-inch blades are good for grooming average to large hedges, and 20-inch blades are best for big hedges. Since a 24-inch blade can handle a wide variety of plant types, it’s a common length for residential trimmers. If you want a model with a blade that is longer than this, be sure you can maneuver it without difficulty.","Cutting Capacity<br/>A hedge trimmer’s cutting capacity depends on the spacing between the blade teeth, or gap. The gap determines the maximum branch size the machine can safely cut. The larger the gap the greater the cutting capacity of the trimmer. Typically, hedge trimmers have a gap of 1 inch or greater, but you can find models with a gap of 3/8 to 3/4 of an inch. For thick, dense or woody plants, you probably want to opt for a large cutting capacity. For young, leafy hedges with fine stems, a lower cutting capacity is acceptable. ","Extra Features<br/>Most hedge trimmers have the same basic design, no matter their power source or blade length. So, it’s the extra features that differentiate them and make them fit specific needs.","Some trimmers come with a shoulder strap, which can relieve strain on your arms during long trimming sessions. Others have ergonomic handle designs that increase comfort and enhance maneuverability. Others still have anti-vibration technology that makes for a smoother, more manageable trimming experience. And the best of the best have laser-cut blades that make clean, straight cuts on every pass. Picking a tool that has one or more of these features ensures you get the most value and power for your dollar."]},"id":"e0590991-b4b9-4153-bdcf-830d07d18eb2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_234","url":"/best-hedge-trimmers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"J.D.
