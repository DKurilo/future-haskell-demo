This keyboard has rounded keys that are soft upon impact, yet responsive. It also features a small, unpadded wrist rest and media buttons across the top of the keyboard. The mouse contains only the simplest features. It is a solid wireless mouse and keyboard combo that works well and travels easily.","Our test group felt both the <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">wireless keyboard and mouse</a> were comfortable to use. Many of our reviewers liked the responsiveness of the keyboard along with the flat profile of the keys. The 2 mm actuation helps typists pick up the speed. Other keyboards have to be depressed 3 mm or more to fire properly. A millimeter might not seem like a lot, but it makes a difference.","The switches found under the key shell are silicon, which makes for a soft impact. Even though they are silicon, the keyboard is responsive and a bit loud, more like what you&#39;d expect from mechanical switches.","The mouse has a large arch for the palm of your hand to rest on. The mouse doesn&#39;t have any additional features or buttons beyond left and right clicking and a scroll wheel for vertical page scrolling.","The mouse was impressive in our surface testing. We tested all mice on wood, laminate, carpet, denim, marble and glass surfaces. This wireless mouse is among the most responsive in our comparison. The only surface that made the cursor lag a little was glass, but that is a common occurrence for mice with a laser sensor. The lagging was only minor and the mouse still performed well on glass.","The mouse is powered by a single AA battery while the keyboard is powered by two AA batteries. Logitech claims that the mouse will last up to one year on a single battery, which is fair, but others can last up to three years. The company doesn&#39;t specify battery life for the keyboard.","This wireless keyboard and mouse are covered by a three-year warranty from Logitech. If you experience any problems, you can contact support via phone or email.","The Logitech Wireless Combo MK520 is a solid choice for a keyboard and mouse combo. If you tend to use your mouse on a variety of surfaces, this mouse is more than capable. If the mouse had more features, this would certainly be one of the best wireless mouse and keyboards in our lineup."]},"id":"1cd2f023-e19a-40f7-afc6-7f05514d2b05","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68140","url":"/logitech-wireless-combo-mk520-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-01T17:56:19Z","datePublished":"2016-08-01T17:56:19Z","name":"Logitech Wireless Combo MK520","synopsis":"The Logitech Wireless Combo MK520 just fell short of the top three in our lineup.
