While this isn&#39;t smart lighting technology that lets you control light switches remotely through a smartphone app, it does allow you to manage <a href=\"/best-smart-lighting-controls\">multiple switches</a> in the house from a single control. You can easily turn lights on and off even if you’re not in the same room, as well as dimming each light. This lighting panel gives you control over your home so you don’t have to worry about accidentally leaving lights on and wasting power.","This advanced light switch can control up to nine locations throughout your home. By connecting multiple switches within your home, you gain access to each of them from a single control. Along the side of the switch are multiple indicator lights to show which light controller you’re manipulating. When you flip the switch, the light for the controller you’re accessing is turned on or off.","The light controller also allows you to set up a delayed-off function. When you tap the controller, the light remains on for several seconds so you can exit the room before it goes dark. The unit even acts as a dimmer switch, allowing you to fade up and down. A soft LED light next to the switch shows the brightness level of the switch you&#39;re controlling.","The Lutron Multi-Location Dimmer gives you access to multiple switches in your home from a single panel. You could install one on each floor to consolidate your control to a couple locations. The dimming feature is also useful for setting the light as you like it. We tested the Lutron Caseta Wireless Smart Lighting Dimmer Kit in 2015 and were impressed by how easy it was to use and how well it worked with many smart home systems, particularly Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant."]},"id":"a425c3db-e8ab-42e9-bc05-3f6b6462ee8b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61080","url":"/lutron-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-05T22:45:41Z","datePublished":"2014-11-05T22:45:41Z","name":"Lutron MRF2-8S-DV-WH","synopsis":"The Lutron Multi-Location Dimmer allows you to control multiple light switches from a single panel.
