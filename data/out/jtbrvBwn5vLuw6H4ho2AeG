High sensitivity allows you to hear all 110dB of sound when you crank the volume for excitement and pounding bass. The over-ear, closed earcup design naturally blocks out ambient noise, boosts bass and swiftly places the Momentums well in front of other solid bass headphones. The noise isolation is important to keep the bass in, and the noise of traffic out – which makes them particularly good headphones for bass.","Although the minimum frequency is at 16Hz, which is still low, it is less conducive for &#34;feeling&#34; the bass than the frequency in the best bass headphones. The low power output (at 200 megawatts) is also a drawback because you can&#39;t pump the volume as loud as you might like, but it does protect your hearing.
