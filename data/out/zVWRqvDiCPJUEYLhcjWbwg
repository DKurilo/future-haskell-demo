are many solar companies out there, but Sunrun is one of the best. It provides roof and workmanship warranties on all of its installs and has a multiple payment plans to choose from, so it is easy to budget for your new solar panels. The one downside is it can be a little difficult to get ahold of the company.","Sunrun is one of the largest <a href=\"/best-solar-companies\">solar companies</a> in the United States. It covers 17 states across the U.S., including California, Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Contact the company to find out if it offers service in your area.","You can choose between four payment agreements: BrightSave Monthly, BrightSave Prepaid, BrightBuy and BrightAdvantage. No matter which plan you choose, Sunrun includes a 10-year roof warranty and a workmanship warranty as well as backup battery storage, though the latter is only available in select locations.","The BrightSave Monthly plan is a 20-year lease agreement with, you guessed it, monthly solar payments. During those 20 years, Sunrun owns and maintains the solar panels, but your utility bill reaps the rewards of solar production. However, since the company owns the panels, you are not eligible for tax credits.","The BrightSave Prepaid plan is a solar lease you pay in full from the get-go. It comes with a 20-year solar panel warranty as well as Sunrun monitoring and maintenance. Once again, since it is a lease, you are not eligible for solar tax credits.","When you opt for the BrightBuy plan, you purchase the solar system in full – this makes you the sole owner of the system. With this plan, you qualify for all solar tax incentives, and you don’t pay monthly solar installation payments. In addition, the solar panels are under warranty through their manufacturer.","The BrightAdvantage plan is a solar loan, which is often a more feasible way to own your solar panels. This loan allows you to apply for tax credits, and as with the BrightBuy plan, your solar panel warranty period is set by the manufacturer.","When you decide to use Sunrun, it sends a representative to your home to evaluate your solar eligibility. Within three weeks, the company creates a design for you to approve, and after you give your consent, Sunrun begins applying for permits. Permit wait times depend on your local government. Once permits are approved, installation can begin.","Sunrun&#39;s installation typically takes between two to five days. Your home is then inspected by the local municipality to make sure everything is up to code. In addition, Sunrun contacts your utility company to ask it to install a net metering unit – a device that measures your home power production – as well as for permission to operate the solar panels. Once the utility company gives the ok, your solar panels are activated. From beginning to end, this process could take anywhere from three to 10 months to complete.","You can monitor your solar home&#39;s productivity using the MySunrun app or by logging into your account on Sunrun&#39;s website. Sunrun offers backup battery storage with its Brightbox; however, it is only available in Hawaii and California. The company states that it hopes to make this service available in more states soon.","You can find information about solar power on Sunrun’s website – its knowledgebase is complete with a FAQs page and educational videos. You can also contact this solar contractor by phone or email. It can take Sunrun a while to respond to emails, so if you need quick answers, call a customer representative.","Sunrun is a good solar contractor to consider if it operates in your area. Its four payment plans are varied enough that you can find one that works for your home and budget, and the MySunrun app makes it easy to monitor your home’s solar production."]},"id":"4d3d1d8e-3e01-4f43-bdb7-427f4a7e8431","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69384","url":"/sunrun-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-26T13:38:18Z","datePublished":"2017-05-26T13:38:18Z","name":"Sunrun","synopsis":"There are many solar companies out there, but Sunrun is one of the best.
