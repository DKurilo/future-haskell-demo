In addition, this card has steep cancellation fees, and it charges for every customer support call you make.","As soon as you activate your SilverCard, you&#39;re charged an activation fee. This charge is subtracted from the initial card deposit, and you&#39;re also charged a monthly service fee. For every PIN purchase you make, there is an additional small charge. Because this charge is incurred for every purchase you make, it can really add up over the course of the month. Most prepaid credit cards companies charge either a monthly fee or a transaction fee, but not both.","SilverCard&#39;s other fees are generally average for prepaid credit cards. If you withdraw cash from an ATM, you will be charged a fee. A balance inquiry via an ATM results in a small charge, as do denials. There is no monthly statement, and you manage your account online. You can ask for a paper statement, but that&#39;s another charge. Any lost cards can be replaced but for a fee.","However, SilverCard offers freebies in other ways. You don&#39;t have to maintain a minimum balance, and there are no overdraft fees. You can make unlimited signature transactions with no fee. SilverCard also offers free email and text alerts so you can keep track of your spending and balance. You can also check your account status online anytime for free.","The card can also be used to make online bill payments. The same transaction charge applies to online bill pay as for purchases. SilverCard prefers that you use direct deposit for paychecks or government benefit payments. You can also reload your card through wire transfer agencies and other third-party retailers, but, again, fees apply. This card is also set up to make transfers, which can be made to and from bank accounts.","SilverCard&#39;s customer service is rather inconvenient. They charge you to talk to a live customer service representative. The only other option is to mail a letter to its headquarters in Houston, Texas.","SilverCard&#39;s prepaid credit card includes several free services, including free signature transactions, online statements, and text and email alerts. However, this prepaid card company nickels and dimes you for other services, such as cash withdrawals, customer support by phone, balance inquiries by ATM, replacement cards, monthly fees, inactivity fees, and bill pay."]},"id":"e8bef1d4-99f4-4495-9efd-f2788196c056","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3377","url":"/silvercard-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-07-16T15:10:50Z","datePublished":"2009-07-16T15:10:50Z","name":"SilverCard","synopsis":"SilverCard's prepaid MasterCard is relatively similar to other prepaid credit cards, although its fees are somewhat higher.
