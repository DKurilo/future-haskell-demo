You could also just buy John Frieda’s bigger-barreled version of this curling iron.

This matters for people of all hair types, but especially for those who have fine hair, which can burn at high temperatures. In addition, you can depend on the Tight Curls to actually be the temperature it says it is, or at least really close – something that can’t be said about all of its competitors.","We found that this iron’s curls didn’t hold as well over time as some of its competitors’, but it did better than at least half of the other curlers we tested.
