Compared to those gas-powered models, it also has the benefit of not requiring gasoline and oil, which produce exhaust that can harm your lungs and the environment.<br />\n<br />\nThis EGO model is equipped with a 56-volt lithium-ion battery that lasts a full hour before needing to be recharged. This should be enough time to cut a 1/3-acre lawn, provided it’s already well maintained. If the grass is overgrown, you might run out of juice. Luckily, it only takes about 40 minutes to fully charge the battery. The average charge time of the lawn mower batteries we tested was about two and a half hours. <br />\n <br />\nAnother benefit of this mower is its 21-inch cutting width, which is wide enough that it can cut down on the number of passes you need to make to trim your lawn. It also has five distinct cutting heights, ranging from 1 1/2 inches to 4 inches. This allows you to get the cut height that’s just right for the type of grass you have. <br />\n <br />\nThis lawn mower only weights about 58 pounds – some other models we evaluated weigh up to 90 pounds. This not only makes it easy to push across your lawn, but it also makes it easy to move and store. In addition, it has a collapsible handlebar, which makes it even more convenient to store when not in use.","<a href=\"/ego-lm2101-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"19dbb510-404f-407b-9e7f-f60a48007847","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"5e4fb1b8-be00-454b-9c84-09cfdf565aa1","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/dSfw9YNaSQoDqfLjWmyf2i.jpg","link":{"href":"/earthwise-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/7/X/737709/original/earthwise-electric-lawn-mowers-01.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dSfw9YNaSQoDqfLjWmyf2i.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"dSfw9YNaSQoDqfLjWmyf2i","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dSfw9YNaSQoDqfLjWmyf2i.jpg","alt":"Earthwise 60420"},"id":"46e1a50f-0ed5-4d95-beff-d045228d7bb9","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Earthwise 60420\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/earthwise-review\">Earthwise 60420</a>","pros":["20-inch cutting path","Seven cutting positions","Solid steel construction"],"cons":["No self-propulsion tech","Two-hour recharge time","Relatively short warranty period"]},"id":"ce95dba0-3f0e-4fe4-9f9d-eb84f0cbe56d","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["","When money is tight, you need to get the most bang for your buck.

It’s also quite ergonomic, with a comfortable grip that won’t give you blisters or chafe your hands. Additionally, it has seven cutting positions, so you have ultimate control over how long your grass is. <br />\n <br />\nThis lawnmower comes with two batteries that last about 55 minutes each before needing a recharge.

Unfortunately, unlike the top pick, it doesn’t have self-propulsion technology. So even though it’s quite light, it still may be a chore to push around your yard. <br />\n <br />\nThe tradeoffs you make for a cheaper lawn mower are more than acceptable with this model.

Is it true that Lowes electric lawn mowers are the best and, if so, which is the best electric lawn mower at Lowes? Are electric riding lawn mowers worth a look? And, should I buy my electric lawn mower from The Home Depot? Then you’ve come to the right place.","<strong>How to choose the right electric lawn mower for you</strong>","First off, we think that unless you are shopping on a restricted budget then most lawn owners should be looking at a cordless mower in 2019. That’s because there has been big leaps forward in mower battery tech over the past five years and that has allowed even the most modestly priced electric mower to run for 45 minutes to an hour on a single charge, which is more than enough time for the averaged sized lawn to be well and truly cut.","The other option, of course, is to get a cabled electric mower, and that is just fine providing you are happy to manipulate the wire while you mow. Naturally, if you have a very big garden with plenty of turf to master then we’d point you in the direction of a gas lawn mower instead, as these have no cables and can run for hours and hours without needing a fuel refill. ","As most electric lawn mower batteries only take about 40 minutes to fully charge, though, we think most users will find them perfectly suited to their needs.","Aside from going cordless if at all possible, then we’d also suggest that you ascertain exactly what type of cutting needs you require before going out and ringing a machine up. That’s because there are plenty of great electric mowers out there that offer a wide-selection of cutting modes and features, however not everyone will need them, and it makes no sense in spending much more than you need to for a machine that is over the top for your patch.","<strong>Who are the best electric lawn mower makers?</strong>","Lawn mowers aren’t exactly a new product category, so right now in 2019 there are plenty of brands that have serious, multi-decade heritage in the business of making them. However, there are also some relative newcomers that are also producing top lawn mowers, too, so you really do have a very broad range of quality makers to choose from. Makers such as: <a href=\"http://www.egopowerplus.com\">Ego</a>, <a href=\"http://www.americanlawnmower.com\">American Lawn Mower</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stihlusa.com\">Stihl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ryobitools.com\">Ryobi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.greenworkstools.com\">GreenWorks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bosch.us\">Bosch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Husqvarna.com\">Husqvarna</a>.","<strong>What types of electric lawn mower are there?</strong>","<strong>Rotary mowers:</strong> Rotary mowers are characterised by one very high speed rotating cutting blade, which slices the grass on impact. These types of mowers are very common as they allow medium to high cut grass to be quickly cut and deposited in a rear-mounted grass box. These mowers typically have four fixed wheels for maneuvering.","<strong>Cylinder mowers:</strong> Cylinder mowers have a series of blades which tend to be exposed in a cylindrical drum structure on the front of the machine. Unlike rotary mowers, these cut grass by slicing against a fixed bottom plate, with a series of smaller blades doing the work of one. These machines work best when cutting low to medium height grass.","<strong>Hover mowers:</strong> Hover mowers are similar to rotary mowers in that they cut grass with a rotating cutting blade or disc, they differ in that they don’t have wheels for maneuvering. Instead the hover mowers create a downward firing cushion of air that allows them to move easily in any direction, like a hovercraft.","<strong>Important features to consider when choosing an electric lawn mower <br/></strong>"]},"id":"71f3723c-eaca-4ccd-bf61-88581f8ac414","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Battery Power: </strong>Our team of in-house reviewers found that battery power is the most important consideration when buying an electric lawn mower. They were often frustrated when a lesser machine’s battery died in the middle of a mowing job. To measure battery power, our team noted how long each one lasted on a full charge as well as how long it took to recharge it after it died. They found that electric lawn mower batteries last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and can take as long as two hours to charge. Mowers that come with a backup battery earned higher scores.","<strong>Performance: </strong>The most powerful lawn mower isn’t necessarily the best one for your lawn. You should consider how large your yard is and how often you intend to mow it. If your lawn is 1/3 acre or bigger, you’ll want to spring for a high-performance model with a high-voltage battery, wide cutting path and multiple height settings. If you have a smaller yard or don’t need to mow very often, you can probably get away with one that has less power. ","<strong>Design: </strong>The reviewers found that using a mower that has multiple height settings is imperative to getting your grass cut just the way you want it. Different types of grass have their own unique needs and look better when cut at certain heights. The more height adjustments you have on your mower the better. We also factored weight into our analysis. Mowers that weigh more are harder to push around your yard. Also, because these machines don’t have internal combustion engines, they have little to no self-propulsion. Lighter mowers scored higher in our analysis, but our reviewers’ experiences maneuvering them was also considered. Only one model we reviewed had additional self-propulsion technology, and it got bonus points. Comfort and convenience should be key considerations when picking an electric lawn mower. The best models have padded, ergonomically designed handles that prevent chaffing and blisters on your hands. Additionally, the models we reviewed all have a primary ignition system of either a key or a button, both of which are far superior to the rip-cords on gas mowers.","<strong>Pricing:</strong> Corded electric lawn mowers start at about $100; however, it can be awkward to deal with a cord while mowing, and it limits your mobility and the distance you can cover. Battery-operated mowers cost a little more, starting in the low $200 range up to about $500, but the convenience of battery power, for many consumers, is worth paying extra. Be aware that cordless mowers tend to have somewhat less power than corded models, and you’ll have to recharge the batteries, but they offer much more mobility."],"type":"ul"},"id":"2e693ab3-fc0d-4757-8b43-7c024f8a3048","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Read more:</strong><br/>"]},"id":"723252b5-2551-4a18-865d-05f3479e0a7c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-lawnmowers-review\">Best Lawn Mowers Overall</a>","<a href=\"/best-gas-lawn-mowers\">Best Gas-Powered Lawn Mower</a>","<a href=\"/best-riding-lawn-mowers\">Best Riding Lawn Mowers</a>","<a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">Best Robotic Lawn Mowers</a>","<a href=\"/best-edgers\">Best Lawn Edgers</a>","<a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">Best Electric Weed Eaters</a>","<a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">Best Weed Whackers</a>","<a href=\"/best-leaf-blowers\">Best Leaf Blowers</a>","<a href=\"/best-pest-control-services\">Best Pest Control Services</a>","<a href=\"/best-landscaping-software\">Best Landscaping Software</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4178d24e-6ee5-4dda-ad15-9cf47f7c2848","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_25","url":"/best-electric-lawn-mowers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
