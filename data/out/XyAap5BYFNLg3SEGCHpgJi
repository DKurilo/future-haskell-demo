Ceramic and tourmaline are a hot change of direction the in professional and home styling realm. These combined materials create a super duo of conductivity and consistent heating. Tourmaline is a piezoelectric mineral with a natural proclivity for electric charges, while ceramic materials heat evenly and stay hot longer than metal. The negative ions emitted from the ceramic and tourmaline barrel redistribute moisture in your positively charged hair, leaving it smooth and shiny. Unlike metal, the heat from these materials is radiant rather than direct, so you don&#39;t have to worry about damaging your hair if you hold the barrel in for a long time.","If you travel a lot, you&#39;ll appreciate the 8-foot heavy-duty cord because you never know where the mirror will be in relation to the outlet. The swivel head at the bottom of the iron gives you extra flexibility and control in your styling. Don&#39;t let the European outlets discourage you from sporting a perfect beachy wave on your vacation. With the help of a plug adapter, you can travel overseas without worrying about tricky voltage conversion. This curling iron is a great travel companion, and its dual voltage feature means it will work around the world by automatically adjusting to the correct voltage level."]},"id":"2fd7f8df-595b-461a-9bc8-a89a19f922a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/AfZWfdYmwKkvhkdGSxMFgZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57444-babyliss-pro-tt-5001.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfZWfdYmwKkvhkdGSxMFgZ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"AfZWfdYmwKkvhkdGSxMFgZ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfZWfdYmwKkvhkdGSxMFgZ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c332b2d0-e66c-4441-8bde-27e856ce7917","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BaByliss Pro TT 500 comes in five different barrel sizes: 1.5, 1.75, 1, 0.75 and 0.625 inches. The variety of sizes means youâ€™ll find the right tool for a range of hair lengths and styles. The larger the barrel, the larger the curl, which is better for longer hair. Barrels of 1 inch or smaller typically create small, tight curls, a la Meg Ryan or Sarah Jessica Parker. The long cool tip and slim rubberized handles help you look like a styling pro and add more comfort and safety, which is significant if you have a lot of hair to curl. This BaByliss Pro model comes with a one-year warranty for replacement or repairs after purchase.","The BaByliss Pro TT 500 offers a wide range of barrel sizes, quick heat and a wide heat range, as well as dual voltage and a locking temperature dial.
