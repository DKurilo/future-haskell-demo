You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This is one of the smaller dual-zone wine chillers available. The Whynter WC-211DZ holds up to 21 standard-size bottles and is only 13.4 inches wide (it will fit three bottles across per shelf). The top, white wine zone fits a maximum of six bottles and can be set to hold a temperature of 44 to 66 F. The lower zone holds up to 15 bottles and can be set to any temperature between 50 and 66 F. These ranges make the unit suitable for light whites as well as dark red wines. However, if you enjoy chilly sparkling wines this unit may not cool low enough for you. Check out the <a href=\"/newair-awc-330e-review\">NewAir AWC-330E</a> if you need a machine that reaches lower temperatures. ","This <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">wine fridge</a> is black with stainless-steel trim, so it will likely coordinate with other popular appliances in your home. It only has one door for both zones, but you shouldn’t notice much temperature bleed between zones. The Whynter WC-211DZ uses a thermoelectric cooling system, which does not include moving parts or toxins such as Freon. Some argue that motionless cooling units are better since they are quieter and do not shake around sediments in red wines. However, you will find equal numbers who will argue that compressor cooling systems are not always louder and that a little vibration to your red wine is just fine. So, depending on your penchants, you may prefer one over the other.","The Whynter WC-211DZ includes digital controls; however, they are located inside of the unit. So every time you open the door to adjust the temperature, the inside temperature will change. Because of this we recommend that you leave a digital thermometer inside the unit with the door closed for a few minutes to see what the actual temperature is inside before you make adjustments. Since both zones can be adjusted up to 66 F, you could store any type of red in the wine cooler that you desire.","While this unit only weighs 46 pounds, it is rather narrow for its height. You may want to be careful with this unit if you think little ones might try to climb on top of the unit or pull it over. Additionally, most free-standing units such as this one cannot be built in to secure them, as they need space around them to ventilate. This wine cooler also does not lock to keep children from accessing the wine. While these issues may not matter to many, they should be taken into account if you have young children in your home."]},"id":"35177d0d-c317-42b8-a29a-5704b97e6434","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"720507bd-a12e-4c2d-b016-ca4d63d2ce1d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Whynter wine refrigerator is one of lower-priced dual-zone options.
