Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Netgear WN2000RPT is one of several  Wi-Fi boosters offerings from Netgear. This model is packed with features that help the user quickly and easily connect the wireless repeater to the current wireless network. It also has four Ethernet ports for connecting wired devices to the internet.","This Wi-Fi booster is specifically designed to extend your current network’s wireless range and keep the data rate at a whopping 300 Mbps. But, not only can the WN2000RPT extend your connection, it can act as a bridge for wired devices. Four Ethernet ports are at your disposal for connecting wired devices like gaming consoles, Blu-ray players and more to the internet. LED indicator lights display the connection status between your router and the Wi-Fi booster as well as the connection status between other wireless devices.","One of the trickiest parts of using a Wi-Fi booster is determining where the ideal location for the wireless repeater may be. If you put it in the wrong location, your home or office may still have dead spots. The Netgear WN2000RPT has an optimal coverage LED light that will establish the best location to place the Wi-Fi booster. The unit stands vertically (4.41 x 1.77 x 2.91 inches), with the LED indicator lights on the front-side and the Ethernet ports and buttons on the back.","A unique feature of the Netgear WN2000 is the inclusion of a power on and off button as well as a Wi-Fi on and off button. With this feature you can still have wired devices plugged into the Ethernet ports and receiving the internet, but you can turn off the rebroadcasted Wi-Fi signal. A WPS setup button is another handy feature. Pressing this button creates a secure connection with your router – be sure to press the WPS button on your router as well.","Netgear’s support page on their website is simple enough to navigate. If you have a question they’ve set up a gigantic list of FAQs for you to search through. For specific questions, you can use their online contact form or call in. Be wary though and remember this disclaimer from the Netgear website before calling, “Free phone support is limited to 90 days only from date of purchase. Refurbished Products are not entitled for phone support.” We think putting a limit on phone support is a little cheap of Netgear, especially since their hardware warranty lasts for a year. Netgear is one of the few Wi-Fi booster manufacturers that have a stipulation on support availability."]},"id":"058da2da-33be-4148-8723-736a6b31f2d2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cbfb1ee2-4912-473e-bad3-28f3c9e3005e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It is obvious that Netgear is a stellar manufacturer of all things internet related.
