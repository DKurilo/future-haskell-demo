The software provides many creative filters and standard editing tools; however, its capabilities limit you to basic photo editing.","This <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac photo editor</a> has a user-friendly interface, and you can familiarize yourself with the workspace in just minutes. Rather than using dropdown menus to display its tools, they are all easily accessible on the application’s top toolbar. After you select a tool, its options display on the side menu, and you can then adjust the tool by moving the sliders around.","FX Photo Studio Pro has the standard editing tools that most Mac photo editing software offer. You can crop, rotate, adjust colors and add filters to your photos. Using the program’s 170 filters, you can alter the colors and textures of your images. There is also a side-by-side comparison feature, so you can view the original and edited photo next to each other before implementing your edit.","While this software has a deep catalog of filters, it’s missing key editing tools found in the best photo editing software for Macs. The program does not support working in layers, and you cannot add text to your photos. Additionally, the application lacks some basics, such as selection, painting, drawing, shape and makeover tools, as well as more advanced tools like panoramic images, HDR imaging and batch processing. As such, FX Photo Studio Pro serves as an application to apply filters and make basic edits to your photos.","FX Photo Studio Pro doesn’t come with a built-in organizer to help you manage your photos. Instead, you have to rely on your Mac’s Photos application. The software is compatible with six image file formats, including RAW, JPG, TIFF, PNG and PDF. After launching the program, you can select an image to work on by dragging and dropping, loading or opening a recent photo.","If you want to share your photos, you can post images to Facebook, Tumblr, Flickr and Twitter directly from the application. You can also email your photos to your friends and family. Before sharing your images, the software allows you to optimize their resolution.","FX Photo Studio Pro offers some help and support. There is a general blog on the developer’s website that contains interesting information. You can find video tutorials online and access the user guide inside the application. If you need to contact a support representative, you can find phone numbers and an email address on the company’s website."]},"id":"2e9e15c3-92f6-4569-b75e-d42b892c1fb8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4dec1d81-ed92-4176-aeda-c2b32a9ecc21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["FX Photo Studio Pro serves as a good picture editor for Macs.
