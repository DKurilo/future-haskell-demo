Having our number one product, Logitech Harmony One as competition is sure to put a strain on any universal remote&#39;s ego. The Harmony One has proven superior because of its LCD color touch screen and power cradle. ","The Harmony 700 is less expensive than the Harmony One, and rightly so, due to its lack of a touch screen and disappointing power management situation. An interesting fact to think about when reading our review about the Logitech 700 universal remote is the jump from the One&#39;s 15 devices to Harmony 700&#39;s six devices. While we think this product is definitely worthy of its number two spot, we have to wonder why Logitech made that decision which decreased the functionality of this remote."]},"id":"132c35d2-a198-4aa1-8414-cd3efddc9eff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"959de9ee-8efc-48a6-9b65-bb6a91a76434","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/aRkrkmXL7rbDuYNU5SEs9Y.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"One design element missing from the Harmony 700 universal remote is the power cradle. Because of this, rechargeable batteries are used in its place. While the batteries can last up to a week or longer, the process of using two cables to plug the remote into a wall outlet can be tedious. However, our favorite feature was born out of this lack of a power cradle. The motion sensor on the advanced universal remote helps the battery status indicator on the screen stay within the green power zone much longer than a remote without the sensor would.

The red, green, yellow and blue buttons are grouped together and can be programmed to your favorite devices with one-touch  ease. Along with the groupings of the activity buttons, we also love the fact that Logitech added a rewind and skip button to this universal remote for additional ease.","Like the Harmony One, we would have liked to have seen this universal remote equipped with both the infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF) capabilities.
