You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","The One World Touch DM-1700-19 is a responsive and relatively inexpensive <a href=\"/best-touchscreen-monitors\">touchscreen monitor</a>. The screen on this monitor is only 17 inches, with a resolution of 1280 x 1024. It only responds to one touch at a time. However, you can also purchase monitors that have bigger screens, higher resolutions and multi-touch technology through this company if you want something fancier.","The resolution of the DM-1700-19 is 1280 x 1024, which isn&#39;t horrible. However, it&#39;s not a high-definition screen. Although this screen isn&#39;t HD, One World Touch has monitors with 1680 x 1050 resolution screens.","The One World Touch DM-1700-19 has a decent brightness level of 250 candela per square meter. The contrast ratio is 1000:1, which is standard among the touchscreen PC monitors we reviewed. It also has a fast response time of 5ms, which helps produce a crisp picture if you game or watch movies on the monitor. The pixel pitch also influences the picture quality. This measurement determines the amount of space between the pixels. At .26 mm, the One World Touch monitor has a standard pixel pitch for its screen size and resolution.","One World Touch allows you to choose between a resistive and capacitive touch monitor. A resistive screen requires you to press the screen with your finger or a stylus to push the layers of the screen together to register a response. The capacitive touchscreen has a hard screen that registers your touch when your finger distorts the electrostatic field on the screen.","It&#39;s easy to adjust the touchscreen PC monitor so that it is at a comfortable height. Unfortunately, this monitor doesn&#39;t have an option to mount it on a wall, which is something that most of the other touchscreens we reviewed allow. The screen is slightly inlayed, which makes it a little difficult to use the edges of the screen. The viewing angles are nice and wide, 170 degrees vertically and 176 degrees horizontally. This means that you can sit in practically any seat in the room and still see the screen well. The monitor has built-in speakers. It also has a security lock so that you don&#39;t change your monitor settings by mistake."]},"id":"d0418fa3-f08d-4b7e-9e94-64cc02b8cac3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a8312489-a42e-4347-af69-8034c0daf2a7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The One World Touch DM-1700-19 is not going to blow your socks off with its amazing display, but it still performs well as a simple touchscreen PC monitor.
