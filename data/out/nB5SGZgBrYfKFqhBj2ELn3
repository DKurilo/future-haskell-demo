The onBoard 35 Air is an older model, but this reliable <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> has all of the safety features you need with the convenience to fit your lifestyle. The onBoard has impressive side-impact protection, and when you&#39;re ready to transfer the carrier to the stroller, you can choose from many different Safety 1st strollers to fit your needs. Unfortunately, there are a few bothersome aspects of the car seat, like the cushions, which are not machine washable.","Like all retail car seats, the onBoard 35 Air meets all federal crash-testing requirements. It offers both energy-absorbing foam and side-impact protection to protect your child in the event of a car accident. The seat is easy to install with its LATCH connectors. You can also secure the base with your seatbelt. Unfortunately, according to the manufacturer&#39;s user manual, you cannot install the carrier independent of the base. The seat supports an infant as light as 4 pounds and as heavy as 35 pounds, or as tall as 32 inches.","The Safety 1st onBoard 35 Air is compatible with several different strollers, including the Lift LX and the SleekRide. The base is simple to install correctly, thanks to the installation instructions and the level indicators. You can adjust the carry handle to many positions. There is a decent amount of space between the handle and the canopy, so you won&#39;t have much trouble using both at the same time. Unfortunately, the cushions are not machine washable, so you&#39;ll have to spend time hand-washing the seat. If you want a car seat with machine washable cushions, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/evenflo-embrace-review\">Evenflo Embrace</a>.Â ","Safety 1st supports the onBoard 35 Air with a one-year warranty. You can download a new user manual if you lose yours, and if you need help with installation, there is a video tutorial on the site. Customer support representatives are available by email and phone, but we had trouble getting answers from either source."]},"id":"90cfe642-5160-4044-a5a7-00a06c2dbd40","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1bc12530-bf05-4dbc-a629-3b9b473485a4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Safety 1st onBoard 35 Air is a reliable baby car seat, and even though this model is older than many of the other car seats we reviewed, it has most of the safety and convenience features we look for.
