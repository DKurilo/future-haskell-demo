If you want to return a rented textbook online for any reason whatsoever, you can do so within 30 days of the order date and receive a full refund. However, Campus Book Rentals goes an extra step by offering free return shipping, while other companies make the customer pay for shipping in the event of a return.","One of Campus Book Rentals&#39; biggest perks is a 15-day grace period. The people behind the company understand the nature of the student lifestyle and do everything they can to minimize stress on your end.
