Its all-rubber casing is shockproof and even water-resistant, so your files will be physically protected from damage. The memory stick is available in four storage-capacity options: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB. The 16GB version has recorded maximum read speeds of 75MB per second and maximum write speeds of 18MB/s. While it’s fast enough to stream a movie, its read speeds aren&#39;t as fast as several USB flash drives we reviewed.","This pen drive comes with a five-year warranty from Corsair, and should you need to contact the company for technical support, you must first register to create a Support account. Once you log in, you&#39;ll be able to create and view customer service tickets, read FAQs, communicate with customer service representatives and request a product replacement if it is still covered by warranty.","As mentioned, this is a durable drive. Its shock resistance was tested at shock pulses of 40G, and it’s been known to even survive a clothes dryer. One thing to note, though, is that the protective outer casing is thicker than other drives. If you need to connect this on top of another USB-connected device or in an otherwise tight space, you might want to consider a USB extender or dock.","This flash drive has a loop to connect it to a lanyard or key ring. One negative physical feature is that it has a removable lid instead of incorporating a capless design. However, if you do not lose the lid, this flash drive is more durable than most USB drives.","The Corsair Flash Voyager is a plug-n-play device, which means you don’t have to install any additional software on your computer to use it. It can exchange files with Windows, Mac and Linux machines. This flash drive does not come with security software. If you need to password protect your folders or encrypt files, you will want to look to a different drive or employ third-party software to do that for you."]},"id":"5e8228d6-a039-426e-8678-3893e193f693","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"04668005-63b6-4cf6-af45-a1d5f234571c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Some of us are not as gentle with our technology as we should be.
