It is also compatible with ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart sensors. The Cyclo 505 can connect with your smartphone via Bluetooth to enable music playback and phone notifications, and it has Wi-Fi for automatic ride uploads.","During your ride, the Cyclo 505 will display your speed, time and distance data, as well as information gathered from your heart rate, pedal cadence and pedal power meters. The cycling computer can connect to sensors that use ANT+ wireless technology and sensors that use the new Bluetooth Smart technology. This means that practically every sensor on the market will work with the Cyclo 505.","The bike computer has a feature rarely seen in this type of device: automatic route finding. You can determine a distance or time you want to ride for, and the Cyclo 505 will offer three suggestions for a route. The 505 also has maps navigation. These two features make this an excellent bike GPS unit for riding in unfamiliar territory.","Because it has Wi-Fi, the Cyclo 505 can automatically upload your route to Magellan’s online training software when you’re in range of a signal. This means you won’t have to plug the unit into a computer to upload your ride data. One of the best features of the Magellan website is its automatic data transfer to Strava, a popular online cycling community.","The interface is simple to figure out and, though it doesn’t have a touchscreen, the buttons are large and easy to push, even with gloved hands. This cycle computer is rather large, which could be a problem if you’re particularly conscious of weight and drag. Its 12-hour battery life is lower than other high-end bike computers, so you may have trouble keeping the unit powered through all-day rides. Additionally, there’s no live GPS tracking, which would allow your friends to monitor your ride online to ensure your safety or just to cheer you on.","Magellan features live chat, phone and email support, and an excellent YouTube channel full of informative videos and tutorials. The cycling computer ships with an industry-standard one-year manufacturer warranty."]},"id":"fd7a5b9a-2ead-46f9-a71b-a9e1e85a68f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"36e5fff7-c9f6-4fd4-81d6-4ecdd857019c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magellan Cyclo 505 is powerful enough for professional and amateur cyclists alike, though its weak battery capacity is its Achilles heel.
