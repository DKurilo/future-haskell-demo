This affordable printer might be just what you want for your unique circumstances. While you can&#39;t expect an inexpensive, compact printer to deliver the exact same experience as larger, more expensive printers, the HP LaserJet Pro M102w manages to be a pretty decent basic black and white <a href=\"/best-laser-printers\">laser printer</a> that would be well-suited for users that only occasionally print documents, such as a student who lives in a dorm room or a consumer that has a home office.","The HP LaserJet Pro M102w is the smallest printer we reviewed and is one of the best compact laser printers on the market. The little desktop laser printer measures just 14.4 x 9.7 x 7.5 inches and weighs only 10.4 pounds, a fraction of the weight of top-rated laser printers.","The LaserJet Pro M102w produces passable printed documents, with readable text down to a 3-point font. But passable is a far cry from perfect, and we saw several noticeable errors in our test documents. In our text-heavy 10-page test document, we counted 32 print errors, with several pages speckled with pinprick-sized spots of unwanted ink. In the Excel print test, there was minor banding in charts and graphs as well as some unwanted bordering around the edges of color blocks. Printed images also seemed flatter than those produced by other black and white printers, with minimal variance in tones. Print speeds were also a bit disappointing compared to more expensive models, printing at 14 pages per minute, one of the slower printing speeds for black and white documents.","The printer uses a basic black toner cartridge which sells for $62.99 and has an estimated yield of 1,600 pages, working out to a per-page average cost of 4 cents. The printer&#39;s primary paper tray holds 150 pages, while a secondary tray holds up to 10 pages. That combined capacity of 160 pages is the smallest offered in any printer we reviewed, and you&#39;ll be refilling paper quite frequently as a result.","The printer&#39;s 10,000-page duty cycle is also the lowest in our review and suggests that this inexpensive printer won&#39;t be anywhere near as durable as the top-rated laser printers with ratings of 50,000 pages or more.","It&#39;s the only model in our review that doesn&#39;t have Ethernet connectivity, relying entirely on Wi-Fi for networking and mobile printing. The printer is compatible with the HP ePrint app and boasts support for Apple AirPlay, Google Cloud Print and Mopria mobile printing.","HP covers the LaserJet Pro M102w with a standard one-year warranty. Live support is available via phone, email and live chat through the HP website. Online support materials include an online manual, a troubleshooting guide and access to HP&#39;s customer forums to ask questions and browse past answers from tech support."]},"id":"342d7591-72d6-45dd-acc6-bb27165826e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a15290ad-10f5-453f-8874-a587c5dc05cf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP LaserJet Pro M102w isn&#39;t the best budget laser printer, but it&#39;s still worth considering.
