Because of its low airflow, this unit performs at its best in places like small bedrooms and workspace cubicles. It’s the most affordable unit we evaluated, costing around $130 – much less than the $150 average among the products we reviewed.","With an airflow rating of 250 cubic feet per minute (CFM), the EC45S isn’t close to being the most powerful portable evaporative cooler we reviewed, a distinction that goes to the <a href=\"/honeywell-review\">Honeywell CO60PM</a>. However, it can lower temperatures in small enclosed areas. According to Luma Comfort, the EC45S works well in spaces no larger than 100 square feet and may also be effective on small decks and patios. Since the Luma Comfort EC45S only uses 45 watts of power, it costs little to operate – around $4 for the summer months. As such, it can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional air conditioning.","The unit’s built-in caster wheels make it easy to move, even when its reservoir tank is full – although the tank only holds up to 1.6 gallons, so it isn’t too heavy. The EC45S’s tank fits tightly in place. However, it can be difficult to access, according to customer reviews we found during our research."]},"id":"d659934f-9761-4eae-8f1d-2246dc303c0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/7ky2UqqYTG8r479o7DNrV3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"With its sleek body and silver casing, the Luma Comfort EC45S blends into any home or office decor.
