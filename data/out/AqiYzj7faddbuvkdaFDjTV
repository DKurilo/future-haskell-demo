That comes to a total of 30,000 hours. The light will continue to work beyond the 30,000 hours, but you&#39;ll notice a decline in how bright it is. LED lamps slowly decline in how bright they are as they age. At 30,000 hours, LED lights give off 70 percent of the light they initially offer, which is the point at which you typically start noticing a decline in how bright the light is.","The L Prize competition tested the L Prize bulb to determine how much light it provides and the direction the light emits from the lamp. The tests also see how LED light bulbs respond to taxing conditions such as high humidity and temperature. It also assessed how long the bulb will last.","The Philips L Prize lamp works in temperatures between -4 and 109 degrees Fahrenheit. High temperatures are hard on the light-emitting diodes and can decrease their lifespan. For this reason, the L Prize energy efficient light cannot be in a fully enclosed fixture. Although it&#39;s pretty hearty in warm conditions, an enclosed fixture traps heat. For normal use in an open fixture, the metal heat sink plate, which is part of the bulb, helps to wick the heat away from the light-emitting diodes and keep the lamp cool. Even after the bulb is on for a while, it becomes warm but doesn&#39;t get nearly as hot as an incandescent bulb. Still, Philips urges that you turn the light off and wait for it to cool before removing it from the socket.","This light is UL listed in the U.S. and Canada. This means it meets the required standardized safety testing for both countries.

The bulb is similar in shape to a standard A19 bulb. However, the top is fairly flat. The maximum overall length (MOL) of the Philips lamp is 4.1 inches. We compared its length to a standard incandescent light bulb and found that the Philips LED is .15 inches shorter. The bulb diameter is 2.3 inches, which is practically the same diameter as the incandescent we compared it to. The LED bulb weighs 4.64 ounces. Most of this weight comes from the elements within the bulb that work to keep the light-emitting diodes cool. This LED bulb weighs almost 4 ounces more than its incandescent counterpart.

These grooves are for design purposes and may make it easier to handle when inserting the LED bulb into a socket. We noticed that when the light is on, these indented portions of the bulb don&#39;t light up, leaving three small dark vertical sections on the bulb. However, you won&#39;t notice these darker sections in the lighting in the room, even when this Philips LED lamp is the only source of light. This bulb gives off an even delivery of light, both horizontally and vertically. This light distribution is call omni-directional lighting and is comparable to the even spread of light that an incandescent provides.","The upper portion of the bulb has three yellow, remote phosphorous lenses. The light-emitting diodes in the bulb give off a bluish color. When the light passes through these yellow lenses, it changes the color of the light to a warm white. If you look at the LED light bulb when it is on, the yellow lenses appear white. The color of light this LED bulb supplies is warm and pleasant, similar to what you would expect from a soft white incandescent light bulb.","These energy efficient light bulbs turn on instantly, unlike CFLS that slowly warm up and increase in brightness. On a similar note, Philip designed this LED lamp to be dimmable with its leading edge dimming control system so that you can adjust the brightness of the lamp. With LED bulbs, you can turn on the light and adjust the brightness immediately without having to wait for the bulb to light up all the way before you can determine how much to dim it.","You can use this lights indoors as well as outdoors.
