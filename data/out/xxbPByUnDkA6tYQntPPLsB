We set up an obstacle course with medium-sized cereal pieces, long and wavy human hair, soft pet hair, breadcrumbs, kitty litter, flour, and papery garlic skins to see what the Roomba 880 would munch up and what it would ignore. After reading and studying the illustrations in the user manual, we expected to see this robot vacuum cleaner start out with a spiral cleaning pattern and then graduate to its wall-to-wall pattern, but it surprised us. It shot across the carpeted floor and appeared to “feel” its way around the room, picking up pieces of debris and dirt here and there. We watched as it made random passes from one room to another, back again and over a rug.

On hard flooring, this Roomba did very well – especially with breadcrumbs and cat litter. Although its brushes pushed some of the litter to the side, it returned to pick it up later. The Roomba 880 had some difficulty pulling up flour from a few different surfaces, but most of the robot vacuum cleaners had the same issue. Spot cleaning is a great way to quickly sweep up sudden messes, but sometimes you need to direct it to clean a spot more than once.","You can schedule the Roomba 880 to clean your whole house whenever you want, and if it doesn&#39;t finish the entirety of your home, it charges up at its home base and then returns where it left off to complete its task.

However, cleaning hair from the rollers was simple because of the Roomba 880&#39;s rubber roller design – the hair it collected that did not go to the bin bunched up and moved down the long texturized rollers to the ends where we simply pulled off two rings of compacted hair and tossed them into the trash can.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/66691-irobot-roomba-88019.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EYkUqcGPt9kgZx3dhhR92T.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"EYkUqcGPt9kgZx3dhhR92T","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EYkUqcGPt9kgZx3dhhR92T.jpg","alt":""},"id":"3f346944-125d-4b2a-adaa-c88e714ac6d2","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can quickly and easily move this robot vacuum to another room with a quick lift on its handle, and it weighs less than 9 pounds, so it&#39;s easy for almost anyone to transport it.

Once it finishes, the beam will turn off and allow the Roomba to pass and clean the next room in its path.
