With plenty of features and a comfortable design, they make a good fit for everyone who likes the standout fashion statement made by the bright colors and skull logo.","Skullycandy&#39;s Chops In-Ears feature soft-touch rubber earhooks that slide into place to grip the back of your ear. The hooks are adjustable, which allows you to change the size based on your ear shape. The sports earbuds sit over the top of the ear for a comfortable fit, but they do not come with additional eartips for a custom fit. This is a design flaw if you have small or large ears because the earbuds may not be comfortable and may not seal properly in your ears. This affects audio quality as well as fit because you do not get the same audio without a proper seal.","The large 9-millimeter speakers offer quality audio, which you can control using the inline remote. The microphone and remote allow you to play, pause and skip tracks. You can also accept calls without taking your phone out of your pocket by using the microphone. The remote is not compatible with every phone but does work with iOS and most Android models.","With no sweat resistance or water resistance rating, the sports earbuds are not suitable for running in the rain. They are also too large to fit well under helmets, which is a disadvantage if you want to use them while cycling. Because they do not have a clip, the headphones are not ideal for running because the cord can bounce around and tangle easily, although you can purchase a third-party clip for them.","The sport earbuds come in a number of bright colors. They also feature a 3.9-foot cord, which is a suitable length for tucking a phone into your pocket without discomfort or pulling. The lack of an adjustable neckpiece means that you have to work with the size, whether or not it is a good fit.","While lacking in several features such as water resistance, the Skullcandy Chops In-Ear sports earbuds make a fashion statement if you want to stand out. The large design fits well over the ears and is comfortable. All in all, they are fashionable and most suited for use at the gym."]},"id":"bc63f899-3a27-42e7-831b-a34dcbde5af7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63404","url":"/skullcandy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T21:49:25Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T21:49:25Z","name":"Skullcandy Chops Buds In-Ear Mic Earbuds","synopsis":"The Skullcandy Chops In-Ear sports earbuds feature a large over-the-ear hook to secure the earbuds in place, an inline microphone and a remote control.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Skullcandy Chops In-Ear sports earbuds feature a large over-the-ear hook to secure the earbuds in place, an inline microphone and a remote control.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-10T21:49:25Z","id":"yVWDeA8urn5JjoUdWQVLVa","meta":{"title":"Skullcandy Chops Buds In-Ear Mic Earbuds Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Skullcandy Chops In-Ear sports earbuds feature an inline remote, over-the-ear hooks and a microphone.
