You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Many <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital cameras for kids</a> have special features that set them apart from the competition. The Dora the Explorer Talking Digital Camera from Sakar also has its own unique feature – you guessed it, it talks. Considering that talking is a large part of Dora&#39;s show, it&#39;s a fitting feature. Unfortunately, unless your child is a Dora the Explorer fan, there&#39;s not much else about this camera that would cause kids to choose it over something else on our lineup.","While many cameras offer games, editing and effects to help keep kids engaged, this camera doesn&#39;t even have a true display. In order to view anything that you capture with this camera, you have to install the included software on your computer and then use it to extract the images from your camera.","But features and games aren&#39;t the only areas where this camera lags behind. It&#39;s also one of the least durable, lowest-capacity, least intuitive cameras in our review. It&#39;s constructed almost entirely of plastic with no reinforcements, holds only 52 images, and has menu items represented by two letters on a small monochrome LCD that you navigate using only its on/off and shutter release buttons.","The few features it does have, however, can be pretty useful. There&#39;s a video recording mode, continuous shooting for capturing consecutive images, and a self-timer for capturing images remotely. Unfortunately, the image quality of this camera is relatively poor, so even these features suffer compared to the competition.","Sakar backs up all of its cameras in our review with a one-year warranty that covers any defects in craftsmanship or materials. You can get support for your camera over the phone, by email, or by simply consulting the user manual that comes with the camera."]},"id":"59f59498-2d1a-4644-8450-330bdf2e807b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aa2e3182-1919-4e0e-a7ce-5c20f9787793","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are many cameras, even those of comparable price, whose features, design and performance are superior to the Dora the Explorer Talking Camera.
