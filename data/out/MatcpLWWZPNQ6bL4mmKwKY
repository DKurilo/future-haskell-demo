This company typically seeks customers with budgets on their minds. LifeShield services match those of its competitors, and the company offers decent technical support. The warranty is underpowered when compared to other companies.","LifeShield offers three monitoring plans: Security Essentials, Security Advantage and Security Professional. Each plan comes with a base station, control panel, keypad, key fob, motion sensor, smoke detector, yard sign and two window decals. This makes the basic security package more impressive than those of most competitors. The number of door and window sensors you receive depends on the plan you choose. The Security Advantage plan, for example, gives you six door and window sensors, which is the most you can get in our review before starting costs go up.","The Security Advantage package also includes a home security camera with 250MB of cloud storage. This amount of cloud storage is respectable when compared to other companies in our review. LifeShield&#39;s security camera has high quality 720p HD resolution. The indoor surveillance camera has a night vision range of 15 feet, which is the weakest of the cameras we reviewed. LifeShield only offers one type of surveillance camera, which limits options for placement and capabilities.","You can access the LifeShield mobile app on tablets and smartphones to view live video or recorded footage. The app lets you change access codes, receive notifications and arm or disarm your security system. The self-installation process is very easy, but you can pay extra for professional installation if you prefer.","LifeShield&#39;s online support is decent if you&#39;re a current customer or a potential user. The support team can be reached via phone and email. There are also FAQs and tutorials to help you customize your equipment and troubleshoot problems. The flaw in LifeShield&#39;s help and support is that the company only provides a one-year warranty on its security cameras and detectors. That short time frame holds it back from ranking much higher."]},"id":"3ecb1112-467e-47c2-95f3-d5fcc1586e0e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5196e5c0-e82d-4b37-9ac0-5dd3f43f8e38","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With more updates to its equipment, such as a wider variety of cameras, LifeShield might compete better with other security providers.
