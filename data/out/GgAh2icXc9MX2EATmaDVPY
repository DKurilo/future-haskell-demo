This is only a poolside camera, as it cannot handle any other kind of abuse. In the correct shooting environments, it takes good pictures, usually at the same quality as smartphones and affordable cameras. Unfortunately, it does not give you many of the tools we prefer when looking for vacation cameras, like image stabilization and GPS tagging.","The WP16 Splash2 is waterproof, but it does not have any other durability rating. Even its waterproofing is limited to pool usage. It can handle a maximum depth of 10 feet for an hour. After that, you need to let the camera dry for about 10 minutes before using it again. While this is a standard depth for pools, it is not great if you are going snorkeling. It will be hard to swim around coral if you’re constantly worried about the camera breaking. On top of that, it is not freezeproof, shockproof, crushproof or dustproof.","The camera is capable of producing some good images, but its 16MP image sensor is a little misleading. Its maximum resolution is 16MP after computerized interpolation, a process in which the computer fills in pixels by using mathematical formulas to interpret existing pixel colors. Without the interpolation, the camera’s maximum effective pixels are 5MP, which is incredibly low when compared to any other camera. Still, as long as you set the camera to its maximum settings, it will produce clear images, even if a computer filled several of the pixels in.","The Bell+Howell WP16 Splash2 is also light on features. It can film in 720p, and it does have a small set of picture effects for you to use before taking a picture. However, it lacks many standard features that we want in an underwater camera, including image stabilization, panoramic imaging, Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS tagging. One of its better features is its smile shutter, a setting that won’t take a picture until your subject smiles. This is a good alternative to the included self-timer, if you don’t like waiting several seconds for the camera to take a picture."]},"id":"c84e8863-3bd9-4877-ae47-c56635ce53b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"37601dc7-5068-4199-a8cb-f5948ac87451","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bell+Howell WP16 Splash2 is a good poolside camera, but its waterproofing is too weak to handle deep-water activities, like snorkeling.
