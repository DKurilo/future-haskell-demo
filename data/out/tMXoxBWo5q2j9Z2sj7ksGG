You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","eCare+Voice is a water-resistant <a href=\"/best-gps-medical-alert-systems\">medical alert system with GPS</a>, so you can take it in the shower with you. This unit is also one of the few comparable GPS units to offer volume control, so you can lower or raise the call volume as needed.","When you need help, you press the button on the front of the device to send a call to the 24/7 monitoring center. The unit also sends your last known GPS location, so the responder knows where you are in case he or she needs to send emergency help. The representative can communicate with you over the two-way communication speaker, a standard feature in all GPS medical alert units.","So long as you are within an area covered by T-Mobile, the cellular network that eCare+Voice uses, you will be able to place an emergency call. You and your family members also have access to an online web portal where you can track the unit&#39;s last known location on a map. You can also access tracking information by texting a number to have the location sent to you via text message.","The battery on this GPS medical alert unit is advertised to last up to 120 hours, or four days, on standby. Overall battery life in real-world usage varies based on the cellular signal strength in your area, as weaker signal strength means the unit drains battery faster searching for and maintaining a signal.","The eCare+Voice unit comes with a wall charger that you connect to the device through a mini USB port. For those with poor eyesight or other health problems, such as arthritis, this can make it more difficult to charge the device correctly. You can purchase an optional charging pad; this unit lets you rest the GPS mobile device on the charging pad surface to recharge."]},"id":"61a0fdf5-b58a-4ff4-a54d-5d597b5d0f58","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3ebe07ff-9437-4e95-b991-f8f56412e059","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["eCare+Voice offers convenient tracking features for you and your loved ones to accompany its GPS medical alert system unit.
