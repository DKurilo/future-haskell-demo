The meat was tender and the broth relatively flavorful. We found it somewhat difficult to ladle out the stew – especially compared to the similarly sized <a href=\"/elite-by-maxi-matic-review\">2-quart Elite by Maxi-Matic</a> – because the bowl was so narrow and deep. The same would go for any meat-intensive dishes, since they are heavy and hard to scoop around. You wouldn&#39;t have this problem with a soup or nacho cheese recipe, though. However, no matter what you make, you will want to have a small ladle to make the scooping process easier. ","In our evaporation test, this device only lost 10 percent of moisture on the high setting and 3 percent of moisture on the low setting. With these numbers, it&#39;s likely that your food won&#39;t dry out during cooking, as long as you place a good amount of liquid inside. The exterior of the device was 140 degrees Fahrenheit above the settings knob and 154 degrees by the handles. The handles were just a little warm during our cooking sessions but you could easily lift the device without burning your fingers. These are neither the hottest nor the coolest temperatures we measured. But, like any slow cooker, you&#39;ll want to keep it away from pets and children.","You will find 10 recipes in the included instruction manual. If you happen to lose the manual, you can find these recipes and the instructions on Crock-Pot&#39;s website."]},"id":"1224a03c-16d5-4f13-a7d7-566e92f04857","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/zQpBwtMzVonCdpCwnfmiY6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Since this is such a basic slow cooker, there are no included accessories.
