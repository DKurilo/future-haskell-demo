Strangely, it has trouble with thinner carpets and doesn&#39;t perform well on tile or hard floors. If you have a house full of traditional carpet this will work fine for you, though.","We tested the Eureka on different surfaces, including low- and medium-pile carpet and hard floors using different materials, such as flour and kitty litter, to test the suction power of each vacuum. The Eureka performed great on medium-pile carpet, which is the most common type for households. It was one of the best-performing budget vacuums at removing pet hair. The suction from the 10-amp motor dug into thick carpet and removed all of the fine pet hairs that cling to carpet fibers. However, we weren&#39;t as impressed with its performance on thin carpet. The vacuum had trouble grabbing kitty litter with its brush roll and left a lot of debris behind. For something with more suction on low carpeting, consider the <a href=\"/hoover-tempo-review\">Hoover Tempo</a>.","One positive with this affordable vacuum is how nice it looks and how well it moves. Despite lacking a more maneuverable swivel head, the wheels glide smoothly on all surfaces and turn quickly. Weighing 8 pounds, this ties for being the lightest vacuum we tested. It was easy to carry it up and down stairs and maneuvering around obstacles was effortless. When you&#39;re done, the Eureka is compact and fits neatly in the back of a closet.","This is a bagless vacuum with a dust cup attached to the front. The cup is clear, but you still need to guess when it&#39;s completely full as there is no indicator light. The dust cup clips off, but debris tends to clump inside and doesn&#39;t come out easily. You’ll have to use a tool or reach inside with your hands to empty it completely. At 92 decibels, this is one of the noisier models we tested.","The Eureka has a full range of extra attachments that are all housed on the unit. The extension wand and detachable hose give you a lot of extra length for reaching dusty ceiling corners or high curtains. It lacks an upholstery tool, though you can use the dusting brush on couches and other furniture.","This vacuum comes with a standard one-year warranty, which is below average for the category. Some competing units offer more coverage."]},"id":"96cc1c68-574d-4363-816a-b9272b45fed5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f217f48d-dbef-423f-b771-1eb9d9d0d581","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For households with thicker carpets or pet hair and dander, the Eureka AS One is a great value.
