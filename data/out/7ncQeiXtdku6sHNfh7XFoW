You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","Panasonic&#39;s KX-TGH263B <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless telephone</a> is slim and smart. It looks great on a countertop and has two included handsets. It has most of the features that you need to use as a business tool or help keep in touch with family and friends.","This cordless phone has an average talk time of 10 hours. In standby mode, the phone will last for six days, which is a lot less than other phones. The best cordless home phones have a standby time around 10 days. It takes seven hours to charge these handsets, which is average.","You can add an additional three handsets, which is enough to cover a big home or a medium-sized office. Although there isn&#39;t a dock or USB port to charge your cellphone with this model, you can still make and receive phone calls with your smartphone. You can connect two different cell phones to the cordless phone via Bluetooth and even pair a wireless Bluetooth headset if you want. The call quality is crystal clear and is much higher in quality than if you were to make a phone call directly on your cell phone.","When the phone is paired with your smartphone, you can be alerted when you receive a text message. However, you cannot open and read the messages or respond to them using the handset.","The handsets are quite small and have tiny buttons, which can make it difficult to dial. The handsets light up, so the controls are easy to see in the dark. The screens on the handsets are bright, but the text isn&#39;t as large as it is on other cordless phones. The handsets store 3,000 entries in the phonebook and remember the last 50 callers. You can also redial the last five numbers you input.","The included warranty for these cordless phones lasts one year. You can reach out to Panasonic by telephone, email or online chat if you have any problems with your handsets or the base. Also, you are free to download the instruction manual on Panasonic&#39;s website or read its FAQs page online."]},"id":"d586546f-d87b-48c8-a269-05f3890222ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6905105e-f360-4dd8-9384-8111fe85a817","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic KX-PRL262B is a decent phone, but it is lacking some useful features like a speakerphone.
