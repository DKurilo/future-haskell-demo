Unfortunately, this mower brings up the rear of our best push lawn mowers buying guide, because it failed nearly every test we put it through.","Judging by specs alone, this <a href=\"/best-lawnmowers-review\">reel lawnmower</a> may look like one of the best choices. However, in practice it was the most frustrating machine that we tested. During our tests, we tracked how often the push mowers jammed on a 10’ x 10’ stretch of debris-free grass, and when the LawnMaster reached 10, we stopped counting.","Most non-gas-powered-mowers stop if they encounter something they can’t cut, like a twig or a rock. This mower even jammed on the very grass it was supposed to cut. Even at its highest cut-length setting, it simply did not perform anywhere near our expectations. No other mower we tested had this problem.","Moreover, it took 20 passes over our sample area to effectively cut the grass. This is the most passes to cut a 10’ x 10’ portion of lawn of any product we reviewed. However, while it required extra effort it took to cut the grass, it did yield consistent results. The tallest uncut grass in our test patch measured 5 inches tall. When we were done, the grass was a nice and even 2.5 inches on all but one of our measuring points, which measured a trivial half inch taller. This reel lawnmower can cut grass as short as 1 1/3 inches.","This reel mower advertises a 16-inch cutting path. We usually found that the advertised cutting width was about an inch short of reality, but this is not the case with the LawnMaster. You really will get a full 16 inches of cut grass in each pass.","One area where this push mower excels is how quiet it is compared to the other products we reviewed. While in use, the loudest this mower got was 76 decibels. Compared to the average 90 decibels, you won’t have any complaints from the neighbors if you decide to mow your lawn in the evening or early in the morning.","If you decide to buy this lawnmower, keep your expectations low. It’s probably best to keep this one as a backup mower in case your regular one breaks down. There are some ways to hack the mower so that it doesn’t jam up so much; unfortunately doing so voids your warranty, and if you don’t know what you’re doing, you could permanently damage your machine. On the plus side, once you get the hang of it, you can expect a nice trim and evenly cut lawn."]},"id":"27d8970e-3d4b-4c36-b248-39be34ccd694","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64526","url":"/lawnmaster-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
