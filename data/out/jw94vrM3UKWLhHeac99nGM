But if you need a little assistance in the artistic realm, this may not be the software you’re looking for. The best photo collage programs usually give users more options to decorate their collages.","PhotoMix’s learning curve is steep. Every feature in this photo collage program has a unique button with an image explaining the tool. We found it difficult to determine what the symbols meant and had to hover over each one to learn its purpose. It took a while to get the hang of things when we reviewed this collage making software. This can delay your projects if you need a system you can quickly learn. Once you’ve chosen a template, you can drag and drop uploaded pictures into the collage. The program doesn’t have an auto-fill option, so you have to do all the legwork on your own. If you want a program that is easier to use, you might want to consider <a href=\"/picture-collage-maker-pro-review\">Picture Collage Maker Pro</a>.","There are some photo-correction features missing from the software that we would like to have seen. You cannot crop photos or remove red eye with PhotoMix, which will make photos with people in them harder to edit. There is also no video or music compatibility, so you cannot incorporate either into your multimedia projects.","We were quite impressed with PhotoMix’s export options, which are on par with the best collage software. While you can’t automatically send completed photo collages to your blog or Facebook, you can save them in a number of file types to use as you please. You can save your collage to your hard drive as a JPEG, TIF, GIF, BMP, PSD or PNG. You can also set the image as your desktop wallpaper, send it via email or print it.","Online assistance is available on PhotoMix’s website. It has step-by-step tutorials and answers to FAQs. There is no phone number to contact customer support, but an email form is available. We wish PhotoMix were more customer friendly in its support options by connecting to its users via a blog or Facebook, which the best collage software programs do."]},"id":"0e229c99-5d81-4316-aa2f-0e91de7488f3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"72c44ab8-6d75-42f4-a7d4-79f2471be878","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["PhotoMix has templates so you can easily  drag and drop pictures to create a collage, but there is no personality behind it.
