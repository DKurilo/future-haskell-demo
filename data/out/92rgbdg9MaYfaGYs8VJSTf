You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Redcat Racing&#39;s Tremor ST a hobby-grade RC truck that&#39;s smaller in size and cost than most. Although it is less expensive, it retains the majority of features you&#39;d expect from a hobby-grade vehicle. Due to its smaller size, it&#39;s a great option for kids who aren&#39;t quite ready to handle the heft of larger <a href=\"/best-remote-control-cars\">radio controlled cars</a>. Its size also makes it a great option for driving indoors. Large wheels and a powerful engine mean it&#39;s also more than capable of off-roading.","The Tremor RC monster truck comes ready to run, with no need to put anything together. All you&#39;ll need to do is charge its lithium ion battery using the included charger and you&#39;re ready to go. With a top speed of 20 miles per hour, four-wheel drive and a full suspension, the Tremor is well suited for a wide assortment of terrain. You can take it off jumps, over rocks or on the road for a well-rounded RC driving experience.","Because it is smaller than other off-roading models, it will have more trouble with larger obstacles. Four-wheel drive helps a lot with this. However, its suspension is of lower quality than more expensive RC cars, operating solely on springs without oil-filled shocks. This means you might bottom out a little more often, which could lead to more frequent breakages. The small size and lack of waterproofing features also hurt the durability of this truck. Although it handles abuse fairly well, it just can&#39;t keep up to the same standards of larger and more expensive options.","The remote included with this model is a 2.4GHz pistol-grip transmitter. This transmitter supports digital proportional steering and throttle, which gives you direct control of how sharply you turn and how quick you drive. It requires three AA batteries that are not included with this model.","As a part of the company&#39;s comprehensive support, Redcat Racing offers a 90-day warranty on the Tremor&#39;s electronics and covers any out of the box manufacture defects. On the company&#39;s website, you can find a downloadable user manual complete with maintenance instructions, parts lists, repair guides and more. If anything should break on your Tremor, Redcat offers extensive part support. The manufacturer also offers upgrades for the Tremor, such as oil-filled shocks, that increase the durability and functionality of the truck."]},"id":"3f6559fa-7fc6-40c2-9224-031779ac6104","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5378dadb-9def-4845-8ea6-9946073d8c71","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, Redcat Racing&#39;s Tremor ST is a solid choice for an RC truck.
