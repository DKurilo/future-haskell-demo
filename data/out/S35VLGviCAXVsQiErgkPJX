The original review is below, but check out our current </em><a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\"><em>GPS Trackers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Securus eZoom is a versatile GPS tracker that can help you keep track of your kids, valuables and more. It uses a combination of GPS and T-Mobile coverage to track the eZoom, so you&#39;ll want to make sure you&#39;re in an area with good T-Mobile coverage before you make this purchase. T-Mobile&#39;s network is not as extensive as those of some other cell phone providers.","The eZoom weighs just under 3 ounces and is about 2.3 inches tall. It has a tough, water-resistant exterior that can withstand your kids banging it around. You can also buy an auto installation kit that allows you to leave the eZoom plugged into the car at all times.","This GPS tracker has three modes of operation. In continuous mode, the device updates its location every five minutes. This is the default mode of the tracker. In track mode, the device updates every 30 seconds. In on-demand mode, the tracker only updates when you request its location. The battery life varies wildly based on the mode you put the device in. In on-demand mode, you can get up to 21 days of battery life from the eZoom, although if you&#39;re using the device in continuous mode, the battery life decreases to a few days.","You track this GPS tracker using either the app or the Securus web portal. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices, and you can access the web portal from any internet browser. You can create zones called SafeSpots in the web portal, and the eZoom sends you text or email alerts when the device is leaving or entering a zone. This can help you ensure your kids are in a safe area, or staying away from an unsafe area.","An emergency button on the tracker automatically sends alerts with the tracker&#39;s location to the email address or phone number of your choice. Some competing devices feature voice calling, which is a better option for an emergency button. One of the eZoom&#39;s most unusual features sends an alert the instant the device is moved. This feature is especially useful for protecting your car. If you have a teenage driver, you can set a maximum speed limit for the device and place it in their car. If the car goes over that limit, the device sends you an alert.","The eZoom works on T-Mobile&#39;s network, and you agree to a 12-month contract with monthly fees when you purchase the device. Additionally, there is an activation fee to begin service.","Securus offers a one-year warranty on the eZoom, as well as email and phone support. The representative we spoke to patiently answered all our questions about the product."]},"id":"ba86ec07-e563-4eca-9d77-5d47a4127de0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4f433212-251e-4b9d-ba8a-85f2aeed0cc3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Securus eZoom is a versatile GPS tracker that helps you keep track of your loved ones and possessions.
