Many coolers are designed for desk use only, but this one has an ergonomic wedge design and a soft neoprene covering, so it is comfortable enough to use on your lap.","This wedge design also elevates the fans off the surface the cooling pad rests on, so you can use it on soft or uneven surfaces without restricting airflow to the fans. Whether you like to use your laptop in bed or on your lap, this cooling pad keeps it from getting too hot. The Lap Chill Mat puts so much focus on versatility and comfort that it doesn’t have the best cooling performance. Its fans aren&#39;t as powerful as those in laptop coolers that make cooling their primary focus. While the Targus serves its purpose well, another model may be better if you need to cool your laptop while you game or edit videos.","You can’t adjust the mat’s height, but it does have a slight incline and doesn’t hurt your wrists when you type. The cooler has four rubber feet that keep your laptop securely in place. There is a USB cord attached to the back of the cooler. It&#39;s secure, so there is no risk of it falling out if you accidentally bump it. Unlike the best laptop coolers, the Lap Chill Mat doesn&#39;t have an extra USB port to make up for occupying one on your laptop. Still, keeping your laptop cool and protected from overheating is worth the loss.","Targus offers a one-year warranty on the Lap Chill Mat, and the company’s website has downloadable user manuals and a FAQs page. These two options are quick ways to get answers to your questions. Another way to get immediate answers is Targus’ live chat support, which is efficient and helpful. We were able to get our questions answered with little wait time."]},"id":"1a8f0d84-2fe3-460f-a775-ac42ce5e26c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"57fcc7cb-74c5-4440-9f0c-0717d8665ed1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even without adjustable height, the Targus Lap Chill Mat is one of the most comfortable cooling pads available.
