This company boasts many unique slings, including a full organic line, reversible water slings and fleece slings.","These baby slings have no rings, buckles or straps to adjust or tie. You just fold the sling in half with the built-in pocket on the outside to create a pouch and slip it over your head, and you are ready to go. Karma Baby Slings are designed for newborns who weigh at least 8 pounds all the way up to toddlers who weigh as much as 35 pounds. As your baby grows, you can switch between five carrying styles for better comfort for you both. The sling is machine washable for added convenience. If you are interested in getting a wrap that uses buckles, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">Zolowear Pleated Cotton Sling</a>.Â ","Depending on the type of Karma Baby sling you choose, you may have multiple colors or patterns to choose from, so there is plenty of variety to please Mom and Dad alike. Karma Baby has a number of fabric options too. A fleece version is super soft and perfect for keeping your baby warm during chilly months. There&#39;s also a water sling for use in the pool or shower, which dries in minutes. It is made with Solerveil material that is breathable but blocks up to 95 percent of the sun&#39;s rays. In addition, Karma Baby offers a &#34;casual&#34; line of standard cotton baby slings. Another option is the exclusive organic line. These slings are made from an environmentally friendly material free of chemicals and pesticides.","For newborns to 10-month-olds, Karma Baby recommends the cradle carry position, which is also convenient for breastfeeding. Older babies will be comfortable in the tummy-to-tummy, kangaroo or hip carry positions, while toddlers 18 months and older enjoy the piggyback-style carry. An instructional video on the Karma Baby website demonstrates the cradle, hip and tummy-to-tummy carry methods, and the site also provides written step-by-step instructions for all five positions.","Though the website provides a few important safety tips, it lacks detailed warnings and useful illustrations on correct and incorrect positioning to help you keep your baby safe and secure. If you purchase a baby sling from this company, you can return it within 30 days of purchase, but it must be unused and unwashed, and you must pay a restocking fee for all returns."]},"id":"42238141-6561-4e94-92f7-f2bf81e136fb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58777","url":"/karma-baby-organic-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-03T23:52:11Z","datePublished":"2014-02-03T23:52:11Z","name":"Karma Baby Organic","synopsis":"Karma Baby provides numerous baby slings for you and your little one.
