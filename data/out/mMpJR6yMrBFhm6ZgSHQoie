The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-washer-dryer-combos\">Washer Dryer Combos</a> here</em>.","The Ariston ARWDF129 washer dryer combo has a small, compact frame that fits in tight spots. It’s made to roll out and hook to a faucet, so it is a good unit for smaller apartments or cabins that don’t have hookups. It also has a nice variety of both washer settings and drying functions.","It’s one of the best washer dryers for space efficiency, which means it has a small footprint without sacrificing overall capacity. This isn’t a washer dryer combo that a large family should use as their main washing source, but it’s a good choice for couples or vacation units.","It also has 14 washing cycles, tying for the most in our lineup. One big concern is that, despite its size, it isn’t an energy efficient unit. It is not Energy Star certified and can cost you more on your electric bills compared to other washer dryer combos.","This combination washer dryer didn’t make sacrifices regarding its drying capabilities. A lot of small units only allow timed drying, but the Ariston has preprogrammed settings and the ability to change temperatures. You also have control over the soil setting, meaning that the washer treats heavily soiled laundry differently than a regular wash.","The display in the front of the machine is lacking. It doesn’t have a full digital display and only tells you how much time is left in the cycle. The door is wide and spacious, giving you the clearance you need during loading, and the machine comes with noise vibration reduction. This means quiet cycles, a necessity in a smaller home.","Ariston has a variety of support options on its website, despite the fact that navigation is difficult. The warranty is standard; the company offers a one-year warranty on parts, labor, drum and motor. Comparatively, the best washer dryer combos have warranties as high as 10 years on the motor and a lifetime warranty on the drum."]},"id":"7693a365-a597-41c3-a925-c37170960dc5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"222f23bb-c786-469f-8e7a-e22cd41ecf15","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ariston is a versatile machine that packs a lot of cycles into its design.
