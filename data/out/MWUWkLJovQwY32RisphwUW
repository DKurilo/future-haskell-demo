You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information."," Pandigital is taking a leap of faith by releasing their eReader, the Pandigital Novel. One of the top names in digital photo frames, Pandigital uses their knowledge of digital screens by creating an <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader</a> with a TFT LCD color screen, an average memory capacity and Wi-Fi capability.","From their success with digital photo frames, Pandigital knows how to create a display screen with impressive features and they proved that once again with the Novel. This eReader has a 7-inch LCD color touchscreen, which is relatively large for eBook readers, aside from models such as the Kindle DX. With full touchscreen capabilities, the Novel features a virtual keyboard that can be difficult to use. The only problem with an LCD screen is that after an hour or so your eyes will begin to burn as if you were looking at a computer monitor. E-ink is the primary display type because it is easy on the eyes and is a must for a good eBook reader. Another drawback to the Novel is its weight. The Novel is not a one-handed eBook reader, or one that can be held for long periods of time. It weighs 16 ounces (which is one pound), just big enough to make you feel a bit of a strain after reading for quite some time.","The Novel can lend content via the LendMe feature. This allows users to share eBooks with friends and family for up to 14 days. However, while the book is lent out, the owner cannot read the book. This really shouldn’t be that big of a deal because if one was to lend a paperback book, they couldn’t read the book at the exact time as the borrower.","The Novel has access to browse and shop eBooks from Barnes and Noble. The device also has access to more than half a million free classics. The eBook reader supports PDF, ePUB and HTML formats.","The Novel comes with 1GB of internal memory. This will hold oodles of books, however, if you are the avid reader, the Novel also offers SD card support up to 32GB. This will allow you to choose from thousands of eBooks all found right in your hand.","The battery life of the Novel is approximately six hours while in reading mode. It is drastically less than the Kindle’s battery which doesn’t have to be recharged for days. This Pandigital device does run off an Android Operating System and is compatible with Windows 2000, Vista/7 and Mac OS X.","Features to make reading easier and more enjoyable are abundant in this eReader. The Novel offers a built-in dictionary, word search, multiple bookmarks and even text highlighting. This can make studying or just reading for pleasure a more satisfying experience.","Users are able to access the Internet on the Novel. Featuring Wi-Fi capabilities, email access and a web browser, access to surf the Internet is a possibility. The ability to listen to music, watch videos and play games are also available on the Novel. Of course, you can’t have a Pandigital product without having a digital photo frame. The eReader comes with digital photo playback functions and becomes a photo if placed in the desktop stand that is included with the device."]},"id":"6bfd5256-a336-4cfb-99ce-4690cdee2373","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0282d8d6-bef3-4135-9216-3e9acb618699","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though Pandigital hasn’t perfected the eReader industry yet, they made a good impression with their first eReading device.
