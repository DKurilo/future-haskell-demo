What this means is that businesses that didn&#39;t upgrade their systems to process credit cards using EMV chip technology are liable for any counterfeit fraud that originated at their point of sale with chip credit cards. This regulation, commonly referred to as the EMV liability shift, was put into place to encourage the widespread acceptance of EMV chip cards, which have been proven to reduce this type of credit card fraud.","The familiar magnetic stripe on <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit cards</a> uses 1960s technology that&#39;s easily hacked by thieves with the right equipment. The microchip is far more complex and difficult to hack. The United States has lagged behind other developed nations in adopting the new technology because updating to new systems and equipment is an expensive undertaking and both the banks issuing credit cards and the merchants accepting them resisted the move. Most believed that the country&#39;s existing security protocols were good enough to thwart major attacks and many wanted to wait for the next generation of credit card security, since EMV has been used for many years in more than 80 countries. However, as counterfeit credit card fraud continued to rise in the U.S. and decrease in countries using EMV technology, it became evident that the U.S. needed to adopt EMV technology.","<strong>EMV Liability: Deadlines &amp; Conversion Progress<br/></strong> Most businesses had until October 1, 2015, to transition to EMV before assuming liability for fraud, but only about half had actually done so even a year later. Merchants with ATMs and fuel pumps have a little more time to upgrade their systems. MasterCard&#39;s deadline for ATMs is October 1, 2016, and Visa&#39;s deadline is October 1, 2017. Gas pump merchants have until October 1, 2020, until their card readers are required to accept chip cards.","Despite the time extension on the liability shift for ATMs, the changeover has been slow. According to a MasterCard estimate quoted in the Chicago Tribune, only 20 percent of ATMs had been adapted to accept EMV chip cards as of September 2016, and this number may only increase to 35 percent by the October 1st deadline.","<strong>An Expensive Upgrade<br/></strong> Merchants with ATMs and gas pumps were given extensions on the liability deadline because the card readers are integrated into the machines, making it substantially more expensive to upgrade than most retail point-of-sale systems.","According to the Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing, retooling a gas pump with EMV chip-reading technology costs between $6,000 and $10,000 per pump.  In addition, the gas pumps are logistically more difficult to upgrade because they&#39;re highly regulated, and after the new technology is installed, local authorities must inspect and recertify every pump. It&#39;s estimated the fuel industry will spend $3.9 billion retooling the country&#39;s 800,000 fuel pumps.","There are 425,000 ATM machines that need to be re-tooled, with each running between $2,000 and $5,000 each to refit with the new EMV-compliant card readers.","<strong>The Consequences of Noncompliance &amp; What&#39;s to Come<br/></strong> It may seem odd that businesses are resisting EMV compliance, but for many merchants, the perceived risk doesn&#39;t justify the expense. As noted in the EMV Migration Forum report, the liability shift isn&#39;t a mandate. Merchants don&#39;t have to install the new technology, but those that don&#39;t risk being held liable for in-person counterfeit fraud perpetrated at their point of sale. Many merchants are willing to take the risk.","However, as more and more businesses move to EMV technology, the risk of being targeted for fraud increases for those who continue with the outdated magnetic stripe readers.

However, as the deadlines near and more businesses take the plunge, the pressure – and the risks of noncompliance – increase. Most likely, once enough businesses convert to EMV technology, the rest will follow suit. The Senior Vice President of MasterCard, Bruce Owens, told the Chicago Tribune that that &#34;tipping point&#34; is likely to be 60 percent and may happen as soon as the first half of 2017."]},"id":"88c8eae3-d1ad-42b7-ab4b-4e391057f5e9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10119","url":"/emv-atm-pump","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-30T16:38:40Z","datePublished":"2016-09-30T16:38:40Z","name":"EMV Liability for Fuel Pumps and ATMs: The Roadmap to Compliance","synopsis":"In October 2015, credit card companies changed their regulations so that fraud liability shifted to the party with the least secure system.","review":{},"strapline":"In October 2015, credit card companies changed their regulations so that fraud liability shifted to the party with the least secure system.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-12-02T17:42:52Z","id":"j2wFNvWmmFyyLX8FDCX6PW","meta":{"title":"EMV Liability for Fuel Pumps and ATMs: The Roadmap to Compliance","description":"EMV liability for ATMs and fuel pumps fully shifts to merchants on October 1, 2017.
