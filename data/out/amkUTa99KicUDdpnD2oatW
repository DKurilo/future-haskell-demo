If you want to install your own equipment, Brinks will program it and send it to your home with tutorials – you only have to place it and turn it on.

For no-fee cancellation, you can return equipment within 30 days of when you sign your contract. The company's cheapest monitoring plan, Brinks Home Complete, costs $29 a month, which is more affordable than the $37 average among home security providers.

As such, we will continue to maintain separate reviews for ADT and LifeShield until further notice.","*On Feb. 4, 2019, Nest announced that it’s <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/nest-secure-google-assistant/\">bringing built-in Google Assistant voice controls to Nest Secure</a> via a software update to the Nest Guard base station. Although this functionality doesn’t completely make up for Nest Secure’s high starting costs, it makes the device a little more appealing. It can be used to arm your security system, but it doesn’t have a voice-activated disarm option, which intruders could manipulate to enter your home. The Nest Guard&#39;s ability to serve the same role as a Google Home Mini makes it an excellent option for controlling other smart home devices that are compatible with Google Assistant. Nest Secure is compatible with optional Brinks monitoring.","UPDATE: Since the announcement, Google has been criticized for not disclosing the Nest Secure’s built-in microphone when the device was first released. Google has apologized for this by indicating it was unintentionally left off the unit’s specifications and has corrected the issue on its product page for the Nest Secure.

The prices we discuss in this guide are the minimum you can expect from a particular company for cellular monitoring that doesn&#39;t use a landline. You also need to consider any taxes, fees and equipment charges that might be part of your monthly bill. For example, large homes often need more equipment than small homes.","Homeowners Insurance Discounts","Despite paying a monthly fee, home security monitoring can save you money on your <a href=\"/best-homeowners-insurance\">homeowners insurance</a>. This is because burglars tend to avoid homes with security systems, reducing the likelihood your insurance company will need to intervene to cover costs.","You can save between 5 and 20 percent of your insurance bill, depending on the insurance company and the type of equipment you have in your system. While insurance discounts won’t pay for your security system entirely, they can make it more affordable. You should check with your insurance provider to see if your system qualifies you for any discounts.","<strong>What to Expect From Home Security Monitoring Services</strong>","Contracts Explain Fees &amp; Cancellation Policies<br/>The length of your contract determines your overall costs and cancellation fees. Most home monitoring services require one- to three-year contracts, though five-year contracts exist. The best contracts offer services on a month-to-month basis without cancellation fees. In most cases, you can expect the contract to renew automatically on a month-to-month basis when the main term is up.<strong></strong>"]},"id":"8ea9b066-e0b3-4d93-a3e4-c37e9dcaf84d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/tfAqUoKPTgatAwVnP5sUCW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/home-security-monitoring/w/711/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9ML00vNzg3NDUwL29yaWdpbmFsL0hvbWUtU2VjdXJpdHktTW9uaXRvcmluZy1Ccmlua3MtSG9tZS1TZWN1cml0eS0wMDIuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tfAqUoKPTgatAwVnP5sUCW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"tfAqUoKPTgatAwVnP5sUCW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tfAqUoKPTgatAwVnP5sUCW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"6fcdc23d-5dec-423f-b1bc-324ab4b6c8dc","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Perhaps the most tedious part of a home security monitoring contract is an early cancellation policy that requires you to pay most or all of the balance remaining on your contract. While a perfect cancellation policy has no fees, one requiring you to pay 80 percent or less of your balance is better than one requiring 100 percent payoff.","The final policy you should be aware of is the equipment return policy. These let you return your system without cancellation fees during a narrow window right after your contract starts. Depending on the company, equipment return policies end in as little as three days or as long as a year after installation.","Customer Service<br/>Customer service is similar to Wi-Fi, where more bars means a stronger signal. In customer service, more support channels and useful operating hours lead to a better customer experience.","We prefer companies that provide support over social media. This is a reliable channel since a public post or private message on a company’s Facebook or Twitter page often gets a quick response. Other effective support channels include live chat and phone, though phone support is less ideal. Email is the slowest support channel.","Psychological Barriers, Not Physical Ones<br/>Unfortunately, home security monitoring services can&#39;t physically stop intruders from entering your home. However, they can be a reliable psychological deterrent by leveraging an intruder&#39;s fear of getting caught. In fact, a Cromwell-Olson-Avary study, as cited by Alarm.org, said nine out of 10 criminals avoid homes with an alarm system. This is a main reason security monitoring companies include yard signs and window decals with your system, as a visible warning. If the intruder ignores these, a loud siren provides more incentive to leave.","24/7 Home Security Monitoring<br/>Home security monitoring services watch your home 24/7. For example, if an alarm triggers, the monitoring company contacts you to see if you&#39;re okay. If there&#39;s no reply, or you ask for assistance, the company contacts the appropriate emergency services.","Security Devices Included<br/>You can expect a basic security system to have at least three devices: a control panel, entry sensors for doors and windows, and motion detectors. Most equipment runs on batteries and wirelessly connects to the control panel. The control panel requires a power cable most of the time but often has a battery backup to keep it working during power outages. Companies might include extra devices as an incentive, but it&#39;s not always free.","Smartphone Apps<br/>The best security monitoring services provide cellular or internet monitoring and a mobile app that lets you arm, disarm and control your system with a smartphone. The mobile app may also let you control other device you get for your system such as a thermostat, lights, smart locks and security cameras; however, these features usually require an upgrade to a higher-priced plan.","Security Cameras","Security cameras can enhance the effectiveness of your home monitoring system since they provide crucial information to help identify trespassers and the items they take. You can also use the camera to check in on your loved ones while you&#39;re at work.","Security companies generally reserve security cameras for premium monitoring plans. As such, if you choose to get a security camera in your system, your security provider will charge more in monitoring fees, usually $5 to $10 more a month, to cover server and cloud video storage costs.","It&#39;s best to put security cameras by the exterior doors to your home. While you can place a camera on the inside of the door, an outdoor camera can deter intruders before they break in. Common areas inside your home are also good locations, but you shouldn’t put cameras in bedrooms or bathrooms. In most cases, a security provider does not have access to your camera’s video feed.","If you only want a home monitoring system for the security camera, you should consider buying a cheaper alternative such as a <a href=\"/best-security-cameras\">standalone security camera</a> or <a href=\"/best-video-doorbells\">video doorbell</a>.","Smart Home Devices<br/>Most home monitoring providers also sell smart home equipment such as smart speakers, smart locks, lighting controls, video doorbells and thermostats. This equipment usually requires an intermediate- or premium-level monitoring plan, which can be $5 to $10 higher than base monthly monitoring fees.","Home security monitoring systems often work with retail smart home devices, including the <a href=\"/amazon-review\">Amazon Echo</a>, <a href=\"/google-review\">Google Home Mini</a>, <a href=\"/august-review\">August Smart Lock</a>, <a href=\"/ring-video-doorbell-2-review\">Ring Video Doorbell 2</a> and <a href=\"/nest-review\">Nest Learning Thermostat</a>. Check with the provider to see what devices it supports.","Specialized Security Devices<br/>","In addition to the standard security features that come with every system, home security monitoring companies often sell other safety and security devices with specialized features and functions. While none of these devices or features are essential for securing your home, they can add extra layers of protection for your unique needs."]},"id":"5cbe837c-d37a-4f5c-9112-97e40520575b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Smoke &amp; carbon monoxide detectors – These may be preferable to your current smoke and carbon monoxide sensors if you have hearing problems, a sleep condition or limited mobility that keeps you from reacting when an alarm sounds.","Pet-immune motion detectors – These can help reduce pet-triggered false alarms by ignoring animals under a certain size. Many motion detectors have this function built-in, so you should check with the provider to verify this functionality.","Glass-break sensors – Burglars that enter through a broken window won’t set off the entry sensor. In these cases, a glass-break sensor can help detect an intruder.","Flood sensors – These sensors detect water leaks that could potentially damage your home and are best used in bathrooms, basements, kitchens and utility closets.","Key fobs – If you don’t want smartphone controls, these are a good way to save on monitoring fees and still remotely arm and disarm your system.","Panic buttons – These devices immediately signal an emergency to the monitoring station, informing them to send help to your home, which can be useful if you live alone."],"type":"ul"},"id":"9db68477-d946-4457-833a-9181038d5c1b","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Installation","When you get a security system, you can expect one of three types of installation: professional, self-installed and DIY.

However, some companies charge for shipping the new sensor or the service call to your home. In fact, most service calls require a fee at the time of service or a small monthly fee in addition to your monitoring fee. Most warranties require you use a test mode once a month to look for faulty sensors and dead batteries. These warranties do not cover the cost of new batteries.","Alarm Permits<br/>Most cities require you to register your security system, even if you install it yourself. The FTC recommends you contact your city&#39;s police and fire departments to find out the regulations where you live. By registering for a permit, you agree to pay for false alarms that burden emergency responders. You can also ask your monitoring company for information about permits.","Credit Checks<br/>As with any service that requires you to sign a long-term contract, you can expect the security provider to perform a credit check when you sign up for service. This is mostly to see if you have the means to keep up with monthly payments until your contract is up. Security providers usually perform a soft inquiry with only one of the three credit bureaus, which focuses on your current credit score rather than your credit history. You shouldn’t have any problems qualifying for a system if you have good credit (a score of 600 or higher).","While it’s possible to qualify for a home security monitoring contract with poor credit, you should consider looking for a no-contract option like <a href=\"/simplisafe-review\">SimpliSafe</a>, Nest Secure or <a href=\"/scout-review\">Scout Alarm</a>. With these systems, you pay more upfront for your equipment but pay for monitoring month to month, negating the need for a credit check.","<br/>Takeover Monitoring<br/>If you already have a security system in your home and want to switch providers at the end of your contract, you might be able to keep your equipment and use a different company for monitoring services. However, this only works if a provider offers such a service and if your equipment is compatible with the new provider. In many cases, a takeover provider will install or provide an adapter to make your system compatible. Among the providers in our comparison, ADT, Brinks, Link Interactive and Protect America all offer takeover monitoring while Vivint, Frontpoint and LifeShield lack such an option.","Monitoring for DIY Security Systems<br/>Although it’s common to get equipment directly from home security monitoring companies, there are a few DIY systems on the market that support professional monitoring from a traditional security provider.
