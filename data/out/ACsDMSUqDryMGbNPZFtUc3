The Nordyne 120,000 BTU is a unit built with quality in mind, utilizing a dual-heat exchanger to ensure it extracts as much heat as possible from the gas it burns. Combined with its diagnostic system for easy maintenance and troubleshooting, this device is a reliable choice and offers years of use.","The overall operation of the Nordyne 120,000 BTU depends on a heavy-gauge, aluminized-steel heat exchanger and a stainless steel, secondary heat exchanger, both covered by a lifetime warranty. The inclusion of two heat exchangers ensures the device is capable of moving large quantities of air quickly. Due to its 120,000 BTU rating, this is a large, high-efficiency furnace ideal for homes larger than 3000 square feet.","The Nordyne 120,000 BTU comes equipped with diagnostics features to assist with troubleshooting any potential problems. While each unit is fired and tested on the manufacturing line to ensure its safe operation prior to sale, manufacturer defects can still appear after several months of use. To further help in detecting potential problems, the heating furnace comes with diagnostic lights to allow you an easier job of troubleshooting without having to count flashes. In addition, it comes with an integrated circuit board and connectors for electric air cleaning and humidifying if you need to adjust the type of airflow.","Using 40 PVC pipe, you can vent the furnace either vertically or horizontally due to its flexible, category IV venting system. A category IV venting system operates with a positive static pressure to ensure constant outflow. The venting can operate at temperatures above 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which assists in preventing excess condensation from gas exhaust.","The Nordyne 120,000 BTU is a powerful and large furnace capable of accommodating larger homes and small commercial buildings. In terms of efficiency and performance, this is among the best furnaces available due to its warranty, dual-heat exchange and flexible venting system. Not only will the unit prove capable of circulating air quickly and comfortably in your home, it will also greatly assist in keeping your heating bills low throughout the year."]},"id":"647a3bd4-5578-404f-bd39-edc42c1697dc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59568","url":"/nordyne-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-20T13:40:51Z","datePublished":"2014-05-20T13:40:51Z","name":"Nordyne Kelvinator 120,000 BTU","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
