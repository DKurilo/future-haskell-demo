Payroll is a common part of business operation that you can often outsource or manage electronically. Many business owners spend far too much time attempting to manage this process when they could instead focus on growing their business. Depending on your organizational structure, financial stability and expectations, you should consider the pros and cons for payroll software versus <a href=\"/best-online-payroll-services\">payroll services</a>, as each will offer a drastically different experience.","<strong>Payroll Software Pros</strong><br/>Small business payroll software can fully automate the process of creating and submitting paychecks, making it significantly easier to manage in the long-term. The data contained within these applications is in your hands, which can give a strong feeling of security. Software typically comes equipped with numerous features that can augment your ability to quickly process paychecks. The software includes the ability to file and pay taxes and integrates with other financial management or bookkeeping software. Once you ve purchased the software, this typically involves little additional cost, whereas professional services will charge you a per-employee rate for processing payroll in addition to a monthly rate that can gradually add up to a significant amount."]},"id":"b622f513-aef9-46a8-8a8c-78f701badead","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Payroll Software Cons</strong><br/>The most common problem with payroll software for small businesses is the up-front financial and time investment. Initially purchasing the software is a costly endeavor, and once you ve acquired the application you must then set it up with the tools, templates and structure of your pay schedule. Some software can be quite difficult to learn and may require additional upgrades to perform all the functionalities you need.","<strong>Payroll Service Pros</strong><br/>A payroll service is the best option to reduce the amount of time it takes to setup, manage and process payroll for your business. In this instance, you re having an outside company process your payroll for a fee, though this frees you up to perform other activities. In addition, external services ensure you remain compliant with any regulatory changes, in addition to managing and submitting employment tax reports on time and mailing out W-2s automatically at the end of each year. The end result of utilizing an external service is that you don t have to worry about all the paperwork or the other headaches commonly associated with payroll.","<strong>Payroll Service Cons</strong><br/>By working with an external agency to process your payroll, the fees for services will vary. The cheaper the service, the more likely you ll need to perform additional work to support them. In addition to a typical monthly rate, you ll also have to pay additional fees per employee whose payroll is processed. Prior to picking a payroll service, be sure to perform significant research, as there may be differences between what you expect the service to provide and what they ll actually deliver, which could significantly reduce the cost savings the company is supposed to be offering."]},"id":"6fd58add-6f0c-49bf-bff4-109e85091d18","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9187","url":"/payroll-software-or-service-whats-the-best-for-your-small-business","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-27T05:08:41Z","datePublished":"2015-02-27T05:08:41Z","name":"Payroll Software or Service: What's the Best for Your Small Business?","synopsis":"Both small and midsized businesses are always on the lookout for ways to streamline operations and improve efficiency while reducing daily costs.","review":{},"strapline":"Both small and midsized businesses are always on the lookout for ways to streamline operations and improve efficiency while reducing daily costs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-27T05:15:59Z","id":"TFVgdkRMnYeuxxRTFVvEac","meta":{"title":"Payroll Software or Service: What's the Best for Your Small Business?","description":"To simply payroll for your small business, you should consider payroll software or payroll services.
