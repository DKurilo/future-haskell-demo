They operate 24/7/365 and charge by the visit. It does not replace your primary care physician nor can it handle emergency situations.","The physicians are board-certified, have undergone background checks and have an average of 15 years&#39; experience. They have also trained in telemedicine protocols. You can consult with doctors in internal medicine, family practice, pediatrics and emergency medicine. While this is no substitute for an emergency room, such as if a person is having a heart attack, in cases where you aren&#39;t sure if you need emergency care, such as a child with a fever, you can call and they can advise you.","Its online doctors can advise on common ailments that can be worrisome, such as flu, headaches, insect bites, vomiting, UTIs and other ailments. They also consult on more chronic issues like acne or allergies. If necessary, they can prescribe medications and have the prescription sent to the pharmacy of your choice. They can prescribe two- or three-day refills of medication, making them a good alternative if you lose your meds while on vacation or run out over a weekend. MDLive&#39;s physicians can only prescribe other medicines in a 30-day supply, maximum.","Finding a therapist is a little different than working with a medical doctor. The telepsychology service lets you search out therapists in your state by specialty, insurance or price and lets you contact multiple therapists to find the right fit before making your first appointment. Thus, you can expand your search outside the constraints of your local area or insurance providers. You can consult with these therapists virtually. MDLive has psychiatrists on its program as well in case you need medication.","MDLive is HIPAA-complaint and secure as your doctor&#39;s office. To use the service, you first register with some basic information. You download the app in order to contact the doctor. You can start the service immediately and pay per visit. The fee is not much more than a copay.","This telehealth company provides 24/7/365 access to medical doctors and access to psychologists and psychiatrists for a variety of non-emergency situations. It is available to anyone and charges a flat rate per visit for medical consultations. (Telepsychology varies by provider.)"]},"id":"05d9a5c4-ea27-4b89-93e2-c795826d00b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68815","url":"/mdlive-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-22T21:21:00Z","datePublished":"2016-11-22T21:21:00Z","name":"MDLIVE","synopsis":"MDLive is an app-based telemedicine service that can connect you to qualified medical and psychological doctors for common but sometimes worrisome needs that can't wait.
