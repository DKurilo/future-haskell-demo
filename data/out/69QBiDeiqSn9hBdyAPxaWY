You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The LG Kompressor has some features that you won&#39;t find with other <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum cleaners</a>. While traditional vacuum cleaners generate most of their suction power at the center of the cleaner, this model uses dual-force suction technology that generates extra suction on both the left and right sides of the vacuum. The suction flows evenly across the entire base of the machine, instead of just the middle, so you do not have to make as many passes to clean a room.","This bagless cleaner has a compression system that packs the dirt in the canister the same way that a garbage compactor crushes trash. A rotating wiper blade on the inside of the canister presses debris into the bottom of the container so you can store up to three times more gunk. That means you don&#39;t have to make as many stops to empty the bin. The dirt forms a compressed brick that is easy to discard. However, although we were impressed with this machine&#39;s unique compression feature, it does not have any outstanding filtration features.","You can easily adjust the floor height to accommodate a variety of cleaning surfaces. This upright vacuum can transition smoothly from hard flooring to any type of carpeting. Although we like the 30-foot power cord, the machine&#39;s design is bulky, so you get the impression when using it that it is heavier than its 17.8 pounds.","You also get a steering system that allows you to turn corners easily. Just turn your hand in the direction you want to go and the machine follows. It is easy to maneuver in open spaces. However, it takes some time to get used to it, especially in tight spaces. With its size and power, it is difficult to maneuver under furniture, and the hard plastic body bumps into furniture instead of lying flat to reach underneath it. We prefer cleaners with soft tops or handles that recline to the floor to prevent furniture damage.","The LG Kompressor comes with a motor overload protection sensor; you do not have to worry about the motor overheating. Any clogged hoses or filter blockage will trigger the auto shut-off mechanism and that will save your machine.","A wand, upholstery tool, dusting brush and crevice tool come with the cleaner. It also comes with an 8-foot hose and telescopic handle, which extends your reach so that you can clean high bookcases or the ceiling.","The LG customer support website includes telephone and email contact information. The company also offers live chat services with knowledgeable product specialists. There are no service centers, so if you have any problems with your machine, you have to ship it for repairs. It has a five-year warranty."]},"id":"519cce6d-372a-4bb1-b063-a3e9c4a58a54","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6c0e739e-62f0-45cc-877f-98b3d3da05b0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This vacuum cleaner has powerful suction and performs well on a variety of surfaces.
