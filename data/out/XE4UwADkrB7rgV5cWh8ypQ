The ignition system makes starting the grill quick and easy with the press of a button. Electronic ignitions are an efficient way to get the flame going, but they also require a battery, which needs to be replaced occasionally. In our tests, this was one of the fastest grills to heat up, reaching 500 degrees Fahrenheit in about three and a half minutes. It also does a fairly good job of retaining heat, though we found it doesn&#39;t retain heat as well in front as it does in the middle and rear of the primary grilling area. This could be because many grill companies, including Napoleon, have cut down on thicker materials to reduce the weight of the grills.","The Mirage is available as a propane or natural gas unit. Once you install the natural gas pipeline, you no longer have to worry about running to the closest gas station to fill up your depleted propane tank in the middle of a barbecue.","Infrared technology is a good way to grill meat at high temperatures to sear meat and caramelize the outside. The Mirage comes with an infrared side burner that features a ceramic infrared heating plate and burner in the rear of the unit. This gas barbecue grill is one of the few midrange grills we found that features a rear infrared burner. You can also buy a heavy-duty rotisserie kit separately to slow-cook or roast. This extra feature opens up new possibilities in grilling and is one of the reasons this is among the top-rated gas grills in our review.","The more efficient a grill&#39;s design, the fewer Btu it requires. Generally, you want a grill that has a Btu rating of around 80 to 100 per square inch. This ensures that the grill grates stay hot and sear your steak in a timely fashion. The three primary burners on the Napoleon Mirage generate up to 48,000 Btu, which is about 99 Btu per square inch. The side burner generates up to 12,500 Btu on its own, and the rear rotisserie grill can generate up to 13,500 Btu."]},"id":"9438bd71-fed1-4dbf-9631-31ed6feb4fe3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"b383e5c1-ab14-4708-86f2-4056758a7a94","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/jMNTiyAsj2hwfVN7Jk6HsL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52628-napoleon-prestige-i12.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMNTiyAsj2hwfVN7Jk6HsL.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"jMNTiyAsj2hwfVN7Jk6HsL","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMNTiyAsj2hwfVN7Jk6HsL.jpg","alt":""},"id":"06bb0716-371d-4d71-853c-44553c630795","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The space the Mirage provides for primary grilling is a little below average, but the infrared burners help make up for it. We were able to fit 20 burgers on the grill at once, which is plenty for most occasions. Grills like the <a href=\"/weber-genesis-review\">Weber Genesis II </a>can hold up to 24. The warming tray fits up to eight buns. The warming trays are good for melting cheese on your burgers or keeping vegetables warm. The infrared side burner is also nice for cooking vegetables and other toppings. You can slow-roast meat using the infrared grill in the back.","Another nice feature of this gas grill is its integrated ice bucket and cutting board on the side shelf. You just flip the lid of the side shelf over and you have a sturdy cutting surface. Under the lid, you&#39;ll find a space where you can add ice to keep your drinks or meat cold. The Mirage also gives you the rare option to use charcoal with a tray that lets you convert half of your grill to a charcoal grill. You have to purchase the charcoal tray separately. While they aren&#39;t necessities, these features set the Mirage apart from the other grills.","This gas grill has backlit control knobs for grilling at night. The knobs&#39; ergonomic design makes it easy to grill in the dark without squinting to see the temperature settings. Napoleon also offers an optional halogen light that you can attach to the side of the unit for these nighttime barbecues.","The roll-top lid is also handy, because it decreases the space the grill takes up. Many grills need a few extra inches of clearance so you can lift the lid all the way up. The lid on this grill rolls forward as it lifts, so it is almost flush with the back of the grill."]},"id":"872cf7c6-6c6c-4778-9f40-029aad584b86","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Heating"},"id":"3bf2de52-ba03-4194-af6d-9e691e96581f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/3THcBMroXPPzrEzH4s6EHQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52628-napoleon-prestige-i6.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3THcBMroXPPzrEzH4s6EHQ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"3THcBMroXPPzrEzH4s6EHQ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3THcBMroXPPzrEzH4s6EHQ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"824532dc-1e7a-4662-a13c-a24008b08431","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Inside this grilling machine, you get sear plates, cooking grids and three burners, all made of stainless steel. The lid, side shelf and cabinet doors are also made of stainless steel, which means that your grill will last a long time.
