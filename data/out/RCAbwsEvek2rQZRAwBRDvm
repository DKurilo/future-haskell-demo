We love the digital display, which includes the toasting progress indicator and the shade selector level. The control dial easy turns from level one (the lightest) to nine (the darkest). The toaster will turn off when the cycle is complete, or you can press the cancel button at any time.","We love the bagel setting that will toast the cut side of your bagel while warming the outside. There is nothing worse than a burnt bagel. There are also controls for defrosting or reheating. When choosing these settings, press the button after you’ve pushed the control lever down. While cooking, you can check on your toast by using the high-lift lever.

A removable crumb tray pulls out from the bottom to easily keep your toaster clean. But our favorite of the included features is the progress indicator.
