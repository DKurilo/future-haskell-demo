The design of these Michelin tires specifically enhances those elements through the design of the treads. The tire makes use of 3D Variable Thickness Sipes Technology, with wide sipes designed along the inside to provide added traction in the snow, and the narrower sipes on the outside, improving handling during dry seasons.","The Pilot Alpin PA3 tires increase the total number of Biting Edges over previous tire models to create even better control in cold weather conditions, such as an improvement in grip while accelerating. In addition, these car tires are built using Helio Compound, a material that gives even greater traction for stopping and handling than previous tire models, allowing for a stopping distance of up to 9.2 feet shorter than most other models.","Snow tires tend to come with a shorter warranty due to the limited range of use they receive and the reduced amount of tread wear allowed. These tires are covered with a tread wear warranty of 30,000 miles, which is understandable when you factor in the design of the tread. As the treads wear away with regular use, the elements specifically designed to grant added levels of traction on snow and ice quickly wear off. The main gripping treads exist on the surface and don’t extend deep into the tread block, which means when those pieces disappear, the tire works much like general tires for any season.","Performance cars need performance tires for each season. All-season tires may perform well during mild winters, but if you encounter snow storms that regularly drop four to six inches of snow, you’ll need the right winter tire to face those driving conditions. The product you’ll find at most tire stores to suit that need is the Michelin Pilot Alpin PA3."]},"id":"0e807eee-eed3-4174-a106-53ac1c9ff3fe","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58030","url":"/michelin-pilot-alpin-pa3-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T15:03:11Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T15:03:11Z","name":"Michelin Pilot Alpin PA3","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
