The best <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">gas grills</a> offer plenty of power, cooking space, features and solid construction, along with an excellent warranty and support offerings. The Brinkmann Grill King meets the bar in most categories, but it does little to establish any kind of rule amongst its competition. Still, it is a good choice for an outdoor gas grill.","The Grill King features four primary burners, which is a good number for a gas grill. Each of these burners generates up to 12,000BTUs, totaling 48,000BTUs, in the primary cooking space. There is also a 12,000BTU side burner on this gas grill that is ideal for cooking side dishes such as veggies or beans while you cook your main dishes on the primary burners. The Grill King is fueled by propane and does not have a natural gas option. However, this gas grill has an electronic ignition system, making startup easy and fast.","The Brinkmann Grill King gas grill has a good amount of primary cooking space, making it suitable for both small gatherings and large parties. The primary cooking area is 514 square inches. There is also 120 square inches of warming rack space on this grill. Unfortunately, one of the major missing components of the Grill King is a built-in heat thermometer. Many hot gas grills include this feature to assist the chef, as many items require a precise temperature to be cooked evenly and thoroughly. This omission hurts the Grill King.","The housing material for this Brinkmann gas grill is stainless steel, which helps prevent rust and wear. The cooking grates are porcelain-coated cast iron – a material that helps add the coveted grill searing and is easy to clean up afterward. Unfortunately, Brinkmann grills are infamous for their less-than-stellar construction, and the Grill King is no exception. While the grill itself won&#39;t fall apart while you&#39;re cooking, it appears flimsy and less sturdy than competing grills.","Luckily, these materials are covered by a decent warranty from Brinkmann. The Grill King has a five-year warranty on its burners and a three-year warranty on all other stainless steel parts. The Brinkmann website hosts a helpful FAQs section and online manual for the Grill King. If you need direct assistance, you can reach a Brinkmann representative by phone or email, or you can submit a support ticket online."]},"id":"08df5e9a-be19-45ce-b78a-dd8385a98acf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"be06f2b8-e467-45b6-afb3-fd7dd536a0a0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Grill King is not the king of all grills, but it will make a nice addition to any backyard or patio. Cooks will enjoy the extra cooking space and side-shelf storage, along with the powerful burners.

Still, the Brinkmann Grill King can get the job done for all your backyard barbecues."]},"id":"283a10da-a57f-415b-a925-7a156c43d33e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56610","url":"/brinkmann-grill-king-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
