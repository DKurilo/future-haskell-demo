The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-beat-making-software\">Beat Making Software</a> here</em><em>.</em>","BTV Solo is one of the simplest pieces of beat making software you will find. All the controls are on one window, but the layout is different from traditional tracks and layers we found with other software. You can use your keyboard or mouse to create beats by using one of the thousands of preloaded engineered sounds. Plus, there are more than 100 premade loops. It can be hard to find these beats, though, because there is no search panel, but we do like BTV Solo for its simplicity â€“ especially if you are a beginner.","The first thing we noticed about this beat maker is the layout. It lacks the tracks, layers and design of traditional beat making software. This can be both good and bad because building music in layers is such a prevalent method in the music industry. What we do like about the interface is that you can use your mouse to select beats or use your keyboard, which makes the process go much quicker. If you have a MIDI keyboard, you can control everything on the interface with it. But because this is not a traditional interface, there isn&#39;t a drag-and-drop feature or a master bus track.","BTV has more than 1,000 professionally engineered sounds that you can add to up to 16 tracks. Circulating through the tracks requires you to use your mouse or keyboard, and you can easily delete tracks you don&#39;t like. This custom beats maker automatically quantizes your music, which means that the program automatically matches the rhythm of your beat to the tempo you set. This is useful, especially if you feel your most recent creation was a bit sloppy.","BTV Solo has a section to edit WAV files, and you can add effects, delay or reverb to your sounds. One thing that stands out with this program is the beats per minute button. If you find yourself listening to a song, you can tap the BPM button and it will automatically adjust to that specific song, giving you the power to create a song with the same time signature.","The BTV software comes with how-to tutorials to help you understand the program and its interface. The company has also posted several videos to YouTube as well. There is a members section of the website where you can browse forums and get help from professionals. You can also call or email BTV representatives."]},"id":"0449b6d5-d651-4b13-b741-5d9c799e8634","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"58999e48-6345-4055-9a67-0abe0b5c1858","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for a user-friendly experience when making your own beats, you should consider BTV Solo.
