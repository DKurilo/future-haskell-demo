Its resolution isn&#39;t the greatest, and additional features like laser pointers, flashlights and manual focus are entirely missing. Unlike other inexpensive <a href=\"/best-infrared-cameras\">infrared cameras</a>, however, the Ti90 produces radiometric files with detailed thermal data.","The resolution of this thermal camera is fairly low at 80 x 60 pixels. While this is enough to gather general thermographic data, more intricate details simply aren&#39;t viewable. Like most modern thermal infrared cameras, however, the Ti90 is capable of taking a good visible-light image and pairing it with thermal information for increased clarity.","This thermographic camera&#39;s fixed-focus system means that you don&#39;t have any options to customize the way it focuses on objects. While this can be convenient at times, you&#39;ll be limited to the infrared camera&#39;s preset focus setting.","Despite all its shortcomings, the Ti90 remains a fairly powerful tool for measuring thermographic data. Although its images are of relatively low quality, they are embedded with valuable radiometric data. These radiometric files, in Fluke&#39;s proprietary IS2 format, can be used with the included software to analyze and build in-depth reports based on the detailed temperature information.","Fluke&#39;s Ti90 is also one of the least expensive thermal-imaging cameras to offer Wi-Fi connectivity. This allows you to capture images and information and share them immediately through apps designed for Apple and Android devices.","Although its image quality suffers, the Ti90 remains thermally accurate to 2 percent. This allows you to capture images and build reports confidently around its radiometric information. It is capable of measuring temperatures between minus 20 degrees and 250 degrees Celsius, and it is sensitive to temperature differences of less than 0.15 degrees. This sensitivity captures less specific thermal information than other, more expensive cameras.","As is the case with any electronic tool, battery life and durability are key features of any infrared camera. In spite of its low cost, the Ti90 makes no sacrifices in these crucial areas. Its high-capacity lithium-ion battery can last up to four hours on a single charge, and its outer casing affords it protection from dirt, water and falls of up to 6.6 feet.","The Ti90 also boasts the same warranty coverage as any of Fluke&#39;s cameras: two years of protection against defects in its parts or assembly. In case you run across any other issues during that time, the comprehensive FAQs section and large number of downloadable documents give you the information you need to keep your device functioning properly."]},"id":"6d3a63f0-4a38-4091-9024-f11409cb6613","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"84753890-9760-4a9f-b0eb-7841ecb9cfc7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ti90 is a barebones infrared camera that offers little more than basic, low-resolution thermal images.
