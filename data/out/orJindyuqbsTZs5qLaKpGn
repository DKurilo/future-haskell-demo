It attaches to your child’s clothing or is worn on their wrist, so you don’t have to worry about false alarms caused by severe weather or a loose towel or tree branch blowing into the pool. This alarm comes in the form of two turtle bracelets: The alarm itself is a green plastic turtle about the size of a silver dollar affixed to a black fabric strap. The bracelet latches shut with a small black closure that requires a key to open and close. That way, your kiddo can’t wriggle out of it. The bracelet can be secured small enough for a toddler or large enough for an adult. You could even wrap it around Fido’s collar to make sure he doesn’t jump in the pool unattended.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"4b456110-57d3-469d-8bf1-740a606b8095","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63622","url":"/safety-turtle-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-23T20:26:38Z","datePublished":"2015-03-23T20:26:38Z","name":"Safety Turtle 2.0 Child Immersion Pool/Water Alarm Kit","synopsis":"The Safety Turtle 2.0 wearable pool alarm is easy to use and always accurate.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"The Safety Turtle 2.0 is a fun, accurate wearable pool alarm perfect for knowing whether your young children or pets have fallen into the pool.","pros":["It doesn&#8217;t require batteries."],"cons":["It&#8217;s expensive."]},"strapline":"The Safety Turtle 2.0 wearable pool alarm is easy to use and always accurate.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-08-08T00:00:00Z","id":"orJindyuqbsTZs5qLaKpGn","meta":{"title":"Safety Turtle Pool Alarm Child Kit Review","description":"The Safety Turtle is not a traditional pool alarm, but tracks individuals as an easy way to make sure children don&#039;t go into the pool."},"products":[{"slug":"safety-turtle-2-0-child-immersion-pool-water-alarm-kit","url":"/product/safety-turtle-2-0-child-immersion-pool-water-alarm-kit","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","name":"Safety Turtle 2.0 Child Immersion Pool/Water Alarm Kit","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","id":"LtwuvrZs6Yfio3zuEQaGdb","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8UtGYCVu9TMeUfxvTH2uQG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","mimeType":"","name":"8392ce0bb801b1c9034c049a9ff26aae.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8392ce0bb801b1c9034c049a9ff26aae.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","id":"8UtGYCVu9TMeUfxvTH2uQG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UtGYCVu9TMeUfxvTH2uQG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Safety Turtle Pool Alarm Child Kit Review","description":"The Safety Turtle is not a traditional pool alarm, but tracks individuals as an easy way to make sure children don&#039;t go into the pool."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8UtGYCVu9TMeUfxvTH2uQG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","mimeType":"","name":"8392ce0bb801b1c9034c049a9ff26aae.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8392ce0bb801b1c9034c049a9ff26aae.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","id":"8UtGYCVu9TMeUfxvTH2uQG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UtGYCVu9TMeUfxvTH2uQG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Safety Turtle Pool Alarm Child Kit Review","description":"The Safety Turtle is not a traditional pool alarm, but tracks individuals as an easy way to make sure children don&#039;t go into the pool."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/safety-turtle-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:46Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
