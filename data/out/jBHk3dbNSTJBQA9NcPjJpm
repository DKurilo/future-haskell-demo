However, practicality prevents us from testing some products, such as home safes, firsthand. As such, we rely on our experience, research and interviews with industry experts to advise you in choosing the home safe that fits your needs while highlighting notable products from popular brands.","We studied information about burglary and fire-resistance classifications for safes as defined by Underwriters Laboratories. Additionally, we found extremely helpful guides from American Security Products on both <a href=\"http://www.amsecusa.com/burglary-ratings-explained/\">burglary</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amsecusa.com/fire-ratings-explained/\">fire</a> ratings that are worth checking out. We also contacted Tarsila Wey, the director of marketing at First Alert, and asked about homeowners’ reasons to buy safes and some tips for choosing a good safe.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We aren&#39;t able to conduct home safe testing in our lab because we lack the facilities to adequately and safely assess each product&#39;s resistance to physical attacks, fire and water damage. While these destructive testing methods may be useful in gauging each product&#39;s effectiveness, we don&#39;t think it would reveal much more than UL classifications and manufacturer specifications.","While we consider UL-listed safes to be superior to unlisted models, we also recognize that most of the popular models you can buy online fall into the latter group as they are more affordable. As such, the safes we chose to evaluate only have the most basic level of security, which is better than none at all.","Because of this, we don&#39;t score the safes in our review, though we still conduct thorough research to help you decide which brand or type of safe is best for your needs. Our recommendations stick to affordable models that work for most homeowners but may not be large enough or offer the best features of an all-in-one safe. For more secure, full-featured models, we suggest speaking with a seller in your area specializing in safes.","<strong>How Much Do Home Safes Cost?</strong>","Generally, the more money you spend, the better the quality and workmanship you can expect from a safe, particularly if it is burglar- or fire-resistant. A small budget safe can be had for around $50 to $70, while a large gun safe can cost over $1,000. Other factors can contribute to the high price tag, such as advanced digital locking features like keypads and fingerprint-recognition locking devices. Home safes can be found at every budget level, and small safes usually cost less than large ones. We recommend deciding on a home safe based on what you want to store. Storing valuables, firearms, currency, important documents and photos each have different internal space requirements.<strong></strong>","<strong>Getting the Best Safe For Your Home</strong>","Burglary Resistance<br/>If you are serious about protecting your valuables against burglary, you should consider a safe that is UL-listed for that purpose. Underwriters Laboratories ratings reflect the construction quality of a safe and are based on how long it would take a burglar to force it open. The minimum level of protection and lowest rating, Residential Security Container, is not really considered a safe as it means the container only resists weak attacks for five minutes and is relatively easy to break into. However, UL&#39;s other ratings, UL TL-15 and UL TL-30, mean the safe can withstand strong attacks, including power tools, for 15 and 30 minutes respectively.","Most safes you can buy online or in retail stores don&#39;t provide much resistance against burglars, though Tarsila Wey from First Alert suggests safes with programmable digital locks and concealed pry-resistant hinges offer more security than those that don’t. Storing your valuables in a home safe does at least discourage impulse and opportunity thefts. For the security of major assets, however, we recommend visiting a locksmith or a store that specializes in safes, or getting a lockbox at your bank.","Fire Resistance<br/>If protecting key documents from fire is your main concern, get a model that has been UL classified for fire resistance. In order to earn a UL classification, a safe must keep an internal temperature below 350 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour, even if the outside temperature reaches 1,700 degrees. Safes that last two hours at 1,850 degrees earn a higher rating. Many cheap fire chests are UL classified for 30 minutes at 1,550 degrees. Of the safes we evaluated, only the <a href=\"/first-alert-review\">First Alert 2087F-BD</a> is UL listed for fire resistance.","&#34;Many of today’s safes are capable of providing both fire resistance and effective burglary protection,&#34; Tarsila Wey told us in our interview. Of course, if you want a safe that is both fire- and burglar-resistant, you should expect to spend more.","Locking Mechanism<br/>Some safes have one basic locking device, while others are equipped with as many as four, such as basic key entry, combination dial entry, digital combination pad entry and fingerprint recognition entry. While it&#39;s important to choose a lock style that best fits your needs and preferences, each lock type has weaknesses. For example, digital locks have trouble if the batteries die, and burglars can force the lock using the slot for the backup key. Likewise, manual locks can be susceptible to lock picking and forgotten combinations. Remember, if a safe has a UL listing for burglary resistance, its lock will reflect that.","Size &amp; Weight<br/>A UL-listed steel safe might be impenetrable, but it could be too bulky and heavy for what you need. It also might not be a good fit in second-story rooms (imagine carrying a 700-pound safe upstairs) or if you relocate often and want to take the safe to your new home.","Ultimately, the size you choose comes down to what you want to put inside. Small safes, such as the Barska AX11620, <a href=\"/sentry-review\">SentrySafe X055</a> and <a href=\"/stack-on-review\">Stack-On PDS-500</a>, are ideal for securing documents and small jewelry. Likewise, medium-size safes such as the <a href=\"/paragon-review\">Paragon 7775</a> and First Alert 2087F-BD are better if you need more room. However, if you need to store rifles and other large firearms, safes like those from Steelwater and similar manufacturers are good options.","Regardless of the size, it&#39;s a good idea to get a safe that bolts to your floor or a shelf in order to prevent thieves from taking it elsewhere to open.","Moisture Buildup<br/>Moisture can sometimes build up and harm papers, guns, jewelry and other items. It might be a good idea to put some small packets of moisture-absorbing desiccant materials in your safe. You can buy these online. If you live in a particularly humid climate, using a dehumidifier is another way to help maintain your safe both inside and out.","Alternatives<br/>If you don&#39;t have room in your home or want to keep your valuables in a more secure location, you can rent a safe deposit box at a local bank for a small monthly fee. However, not all banks offer this service, and you can only access the box during business hours.","If mail theft and identity theft are concerns in your neighborhood, a product such as the <a href=\"https://www.mailboss.com/shop/curbside-mailboxes/mail-manager/\">Mail Boss 7506 Mail Manager Locking Security Mailbox</a> could help. It&#39;s approved by the U.S. Postal Service and lets your mail carrier deposit letters and small parcels into a secure safe.","A UL-rated fire safe is the best option to protect physical data storage devices such as CDs, flash drives and hard drives. However, it may also be a good idea to back up your data to a cloud storage service.
