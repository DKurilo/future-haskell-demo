Not only is the river crystal clear here, but Bemidji is also a great place to learn about Paul Bunyan and his blue ox, Babe. Both have a commemorative statue that has been on display in Bemidji since 1937. Paul Bunyan stands over 18 feet high, while Babe easily reaches his shoulder.

He was notorious for getting out of tough situations, and the great escape in Garretson, South Dakota, is no exception. The story is told that James was being heavily pursued by a large posse after robbing a bank in Missouri. James came to a rock chasm with a rushing river far below. With the posse bearing down, James&#39; only choice was to jump the gorge. Without much hesitation, Jesse James reared his horse and jumped, landing unscathed on the other side and safely riding to freedom. The infamous jumping place is now known as Devil&#39;s Gulch, and a bridge has been built for visitors to easily cross the West River. The easy-to-hike trails lead to beautiful scenic spots, perfect as natural backdrops to your photos.
