When compared to the top desktops on our lineup, the DX is an underwhelming ready-to-use PC. However, it’s up to most tasks, except for video games. Your family will be able to surf the web, stream entertainment and store thousands of files without a hitch. Also, if the base model is not powerful enough for your needs, there are a variety of higher-end models available in the DX family, or you can swap components on your own after purchase.","The Gateway DX comes with a top-tier Intel i5 processor, as ranked by Tom’s Hardware. It is not the best performing of the first-tier processors, but it has the capabilities to handle nearly everything you need to do on your family computer. The biggest problem with the computer’s performance, and the reason it is trumped by many other desktops, is that all other components are subpar. The computer uses the CPU to power graphics, which is fine in principle. However, when you want to play video games, you’ll have to turn the graphical fidelity down to average or low. On top of that, the base model DX only comes with 4GB of RAM, half the standard amount of memory that most computers use.","Fortunately, you can upgrade the computer by buying one of the better models, or you can upgrade the components of the base model after purchase. Typically, if you make the upgrades yourself, you can find components on sale and save a lot of money. This will improve both the computer’s performance and life.","Unfortunately, Gateway’s customer support options are not the best. Online, you can find downloadable drivers and use live chat to contact customer support. Unfortunately, there are no user forums and you cannot email support representatives. Phone support is connected to the warranty, so if you stick with the standard one-year warranty, telephone support will expire at the end of the year. The longest warranty available lasts three years."]},"id":"607e4a12-5c2c-4b10-b804-d3d2b8640a63","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a871ff92-26f7-4dfe-a214-7261aa968a2f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Gateway DX is an upgradeable PC with a top-tier Intel i5 processor, it falls short as an out-of-the-box home computer.
