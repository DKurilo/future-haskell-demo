Antivirus+ Security did well as we compared the best <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus software</a>, in part because it earned a perfect score for malware detection and removal in our tests. It also did well in other third-party protection tests. For every malicious website, even those that didn’t load because the site no longer existed or because it was taking too long, Trend Micro recognized the URLs and still warned us of the danger on them. This is because the software uses web reputation technology that assigns scores to domains and individual webpages to determine how safe they are.","Web reputation technology is also how Trend Micro works so well with Microsoft Edge without needing to install a browser extension. Since Edge doesn’t allow third-party extensions in its browser, it’s difficult for most antivirus programs to warn about dangerous sites or stop malware from downloading within the browser if something sneaks past Edge’s security settings. And that can happen. But Trend Micro was able to warn us with an in-browser message about all these threats. We highly recommend using Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security if you use Microsoft Edge to access the web.","When we came in contact with viruses that download from malicious links and files, Trend Micro didn’t let them go anywhere, completely blocking them so the download process couldn’t ever start. This is a huge plus and a feature several antivirus programs don’t have.","While giving you stellar protection, Trend Micro does use a good portion of your computer’s resources and creates noticeable slowdown. Most of the time this isn’t a problem when searching the web, posting to social media or sending email, but we experienced some drag while waiting for videos and games to load and while attaching large files to outgoing email.","One important feature Trend Micro doesn’t have that other basic antivirus programs tend to include is a vulnerability scanner. This tool checks all the programs installed on your computer and lets you know if any need to be updated. Out-of-date programs are among the most common ways hackers sneak into your system. Ransomware also takes advantage of these weak spots. Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security also doesn’t have safe banking tools, a password manager or parental controls. However, the company has all-encompassing internet security programs that include these tools, such as <a href=\"/trend-micro-titanium-maximum-security-review\">Trend Micro Maximum Security</a>. <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Antivirus Basic</a> is another program that includes several of these features, yet it’s comparable in price to Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security.","If you need help installing or using your antivirus program, email support is always available, and you can reach a Trend Micro representative by phone during normal business hours. However, if you choose to purchase the premium support package along with your Trend Micro antivirus software, you have access to 24/7 telephone support and expedited email replies."]},"id":"a89e584e-3ef1-4aeb-9de4-767bbad3b07b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a90ad44-8b6d-424d-930a-f4741c9b5e18","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security is antivirus software for Windows that does a great job blocking viruses and works especially well with Microsoft Edge, something other antivirus programs can’t do very well.
