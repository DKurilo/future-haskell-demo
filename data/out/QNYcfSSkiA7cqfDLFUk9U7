The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-french-door-refrigerators\">French Door Refrigerators</a> here</em><em>.</em>","French door refrigerators are quite popular because they put the food you retrieve most often right at eye level, and they give you ample space in the freezer. The DCS ActiveSmart RF195AUUX1 is your basic french door fridge, but with a surprisingly energy-efficient motor. This fridge has the lowest energy usage of any fridge we reviewed, using just 445 kilowatt-hours a year. That translates to a cost of roughly $47 dollars a year to run. It has ample shelving and storage space, but lacks the amenities that refrigerators in its price range include.","The DCS ActiveSmart fridge has a total capacity of under 20 cubic feet. The fridge portion has 14.4 cubic feet of space and the freezer has 5.4 cubic feet. With these measurements, this fridge is on the small side.","Many french door refrigerators in this price range have four or more shelves. The DCS ActiveSmart has a disappointing three shelves, all of which span the width of the fridge. The shelves are adjustable, so if you need to accommodate a large item, you can remove a shelf or two. You can control the humidity in the two crisper bins. This feature allows you to change the humidity in the individual bins to improve the longevity of fruits and vegetables. An odd feature of the crisper bins is that both sit on a tray so you can&#39;t pull one bin out without the other. This fridge has a full-length drawer for storing meats and cheeses, thawing items and beverages, but you can&#39;t control the temperature. This is another feature that many fridges in this price range include. As for matching your décor, the DCS french door refrigerator only comes in the stainless steel style.","You will have ample in-the-door storage in this refrigerator, but you sacrifice a through-the-door ice dispenser. The fridge has eight door bins with four of those wide enough to fit gallon-sized bottles. In two of the gallon-sized bins, there is a sliding divider so that you can better hold smaller items in the bin. Two of the door bins are quite shallow but can still hold several condiments, and the last two bins have clear covers and work as dairy compartments.","The freezer has a pull-out drawer with two tiers. The top tier has three clear plastic bins. The bottom tier has one larger bin separated into two with a divider. The top tier houses the portable ice bin, which is one of the three bins, and ice drops into it from the icemaker located in the freezer. You can control the icemaker from the external control panel on the front of the fridge. From this control panel, you can also control the inner temperature of both the fresh food section and the freezer section. The freezer is spacious and can keep your food organized, and the control panel has easy-to-use buttons to control all of the settings."]},"id":"825467fa-2377-4983-8aae-02dc684902f5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aeedb7b9-d4fb-4495-b588-17492b0b4766","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With a hefty price tag for what you receive, the DCS ActiveSmart RF195AUUX1 does have some surprising features, but it is still missing some important features.
