Some midrange smartphones, like the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-s5-smartphone,review-2457.html\">Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/sony-xperia-z1-hands-on\">Sony Xperia Z1</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-alpha-att\">Samsung Galaxy Alpha</a>, offer a variety of features, large screens and access to hundreds of apps. With the wide range of availability, you have plenty of options, whether for an upgrade or a first foray into smart communication.","Midrange smartphones offer many of the same features as more expensive models including Wi-Fi, 3G or 4G, allowing you to stay connected to the internet for news, apps, social media and browsing the web. Some of the best midrange smartphones include high-quality cameras, GPS and even waterproofing.","<strong>Mid-tier Smartphones: What to Look For</strong>","Picking the best mid-tier smartphone means weighing features, functions and costs to find the option that s right for you. Considering the key factors that affect your phone usage can help you to find the best midrange phone for your needs.","<strong>Storage</strong><br/>Phone storage allows you to install applications, take photos and videos, download games, and keep music on your phone. Some midrange smartphones offer expansion microSD or miniSD slots, allowing you to swap out the memory and add more storage while others do not. If you enjoy using apps or want to keep a large library of music or videos on your phone, then the storage capacity is an important feature to consider. Midrange phones vary greatly in available storage, but many options offer 8GB to 32GB of data.","<strong>Size</strong><br/>Screen size, bezel size, weight and comfort are all considerations when you purchase a midrange smartphone. The larger the screen, the easier it is to view videos and photos. However, this makes the phone less comfortable to hold and more difficult to put into a pocket. Weight also varies, and while thinner, lighter phones are the best option, you usually pay a premium for decreasing the thickness and weight. Choosing the best midrange smartphone based on size means choosing an option that fits comfortably into your hand and is easy to carry around.","<strong>Camera</strong><br/>The gold standard for digital cameras has always been the megapixel (MP), which measures photo clarity and the size of the data file. The higher the number of megapixels, the higher the resolution of the photo, the larger the file size and the more storage space it uses. A 5MP camera can print photos up to 13 by 19 inches in size when the photos are taken in good lighting. You also have to consider the sensor, which affects photo quality in different light, blur reduction and color. You should check the camera features, such as shake correction, low-light sensor and the number of colors, to choose a camera that suits your photo preferences.","A wide range of midrange phones are available to choose from. A careful study of the various offerings will help you find the one that s right for you."]},"id":"8a0ebeda-89d2-4174-ac8b-be84a181ebd4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8fb08020-f6bc-4434-8efc-ac55619b216f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F3ISEUC/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63599[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Apple</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LBAGJO4/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63602[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">HTC Desire</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QHYSS7U/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63603[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">HTC Desire EYE </a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JPIAGW0/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63600[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Huawei</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NKRAKZK/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63606[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">LG G3</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MWI4HW0/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63601[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Motorola</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFG57CW/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63607[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Nokia</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MJAX9R0/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63608[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Samsung Galaxy</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T56EKJ2/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63604[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Samsung Galaxy Alpha</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ET7MWWO/?&tag=ttr_midtier-smartphone-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1655[art|NA[pid|63605[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8e4aba00-6dea-4d08-8734-99e14777f2ac","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1655","url":"/best-mid-tier-smartphones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-11T18:41:34Z","datePublished":"2015-04-13T21:57:28Z","name":"Mid-Tier Smartphones Review","synopsis":"Midrange smartphones give you a good selection of functions and features with less of an impact on your budget.
