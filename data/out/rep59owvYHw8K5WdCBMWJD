They evaluated each program’s tools and features and compared them to its competitors’. At the end of our analysis, each application was given an overall score based on its performance.","We also reached out to architects and interior design professionals to get a better understanding of what it takes to make a great design. Gregg Hodson, principal designer at <a href=\"http://gregghodsondesign.com/\">Gregg Hodson Interior Design</a>, told us that he has his drawings produced on AutoCAD and also makes hand-drawn plans. Hodson warned against drawing plans on your own if you don’t have a firm understanding of what you’re doing. In fact, when asked how often he’s received a home-made plan he could work with, he said “never.”","Hodson went on to say that the biggest obstacle for DIYers is they lack professional knowledge, stating, “It’s challenging when people think they know but they don’t.” He also stressed that casual users have to have a creative mind and an intuitive feel space, layering and flow. Additionally, he cautioned against trusting the colors you get from a computer program. According to Hodson, “color on the computer never ever works…there’s no way, we’re not there yet...they haven’t got it to the point where I know I’m looking at the true color.”","The architects at <a href=\"http://www.mountainwestarchitects.com/\">Mountain West Architecture</a> expressed similar sentiments. Lead designer Trevor Broughton told us of amateur produced plans, “My biggest concern with anything brought to me is it&#39;s scalable and accurate.” When asked what lay designers should look for in design software, he said they “Need to be able to get up to speed quickly at it. Different people have different abilities. Consumer grade software allows the consumer to get a more solid concept, it lets them work through some of the issues before they come to us. So, we can get a more concise interpretation on our end.”","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Our review team considered more than a dozen interior design applications before they decided which programs are the best. They used each program to create a test design, which was made to use each feature and tool to its fullest extent. They noted how each product’s interface works and its workflow as well as considered how intuitive each software is to figure out and use. This all culminated in assigning each product an ease of use grade. For the most part, the programs had shallow learning curves, but some were much harder to use than others. The lowest grade our reviewers gave was a C-, and seven of the 10 products we reviewed received a B or higher.","As we evaluated each software’s common features, such as photo import tools and drag-and-drop placement, we compared them against their counterparts in other programs. We then assigned a grade based on how well these features work. Again, all the programs scored fairly well, with no application earning lower than a C. We factored the performance of the applications’ non-graded tools into our overall final scores.","<strong>What to Look for in the Best Interior Design Software</strong>","As we evaluated interior design software, we focused on the following criteria:","Room Design<br/>You need more than four walls, a ceiling and a floor to make a good room design. To be useful, interior design software requires several tools, chief among them an object library. These libraries contain a wealth of common household items for you to place in your design, including couches, televisions, lamps, plants, appliances and more. The bigger the object library the better. However, the best programs can import even more objects from third-party sources like SketchUp and Trimble 3D Warehouse.","If you have a unique item you can’t find anywhere but you still want to include it in your design, look for a program that lets you build objects from the ground up. The best applications include custom designers for things like fireplaces, staircases, windows, cabinets and more.","Planning &amp; Construction<br/>Creating a true-to-life design is very important but even more so is bringing your ideas into the real world. The best interior design programs include tools that import photos and floor plans from other software or even have features that let you scan blueprints and convert them for fine-tuning. Additionally, a good interior design program has sample plans you can use as jumping-off points, in case you don’t know what you want in the beginning. Further, the best programs also include a cost estimator and material list generator, which show you what it will take to actually build your design.","Help &amp; Support<br/>No matter how intuitive manufacturers make interior design software, there will be times when you need help. The best programs have video tutorials you can follow if you get stuck. Additionally, you can also seek technical and customer support via phone, forums, FAQs and live chat. Our favorite products have most or all of these options.","How Much Does Interior Design Software Cost?<br/>The average price of the software we reviewed was about $60. Most of the developers create similar programs with different feature sets, with more advanced versions costing more. Most premium programs cost about $100, and their watered-down versions cost about $50. There are applications that cost as little as $25, but they are barebones and only good for small projects.","<strong>Online Interior Design Software</strong>","If the software packages we reviewed are a bit much for you, you may want to check out <a href=\"https://planner5d.com/\">Planner 5D</a>. It’s free and much easier to learn and use than all the interior design programs we reviewed. Even if you only have basic computer skills, you can learn the ins and outs of this basic interior designer in short order.","The free version provides the bare basics – you can build a floor plan and place doors, windows, electrical outlets and plumbing. It also comes with limited access to its library, which includes 4,000 household objects like furniture and appliances as well as room-specific items for kitchens, bathrooms, patios, garages and more. You get full access to the object library when you purchase one of Planner 5D&#39;s upgraded plans, which cost as little as $10 for 30 days of access.  ","Since this interior designer is made for amateurs, it’s not nearly as powerful or useful as the programs we tested. However, it’s a good starting point to learn the basics without committing too much time or money in a piece of software you may never use to its fullest potential."]},"id":"1ee1a232-4778-4b82-962d-bc7f689c719a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"6410adfd-c180-4409-bd15-32496db74ca0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/virtual-architect-ultimate-review\">Virtual Architect Ultimate 8</a>","<a href=\"/turbofloorplan-home-landscape-deluxe-review\">TurboFloorPlan Home &amp; Landscape Deluxe 2019</a>","<a href=\"/virtual-architect-instant-makeover-review\">Virtual Architect Instant Makeover 2</a>","<a href=\"/punch-interior-design-suite-review\">Punch Interior Design Suite 20</a>","<a href=\"/turbofloorplan-home-landscape-pro-review\">TurboFloorPlan Home and Landscape Pro 2019</a>","<a href=\"/punch-home-landscape-design-premium-review\">Punch Home &amp; Landscape Design Premium 20</a>","<a href=\"/chief-architect-home-designer-review\">Home Designer Interiors 2019</a>","<a href=\"/total-3d-review\">Total 3D Landscape &amp; Deck Premium 12</a>","<a href=\"/punch-home-landscape-design-standard-review\">Punch Home &amp; Landscape Design Essentials 20</a>","<a href=\"/total-3d-home-design-deluxe-review\">Total 3D Home Design Deluxe 11</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0608a13a-0fa3-46c5-b74d-6de6c08f904e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_373","url":"/best-interior-design-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
