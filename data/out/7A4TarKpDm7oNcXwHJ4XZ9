This affordable <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/988-best-gaming-services.html\">online video game rental service</a> ships from multiple distribution centers nationwide, so you can receive games fast. Gamerang doesn’t have a parental control feature and doesn&#39;t offer a free trial, but the service offers rental plans to suit every gaming lifestyle, from the casual gamer to the ultimate gaming enthusiast. Additionally, if you like your rental so much that you just can’t bear to part with it, you have the option to purchase the game instead of sending it back.","Like most video game rental services, Gamerang has a queue, or a choice list, that allows you to select which games you would like to rent and in what order. As soon as the distribution center receives your returned games, the next choice from your list is mailed to you. Gamerang has no late fees or due dates and gives you free two-way shipping. You also have the freedom to purchase a rented video game and the choice to cancel your membership at any time. You can find user ratings on video games, and although there’s space for reviews, there doesn’t appear to be a single review on a game. In addition to no reviews in the Reviews tab, there is no consistency to the game pages. Some information pages show game screenshots and a description of the game, and others will suggest other games to rent.","Gamerang’s game library is full of more than 13,000 games, and their collection continues to grow. You can rent games online for most consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. They also have a large library for handheld devices like the PSP, Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, and you can rent older games for the PlayStation and GameCube.","Gamerang gives you lots of options to search for games, although you&#39;ll have to spend a lot of time with the site before you fully know your way around. In the left navigation, games are grouped into genres, online capability, popularity, new titles and upcoming releases. On the top toolbar, you can use the GameFinder search box or search games by console. You can then further sort games by price, customer rating, release date or publisher.","The service has eight traditional genre categories: Action, Adventure, Racing, Puzzles/Arcade, RPG, Simulations, Sports and Strategy. You can also see games that were recently released or those that are coming soon.","The support center includes a FAQs section that answers the most common questions. If you can’t find the answer you need, you can contact customer service by submitting a help ticket or emailing the support team.","Gamerang has one of the largest and most comprehensive game libraries on the internet. It offers a handful of different membership plans, so you can get one or two game titles at a time, depending on how quickly you play through games."]},"id":"b3ff764f-0ed2-440b-b6e8-4529b84ebcf0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1651","url":"/gamerang-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2016-10-31T18:05:56Z","name":"Gamerang","synopsis":"Gamerang has more than 13,000 titles for all major gaming consoles, which covers almost any game you can think of.
