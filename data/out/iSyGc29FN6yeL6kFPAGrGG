Its responsive variable drive makes it highly maneuverable, so you can easily get into tight spots.

It won&#39;t be a problem for people who like to set their mower at the height they like and keep it that way, but it may be an issue for others. This mower has a single lever that lifts the rear wheels and another for the front wheels. However, despite the lack of a single lever, you can adjust them easily and you don&#39;t have to work hard to get it to the right height.

This makes it easier to use than many mowers when it comes to traversing diverse terrain for yards as big as a half-acre. Given its extreme mobility and rear-wheel drive, it does not really need the variable wheel size that some mowers rely on. This self-propelled mower weighs in at approximately 90 pounds, which is a bit on the heavy side when compared to other lawn mower brands we reviewed.
