The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-deep-fryers\">Deep Fryers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","A common issue faced by consumers is reusing oil. After cooking a meal, many individuals simply throw away the oil. Considering the amount of oil required for deep fryers, this can prove a very costly ingredient. The Emeril FR7015001 seeks to address this with an automatic oil filtration and storage system so you can reuse your oil for multiple meals and reduce the expense of creating the foods you love.","The Emeril FR7015001 reflects a very professional approach to creating a high-value, electric deep fryer. One of its unique features is that when your oil has cooled after cooking food, the device automatically filters and drains the oil into a re-sealable storage container. This ensures you can get multiple uses out of your oil rather than having to throw it all away after each use, a huge cost savings for consumers.","In addition, the Emeril FR7015001 comes with an oil change indicator light. While it’s helpful that you can reuse the oil for multiple meals, eventually the deep fat fryer’s oil will need replacing entirely due to the build-up of food particles from past meals. While such buildups won’t affect the taste of meals immediately, eventually it can drastically influence flavors, so the indicator will become a huge aid in keeping your meals delicious.","The small deep fryer comes equipped with multiple controls in the form of a dial, buttons and digital display. The dial at the front of the fryer controls the filtration of oil. It has a setting for frying, which filters oil back into the main cooking area. Then you can switch to automatic oil filtration to clean the oil and put it in the sealable oil container or simply have it drain into the container without filtering. In addition, the display controls allow you to adjust the temperature and timer.","The Emeril FR7015001 places particular emphasis on creating a truly professional and efficient low fat fryer. With the inclusion of its ability to filter oil and store it in a container, this device will prove an invaluable aid in prolonging the number of meals you can get from your oil. Combined with its heating element and controls, this fryer will help you in creating tasty and tender meals."]},"id":"2b46f2d9-fb29-4fa2-92b7-2945b1852d97","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59011","url":"/emeril-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-06T14:40:53Z","datePublished":"2014-03-06T14:40:53Z","name":"Emeril FR7015001","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
