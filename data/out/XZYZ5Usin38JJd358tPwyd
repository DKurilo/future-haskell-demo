You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Mr. Coffee is well known for its quality appliances, especially those relating to coffee, so the Mr. Coffee Cafe Espresso ECMP50-NP <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a> is a something of a surprise since it brews rather lackluster espresso and is not especially easy to use, at least not at first.","Once you figure it out, it is much easier to operate but nonetheless, it is still not an especially intuitive machine. The best bet is to read the instructions carefully and then experiment with this semi-automatic espresso maker.","You begin by priming the pump, which takes less than a minute. The hot water that flows into the portafilter runs freely and does not stop automatically, so you must turn it off yourself.","One thing we found during our taste testing is that it helps to release a little water into the portafilter first, stop the flow, let it steep a bit and then resume making espresso. With this approach, you get a better, stronger and fuller flavor. Otherwise, if you make espresso according to the directions in the user manual, the resulting beverage is weak, even if you use the correct grind for your coffee beans. This espresso maker does not use coffee pods.","You can brew two shots simultaneously with this espresso maker, and the outside of the machine stays cool to the touch. Our measurements showed it reached a temperature of 111.2 degrees F. This also is one of the quietest espresso machines we tested, with the sound during operation reaching 64 decibels, which is on the lower end of the spectrum, close to what a normal conversation sounds like at a distance of three to five feet away. This is helpful if you get up earlier than others in your household and want some espresso without waking everybody else.","This compact and attractive espresso maker gives you a 40-ounce water reservoir on the back, so you can see if you are running low on water. Forty ounces is somewhat small, compared some of the other espresso machines we reviewed, but it still does the job nicely.","This comes with a tamper that has a measuring spoon on the other end. Espresso purists dislike these types of tools and prefer a tamper with a flat head at the top because they claim you can apply different levels of pressure with your hand more easily. However, we encountered no problems tamping coffee grounds with this tool, and it is always useful to have a measuring spoon included with an espresso machine when you buy it. If you feel strongly about the tamper, you can always buy one separately since these are inexpensive and easily available.","While the coffee-brewing aspect of this home espresso maker is a bit disappointing, the easily swiveled steam wand performs better and once you master it, you can create some coffee drinks with nicely steamed milk.","However, our testing showed inconsistent results regarding the foam it creates. We tested five milks, including dairy milk with varying amounts of milk fat as well as soy and almond milk. In some tests, the foam was excellent – silky, creamy and rich with a microfoam. But in other instances, we got very little foam and an abundance of big bubbles, not the results you want from a cappuccino maker."]},"id":"40b7c8cb-fb14-4689-a70a-a3e0c4d903b0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6bc6bbd2-96e5-49f5-a48c-6f1368ff8ed8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This quiet semi-automatic home espresso maker can create good-tasting espresso if you steep the grounds briefly, but its steam wand produces variable results.
