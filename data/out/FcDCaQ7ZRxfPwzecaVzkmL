Magazines have evolved over hundreds of years to become what we know and love today and whilst magazines were perhaps available in many different forms, the first time the  magazine  term was used was in 1731. The Gentleman s Magazine is thought to be the first publication of a magazine by Sylvanus Urban, real name Edward Cave. The term  magazine  sprang from an analogy of the Arabic s term for a storehouse,  makazin .","The magazine was then published on a monthly basis in London by Edward Cave and included topics of public interest, a bit like most of our magazines do today even though they are more specialized now. This magazine publication ran from 1731   1922 in various different formats and renowned English author Samuel Johnson even began his career writing for The Gentleman s Magazine. Not only did Cave create the term  magazine  but he also developed the distribution ideas for magazines, so that his publication could be read internationally in the English speaking world. Thus Cave created the mass publicized glossy magazines that we see today, but how did they originate?","<strong>The origins of Vogue </strong>","Vogue itself has been in publication for over one hundred years, first appearing back in 1892, but its road to global success hasn t been an easy one. At first the magazine was a weekly one created by Arthur Baldwin Turnure which continued on a low-key publication until Turnure s death in 1909. The magazine was then taken over by Cond  Nast who changed the publication to two-weekly and began spreading the publication to other countries; Britain, Spain and France. It could be said that Nast s venture to France was the one that really shot Vogue into the limelight as the magazine sales and profit increased dramatically.","Throughout times of hardship such as the World Wars, the Depression and so on, Vogue s magazine sales were raised showing the true impact and uplifting element a magazine can have. However, the magazines true defining feature seems to come under the editorial guidance of Diana Vreeland who took over during the 60 s and the time of the Sexual Revolution. Vreeland turned the magazine into the fashion frenzied, openly sexual, contemporary personality that it has today. Not only did Vogue itself become a household name, but their appearance in it made several models household names, e.g. Twiggy.","Vogue is now available in monthly publications under the editorial eye of Anna Wintour who has been editor-in-chief for over twenty years since she took over in 1988. Wintour herself has developed the magazine to incorporate a wider audience and access different ideas of what fashion really is.","<strong>The origins of Esquire</strong>","Man s magazine Esquire may not have been available for as long as women s magazine Vogue but evoked the same publication needs as Vogue did during the Depression. Esquire s first publication was during this time of the depression in October 1933, beginning as more of an erotic magazine at first. However with contributions from distinguished American authors, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway the magazine began to feature refined articles and fashion features.","Not only is Esquire one of the male magazine pioneers for what we see today but it was also responsible for pioneering  New Journalism  throughout the 60 s. New Journalism is basically a style of journalism that was thought to be eccentric and unconventional and was responsible for giving new modes of thinking to other forms of the press. Writers included in this revolt in Esquire publications were Tom Wolfe, Norman Mailer, Tim O Brien and many more.","Since then the magazine has changed editors and companies many times but still remains a popular magazine of today. David Granger is the current editor-in-chief having been appointed in 1997 and has since won numerous National Magazine Awards for the magazine.","Just by delving into the history of two of the most popular magazines produced one can see how involved magazines are within our societies. They have paved the way we think and see things, which even goes back to The Gentleman s Magazine nearly three hundred years ago. Magazines are wrapped up in our societies and its boundaries and provide us with hours of cheap, accessible entertainment.","If you re considering ordering your magazines online, be sure to visit our <a href=\"/best-magazine-subscriptions\">magazine subscription</a> review site you ll find comprehensive reviews and side-by-side comparisons of the best magazine subscription services available. ","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"a89a90fc-4165-4c9d-bad8-5557d5e06df6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_3868","url":"/where-do-magazines-come-from","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rm25","url":"/author/rm25","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"RM25","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"7NZK6G9JQsTULzvBacR8hg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-01-15T17:26:44Z","datePublished":"2010-01-15T17:26:44Z","name":"Where do Magazines come from?","synopsis":"While an online magazine subscription or digital magazine is very ordinary today, it wasn't always this way.","review":{},"strapline":"While an online magazine subscription or digital magazine is very ordinary today, it wasn't always this way.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-01-25T17:51:08Z","id":"FcDCaQ7ZRxfPwzecaVzkmL","meta":{"title":"Where do Magazines come from?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
