Series 1 Pro is an open-format <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D printer</a> with a huge print capacity. This large printer also has completely wireless printing via Wi-Fi and an online dashboard you can access from any device. With its wide variety of compatible filaments types, the Series 1 Pro is a great choice for custom projects.","During testing, we found the Series 1 Pro performed well. We printed with PLA for our stress tests, and this 3D printer’s models had straight corners and precise positioning, and the machine doesn’t overheat. There were some slight surface quality issues, but overall, each print was highly successful. The print plate is incredibly large. In fact, it’s the largest in our review – you can print models up to 12 x 12 x 12 inches in size. The next closest printer is the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lulzbot-taz-6-3d-printer,review-3639.html\">Lulzbot TAZ 6</a> with a 11 x 11 x 9.8-inch capacity. ","The Type A Series 1 Pro uses PLA and 30 other types of filament, including bronze, flexible materials, nylon and more. The machine’s heated bed is an upgrade from the previous version. Type A’s replacement filament cartridges are reasonably priced, however, you don&#39;t get one for free with your printer. The machine accepts universal and generic filament, so you can bargain hunt and select from more colors. This is one of the best home 3D printers because of its cost-effective and flexible filament options.","This printer is truly wireless and connects to your Wi-Fi network via a wireless router, or you can connect it with an Ethernet cable. The Series 1 Pro even includes a little antenna to boost the signal. This unique printer doesn’t have a screen, like many of the printers on our review including the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ultimaker-3-3d-printer,review-4131.html\">Ultimaker 3</a>. Instead, you control it with an online interface. You can access the online dashboard from your phone, laptop, tablet or any other device that connects to the internet. From there, you can preheat the machine, start and stop prints, move the print head, and more. One of the Series 1 Pro’s best features is its built-in webcam, which allows you to see the model, bed and print head in real time.","You can’t modify or slice models from the online interface, so you need Cura, which you can download for free on the Type A website. In our testing, we found that Cura is one of the best 3D printing programs for both beginners and advanced users.","The Type A Series 1 Pro is one of the best 3D printers if you plan on modifying or customizing your machine. The company even backs custom builds and additions with its warranty. This is really rare, as most warranties don’t even cover the print head. The Pro has an open structure that gives you full access to standard components and plenty of room to add modifications. It also has one of the easiest designs to work with – you don’t need a manual to set up or use this printer.","While it doesn’t have any automatic features, such as auto leveling or auto cleaning, the Pro was one of the easiest 3D printers to maintain and keep printing properly as we tested for our 3D printer comparison. We also found it had a very fast start up time, which means you don’t have to wait very long between pressing print and the machine laying down the first layer. This 31-pound printer is all aluminum and steel, and it doesn’t rock or shake while it prints, which helps with print quality. The glass plate is heated and very easy to maintain.","This 3D printer comes with a 12-month warranty, and you also have access to unlimited technical support. We found that the support staff responded quickly to our questions. When we had a printing problem, technical support representatives were personable and knowledgeable, and our issue was resolved in less than a day. The company’s website has phone contact information, a manual and video tutorials, and the tech support page is very comprehensive."]},"id":"f0f581e7-8f6c-4b08-944c-cfa87b1f1c57","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"398f3e84-9bf7-42bd-ba0e-cac6acd2eff8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Type A Series 1 Pro is a perfect companion if you’re a DIYer interested in modifying your 3D printer.
