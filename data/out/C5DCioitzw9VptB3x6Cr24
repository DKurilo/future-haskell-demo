It is one of the most expensive on the market, and it comes with plenty of features to justify the price.","This running headlamp has reactive lighting technology, so it adjusts to the conditions you find on your run. The built-in light sensor assesses current conditions and makes adjustments instantly, so you are never caught unaware by oncoming headlights, dark tunnels, or a floodlight turning on. The beam itself is smooth and uniform. Since it isn&#39;t concentrated in any one place, you don&#39;t miss any visual details on the periphery.","The Petzl Nao produces between 7 and 575 lumens, depending on the settings you choose. Two lighting modes let you optimize power output for brightness or burn time, so you can decide whether a brighter or longer-lasting light is preferable for any given run. You can also set the light to operate at a constant light level, and choose between low, medium and high options instead of activating reactive lighting. In battery-saving mode, the light works for up to 10 hours before running the battery down. You can preprogram the light using your personal computer and set the parameters you want without having to adjust details when you&#39;re on the road.","This running headlamp uses a lithium-ion rechargeable battery that can be charged using the included USB cable and your computer or with a standard micro-USB charging cable. You can also opt to use this running headlight with two AAA batteries instead, so you have another alternative if you don&#39;t want to wait for the rechargeable battery to get back up to full power before using your headlamp again. It takes about 5 hours for the battery to recharge.","With a water resistance rating of IPX-4, the Petzl Nao headlamp can hold up to splashes and splatters, so running in the rain isn&#39;t a problem. You can also wear it on snowy days because this unit continues to work great in low temperatures. The stable design keeps the running headlamp secure while you run, so it doesn&#39;t slip or slide on your head. The top strap holds it in place during particularly vigorous activities.","The bright beam and reactive lighting technology of the Petzl Nao make it a powerful addition to your night running gear collection. This high-performance model is best for a runner who enjoys exerting precise control over the conditions of a run."]},"id":"a22c2152-2ee3-46d4-98f5-0e2fd1529914","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62542","url":"/petzl-nao-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:44:52Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:44:52Z","name":"Petzl Nao REACTIVE Rechargeable","synopsis":"The Petzl Nao headlamp is a high-end running headlight that offers premium performance during outdoor activities.
