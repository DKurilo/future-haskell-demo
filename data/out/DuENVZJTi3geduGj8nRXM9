Personal Cash Advance specializes in matching you with an online personal loan so you can get cash between paydays for emergency expenses. Although other personal loans online have better interest rates and more options, a Personal Cash Advance loan is an option if you have bad credit and need money fast.","Fast cash loans are supposed to be just that: fast. Although you can be approved for up to $1,500, you&#39;ll have to wait hours to find out. With many of the other best personal loans, you usually wait only seconds for approval. Your APR will depend on your individual lender but can range between 36% and 615%, pretty average for the best online loans. There is no option to have more than one loan at a time, however, so you&#39;ll need to pay the first one off before applying for a second loan if you need one. Like some of the top-ranked cash loan online services, Personal Cash Advance is simply a loan matching company that helps you get a loan from a separate lender. When you apply for a payday loan, it will query its database of participating lenders and submit your application to the networks best suited to your needs. Personal Cash Advance operates out of Wilmington, Del. It offers site encryption to protect your personal information, but does allow applications over the phone.","This company&#39;s loan application is a five-step process that requires the usual information, including employment history and Social Security number. You won&#39;t have to fax documents, there is no employment duration requirement, and there is no formal credit check. You also won&#39;t be disqualified for having a bankruptcy on your financial history. Even if you have terrible credit, it will be easy to find a bad-credit loan though Personal Cash Advance.","Many of the terms in your loan are dependent on which lender provides the loan. Such things as early repayment and term lengths will vary depending on your lender. However, many lenders do allow extensions, require fees for late payments and offer electronic transfer of payments. Generally, the maximum term you can expect to see is only 14 days, which is much less than the best personal loan companies. Sadly, Personal Cash Advance does not give many examples or details regarding what you can expect to see in your loan policy, which means you won’t find out any details until you apply.","Phone support is rather comprehensive and quickly puts you in contact with a representative who can easily answer any questions or address any reservations you have regarding their loans. There is no live chat support, but you do have access to support through email and a FAQs section. As always, because Personal Cash Advance is simply the loan matching service, you&#39;ll need to contact your individual lender for support once you have received your loan funds."]},"id":"34b6da78-007a-45c3-b431-707d1041ea35","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9883051d-6425-4de9-831e-89ed646ef77d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Unlike other services that carefully outline and detail the entire loan process, Personal Cash Advance leaves you mostly in the dark.
