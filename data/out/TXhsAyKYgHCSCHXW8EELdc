SkinIt protectors also have an oil-resistant coating. While this screen protector will keep your phone safe from small scratches and light impact, anything more will likely go through the screen protector and mar the screen. Additionally, it doesn&#39;t fit to the edges of your phone.","When we contacted the company for information about how thick and hard the material is, we didn&#39;t receive a response. However, it&#39;s obvious from our tests that the material is not very hard or thick, especially in comparison to many of the other products we tested. In addition to being a little flimsy, it&#39;s also more difficult to apply to an iPhone screen than other products we reviewed. However, if you are slow, taking care to work out air bubbles as you go, your iPhone screen will be smooth. Still, the SkinIt phone covers aren&#39;t the same texture at the iPhone&#39;s screen.","This iPhone screen protector doesn&#39;t fit exactly over the surface of the screen, even though SkinIt has precut protectors for the iPhone 6, 5 and 4. Instead, the screen protectors stop a little shy of the edge of the screen. In time, the edges may be more susceptible to peeling and wear. The SkinIt iPhone cover is also easy to peel off once you apply it. This may indicate that it won&#39;t stay in place as long if you slide the phone in and out of a pocket or purse frequently.","SkinIt provides a FAQs section on its website for common problems and concerns, and if you have a question that goes beyond the basic answers, you can contact a representative via email. Unfortunately, the company doesn&#39;t offer a warranty beyond the 30-day return policy.","There are no privacy-filter or glare-reduction options available with the SkinIt iPhone 6 screen protectors, leaving you with only the standard clear option. Typically, this is adequate, but if you feel the need for extra privacy or if you use your phone a lot while you&#39;re outside, you might want to look at other options."]},"id":"d97d4142-43a2-415f-b486-f064ac2ab100","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9c62f0a6-9f22-4c26-a686-efdb92d62556","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re looking for a basic PET film to cover your iPhone screen, the SkinIt iPhone screen protector could be the product for you.
