In the unlikely event that you need to cancel your trip or make a claim, the travel benefits kick in and help you recover from travel mishaps.","When it comes to medical benefits, you get $25,000 in emergency medical coverage and a generous $500,000 if a situation arises where you must be transported somewhere to get proper emergency medical care. This policy also includes $500 for emergency dental coverage.","Travel Guard provides useful travel benefits including compensation of $750 if your trip is delayed for five hours, which is among the shortest delay times around. You also can be compensated $250 if there is a missed connection of three hours. The Gold plan offers $1,000 to replace your baggage if it is lost and $300 if it is delayed for 12 hours.","A useful extra benefit is the identity theft assistance you can get from this holiday insurance firm if your wallet is lost or stolen. The company will help you obtain credit report records so you can keep track of what – if anything – is happening with your valuable credit rating.","Travel Guard also provides helpful concierge services that will lend a hand in sending flowers to someone, lining up tickets to events, arranging for tee time at golf courses and more.","As far as optional benefits go, you can purchase up to $500,000 of coverage for common carrier accidental death and dismemberment. This is particularly helpful if you are the source of your household&#39;s primary income and you want to provide for your family in the unlikely event of your death or dismemberment while traveling. To protect your rental car, you can purchase $35,000, but that is subject to a $250 deductible. Coverage involves $9 each day you have the car.","Travel Guard&#39;s customer support is available anytime to answer questions and help with your vacation. It offers a host of services for policyholders, such as travel medical assistance, worldwide travel assistance and LiveTravel emergency assistance.","If you compare travel insurance plans, Travel Guard has the most generous satisfaction guarantee of any product in our review at 15 days."]},"id":"ebf7cf16-dd82-444e-b6a8-8b4bada1b99e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a33b34ae-754c-449f-863e-4c88462a44fd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When it comes to inexpensive travel insurance, Travel Guard Gold gives you great protection for a reasonable price.
