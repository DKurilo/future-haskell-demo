Canon&#39;s Pixma line is designed for consumers, so medium-sized businesses should look at Canon&#39;s Maxify line or at other brands for a unit that can handle high-print volumes, like the <a href=\"/hp-officejet-pro-review\">HP Officejet Pro</a>, our top pick for all-in-one printers.Â ","One of this printer&#39;s greatest strengths is its ability to automatically print on both sides of a page. This feature, commonly called automatic duplexing, saves you money on paper and is environmentally friendly.","Another helpful feature is its automatic document feeder. The ADF allows you to place a multi-page document on the tray, and it automatically scans each page. This is an essential feature if your home office or small business does a lot of faxing.","Most printers we reviewed had a monthly duty cycle rating, which defines how many pages the printer can print in a month without being damaged. However, Canon does not rate its Pixma printers, because it considers them to be consumer-grade printers. The MX922 has no problem printing a dozen documents a day, but if you&#39;re printing all day, every day, you should look elsewhere.","You can connect to the MX922 wirelessly from a host of devices. It&#39;s Wi-Fi enabled, so if you own a wireless router, you can connect to your Wi-Fi network and print from anywhere in your house. This multifunction printer also supports AirPrint, which means Apple users can print from their iPads, iPhones and Macs, as long as they are connected to the same network. Android phone and tablet users can download Canon&#39;s free app and print photos from their mobile devices.","The MX922 has print speeds on par with the best all-in-one printers. It produces black-and-white documents at a speed of 15 pages per minute and color documents at 10 pages per minute.","We interacted with Canon&#39;s phone service representatives several times, and each time we came away impressed. They were knowledgeable and patient, and they had a good knowledge of the entire Canon printer line."]},"id":"81c35041-e47c-42c8-b8a1-18e8ece47106","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8deb4571-5c86-4f6d-9cff-b7fbf5813501","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This printer is exceptional for a home office or a small business.
