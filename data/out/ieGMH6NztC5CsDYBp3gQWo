You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","<a href=\"/electronics/computers\">A home computer</a> is an important investment. Getting the right machine will make your life easier whether you are balancing your bank account or watching movie previews. The HP<strong> </strong>Pavilion Slimline s5-1400t<strong> </strong>has a few things going for it, like the quick processing speed, but there are some disadvantages as well, such as the limited free support options and no Blu-ray player. This particular desktop computer would certainly prove useful, but it doesn&#39;t have anything special about it.","There are a couple of great features when it comes to the specifications of this computer. The first is that it comes with a 1TB hard drive. This gives you plenty of space for all of your documents and images. We also loved the fact that the AMD Intel Core i3-2130 Dual Core processor has a speed of 3.4 GHz. The 6GB of RAM is good, but not as high as we like to see, especially if you want to run multiple applications. The clock speed is also less than what we typically saw on other home computers. It isn&#39;t bad at 1066 MHz, but it is less.","The operating system of the HP Pavilion Slimline s5-1400t is Windows 8. We were pleased that there is an option to add a wireless adapter, but we wish it came wireless ready. The tower is set up to read memory cards so you won&#39;t have to purchase an external device, which we found useful. It also comes with a DVD writer, but we feel that a Blu-ray player would have been more useful. USB ports are used to connect everything from a mouse to your MP3 player so it is important that you have enough to do connect everything you need to. This home computer only has six, which isn&#39;t too bad, but we would have liked to see more.","The support is where the HP Pavilion Slimline s5-1400t lacked the most. We don&#39;t like it when it costs extra to get the help you might need when your computer is having problems. HP offers email, phone and live support for free if you happen to be under warranty; otherwise you have to pay extra. We were pleased that the user forums are free no matter your warranty status. Though we don&#39;t like the fact that you have to pay extra, the warranty does last for two years.  A one-year warranty seems to be the standard for other home computers. And if the warranty isn&#39;t long enough, you can always purchase a longer warranty if you want the extra protection and free support."]},"id":"56178899-1e3c-4c83-b3ef-0f296027a345","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"df3778c6-6fbf-4bb9-a73d-71e3d3e29a97","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the HP Pavilion Slimline s5-1400t is a good computer.

While there are a few features you might want to upgrade, the processing speed and hard drive are excellent to begin with so that is something you won&#39;t have to worry about."]},"id":"38d67ff7-9c78-433a-9b64-1298723fbc07","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53860","url":"/hp-pavilion-slimline-s5-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-10-25T19:42:29Z","datePublished":"2011-10-25T19:42:29Z","name":"HP Pavilion Slimline s5-1400t","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"There are some good features but other areas require upgrading.
