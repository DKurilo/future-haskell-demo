The magnification doesn&#39;t give you the most up-close view of the world around you, so these aren&#39;t the best binoculars for stargazing or long-range hunting. However, lower magnifications allow wider fields of view. The Leupold has a relatively wide field of view at 107 meters, which means you can track birds, sports or potential quarry with it.","This pair of binoculars has 42-millimeter objective lenses, which are the lenses farthest away from your eyes when you use the binoculars. These relatively large objective lenses allow more light to enter the binoculars and reach your eyes, resulting in bright images. This is especially useful in low light settings, such as hunting at dusk or dawn.","One of the reasons the Leupold BX-1 McKenzie produces bright, sharp images is the lens and prism coatings it has. First, the lenses are fully multicoated, which diminishes light reflecting away from the optics and away from your eyes, so objects appear bright as you view them. Second, the binoculars use BAK-4 prisms. BAK-4 is a high-quality material that produces sharp, crisp images and edge-to-edge clarity. Finally, the prism is phase coated, a requirement for these binoculars&#39; design, which helps prevent light beams from splitting as they reflect in the prism, producing clear images."]},"id":"037030c2-8d5b-4103-bf6a-d331cbc9c566","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Usability"},"id":"376d7bc5-3390-418f-b95b-2ec08de98317","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/ZSMVibzxxcWtQYbxLAHgEJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Leupold BX-1 McKenzie only weighs 22.1 ounces, which is lighter than the average binocular weight of 26 ounces.
