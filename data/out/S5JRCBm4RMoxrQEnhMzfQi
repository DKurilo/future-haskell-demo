They look great and sound good, but the price tag is not proportional to the sound quality. The package still merits consideration because the awesome warranty compensates somewhat for the expense.","These speakers don&#39;t have as broad a range as we like to see, especially towards the low end of the spectrum. The subwoofer is not necessarily weak on the bass, just less flexible. The sensitivity rating comes in at 84 decibels, which means that these speakers are quite a bit less power efficient than the industry standard for bookshelf speakers.

The satellites feature a 4&#34; fiberglass woofer with a 1&#34; silk dome tweeter and a removable grille. You may note that the center channel speaker really stands out from the satellites. This can be good for getting clear dialogue, but it also has a negative impact on the overall unity of the surround sound. Both the satellites and center channel speakers are magnetically shielded to protect your television and other electronics. The powered subwoofer features an 8&#34; down firing aluminum driver.","The speakers and subwoofer are large and they won&#39;t be easy to hide. Fortunately, the cabinets are handsome, coming in two varieties: cherry wood and high-gloss black, either of which will look beautiful in your home. They are made of high-density reinforced fiberboard that resists resonation.","These speakers sound good, but the individual units don&#39;t run together as seamlessly as they should. Sound quality also deteriorates as the volume increases. Chances are that you will be satisfied with the sound if you are just getting your hands dirty with your first home theater system, but seasoned audiophiles may be less impressed.","Installing your home theater speaker system should be simple. Each unit comes with high-quality five-way binding posts to get your system wired up quickly. Placement options are limited because the speakers are too large for wall mounts so you will have to find adequate places to set them. Bookshelves and end tables are ideal.","The warranty is excellent. It covers ten years for parts and labor on the speakers and three years for electrical components—more than double the typical home theater speaker warranty. Better yet, it is transferable."]},"id":"971b70ea-fb9f-4993-b1fb-2500e2d7f0d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce832b30-ca75-4c4a-91ef-3fd589c131d5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Intimus 4B Harmony SA home theater speaker system produces clear but imperfect sound.
