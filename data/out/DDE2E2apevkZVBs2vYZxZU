Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Verizon first introduced the HTC Droid Incredible in 2010, and it was a huge success. Professional reviewers and independent testers loved the original Droid Incredible for its specs and usability, and its U.S. sales were impressive. Verizon recently released the second iteration of this <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a>, called the HTC Droid Incredible 2. While it&#39;s not drastically changed from the original, it boasts some welcome upgrades including a unibody design, a better camera and some impressive multimedia features, to name a few.","The most noticeable change in the smartphone is the body design. The original Droid Incredible was somewhat bulky and even felt like cheep plastic to some reviewers. However, the new design features an all-aluminum unibody case. Users say this makes the phone look seamless and sleeker, and that it feels more solid. The Droid Incredible 2 also offers a 4-inch display screen with an 800 by 480 pixel resolution. This is another welcome upgrade from the original smartphone&#39;s 3.7-inch display.","The camera on the new Droid Incredible 2 also marks one of the biggest improvements. The original Incredible only had a 720p HD camera, while the new Incredible 2 boasts a full 8MP camera with dual LED flash. The 8MP camera is one of the highest megapixel cameras offered in the smartphone industry. The camera also offers built-in face-detection software, and user reviews say the camera takes equally impressive shots outdoors, indoors and in dark settings. The video camera is reported to perform very well, and this smartphone even boasts a 1.3MP front-facing camera for making video phone calls.","Another new feature of the Droid Incredible 2 is the SRS WOWHD surround sound for videos and music. The Droid Incredible 2 is one of the first smartphones to offer this multimedia experience. Many users say that they do not notice a difference in sound quality when music or audio from video is playing through the smartphone&#39;s external speakers. However, when those same users put on high-quality headphones, they notice a significant improvement in sound quality as compared to either the original Droid Incredible or other smartphones. The Incredible 2 also now features built-in noise-cancellation software, which users say really does allow for clearer calls.","Some downsides to the Droid Incredible 2 in relation to competing smartphones include processing speeds and the lack of 4G connectivity. The Incredible 2 uses a 1GHz Qualcomm MSM8655 Snapdragon processor, which only means slightly slower processing speeds than competing smartphones that offer dual-core processors. Using your smartphone on a 3G or 4G network also makes for a big difference in speed. In some tests, 3G speeds are just a fraction of 4G speeds, so the fact that you cannot access the 4G networks with the Incredible 2 will be a deal breaker for some."]},"id":"a919a1bd-fd80-4524-8796-cf0e20104c50","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e6bf7d78-0845-4a07-bbf3-c7984f330d55","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The original HTC Droid Incredible is well loved by reviewers and users alike, and the Droid HTC Incredible 2 makes some well thought out and welcome upgrades to the original smartphone.

However, the Droid HTC Incredible 2 is still an excellent, affordable and competitive choice for those who are in the market for a new smartphone."]},"id":"6c567eca-14d4-4155-9e88-236227d206de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53533","url":"/htc-droid-incredible-2-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-30T21:27:57Z","datePublished":"2011-08-30T21:27:57Z","name":"HTC Droid Incredible 2","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":57,"verdict":"If you do not care about accessing a 4G network, the Incredible 2 should be high on the list for your next smartphone purchase.","pros":["A sleek, aluminum, unibody design, 8-megapixel camera, surround sound, excellent usability ratings and affordable price make this an excellent smartphone."],"cons":["The phone lacks a dual-core processor and the option to connect to 4G networks."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-30T21:27:57Z","id":"DDE2E2apevkZVBs2vYZxZU","meta":{"title":"HTC Droid Incredible 2 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
