Our team of video experts has scoured through each product looking for key tools, features and extras that make your watching experience more enjoyable. They focus on finding software that have easy-to-use interfaces, don’t strain computer processing power, have high-quality audio and video playback, and include customization options.","We also considered what media each program can play besides DVDs. The best ones also play Blu-ray discs and other digital media stored on your computer. In addition, our favorite products come with organizational tools that let you access and play all your media files in one place.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We subjected each DVD player program to a battery of tests to measure its performance, usability and playback quality.","Performance Test<br/>In this test, we evaluated each program based on its capacity to play video without lagging, buffering, or other distortions or delays. We also considered the number of audio and picture optimization settings each application has, as well as how well they work.","For reference, a difference of a few percentage points in the programs’ scores shouldn’t have a big impact on which software you choose. We just felt that applications with higher scores worked slightly better than ones graded a little bit lower.","Usability Test<br/>We designed this test to determine how easy each software is to use, including how intuitive it is, how many important features and settings it has, and how well it performs each task. Great DVD player programs have interfaces that are easy to understand and navigate right off the bat.","Additionally, we tested each application’s customization options and other features, such as modifiable video effects. As we customized playback and used extra features, we judged them based on how easy they are to find and use, as well as how well they work.","CPU Usage Test<br/>We played a test DVD and monitored how much the software strained our computer&#39;s CPU. We played the movie without any extra features activated or other programs running. The percentage score we list is the amount of processing power the software used while playing the movie in full screen.","Software that uses a higher percent of your computer’s CPU power may make other programs run slowly if you use them at the same time, or you may hear the computer fan running to keep the processor from overheating. Applications that use fewer system resources are better because you can run other programs while you watch movies, and you don’t have to listen to the high-pitched buzzing of a processor fan.","<strong>Key Aspects of DVD Player Software</strong>","How Much Does DVD Player Software Cost?<br/>You can expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $100 for DVD player software – which sounds like a lot, because it is. Especially since Windows Media Player comes free with the operating system and plays DVDs rather well. The value comes in what else you can do with it – nevertheless, it’s hard to justify paying $100 for the ability to watch DVDs on your computer.","Performance: High-Quality, Lossless Video &amp; Audio<br/>The best DVD player programs don’t degrade video or audio quality. Many offer Dolby and DTS support, so you get crisp, clean sound, as well as lossless audio, even when you use an HDMI cable or headphones. Top products can also optimize DVD content to take full advantage of new high-definition displays.","Quality software also includes a variety of playback options. For example, these applications let you automatically resume watching right where you left off. They also have smooth playback so you don&#39;t waste time waiting for your video to load and buffer.","Options &amp; Settings: Customize &amp; Control<br/>The biggest benefit of using DVD player software over a physical player is you have much more control over quality settings and controls. The applications also have a larger selection of customization features such as player skins and layouts. These extra features can help you organize your content and make the program even more intuitive, which is convenient if you use the software frequently. Furthermore, paid software doesn’t hassle you with nag screens, which pop up when you open the software or at random intervals to ask you to upgrade to a premium version, something that’s common with freeware.","You may want to re-watch a funny section of a comedy flick or zoom in on a specific detail in a mystery thriller, and good DVD player software lets you do so. These programs typically let you customize your video settings, so you can set bookmarks, loop and repeat clips, or even just stretch the video to fit your screen. Some software can also connect with and optimize your home theater&#39;s audiovisual setup.","Windows 8 and 10 don’t come with native media players, though their predecessors did, and a good movie player software can fill that void. Some programs are even compatible with the touchscreen interfaces found on select Windows 8 machines.","Most applications can also integrate with your personal video library on your computer&#39;s hard drive or an external drive. A few even let you post directly to your favorite social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, so you can share what you&#39;re currently watching with a small comment, just like a true movie critic.","Help &amp; Support: Get Information &amp; Upgrade Your Software<br/>With great software comes great technical support, or at least it should. Consider products that offer a way to contact the manufacturer, as well as online documentation that can answer your questions or ease your concerns such as tutorials, a knowledgebase or a FAQs section.","One of our favorite support features is a user forum, which some manufacturers include on their websites. Forums let you interact directly and indirectly with other people using the product to ask questions, report issues or just talk over your common bond.","Lastly, whether for Mac OS X or PC, your DVD player software should offer some kind of free upgrade option. Most come with free minor upgrades for life and make you pay for major upgrades, though your software will continue to work fine if you choose not to upgrade. Very few manufacturers offer free minor and major lifetime upgrades.","Supported Media Types: Make Sure You Can Watch Your Favorite Videos<br/>While most people use DVD player software to play DVDs, many also enjoy playing their favorite digital video files. Some player software allows you to play DVD-R/RW discs. Only a few play Blu-ray discs, so if your movie collection is predominantly Blu-ray, you may want to consider <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-player-software\">Blu-ray player software</a>, which typically has more all-encompassing options.","<strong>What&#39;s the Best DVD Player to Buy?</strong>","In the age of ultra-high-definition Blu-ray discs, streaming services and digital downloads, you could be forgiven for thinking DVD is dead. However, this is far from true. Unlike other formats like <a href=\"/format-wars\">VHS</a> and Laserdisc, DVD has been able to hold on to some relevance. There are still millions upon millions of DVDs in people’s media collections. Unfortunately, the DVD player you bought in 2000 probably doesn’t work anymore, even if the discs you bought back then do. And watching DVDs on a computer just doesn’t provide the same experience as a TV.","While it makes the most sense to buy a <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a> to watch your old DVDs, it’s not always the best option – especially if you have an old standard definition television. We’ve tested, rated and ranked the <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">best DVD players</a> on the market today. At the end of our analysis, <a href=\"/panasonic-dvd-s700-review\">Panasonic DVD-S700</a> was our top overall choice. This is due to its simple physical layout and quick disc load times as well as some extra features. This player keeps track of where you paused or stopped watching on the last six DVDs it played. So, if you’re switching between movies, you can pick up right where you left off even if you’ve watched other things since then.","<strong>Do Windows &amp; Mac Have DVD Player Software?</strong>","Every Windows and Mac computer comes with a preloaded media player. For Windows, it’s Media Player. This is a handy tool that’s been packaged with Windows for many years, but it doesn’t play DVDs – you need third-party software to play them.","On the other hand, Mac computers have a native DVD player program, and it launches whenever you insert a playable DVD. However, it is very basic. For example, it&#39;s missing features for region changing, digital zooming and HD upscaling as well as organizational tools and more.","<strong>Best Free DVD Player Software<br/></strong>","There’s really no worthy competition for the free, open source media player VLC. It’s been around for ages and is a go-to program for people who want a free alternative to iTunes and Media Player. VLC looks and runs a lot like iTunes, and it’s easy to navigate and has decent organizational tools. In addition, it works on almost all operating systems, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and more.  "]},"id":"4d995778-2619-4db3-9b00-e8857654e540","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_264","url":"/best-dvd-player-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
