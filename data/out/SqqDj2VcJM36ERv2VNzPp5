The indoor antenna is flat and lightweight and comes with sticky mounts to adhere the device to your wall, window or even the back of the TV to hide the antenna.","We tested the HD digital antenna in two different locations: our downtown office and in a second-floor apartment a few miles south of the downtown office. Our office building has obstructions such as taller surrounding buildings and trees in the immediate area. This can disrupt a TV signal. In our office we were only able to receive 12 total channels. Even our non-amplified models like the <a href=\"/insignia-review\">Insignia Fine Tuning Indoor</a> antenna were able to pick up at least 12, so this number was disappointing. We were unable to receive CBS, PBS and ABC – three major network channels. NBC came in with great clarity. The other channels included the Home Shopping Network and all of its subchannels, all of which came through nice and clear.","In our second location, we received much different channel reception results. This time we were able to pick up 31 channels with the indoor HDTV antenna, more than the <a href=\"/terk-review\">Terk OMNITV20 FLAT</a>. There are no obstructions outside of the apartment windows, making it easier for signal to reach the antenna and resulting in more channels.","Even though we received more channels in the second location, many of them did not provide great reception. CBS, ABC and PBS were received this time, but with a decent amount of breakup in the signal. Regardless of the surrounding area, we simply couldn’t get good reception on all of the major networks – the channels that usually provide the strongest and clearest signal out.","The Mohu Leaf 50 is amplified, so it does come with a separate power source that needs to be plugged into the wall. The included coaxial cable is 16 feet long. This is one of the longer coaxial cables and gives you enough slack to find the best spot in your home. Some of the cables for other antennas are only a few feet long, which doesn’t give much leeway to find the sweet spot for reception in your home.","The Leaf 50 is covered by a one-year warranty. This is a standard warranty length for most digital HDTV antennas. If you have any questions regarding your digital TV antenna, you can contact Mohu via email or phone."]},"id":"4e68c61a-5c03-4b48-9105-b3b1ce085da7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a4b41dc6-f91e-4b18-9d4c-7f08b04cc31c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This amplified HDTV antenna can scan for channels in a 50-mile radius, but we were unable to get quality reception on major networks such as ABC, PBS and CBS.
