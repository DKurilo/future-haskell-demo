It is a tablet PC, running Windows 8 and any of its programs. It can run any PC game, giving you the power to play high-end titles on the go. However, in order to get the most out of this tablet gaming device, you have to buy its accessories, which cost up to $500 more. Also, the battery life means that you have to stay close to a power outlet. For the amount you have to spend in order to get the most out of the Razer Edge, you can get a better mobile gaming experience from a midrange gaming laptop.","On its own, the Razer Edge is a fairly impressive tablet PC. It has a 10.1-inch HD touchscreen, 4GB DDR3 RAM, a dual-core i5 processor and an Nvidia GT 640M graphics card. It comes packed with Windows 8, and it can run any program that your Windows 8 desktop can. Also, it is Bluetooth enabled, so you can pair a keyboard and mouse to save money on the keyboard dock. It only has 64GB of storage, and it does not have an SD card slot for expanded storage space.","If you want to get the most out of the Razer Edge, you have to buy at least one of the peripherals. The best of these is the gamepad controller with XInput, which makes it compatible with most modern games. The docking station has controller inputs and an HDMI port to turn the Edge into a video game console. Finally, the keyboard dock turns the tablet into a laptop computer.","Without at least one of these peripherals, the Edge is terrible for playing games. Imagine playing &#34;Grand Theft Auto V&#34; on a touchscreen. You&#39;ll have an easier time playing with a controller and 5-inch screen than with the Edge sans the gamepad controller peripheral. The worst part of all this, though, is that for the same amount of money, you could get a midrange gaming laptop and play the same games."]},"id":"b2328e15-62dc-4550-995b-f398c2a8bd3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0178c070-d545-42a6-8118-ef12077f6f2a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Razer Edge is a powerful tablet PC, but this premium handheld game console relies too heavily on peripherals.
