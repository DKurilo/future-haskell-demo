You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With a self-sanitizing brush head, the Brite Brush Advanced is the first <a href=\"/best-electric-toothbrushes\">electric toothbrush</a> of its kind. The head contains an LED light that illuminates to eradicate any germs and bacteria that may be lurking on the bristles. While you can find other sanitizing power toothbrushes on the market, none of them work quite like the Brite Brush Advanced.","Brite Brush designed this rechargeable toothbrush to vastly improve your oral health. The sanitizing light ensures the brush head remains hygienic throughout its lifespan. The company (as well as most dental professionals) recommends that you replace the brush head every three months.","The charge of an electric toothbrush can vary greatly, but Brite Brush claims the battery can last a full week on a single charge. How long it actually lasts will largely depend on how often you use the brush, but most people who brush twice a day with the Brite Brush say it can last several days. When the battery runs low, a charge indicator light blinks; once the brush is fully charged again, the light turns off.","One minor drawback of this toothbrush is it&#39;s only covered by a 90-day warranty. Manufacturers of the best power toothbrushes typically offer a limited one-year warranty that covers the device against any defects in workmanship. Thus, some users are understandably disappointed with Brite Brush’s seemingly insufficient warranty.","While some rechargeable toothbrushes come with different speeds, this one does not. It oscillates and pulses at a single speed. This should deliver effective cleaning and removal of plaque, but it could cause irritation if you suffer from gum sensitivity or gingivitis.","The Brite Brush Advanced comes with two brush head replacements, and you can order additional ones directly from the manufacturer. Each brush head is color coded, which is beneficial if you plan to share the handle with your spouse or another family member.","The Brite Brush Advanced is a pricey electric toothbrush, but it offers proprietary sanitizing functionality that no other rechargeable toothbrush can provide. Individuals looking for a basic power toothbrush are better off opting for a less expensive alternative. However, consider this one if you want to invest in a high-tech electric toothbrush."]},"id":"05e25758-0c69-4223-993f-340e0e30f352","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59543","url":"/brite-brush-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-16T14:53:40Z","datePublished":"2014-05-16T14:53:40Z","name":"Brite Brush Advanced","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
