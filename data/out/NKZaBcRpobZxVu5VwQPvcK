It features many high-quality parts that should help it run better for a longer period of time, such as a molecular sieve to strip nitrogen from the outputted air, recessed casters that help prevent breakage, a moisture-reducing wick and a durable metal outlet fitting. It also has a resettable circuit breaker and a lock for the flow valve, so it can’t be changed to a different rate by accidentally bumping it.","Because it’s such a powerful machine, it’s also the largest and heaviest in our comparison. It weighs 32 pounds and measures 23 inches tall, 9 inches wide and 14 inches deep. By comparison, the <a href=\"/inogen-review\">Inogen One G4</a> and the <a href=\"/caire-medical-review\">Caire Medical Airsep Focus</a> weigh less the 2.8 and 1.75 pounds, respectively.  However, it has built-in recessed caster wheels and a built-in plastic handle for improved mobility.","It uses Rapid Pressure Swing Absorption technology, which helps it reach full purity in about three minutes. Its oxygen purity rate has a variance capacity range of 87-96.55 percent. It has two fitted cylinders which alternate in filling up air so there is always plenty available for you.","It has a simple interface – easy enough for anyone to use – composed of an oxygen flow rate knob, a power button and a breaker reset switch. It will also shut off automatically if it is too hot.","The Nuvo Lite has an advanced set of audiovisual alerts that let you know if there’s any sort of problem with the device. Whether there’s been a power failure or the oxygen flow is blocked, you’ll receive either a visual or audible alert, or sometimes both depending on the specific issue. When it’s not sounding alerts, the oxygen concentrator runs at a whisper-quiet 40 decibels, which reduces the likelihood of it disturbing you while you sleep, go to the movies or enjoy other activities.","What the Nuvo Lite lacks in portability it more than makes up for in features and power. It has a variety of high-grade components – like a molecular sieve and a metal outlet fitting – to help it last longer. Several built-in audiovisual alarms notify you in the event of a problem. Though it’s a large unit, its recessed caster wheels and built-in handle make it somewhat easier to lug around."]},"id":"cc59d413-9407-46e7-8faf-3b41cff93990","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68651","url":"/nidek-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alexander-eriksen","url":"/author/alexander-eriksen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Alexander Eriksen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"hwemruvZsTXWMqRixKJ49","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T20:46:19Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T20:46:19Z","name":"Nidek Nuvo Lite","synopsis":"The Nidek Medical Nuvo Lite portable oxygen concentrator is one of the biggest in our lineup but also one of the most feature-packed portable units on the market.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Nidek Medical Nuvo Lite portable oxygen concentrator is one of the biggest in our lineup but also one of the most feature-packed portable units on the market.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-28T20:46:19Z","id":"NKZaBcRpobZxVu5VwQPvcK","meta":{"title":"Nidek Nuvo Lite Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Nidek Nuvo Lite portable oxygen concentrator is large, but it is packed with features and can adapt to your individual breathing style.
