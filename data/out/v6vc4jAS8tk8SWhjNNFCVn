You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Calphalon No Peek <a href=\"/best-waffle-makers\">Waffle Maker</a> is a high-end machine that makes large, Belgian-style American waffles. Calphalon’s Opti-Heat system, three-setting browning control, and No Peek progress indicator helps ensure consistent quality in your waffles from day one. With its 1500-watt output, you are less than five-minutes from four fresh waffles, so the whole family can eat at once.","In addition to the three-setting browning indicator that shows whether your set for light, medium or dark waffles, the Calphalon No Peek Waffle Maker sounds an audible alarm when it has reached the right temperature. An internal thermometer determines the color of your waffles, which frees you from the work of having to watch your waffle cook. This is what gives the No Peek Waffle Maker its No Peek feature."]},"id":"ad431f39-e5e2-437f-a487-179772485466","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/qbDgaqXStVe5webL5SZnt3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This Calphalon appliance comes with a modest set of recipes in the user manual that should be a good starting point if you want to get creative and produce experimental waffle recipes.

It is particularly imperative that you always follow this manufacturer’s recommendations. Be sure to clean this cooking surface after each use with a damp sponge after it has completely cooled.","Clean-up does provide its own challenges here. While the brushed stainless steel surface of the Calphalon No Peek Waffle Maker does make cleaning easy, you will have to be careful if push comes to scrub so as not to damage the semi-exposed bronze nonstick surface. The waffle maker lacks any type of overflow management system, so you will have to carefully measure the batter you put on the waffle iron surface to avoid messy spills.","Calphalon has made the No Peek Waffle Maker nice enough to be given a place on your countertop, but you don’t have to. It’s easy to store because it’s just smaller than a toaster oven and has a  lightweight design. Additionally, the locking lid feature and attached stainless steel handle mean this machine has been designed to be stored upright, making it perfect for cupboard or pantry.","The Calphalon No Peek Waffle Maker comes with a one-year manufacturer’s warranty on the electronics and a five-year warranty on the bronze nonstick plates.","The Calphalon name definitely has a reputation for quality cooking surfaces, and its No Peek Waffle Maker doesn’t disappoint. The solid build and beautiful design with its overall capacity makes this waffle maker a solid addition to any kitchen."]},"id":"8334aad9-3ba5-4983-abf9-3d3ae60a48be","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57792","url":"/calphalon-no-peek-waffle-maker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-16T01:37:30Z","datePublished":"2013-10-16T01:37:30Z","name":"Calphalon No Peek HE400WM","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-16T01:37:30Z","id":"v6vc4jAS8tk8SWhjNNFCVn","meta":{"title":"Calphalon No Peek HE400WM Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Calphalon brings its legendary line of bronze nonstick cookware to the No Peek Waffle Maker.
