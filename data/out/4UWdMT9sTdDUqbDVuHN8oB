The company offers an array of pool vacuums, including robotic and pressure-side cleaners. Its <a href=\"/best-pressure-pool-cleaners\">pressure pool cleaners</a> are well suited for in-ground pools that are exposed to large pieces of debris from surrounding landscaping. The Vac-Sweep 280 is one of the company’s most powerful yet approachable cleaners.","The 280 vacuum has a three-wheel base and is lightweight enough to clean not only the walls and the floor but the stairs as well. It has dual jets that shoot dirt and debris up into the large filter bag. It is compatible with all in-ground pool surfaces including vinyl and fiberglass, and it connects quickly and easily to a dedicated suction line. It should clean most pools within approximately three hours. You can use the rear sweep tail accessory for assistance in cleaning up additional debris from corners and other crevices. The kit includes a 31-foot hose, which should be enough for most pools. If not, additional hose lengths can be purchased.","A backup valve automatically fires, ensuring that the pressure cleaner cleans the entire pool surface. This Polaris pool cleaner has a history of performing well and being durable. It’s a mid-priced model and offers a simple cleaning design. If you’re interested in a Polaris model with more advanced functionality, check out the three-jet <a href=\"/polaris-vac-sweep-sport-review\">Polaris Vac-Sweep 3900</a>.","The Vac-Sweep 280 pressure pool cleaner requires a booster pump to operate. Be sure that your booster pump is timed to run during your regular pump cycle, or it may eventually burn out. The cleaner is lightweight, so test your hose length to ensure that it won’t tangle, or flip the cleaner over during its cycle. Some newer models have a four-wheel design to make the vacuum more stable, and to reduce the chance of it tipping over."]},"id":"161a7ea1-fbc0-4f1f-98aa-5414e6f62075","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66573","url":"/polaris-vac-sweep-280-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T18:31:41Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T18:31:41Z","name":"Polaris Vac-Sweep 280","synopsis":"Polaris is known for creating innovative pool maintenance and cleaning equipment.
