The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-dvd-ripper-software\"><em>DVD Ripper Software</em></a><em> here.</em>","We were very impressed with Aviosoft Clone DVD. Clone DVD is one of the top 10 best DVD ripper software options because of its feature set, advanced tools, file format options, and help and support resources. A unique DVD rip software feature that we found in Aviosoft’s Clone DVD product is that you can embed a personal watermark on your DVDs. The main drawback we found in Clone DVD is that the application produces inconsistent quality when compared to the original DVD. We were also disappointed that Clone DVD isn’t capable of copying episodic DVDs. Overall, it has a lot of great features to offer, but it doesn’t offer all of the features that are available on today’s market.","As we mentioned above, Clone DVD provides a sound feature set. The DVD ripper software has the ability to copy a portion of a movie and convert it to a number of various formats. You can also crop unwanted areas of a movie, merge multiple videos to a single file, back up DVDs with one click and sync DVDs with PSP, iPod, Blackberry and smartphones. You can even set the software to automatically turn off the computer after copy is complete, and you can run the software in more than 10 different languages. Many of these features are very convenient and make DVD ripping easier than ever before.","We found many of the features in Clone DVD to be unique to this product. The ability to begin a DVD rip and then leave or go to bed, knowing that the application will shut off your computer when the rip is complete, is a convenient feature for busy people who want to simply set and forget the software. Also, you can embed a personalized watermark on your copied movies, which could be fun and useful.","There are five different copy modes available in Clone DVD: entire disk, main movie, customized copy, split disc and DVD ripping. Each mode offers the same great navigation and ease of use. When comparing our copied DVDs to the originals, we found that the copy quality is inconsistent and at times it was a noticeably lower quality than the original."]},"id":"cfa0b64f-f903-4e44-85a2-1f77586ea9a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c3017a64-4293-473f-b0db-38be4fef35f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We are impressed overall with the feature set of Clone DVD.

While we feel that most users will find this unnecessary when ripping commercial DVDs, it could be a fun trait to add to your home videos. Clone DVD<strong> </strong>yields inconsistent results in terms of quality, and while we were very impressed at times with the final file, we were disappointed as well.
