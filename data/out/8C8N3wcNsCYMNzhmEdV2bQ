You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","SkyWay USA has been in business since 2005. They offer <a href=\"/best-satellite-internet-providers\">high-speed satellite internet</a> that is one-way. This means you can download using the satellite, but in order to upload, you must use dial-up. If you don’t upload much, using this service could save you money. Their downloading speeds are comparable to other satellite internet providers.","You can choose from four plans: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. The upload speeds for all their satellite internet products is the same, 56 kilobits per second. Each plan also comes with five email accounts. Each account has 2 gigabytes of storage space. The Bronze plan gives you a download speed of up to 384Kbps and a download and upload threshold of 2,700 megabytes (MB) every 30 days. The Silver plan provides you with downloading speeds up to 512Kbps and 6,250MB of download allowance per 30 days. With the Gold plan, you can reach downloading speeds up to 768Kbps, and you can download 7,500MB per 30 days. The Platinum plan has download speeds up to 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps). You can upload and download 14,000MB through your plan monthly.","Compared to other satellite internet providers’ top-quality plans, SkyWay USA offers a comparable product. The Premium plan’s download speed, and its download and upload allowance per 30 days, are competitive with other providers’ top-quality products. SkyWay USA’s upload speed is much slower than the competition, though. The other thing the Premium packing is short on is email addresses. Other providers offer between two and three times as many email addresses for the speed and price.","The customer and technical support isn’t as effective as that of other satellite internet providers. Several times when we called them, their company transferred us to an extension that didn’t answer and said its mailbox was full. The customer and tech support also transferred us multiple times before we found someone who could help us. Through the whole process, however, they were friendly and helpful.","SkyWay USA doesn’t include other features such as spam and virus protection or blogging tools. Once you receive your equipment, you can customize your satellite internet homepage with your favorite links, and information and news. They focus their service on providing their customers with less expensive service and higher internet speeds.","You can either purchase the equipment or lease it. Another nice thing is that you can install your own equipment. All you need is a screwdriver and a wrench. If you don’t feel comfortable installing your own satellite, you can have a professional from the company install the equipment for a fee. There isn’t an activation fee, but there is a return policy and a one-year limited warranty."]},"id":"ae5873c0-5231-40d9-989e-d47918a87d8c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1a118fe4-1d9e-4ed6-99d6-99cf0cc4107d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SkyWay USA offers good download speeds, but their upload speeds are uncommonly slow.
