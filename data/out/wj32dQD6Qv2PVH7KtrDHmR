You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The IOGEAR GHDSW3 HDMI switch is like a power strip for HDMI cables. You can connect three different media sources to your TV with this device. The <a href=\"/best-hdmi-switchers\">HDMI switcher</a> automatically changes the display on the TV or projector as you turn your devices on and off. A remote isn&#39;t usually necessary, but the HDMI switcher includes a small, intuitive remote. The GHDSW3 relies on power drawn from its HDMI ports, though, which is not ideal.","The GHDSW3 doesn&#39;t have its own power source. Instead, it tries to draw power from the devices connected to it via HDMI. The problem with this is that HDMI ports are not designed to transmit much power. As a result, you may need to have two or three devices plugged in to the switch in order for it to function properly. It would be much better if the switch had its own power source.","This HDMI switcher automatically changes between inputs as you turn one media source on and another off. However, many devices, such as Apple TV and Roku, are constantly running and don&#39;t turn all the way off. The IOGEAR HDMI switch does not recognize the changes in these displays, so you might have to change the settings on your media sources or use the included remote.","The manufacturer provides a variety of customer service options, including telephone and chat on the website. You can also contact the company via email. The IOGEAR HDMI switch is covered by a limited one-year warranty, which is standard for this type of device.","Make sure that the retailer you purchase the IOGEAR GHDSW3 from has a strong return policy. There&#39;s no guarantee that this HDMI switcher, or any other HDMI switcher, will work with your home theater setup. There are too many variables to account for. On the off chance that this switcher doesn&#39;t work for you, it&#39;s important that you can return it with as little fuss as possible."]},"id":"2ae6185a-4a7a-41cc-861b-52a8d8d0021b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"242bf159-8618-4a32-ad37-a5596b029613","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The IOGEAR GHDSW3 HDMI switcher is durable, and all the features are clearly labeled.

Of course, if you have several media sources always plugged into the GHDSW3, then it shouldn&#39;t be much of an issue."]},"id":"75173375-8953-4e58-808e-5d4cfa201ac6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51299","url":"/iogear-hdmi-switcher-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-brown","url":"/author/ryan-brown","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ryan Brown","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"HR3J5H9LhLCfWmFnumxwPW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-11-03T15:37:00Z","datePublished":"2010-11-03T15:37:00Z","name":"IOGEAR GHDSW3","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":78,"verdict":"The IOGEAR GHDSW3 is a decent HDMI switcher, but you should be aware of a couple caveats before buying.","pros":["This HDMI switcher automatically changes inputs for you."],"cons":["Without its own power supply, this switcher depends on other devices in order to function properly."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-11-03T15:37:00Z","id":"wj32dQD6Qv2PVH7KtrDHmR","meta":{"title":"IOGEAR GHDSW3 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The IOGEAR GHDSW3 gives you three additional HDMI ports for your TV and can pass a 1080p video signal.
