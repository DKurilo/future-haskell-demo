The company&#39;s claim to fame is its unique method of shipping fresh-cut, unarranged flowers in water using its patented Moses Miracle system.","The company&#39;s website explains and shows what the system is and how it works. Basically, the floral designer fills a latex balloon with water, inserts the stem ends into the neck of the balloon and adds a rubber band to hold the whole thing together.","The designer secures the flowers in the box to avoid jostling during shipping. The company&#39;s goal is to get the flowers to its destination within 72 hours of harvesting and to keep them hydrated during the delivery process. The idea is to bring you the best flowers in the best condition possible.","Once your flowers are delivered, you must arrange them, either in a vase you already own or in one that you buy from this flower delivery company. KaBloom&#39;s cut flowers are guaranteed to last seven days and generally last longer than those from online flower companies that do not keep the blossoms hydrated during shipping.","KaBloom&#39;s online selection consists of the standard but still pretty and fresh fare: roses, daisies, lilies, orchids, carnations, hydrangeas, irises, sunflowers, tulips, along with exotic flowers and mixed bouquets. You generally have the option of choosing a specific vase for a fee or no vase if your gift recipient has plenty of them already.","KaBloom puts its emphasis on shipping well-hydrated flowers that you arrange yourself, and it does that very well. In the past, this company did not offer much in the way of extras. However, KaBloom now has a business arrangement with Teleflora called KaBloom Today that offers such things as gift baskets of fresh fruit, chocolates, snacks and other goodies. The KaBloom Today and Teleflora arrangement now lets you order bouquets already arranged in a vase as well as other items like potted plants, novelty vases, dish gardens, standing funeral sprays and more.","KaBloom&#39;s online flowers services are available only in the U.S. and India. You can order flowers online or by phone. If you happen to live near one of its 50 franchise stores, located in 24 states and the District of Columbia, you can drop in and place your order in person. Same-day flower delivery is available.","KaBloom&#39;s customer service is a mix of informational articles, a customer loyalty program, and phone and email support. Unfortunately, there is no live chat. You can track your order online through the site or by email or phone."]},"id":"8680cd02-78c9-42d0-882d-69f6d025562e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5e00f0a-ce14-4321-a2a4-0221a2402a56","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["KaBloom&#39;s Moses Miracle system makes a lot of sense.
