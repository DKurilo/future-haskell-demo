The Droid X is a new addition to the Android smartphone market and provides numerous features that makes it one of the top smartphones today. With a gorgeous 4.3-inch touch screen, the ability to capture stunning HD video and the potential to be used as a mobile hotspot, the Droid X is one of the toughest smartphones.

The 4.3-inch touchscreen makes viewing images on your phone enjoyable on the clear and crisp display. We were pleased that this phone was easy to use out in the sun and in brightly lit areas compared to many other smartphones.","A hump towards the top of the Droid X makes this smartphone’s design unique compared to other Android smartphones. The phone is thin, super thin, so they needed someplace to store the camera module and chose to create this strange hump for that purpose. We didn’t mind the hump, and it really didn’t get in the way much as we first thought it might when we saw the device.","For those who like the feel of a physical keyboard when using smartphones, this is not the cellular device for you. The Droid X provides a virtual keyboard with the Swype feature, which allows the user to drag his or her finger from key to key without lifting the finger. We found Swype to be difficult to use at first, but once we got used to it, we found we could type long messages very quickly"]},"id":"f92d8afc-1d1e-44a8-a429-fe2022da21d5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"a6962a00-f0e7-4848-9a49-b039f6229b59","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Droid X is the ideal multimedia phone.
