Danby DWC93BLSDB is a single-zone, freestanding <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">wine cooler</a> that uses a thermoelectric cooling system, so it runs quieter than fridges that use compressors. It cools between 43 degrees and 57 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes it a good choice for white wines and lighter reds. However, if you enjoy your darker red wines at just below room temperature, this unit might not be a good choice for you since the highest temperature is still too cold for them. For a wine cooler that will accommodate higher temperatures for darker wines, check out the <a href=\"/avanti-review\">Avanti EWC1201</a>, which has a high temperature of 64 degrees.","The controls on this wine fridge are inconveniently located on the back, and they’re not digital. There’s a minimum and maximum, but if you want a temperature in between, you have to guess where to set it. It also has fluctuating internal temperatures, so we recommend using a digital thermometer to determine which shelf is best for your specific wines. Some consumers place red wines at the top where the air is warmer and white wines at the bottom where it’s cooler. ","The DWC93BLSDB has five metal slide-out shelves and one staggered shelf; together these hold an impressive 36 bottles of wine. All of the shelves hold bottles lying down, but you can remove shelves and place bottles upright.","This cooler is black with platinum trim and a tempered glass door. The tempered glass helps block UV rays that could cause your wines to age rapidly or spoil, and the door can be positioned to open from the left or right. ","Because this is a freestanding fridge, it shouldn’t be built into a cabinet. Additionally, putting this wine cooler in a garage or on a porch, where outside temperatures are not controlled, will invalidate the one-year warranty that it comes with."]},"id":"9af0bb15-461f-460a-a069-ceaf968cc6cf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50571","url":"/danby-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-30T16:11:34Z","datePublished":"2010-08-30T16:11:34Z","name":"Danby DWC93BLSDB 36 Bottle","synopsis":"The Danby DWC93BLSDB is a single-zone, freestanding wine cooler that uses a thermoelectric cooling system, so it runs quieter than fridges that use compressors.
