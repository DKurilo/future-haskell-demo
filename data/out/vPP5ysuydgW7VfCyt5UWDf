You can still read our original review below, but TopTenREVIEWS is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Amana brand has been around since 1934 and has become a well-respected name in the appliance design world. They were the first company to promote a contoured (curved) door, a design style that is now standard. Today, Amana is owned by Whirlpool Corporation but still keeps the Amana name and continues to make beautiful appliances. One such appliance is the Amana AQF2013TEW <a href=\"/best-freezers\">upright freezer</a>. This freezer has the Amana signature contoured door as well as a capacity of 20.1 cubic feet. It is missing, however, several features like external temperature controls and a protective lock that dropped it into the bottom half of our lineup.","With a 20.1-cubic-foot capacity, this freezer is able to hold approximately 711 pounds of food on four inside shelves, six door bins and two inside baskets. The wire shelves are adjustable to best fit the frozen contents you use most. An Energy Star qualification is another item to add to this upright freezer&#39;s repertoire of features, saving you money on energy bills every year with an estimated yearly operating cost of $71. One energy efficiency requirement is a consistent temperature, and although not located on the outside of the freezer, the Amana AQF2013TEW does have a manual temperature control unit in the upper right hand side. An interior light is also a convenient addition to help searching for frozen items that much easier.","Unlike any of the other upright freezers in our lineup, the Amana AQF2013TEW has manual defrost options, including a defrost drain, as well as an automatic Frost Free setting. We appreciate the manual options because although the Frost Free setting says it will make sure there is no icy buildup, having a backup means of defrosting is never a bad idea.","To ensure the safety of your frozen items, the Amana AQF2013TEW has a power on light that at a glance will tell you that your upright freezer is happily plugging along. Another helpful feature is the Fast Freeze setting that, by lowering the temperature quickly in the freezer, rapidly freezes all items, preserving them in the freshest state possible.","As mentioned previously, Amana is known in the appliance design world as innovators in modern updates to refrigerators, upright freezers and more. The Amana AQF2013TEW is a good showcase of their design aesthetic. This freezer stands fairly tall at 67 inches, with a white façade and a rounded, contoured door. Adjustable leveling legs can alter the height, and even the door can be altered in the way it swings. Modifiable hinges make it easy to make the door swing left or right according to your preference."]},"id":"3aa6dfc7-89ab-47b8-bb4c-af548ff0c9da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"46217bea-4a19-4680-8aee-a9993bc83731","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Amana AQF2013TEW isn’t packed with features like our top three upright freezer reviews are, but it gets the job done.
