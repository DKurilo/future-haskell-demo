It allows you to upload your image, choose a local 3D printer and pick up your product within hours.","The 3D printing business has nearly 19,000 3D printers in its worldwide network. First, you design a 3D model using any number of supported third-party platforms. Or, if you’d prefer to skip the design process, 3D Hubs has an archive filled with thousands of pre-designed products you can choose from. Once you choose your design, upload it to the 3D Hubs website, and you’ll see a list of printers that are closest to you.","The 3D printing website also lists the materials and technology each printer uses and how long it will take to complete your order. If you live in an urban area, you can pick up your completed product within an hour. On the other hand, if you live in a rural area, you may have to travel longer distances, or choose from more limited printing options to pick up your 3D project. You can also elect to have your project shipped for an additional fee. After you select a printer and material, you’ll be prompted to pre-pay for your product. One nice feature about the website is that customers rate each 3D printer, so you can choose one with a good track record.","3D Hub isn’t just a 3D printing company either. It has online forums and discussion threads to foster a sense of community among those who own and use 3D printers. Members can pose questions to other members, discuss projects, display prints and promote 3D printing-related events. Whether you need to design and print an airtight seal or schedule a mass printing, there is a range of discussion threads to help you make informed decisions.","3D Hub’s network of custom 3D printers consists of businesses and individual users. The sharing economy allows individuals or small business that otherwise cannot budget for a 3D printer to invest in one and generate revenue as a result. The website also has manuals and tutorials that cover the entire 3D printing process, whether you’re purchasing a new printer or looking for a single print.","3D Hubs is designed to help reduce 3D printing service costs and make the technology more available to consumers. However, the platform isn&#39;t as accessible for those who live in sparsely populated areas that are not in close to one of the website’s more than 19,000 networked printers."]},"id":"4887c2ec-2c23-44f1-ab91-36eedb8f4c27","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66926","url":"/3d-hubs-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:53:54Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:53:54Z","name":"3D Hubs","synopsis":"3D Hubs is a 3D printing service that connects you with local 3D printers.
