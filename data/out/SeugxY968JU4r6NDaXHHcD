The Schwinn 430 Elliptical offers 22 preset exercise programs and 20 resistance levels to help you reach your fitness goals.","This front-drive elliptical trainer is easy to step up on and is quite stable. It measures over 5 1/2 feet long, 2 1/2 feet wide and 5 1/4 feet tall. The stride is a fixed 20 inches, which is the standard stride length. The LCD console is 3 by 5 inches and displays your distance, time, calories burned and the resistance level. The Schwinn 430 can support up to 300 pounds.","While the best elliptical machines are compatible with chest heart rate monitors, the Schwinn 430 lacks this feature. Fortunately, you can still monitor your heart rate by grasping the stationary handles during your workout for 10 seconds. This gives you an accurate measurement of your heart rate, and you can check it at any time during the workout.","This elliptical bike does not have the ability to adjust the incline while you are working out. While this isn&#39;t a problem if you just want to work against variable resistance, it makes it inconvenient to target specific muscle areas without stopping your routine and changing the incline by raising or lowering the handle.","You can connect to MyFitnessPal or the Schwinn Connect apps to track and monitor the time, distance and calories for each of your workouts. This is a convenient way to hold yourself accountable and motivate yourself to reach your fitness goals. The Schwinn 430 Elliptical has many built-in accessories such as a water bottle holder, speakers and MP3 player input, a tablet or book holder, and a three-speed cooling fan.","Schwinn provides a 10-year warranty on the frame, a two-year warranty on parts and covers labor on the elliptical machine for one year. If you need help, you can contact Schwinn by phone or email. You can also download the user manual from the product website."]},"id":"b6363147-1d05-444e-af00-b614adfb5b1a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7d4407b2-510c-408f-b85f-3eb45a5d70c1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Schwinn 430 is a suitable choice for a home gym elliptical trainer if you don&#39;t mind setting the incline manually.
