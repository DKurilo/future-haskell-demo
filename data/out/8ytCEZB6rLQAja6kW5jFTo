Its 2GB of internal storage needs the extra heft from the added memory card slot to compete with the other products on our lineup.","This recorder comes with a USB port and cable as well as voice recognition technology to record only when someone is speaking, saving battery life and storage capacity. The maximum battery life is 37 hours. It also has variable-speed playback and track marking to make it easier to find portions of audio clips and to edit recordings.","An erase button lets you easily eliminate files or whole folders, and a new feature added by Olympus lets you end one dictation and quickly begin the next by merely pushing a button. This easy-to-use feature is a great plus that adds to the quality of this digital voice recorder.","At 3.7 ounces, the Olympus DS-2500 is one of the heavier portable recorders on our list. Don&#39;t let this dissuade you, though. Its size is proportional to most of the other devices and it will easily fit into your pocket or purse. However, it will have a little extra heft in your pocket.","There are three options for obtaining support for this digital voice recorder. These include standard online FAQs, email and phone.
