Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro is a pocket-size <a href=\"/best-home-computers\">home computer</a> that has comparable functionality to larger, more traditional machines without taking up as much space. Though it has limited storage, it has enough ports to connect your important devices and enough power to let you surf the web and perform other basic tasks.","The Mobile Desktop Pro has a less powerful processor than the best home computers in our review. While the other computers we reviewed have Intel i5 or i7 processors, the Mobile Desktop’s processor is only an Intel Atom x5-Z8500. This processor, combined with its 2GB of LPDDR3 memory, is not ideal for intensive use. The CPU is clocked at 1.44GHz, and it features an Intel HD Graphics Gen8 graphics card. The machine ships standard with Windows 10 Home 64-bit.","Because it’s pint-sized, this mini desktop has just 32GB of eMMC storage, which is a storage tech typically used in tablets, smartphones and mobile computers, not desktop computers. However, you can always use cloud storage or connect an external storage device. With its limited native storage, however, it can store a small selection of your favorite photos, music, documents and other files. Similarly, if you want a small laptop with just the basics, check out the <a href=\"/asus-review\">ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA</a>.","This desktop PC offers one USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports, but it lacks USB 3.1 ports. However, it supplies an HDMI port, a microSD memory card reader and a VGA connection for your monitor. It also has built-in Bluetooth and dual-band Wi-Fi, so you can easily move it around your house whenever you need. Measuring just 3.16 x 4.88 inches, and standing just a half inch tall, its compact size saves you precious space in your work area.","Kangaroo offers a variety of support and troubleshooting resources for you. You can contact their customer service team via live chat, email or phone. Or, you can opt to browse the knowledgebase or user manuals found on the manufacturer’s website. However, they do not host a community user forum.","While you won’t get the processing power, memory capacity or port availability with the Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro that you would with a traditional tower, it’s still a decent option for those who want something simple and portable. It has enough functionality to help you complete various tasks or enjoy some YouTube videos, making it a budget-friendly option."]},"id":"ede2693d-f9ce-4f16-875c-cbbec3e7dd3e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69673","url":"/kangaroo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-10-24T16:41:35Z","datePublished":"2017-10-24T16:41:35Z","name":"Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":24,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-24T16:41:35Z","id":"6hkLYcsp3ekqqWho5rpxrV","meta":{"title":"Kangaroo Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro is a mini desktop computer that&#8217;s simple in its functionality, yet inexpensive."},"products":[{"slug":"kangaroo-mobile-desktop-pro","url":"/product/kangaroo-mobile-desktop-pro","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","name":"Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","id":"AnHEsxVcb5aiu6L4rZVndd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Ck9vJi6VxmmjnJMMmmf2ej.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"7c65f1bd40a78b347c8aa1be10bf7098.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/7c65f1bd40a78b347c8aa1be10bf7098.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","id":"Ck9vJi6VxmmjnJMMmmf2ej","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ck9vJi6VxmmjnJMMmmf2ej.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kangaroo Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro is a mini desktop computer that&#8217;s simple in its functionality, yet inexpensive."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Ck9vJi6VxmmjnJMMmmf2ej.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"7c65f1bd40a78b347c8aa1be10bf7098.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/7c65f1bd40a78b347c8aa1be10bf7098.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","id":"Ck9vJi6VxmmjnJMMmmf2ej","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ck9vJi6VxmmjnJMMmmf2ej.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kangaroo Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro is a mini desktop computer that&#8217;s simple in its functionality, yet inexpensive."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/kangaroo-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"computers","url":"/electronics/computers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","name":"Computers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:13Z","id":"o7A3TAPY7RTrVES9Lb9iRS","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
