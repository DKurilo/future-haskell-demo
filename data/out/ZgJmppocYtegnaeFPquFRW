This prevents a small figure from being overlooked or lost when following the flow process. Of course, there are instances where you may want to make a figure larger than the others to draw special attention to it, but a general rule of thumb is to make all the figures the same size.","Keeping equal spacing between all of your figures will improve the general organization and visual appeal of a flowchart. It also helps in reading the diagram, as you won t be jumping too quickly from one figure to the next or lagging as you follow a particularly long connector.","Use color and effects.
