As smartphones continue to progress and consumers continue to use them for everything from taking pictures of their kids in the park to managing their financial portfolios, viruses and hackers will continue to find new hunting grounds, and computer security software companies will continue to transform their mobile virus protection software. Below are five ways your phone can pick up a virus:","<strong>Downloading Apps</strong> – Before you can play with a new app, you have to download it and accept the terms and conditions. As a conscious consumer, you read every word in these agreements, right? For the majority of consumers, the answer to that question is (with a shameful bow of the head), &#34;wrong.&#34; Within the tiny print of those permission agreements, you may miss the section stating what the app will have access to, including your location, contacts list, social media accounts, email, text and video messages, calendar and so forth. Pretty scary stuff. The best mobile virus protection software scans every app before it is fully downloaded to your smartphone and produces a report detailing any threats the app may pose.","<strong>The Web</strong> – Internet downloads are probably the easiest way for your cell phone to contract a virus. With your favorite TV show or comic book on the line, you may be quick to download any file that promises that content. Beware! You have no idea what could be coded into those files. If your phone is not protected by mobile antivirus software, you will likely get more than just the latest &#34;Community&#34; episode. <a href=\"/bitdefender-mobile-security-protect-your-smartphone\">Cell phone virus protection</a> software scans every file download and creates a report. If the file triggers a red flag, the application will place it into a quarantine section. Here, you can see a damage report and decide if you want to delete the infected item or proceed with the download.","<strong>PC Hookups</strong> – If your child goes to school and a classmate has lice, it is likely that your kid will come home with a hair full of the unwanted bugs. The same concept is true any time you connect your smartphone to your computer via USB. If your computer has a bug and your phone is not protected, it will get the malware, too. The best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-antivirus,review-2588-7.html\">mobile virus protection software</a> completes real-time, scheduled and on-demand scans, each digging deep to find anything that doesn&#39;t belong. The scans include USB connections and any information passed between your smartphone and computer.","<strong>Message Attachments </strong>– Whether it&#39;s personal or business, you may receive hundreds of texts, video messages and emails every day. You simply ignore or delete texts from unfamiliar numbers and your email&#39;s spam box filters out the most obvious offenders. If your smartphone has a virus, however, it can send you texts and emails that are disguised as messages from familiar contacts, which you&#39;ll probably open, exposing your phone to damage. Mobile antivirus protection software monitors your phone in real time to detect and stop any malicious material from infiltrating your smartphone.","<strong>Bluetooth Connection</strong> – In an article published in MIT&#39;s &#34;Technology Review&#34; in 2005, experts predicted that Bluetooth-enabled phones and connections would become the superhighways for airborne viruses. Like the human cold or flu viruses, Bluetooth phones can infect one another by simply being in the same vicinity. This is quite frightening, as almost every phone, smartphone or not, has Bluetooth capabilities. Not every application provides mobile virus protection, so when purchasing mobile software for your phone, make sure it specifically states that it monitors your Bluetooth connection in real time.","As more and more consumers use their smartphones to store their personal and professional information, the temptation for hackers to <a href=\"/top-10-worst-types-of-computer-viruses\">create dangerous viruses</a> and other malware will continue to increase. Even now, smartphones are a primary target for malicious code. Protect yourself now. In less than 10 minutes, you can download mobile security software to shield your phone and data.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To.™"," "]},"id":"13f13e9b-bf14-4d8d-b8bc-0d3ad510dc0f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7481","url":"/top-five-ways-your-smartphone-can-contract-a-virus","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"hailey-keller","url":"/author/hailey-keller","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Hailey Keller","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"9s7PZuNK56ozbym3YC6xxF","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-08-06T20:42:31Z","datePublished":"2012-08-06T20:42:31Z","name":"Top Five Ways Your Smartphone Can Contract a Virus","synopsis":"As consumers, we can be lulled into a false sense of security when it comes to electronics and downloads.","review":{},"strapline":"As consumers, we can be lulled into a false sense of security when it comes to electronics and downloads.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-29T19:19:21Z","id":"UbY5Ug7EDmgaJ5mozyeG7T","meta":{"title":"Top Five Ways Your Smartphone Can Contract a Virus","description":"Mobile virus protection software shields your phone to ensure that the data you&#039;ve stored on it is safe.
