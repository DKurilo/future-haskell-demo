Why settle for just a white noise generator when you can have all the modern bells and whistles to go with it? Not only does the Homedics sound machine have a built-in iPhone and iPod dock, it has a dual alarm clock, a line-in for non-docking music players and six soothing sounds to intensify your slumber.

The HoMedics SoundSpa does usher in fulfilling sleep, but it does so much more. It is the ultimate sleep and wake solution. When you go to sleep at night, you can choose to drift off to your iPod, the radio or the sound machine’s built-in nature sounds. These options can also be set to a sleep timer of 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes; when the set time expires, the machine will automatically shut off. Or you can choose to keep the music playing continuously through the night. When you wake up in the morning, you can choose to also be awakened by a standard beep, your iPod, the sound machine’s built-in nature sounds or the radio. Not ready to rise and shine? Simply hit the snooze button and you’ll be granted another nine minutes of sleep time. The choice of wake options ease you gracefully from a peaceful slumber into a happy and well-rested day – much better than a shrill or harsh start to your morning.","To properly use the iPod dock for sleep and awake mode, make sure your iPod is properly docked. The HoMedics sound machine comes with four different dock inserts for different iPods: iPod nano 3rd, 4th and 5th generation, 5G iPod with Video (60GB and 80GB), iPod classic (160GB) and iPod touch 2nd generation. If the iPod is not appropriately docked, the alarm clock will default to the standard beep tone and the iPod will not charge. A 3mm line-in is available for any versions of the iPod, or other music players, besides those listed.  If for any reason you need to fiddle with your iPod in the middle of the night, the LCD display provides enough light to alter settings. To compliment your iPod, the HoMedics SoundSpa comes with five interchangeable faceplates in silver, black, blue, hot pink and purple. The SoundSpa itself comes in black or white."]},"id":"1367e5d5-014f-45ae-a212-9915d0ba0722","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Sound"},"id":"91c13a75-685d-455f-916e-068a35f054ec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HoMedics SoundSpa is a fairly easy product to use, with a large digital LCD display with a backlight that can be adjusted to your preference. Additionally, the settings are uncomplicated. Some users complain that even the lowest brightness setting is too bright, but others appreciate that the light makes it easy to see the time and provides an impromptu night light. The volume control, located on the top of the sound machine, is a short knob that can easily be turned to the perfect sound level.","Travel ready, this compact sound machine is ready to be packed away in your suitcase. If in a country where the standard US AC-adapter plug doesn’t work, the HoMedics sound machine is capable of operating on battery power. Two “AA” batteries (included) are all you need. When at home, or in a location where the AC adapter will work, the white noise generator uses these batteries as a backup system in case of a power failure. This is a very convenient feature as it always seems the power goes out in the middle of the night, disrupting your alarm clock without your knowledge."]},"id":"aab5d2d6-a588-4102-8e08-87db2bfa3263","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Settings"},"id":"c2997214-e5d2-4ca0-bd9e-af8228388cf3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["First and foremost, the Homedics SoundSpa is a sound machine, designed to help agitated sleepers reach a calm place while falling asleep. The nature sounds that come standard with the SoundSpa subtly shape  your brain waves to match their wave lengths resulting in a longer and deeper REM cycle. While you may not be a believer at first, this clinically proven sleep aid will let you sleep better than you ever have before. This sound machine comes with six different sound therapy options: night, ocean, brook, sunrise, rain and water fall. Each sound’s theme is different, and you may not like all of them. The trick is to find the one you fall asleep easiest to and stick with it. However, because this white noise generator has an iPod dock, you have an unlimited number of sleep therapy sounds available to you. Simply hop over to iTunes, search for white noise music, download to your iPod and sleep soundly to your customized tunes.
