The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about internet service providers <a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">here</a>.</em>","ISP.com provides over 3,000 dial-up access number across the U.S and Canada. They also work with a sister company to provide affordable DSL contracts in limited areas. This <a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">internet service</a> has access numbers offered in nearly 90 percent of the test areas that we targeted. ISP.com has been providing residential and business internet services since 1999.","One thing you may find confusing about ISP.com is that they utilize a few of Google&#39;s free services. For example, if you click on the MyISP.com tab on the ISP.com homepage, it takes you to Google News. In addition, on the main landing page for ISP.com and on the email page you will see an advertisement for Gmail. The company has an arrangement with Gmail for your email address. You will still have an @isp.com address, but you will receive all the perks of Gmail service. For email protection, they offer a tool called MailRover, which is an email spam-filtering product we assume works with Gmail.","In terms of cheap internet service, ISP.com offers two dial-up plans. The dial-up plans consist of a standard and accelerated plan. Each plan comes with 10 email addresses, spam and virus protection and free customer service. As with all dial-up services, you should make sure that your internet provider offers toll-free access numbers in your area before subscribing.","Though ISP.com reports that it provides spam and virus protection, the company does not relate what internet security software it provides, so we cannot easily assess how strong the software is at combating internet threats. Another benefit ISP.com provides free is customer service by telephone, email or through online documentation.","When we searched for access numbers and services in our test areas, we noticed that most areas only have a few access numbers, with the most available in Seattle and none in the New Mexico rural test area code. However, they do offer access numbers in parts of Canada, which is a good option for those that occupy the northernmost part of North America. As with all dial-up services though, make sure to verify that the access numbers available are toll-free from your phone line or you may receive hefty telephone charges."]},"id":"91317e8a-28e5-4426-ab97-edbe81429dda","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a30ff11-3d50-4b00-a5df-cafd30dbbf08","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This dial-up internet service provider can provide static IP and DHCP connections in numerous areas across the U.S. and Canada.
