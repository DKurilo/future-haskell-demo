This powered <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> has a SmartScreen indicator built into the base to help you level and secure the car seat in the safest way possible. However, without its base, the Prodigy is a rather generic car seat. It has a few great features, but much of what is best about this seat relies on a one-time use feature.","The Summer Infant Prodigy&#39;s base requires three AA batteries. You can install the base with its LATCH connectors or a seat belt, although we found LATCH easiest. First, the SmartScreen indicator helps you to adjust the level. With an up or down button, you can adjust the recline as needed until a green smiley face lights up. Then you connect the LATCH connectors or seatbelt and tighten until another green smiley face lights up. With LATCH, there is a crank to tighten the straps, but it is easy to overdo it. While this is a great way to make sure you&#39;ve install the base correctly, it&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ll do it again, since most parents keep the base in the car.","Everything else about the Prodigy is standard, so you aren&#39;t getting much outside of the powered base. You can install the carrier without the base, although you&#39;d be removing its best feature. The seat also has an average canopy and adjustable carry handle. Perhaps the best aspect of the carrier is its machine-washable cushions, allowing for easy cleaning. The carrier is compatible with Fuze and Spectra strollers.","Sometimes it is difficult to separate the carrier from the base, and you may jostle your baby the first few times. When you do get the carrier separated, you&#39;ll notice that it is heavier than many others. At 11 pounds, the carrier is about 2 pounds heavier than most.","Summer Infant supports the Prodigy with a one-year warranty, and you can go to the website to find a local retailer or download a new user manual. Customer service is available by telephone and email, although we had to make several attempts before we could get answers to our questions."]},"id":"02e34cb9-98be-4d20-aaa4-f511c076ac2c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"654d5944-0380-41e3-a97c-9b2aedb5e677","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Summer Infant Prodigy is a powered baby car seat with simple installation instructions.
