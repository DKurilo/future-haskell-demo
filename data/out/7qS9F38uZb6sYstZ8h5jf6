The speakers I tested are 6.5-inch coaxial speakers and cost between $60 and $200 for two speakers. They are all marine certified, which means they’re made of materials designed to handle water and UV rays. Coaxial speakers, which contain the woofer and tweeter in the same frame, are the cheapest kind of marine speaker though. If you&#39;re looking for high-end marine speakers, consider component speakers instead. These cost between $150 and $600 for a pair of tweeter-less speakers.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","The two factors that people consider when they listen to music is the audio quality and volume. You want your music to sound great and you want to turn it up. This is especially important on boats because you&#39;re usually in an open acoustic landscape that allows audio frequencies to quickly dissipate. A boat speaker’s efficiency is more vital than for a car speaker’s because the former needs to be capable of pushing your music pass the wake. It doesn&#39;t have the luxury of a sealed acoustic enclosure to maximize volume potential.","To test these two factors, I developed the following methodologies: ","Audio Quality<br/>How good a speaker sounds is largely subjective. Everyone has their preferences and most people aren’t trained to effectively analyze the audio performance of a speaker, but they can tell you if something sounds good or bad to them. I approach speaker performance from a very objective perspective: A speaker should reproduce an audio signal as accurately as possible. Of course, no speaker is 100 percent accurate. Environmental factors such as air pressure, altitude and humidity can affect woofer performance. To find the best performing speaker, I have to make sure they are all tested in the same environment: the audio test room in the Top Ten Reviews test lab in Ogden, Utah."]},"id":"580635b5-2556-4dd6-88a9-35c3574c2c87","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/kKK9H2zNyULGGuvYaRWkEC.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/marine-speakers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9UL1ovNzYwNTM1L29yaWdpbmFsL01hcmluZS1TcGVha2Vycy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwOC5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKK9H2zNyULGGuvYaRWkEC.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"kKK9H2zNyULGGuvYaRWkEC","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKK9H2zNyULGGuvYaRWkEC.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e284a1ea-2096-4cc5-b880-3d439032c968","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>I started by creating a 10-second sine tone that starts at 20Hz and transitions smoothly to 20kHz. I chose this frequency range because it represents the perceivable frequency range of humans. After warming up the speakers by playing music for 10 minutes and making my own personal notes about the performance, I played the sine tone through the speaker while recording the results with a sensitive directional microphone set up at 6 inches from the woofer. I looped the tone for five minutes. Then I used a frequency analyzer plugin, which scans the recorded tone and creates an average frequency signature based on the five-minute recording.","Comparing the recorded frequency signature to the original frequency signature, I was able to grade the low, mid and high frequencies by counting the spikes and dips. I made sure to dismiss any spikes and dips that appeared in every speaker&#39;s frequency signature, as these are likely caused by imperfections in the microphone, recording software or acoustic environment. After counting the spikes and dips, I considered the decibel impact of each spike. For example, a spike of 10 dB is big enough to hear, but you aren&#39;t likely going to perceive a dip less than 3 dB. After compiling these notes, the speakers with the fewest spikes and least impact received the highest grades because they reproduced the intended audio signal the closest.","Comparative Loudness<br/>Every speaker has a sensitivity rating. Audiophiles and marketing materials often point at this rating as one of the most important features of a speaker because it represents total volume potential. Sensitivity, represented in decibels, is the volume measured at 1 meter using 1 watt of power (though sometimes manufacturers use a 2.86-volt method, which uses more power than the watt method). The problem, however, is that this specification isn&#39;t regulated, which means manufacturers are basing the rating on best-case scenarios and methods and not necessarily real-world use.","The best way to get around this is to measure the volume produced by each speaker when using the same amount of power, which is exactly what I did. I set up a decibel meter 1 meter from the speaker and measure the volume at four levels. I used the same stereo for each speaker so that the power output was the same at each level. Then I graded the results.","Interestingly, the loudest speaker in these tests, the Clarion CMQ-1622RL, had the lowest sensitivity rating. Sometimes the sensitivity rating matched the grade in the comparison, like a speaker with a 90-dB sensitivity rating receiving a B, but often, the highest sensitivity ratings weren&#39;t the loudest.  "]},"id":"305d6cee-179f-45ae-bc3c-e030db6f8bdd","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/KvBYdEkUY7RdPuzzTAECUj.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/marine-speakers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9UL1kvNzYwNTM0L29yaWdpbmFsL01hcmluZS1TcGVha2Vycy1XZXQtU291bmRzLVhTNjVpYy1SR0ItMDAzLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KvBYdEkUY7RdPuzzTAECUj.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"KvBYdEkUY7RdPuzzTAECUj","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KvBYdEkUY7RdPuzzTAECUj.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9662efed-4a85-43d2-8cc5-6dbbbec377d8","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Other Important Considerations When Buying Marine Speakers</strong>","As part of my research, I consulted with Steve Stern, president of the Mobile Electronics Competition Association, which puts on car audio competitions, about how you can get the best audio system. Although we discussed car audio systems, his advice works for boats as well. As with any audio system, he urges, the most important considerations are compatibility and installation. In fact, he said, &#34;A tight install can work to bring out the best in even the most basic, inexpensive equipment. A weak install can bring unacceptable, compromised results with the most expensive and highly lauded speaker.&#34;","Here&#39;s some tips on making sure your new boat speakers are compatible with your current system:","Power Compatibility <br/>Before you buy a boat speaker, Stern suggests, make sure you know the limitations of your sound system. What are the stereo&#39;s power-handling specifications? This will tell you what type of speaker you can and cannot install on your boat.","Power handling is often viewed with regard to the speaker&#39;s quality. And indeed, there is some truth to that. Speakers with higher power-handling specifications are typically louder and more durable. However, it&#39;s more important to make sure your speakers match the stereo&#39;s (or amplifier’s) power output. This is critical, not only to ensuring both aren&#39;t damaged by being over- or underpowered, but for the speaker to perform optimally.","For starters, make sure the impedance of the speaker matches the impedance of the stereo. If a speaker is rated for 4 ohms, then the stereo needs to be rated for 4 ohms. (Most stereos have an impedance range. For example, the rating might be displayed as 3 – 16 ohms.) If the impedance doesn&#39;t match, the speaker will either draw too much power and burn out the amplifier, or it won&#39;t draw enough power and won&#39;t perform well.","Next, pair the continuous power handling. This represents the power that the speaker is rated to handle on a continuous basis. Exceeding this power with the stereo can wear out the speaker faster and risk blowing it.","Professional Installation<br/>Installing a speaker can be as simple as unplugging your old speaker and connecting the wires to your new one’s positive and negative ports. However, it is often not so simple.","After touring a local audio garage, Sound Warehouse in Ogden, Utah, I saw this for myself. The professional audio installers showed me the various gauges of wiring and what a difference the wiring can make in an installation. They argued that it&#39;s often the most overlooked problem in a sound system, and one that most people aren&#39;t prepared to fix. In other words, unless you have a strong grasp on the ins and outs of electrical wiring, having a pro install the speakers is worth it."]},"id":"d3e215d5-6910-470a-a872-193b1c4b03aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/CyD4kGC4RqvrkC8HT5jCJQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/marine-speakers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9UL1cvNzYwNTMyL29yaWdpbmFsL01hcmluZS1TcGVha2Vycy1GdXNpb24tRlItNjAyMi0wMDIuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CyD4kGC4RqvrkC8HT5jCJQ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"CyD4kGC4RqvrkC8HT5jCJQ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CyD4kGC4RqvrkC8HT5jCJQ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"811dec9b-123a-44e5-aba7-547ff079186d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Durability<br/>Marine speakers and <a href=\"/best-car-speakers\">car speakers</a> aren&#39;t very different. In some cases, such as the Polk MM1 series, the speakers are marketed for both cars and boats. The main difference between the two is durability. Boat speakers need to handle a life on the water – they usually live out in the open where they are exposed to sun, water and salt. Make sure you upgrade your boat speakers with units that are marine- certified.","Every speaker we reviewed is approved for marine use. This means they went through extensive tests that involved salt-fog resistance (which uses a saline fog spray to replicate marine environments), water resistance and UV resistance. We considered speakers that are certified by the American Society for Testing and Materials. This includes an ASTM B117 rating for salt and fog resistance and an ASTM D4329 rating for UV protection.","<strong>How to Test the Quality of Your Boat Speakers</strong>","Evaluating the quality of any audio system starts with the speakers. But you also need to know what to listen for; you have to train your ears to listen for specific aspects of the performance.

And because boats have to compete with the open acoustic environment of a lake or ocean, you should evaluate the speakers outside. This means towing your boat out of a garage if that’s where you store it in the winter. Start by standing in the captain’s chair as you listen. During each song, move around the boat. This provides different perspectives of how your passengers would hear the music. If you find an area of the boat where the audio is dull, you’ve found a hole in the audio system and can add a component speaker there."]},"id":"4a695eb5-30ad-4a5b-8a19-035b6ef42439","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_273","url":"/best-marine-speakers","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T21:45:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T21:45:00Z","name":"Best Marine Speakers of 2019","synopsis":"We tested each marine speaker in the same room, on the same mount, connected to the same receiver and recorded with the same microphone.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested each marine speaker in the same room, on the same mount, connected to the same receiver and recorded with the same microphone.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-18T19:39:51Z","id":"7qS9F38uZb6sYstZ8h5jf6","meta":{"title":"Best Marine Speakers 2019 - Boat Speaker Reviews, Test Results","description":"We tested each marine speaker in the same room, on the same mount, connected to the same receiver and recorded with the same microphone."},"products":[{"slug":"fusion-fr6022","url":"/product/fusion-fr6022","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","name":"Fusion FR6022","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"xiqMCv6w4PtfoaqQzSV7Ed","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"clarion-cmq1622rl","url":"/product/clarion-cmq1622rl","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","name":"Clarion CMQ1622RL","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"6aAv6zZLqgEStYtFaJQA3K","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"wet-sounds-xs-65ic-rgb","url":"/product/wet-sounds-xs-65ic-rgb","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","name":"Wet Sounds XS-65ic-RGB","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"op8x7Dk3EuVgfuyfytLqxG","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"polk-mm652","url":"/product/polk-mm652","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","name":"Polk MM652","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"Xi5jn59MaZrfDMN9ykiNdX","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"polk-db","url":"/product/polk-db","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","name":"Polk DB+","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"Ruv4hon5LsY6VsudMbJQxY","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/g2UDVHqbnW5gaGtoE7rupN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Marine-Speakers-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/T/V/760531/original/Hero-Marine-Speakers-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"g2UDVHqbnW5gaGtoE7rupN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2UDVHqbnW5gaGtoE7rupN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Marine Speakers of 2019","description":"We tested each marine speaker in the same room, on the same mount, connected to the same receiver and recorded with the same microphone."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/g2UDVHqbnW5gaGtoE7rupN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Marine-Speakers-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/T/V/760531/original/Hero-Marine-Speakers-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"g2UDVHqbnW5gaGtoE7rupN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2UDVHqbnW5gaGtoE7rupN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Marine Speakers of 2019","description":"We tested each marine speaker in the same room, on the same mount, connected to the same receiver and recorded with the same microphone."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"car-audio","url":"/travel-and-auto/car-audio","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","name":"Car Audio","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:41Z","id":"B67KUsfARUYAEoU9NRPp94","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
