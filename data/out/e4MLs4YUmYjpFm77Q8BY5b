The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-programmable-thermostats\">Programmable Thermostats</a> here.</em>","The Trane XL624 adds programmable thermostat capabilities to your Nexia home automation system. This smart thermostat supports a variety of HVAC systems. However, the energy-management tools are limited, and the unit does not support Wi-Fi connectivity. The technical support options for this thermostat are decent.","This programmable thermostat works with most HVAC systems, though you may get better performance with Trane-brand equipment. The XL624 can manage up to four heating stages and two cooling stages, which, in terms of heating stages, makes it more flexible than most thermostats. The Trane XL624 has a broad temperature swing of three degrees that promotes energy efficiency but may not make your home as comfortable as a narrow temperature swing would.","Advanced energy-management tools are scarce on the Trane XL624. The unit does not support geofencing, auto-scheduling or motion detection. These features are common on the best thermostats in our review. The XL624 has seven-day programming that allows you set up four distinct programs for each day of the week.","With four daily programs, you can customize the Trane XL624 to heat your home in the morning and turn the temperature down while you&#39;re away at work. A one-touch away setting overrides the programmed schedule if, for example, you are leaving on vacation. This thermostat has a humidity sensor to allow for control of your home&#39;s humidity.","Many of the Trane XL624&#39;s best features are tied to the Nexia home automation platform. Nexia automation allows you to remotely adjust your home&#39;s temperature and receive equipment alerts via a smartphone app. However, the unit requires that you purchase and install a Nexia bridge and pay a monthly subscription to enable this functionality. The XL624 does not support Wi-Fi connectivity, unlike higher-ranked wireless thermostats in our review.","The Trane XL624 requires professional installation, which means you need to have a Trane-certified technician install it in your home. Trane does not offer direct customer support through its website. Instead, you can find helpful support information on the Nexia website. You can contact Nexia support via email and telephone, though the company doesn&#39;t support live chat. The Nexia website also hosts an online forum if you subscribe to its home automation services. Trane provides five-year warranty protection for the XL624, which is the longest warranty offered in our lineup."]},"id":"46230aed-2508-42e3-81a1-164322cf9a71","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"003db656-8477-4fc5-8c7e-efec9de52a71","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Trane XL624 offers flexible temperature-control options for your home.
