Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You can easily buy and <a href=\"/best-gift-card-exchange-sites\">sell gift cards</a> with Monster Gift Card. However, the service only offers plastic gift cards, the website layout is dated and you can only receive around 50 percent of the value of your gift cards. If you want to sell a gift card, we recommend using Cardpool, the best site we researched for selling unwanted gift cards.","Monster Gift Cards lets you opt to receive cash or a digital payment when you sell your gift card. You can also receive a check or have funds paid into Dwolla, an online payment system that works essentially like PayPal.","This gift card service has several restrictions: You cannot sell a gift card that is under $10 or over $200. If you have a card that is above that value, the site requires pre-approval. Monster Gift Cards will only pay around 50 percent of a card’s balance, so if you are trying to sell a $25 card you will only get $12.50. You also cannot sell electronic gift cards; the service only accepts standard plastic gift cards.","Monster Gift Cards also offers cards discounted up to 40 percent, which is a higher discount than most exchange gift card sites. You can purchase plastic gift cards, with some that you can redeem online. Either way, the card will be your only expense because this service offers free shipping on all cards you purchase.","The site has several features that improve its customer experience. If you want a gift card that is currently out of stock, you can opt to receive email notifications when it becomes available again.","With over 500 merchants on the site, you may find the ability to narrow down your search a necessity. You can search by discount, category and retailer; it also features a general keyword search tool. The numerous search options make finding a gift card easy.","The service has a wide selection of support tools. Its website has an email address and a contact form for questions. In addition, the FAQs page offers answers to common problems or questions.","If you are looking to get the maximum value for selling your cards, this service isn’t the best for you. You’re better off choosing <a href=\"/cardpool-review\">Cardpool</a> for selling cards or <a href=\"/raise-review\">Raise</a> for buying cards. These sites offer better deals and are more reputable than Gift Card Monster."]},"id":"b7282cd0-83ad-49a4-a7b1-fec445b1760b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50063","url":"/monstergiftcard-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-13T15:33:46Z","datePublished":"2010-07-13T15:33:46Z","name":"Monster Gift Card","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","id":"oD8qFtZswj8cxaccYsGuLm","meta":{"title":"Monster Gift Card Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"You can sell your unwanted gift cards with balances of $10 to $200 for cash with Monster Gift Card.
