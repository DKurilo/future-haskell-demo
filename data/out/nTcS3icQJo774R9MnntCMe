You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Some of the best sound bars grab your attention with sleek curves and glossy finishes. This is not the case with the Boston Acoustics TVee 25. This <a href=\"/best-sound-bars\">sound bar</a> opts for a more understated look, with a gray matte finish and boxy speaker enclosure. Of course, sound bars are graded on more than aesthetics alone.","The Tvee 25 may be placed on a tabletop or mounted on your wall, which is easy thanks to the keyhole slots on the backside of the unit. Simply grab some sheetrock anchors and a couple of screws. We do recommend measuring twice before installing, because you can’t level the speaker if the mounting screws are crooked the first time around.","The 150-watt TVee 25 sound bar produces a large amount of sound, especially given its small dimensions. Generally, sound bars containing only two drivers are incapable of generating such substantial sound, but this speaker bar delivers. While big sound and booming bass are obviously desirable, a good sound bar is also able to produce crisp highs. Unfortunately,  the TVee 25 under delivers in this department, most likely because it only contains two full-range drivers.","While the speaker bar does not include a remote control, the Tvee 25 will learn to operate with the remote control of your choosing. Unfortunately, the process of programming your remote is a bit tedious, requiring a long series of button pushes. But once programmed, the controls work perfectly. We did notice however that the speaker bar’s height can obstruct your TV&#39;s remote sensor if you place the sound bar on a tabletop in front of your TV.","The included wireless subwoofer is smaller than many of the subwoofers featured in our sound bar reviews and contains only a single 6-inch driver. Usually a subwoofer containing only one 6-inch driver would be incapable of yielding such rumbling bass, but this wireless subwoofer exceeded our expectations.","The Tvee 25 contains one RCA input, one 3.5mm input and one digital optical input. The 3.5mm jack allows you to connect MP3 players, iPods, headphones, and more while the digital optical input allows you to hook up your favorite gaming consoles, DVD players and other audio and video components. The sound bar does not support Bluetooth or any similar technology, so you won’t be able to stream music from your Smartphone or iPod to the sound bar.","Customer support is unfortunately not very robust, nor is it always efficient. While telephone and email support are offered, our emails to customer support were routinely returned notifying us that the email address we were attempting to contact no longer offered customer support. We were then prompted to call telephone support. On a positive note, once we did connect with a customer service representative over the telephone, they were friendly and helpful. The TVee 25 comes backed with a one-year warranty.","We are impressed with the giant sound generated from this sound bar but are left disappointed with the limited connectivity options and less-than-stellar customer support. Not being able to successfully contact technical support via email is a problem Boston Acoustic needs to address. A few improvements such as including Bluetooth and the Boston Acoustics Tvee 25 could be a sound bar to be reckoned with."]},"id":"cf65bb90-dc18-43e0-80b1-3b935f866fe3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54617","url":"/boston-acoustics-tveee-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-04-20T20:10:26Z","datePublished":"2012-04-20T20:10:26Z","name":"Boston Acoustics TVEee 25","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"verdict":"The Tvee 25 produces great sound, but it&#8217;s plagued by tedious remote control programming, limited connectivity and subpar help and support.","pros":["The Boston Acoustics TVEee 25 sound bar generates big sound and impressive bass."],"cons":["Remote operation requires programming your own remote to use with the sound bar, a tedious process."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-04-20T20:10:26Z","id":"nTcS3icQJo774R9MnntCMe","meta":{"title":"Boston Acoustics TVEee 25 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Can you bring the excitement of the theater to your living room with a compact sound bar?
