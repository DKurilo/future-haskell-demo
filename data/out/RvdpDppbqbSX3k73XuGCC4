This tire uses thousands of microscopic pores that grip ice, which helps you brake faster than competing studded tires. As is typical for season-specific tires, their performance deteriorates on dry and wet road conditions due to how they grip the road.","Unfortunately, the Blizzak DM-V1 doesn’t come with a tread wear warranty. This does create some risk if the tire were to suddenly fail due to a manufacturing error, but they are known to last more than 20,000 miles of use from the product without issue. Instead, Bridgestone offers a 30-day trial period for you to test out the performance of the car tires on snowy surfaces. If you aren’t satisfied, you can simply return the tires for a full refund.","The design of the tire tread makes this one of the best truck tires on the market for keeping control on the road. Using Bridgestone&#39;s patented NanoPro-Tech rubber compound, the tire is designed inside and out to deal with severe snow conditions. The 3D sipes assist with material evacuation to provide better traction, an attribute also achieved through the presence of a centralized multi-Z tread block pattern to increase biting edges.","The Bridgestone Blizzak DM-V1 differs largely from snow tires designed for sedans. This tire carries a heavier weight and thus must employ different measures in retaining traction on potentially slippery surfaces. It successfully accomplishes this objective and creates a high-performance option for many large vehicle owners. As many tire stores will attest, Bridgestone knows how to make tires for any road condition, especially snow."]},"id":"3a95884e-7bea-4312-ba33-543d872f9d07","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58029","url":"/bridgestone-blizzak-dm-v1-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T15:03:07Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T15:03:07Z","name":"Bridgestone Blizzak DM-V1","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
