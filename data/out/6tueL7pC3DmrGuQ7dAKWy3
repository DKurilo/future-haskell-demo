You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We were fooled by the name at first too, but make no mistake – the eBosser embosses and cuts, and it does both well. This die cutting machine works differently than most on our lineup. With this die cutter, you use your actual dies, sandwiched with eBosser&#39;s platform system, and run them through the machine. The pressure applied by the eBosser will cut or emboss paper, fabric, wood and even thin metals.","This die cutter may seem a little low-tech – and it is compared to the sophisticated machines at the top of our lineup – but it is also easy to use and fast. If you have a collection of dies from the hand-crank days, this could be a very convenient way to use them again. This machine is strong too, cutting up to eight layers of fabric in a single pass, which is quite useful for quilting.","If you opt for the eBosser, you can get out your old dies from Sizzix, Spellbinders, Cuttlebug, AccuCut, QuickKutz and others and put them to good use. You also get several eBosser embossing folders to spark your creativity.","Again, this die cut machine is quite low tech, so it is not for everyone. It will pull the die through for you automatically, but in most other ways, it is just like the old hand-crank die cut systems. That makes it great for classrooms and anywhere else that you want children to be able to do die-cutting and embossing craft projects, though, because it is so easy to use. It also is much safer than many other die cutters on our lineup, with no blades to insert, and it does not need to be connected to the computer in order to function. With its small size and built-in handle, the eBosser is quite portable.","However, the eBosser will limit your design capabilities significantly. The dies you have in your collection are what you will have for design options. That is a far cry from die cutting machines that come with software that allows you to create totally original designs for each new project.","This die cut machine has the backing of good customer service from Craftwell, and we like that. The manufacturer&#39;s website offers clear and concise information."]},"id":"dd12dd44-973d-43a1-8dd2-7fe3c0cc205f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aa86ff3c-7d17-44da-9254-746e15440456","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["eBosser is a lower-tech version of a modern die cutting machine with many good qualities. This is not the unit for you if you want to have unlimited freedom to design your projects, or if you want the machine to be able to draw in addition to cutting and embossing. However, the eBosser is excellent for anyone who is concerned about safety and ease of use. We had this die cutter out of the box and running in about 30 seconds. There is no learning curve for new software, or set-up time or hassle of any kind.
