Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","It is pretty difficult to find a front-load washer that is less efficient than any top-load model; you have to work pretty hard to find a <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-load washer</a> that has a truly bad reputation, and most units come with solid warranties. What makes the Bosch WFVC3300UC stand out among competitors is the way it exceeds these already-impressive industry expectations.","While all the front-loading washers we looked at are efficient, the Bosch entry comes from a company that was named a 2010 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year.","All the front-loading washers we looked at have a fairly good reputation, but the Bosch machine is backed up by a Good Housekeeping Seal and a great reputation.","Each one of the front-loading washers in our lineup has at least a one-year warranty on parts, but this Bosch front load washer comes with a two-year warranty. That shows the manufacturer has confidence in the product. That gives us confidence in the product, too."]},"id":"91d68500-d794-4401-b0f9-4a3ddcb75009","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Efficiency"},"id":"0aec5386-e8af-49e9-9180-13348b65bbd6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Bosch probably does not deserve a medal for including features like time-delay start and automatic detergent, bleach and fabric softener dispensers. Most of the front-load washers we looked at included this, but these features will feel plenty amazing if you are moving up from an ancient top-loader that finally gave up the ghost. Some of those old beaters last forever, and they don’t help you distribute the right amount of detergent at the right time like this front-load washer will.","They also won’t schedule themselves to start at any time, up to 19 hours from the time you schedule the cycle. If you know there are better times to run a cycle, this Bosch front-load washer will accommodate your schedule.","It is difficult to imagine what factors a user might base a time-delay start on in this case. The machine is incredibly quiet and energy efficient, so concerns about noise and a strain on water and energy are really a moot point. Its footprint is so light that a burst of cold water in the shower because of a drain on hot water by this front-load washer is unlikely. But perhaps you want to plan for a load to finish right as you are coming home from work so you can transfer it into the dryer as soon as it is ready. Or maybe you want to schedule a load to coincide with a child’s chore schedule or a roommate’s designated laundry day. Whatever the case, the time-delay feature is at your service.","The noise level will really be a nice upgrade for most new front-load washer users. It’s not designed to be quite as calming as the sound of rustling leaves, which register at about 20 decibels, but at 52 decibels, this front-loading washer makes almost as little noise as a humming refrigerator (about 40 decibels).","This front load washer is quiet and also quite still. The design includes a sophisticated anti-vibration system, which makes it more adaptable to different settings. Front-loading washers have a reputation for shaking the whole house when they are running at full speed. Bosch took engineering steps to avoid this problem. Dare to put this front load washer in an upstairs laundry room. You won’t have to feel a rumbling throughout your house in your quest for clean clothes."]},"id":"9f405f64-e833-4fd2-a4b7-4ff2d4d8d24e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"2ae40777-162e-4f32-88f0-a869446d9807","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of the things that make this front-load washer so easy to use is the wide variety of cleaning cycles. Bosch customers will love features like the XxtraSanitary setting and an NSF-certified ability to kill 99.9 percent of common household bacteria. During the Xxtra Sanitary cycle, water is heated up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. You can position your dial and put your mind at ease when it is time to wash the washrags.","The Quick Full cycle is likely to be a favorite for many users as well. Any size of load can be in and out in 45 minutes. The Allergy Rinse, Wool/Handwash, Jeans, Baby Care, Comforter, Delicates and Drain &amp; Spin settings also help take the guesswork out of the equation for users and make the unit so easy to use.","The large capacity means you can clean rather massive amounts of laundry. With 4.4 cubic feet, Bosch WFVC3300UC is the largest in our lineup – not the largest available, but still pretty massive. We think its relative girth will come in handy. Spin speeds reach a very respectable 1,100 rotations per minute so clothes are well on their way to dry by the time they hit the dryer.","Things you may not notice at first  but will eventually appreciate from this Bosch front load washer include a suds sensor, unbalance sensor and leak protection system.","This Bosch washer also features some fairly standard front-loader creature comforts, but they are still worth some praise. For instance, Bosch manufactures a coordinating pedestal, which will help you stay organized and keep you from having to stoop down so often to access your appliance. And forget about trying to guess how much time remains in each cycle based on the rotation of a dial. The digital display leaves no doubt about when a cycle will begin or end.","Although common on many front-load designs, the ability to sense the level of water needed based on each individual load is still worth mentioning. This machine will know, based on which cycle you select and the amount of clothing you add, how much water to add to get your items sparkling clean."]},"id":"b63e8c45-f16e-4dd4-9cbf-ef287242922c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"65015f67-5a90-4a66-966c-8886dc8208f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This front-load washer is designed to be incredibly efficient.
