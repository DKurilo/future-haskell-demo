If it weren’t so expensive, it would have placed higher in our overall scoring. With an MSRP of $169, it is the least affordable <a href=\"/best-facial-cleansing-brushes\">facial cleansing brush</a> we tested. The most affordable product, the <a href=\"/neutrogena-review\">Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System</a>, is priced at just $22.99. However, the Neutrogena is not designed for gentle daily cleansing.","We reviewed some cleansers that use rotation cleansing technology and some that sonic/micro-vibration technology. The Clarisonic Mia 2 is the most sophisticated of the sonic devices. It uses sonic oscillation to cleanse and exfoliate your skin, oscillating at 300 micro-massages per second. It also has a built-in timer that beeps and pulses during a one-minute cleansing cycle, prompting you to focus for 20 seconds on your forehead, 20 seconds on your nose and chin and 10 seconds on each cheek. You then rinse and dry your face and continue with your skincare and makeup application routine.","Another popular sonic device we tested is the <a href=\"/foreo-luna-review\">Foreo Luna Mini 2</a>, and its use instructions are the same as the Clarisonic’s. Our testers liked the Clarisonic’s oscillation much better than the Foreo’s, saying the Mia 2 felt more comfortable to use and made their skin feel smoother.","Although the Clarisonic Mia 2 doesn’t come with a brush head for microdermabrasion, an attachment is available separately to provide this functionality. You can also purchase additional cleansing brush heads and a foundation brush head for applying and blending makeup.","This facial cleansing brush has two speeds: universal and delicate. It cleans gently enough for use twice daily and is waterproof for use in the shower. Its rechargeable battery has an LED indicator light and provides 80 to 100 minutes of use on a full charge, which takes about 18 hours. The charger magnetically attaches to the handle, but there is no charging dock. The Clarisonic is also lacking a storage case. If you travel often, we recommend the <a href=\"/vanity-planet-review\">Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa</a> because it comes with a protective case.","The Clarisonic Mia 2 comes with the cleansing device, a USB pLink charger, a Radiance brush head and a 1-ounce container of cleansing gel. The handle is available in lavender and pink. Clarisonic warranties the Mia 2 for two years, which is above-average consumer protection. Customer service is available by phone, email and live chat. "]},"id":"f0268c9b-7d19-4513-8fa7-c1bc041f34e2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65099","url":"/clarisonic-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","datePublished":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","name":"Clarisonic Mia 2","synopsis":"Our reviewers gave the Clarisonic Mia 2 an A+ rating for user experience.
