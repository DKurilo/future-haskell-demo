Few systems in our comparison fall below $200, but the Monoprice offers full 5.1 surround sound for below that.","The surround sound speaker system includes four satellite speakers, a center speaker and a subwoofer. The satellite speakers and the center speaker boast a frequency range of 110Hz-20kHz while the subwoofer handles all the frequencies below that, all the way down to 30Hz. The manufacturer&#39;s specs paint a picture that suggests these are top home theater speakers, but our listening tests suggested otherwise.","We had multiple reviewers watch a scene from a movie to evaluate how well the <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker system</a> performed. Our panel listened to each system for dialogue clarity, bass response and surround sound effect. Our panelists gave the Monoprice 5.1 surround sound speakers a respectable B- grade. The panel consistently described the sound quality as &#34;OK.&#34; Unlike when they listened to the <a href=\"/fluance-sxhtb-review\">Fluance SXHTB</a>, nobody in our panel was wowed by the sound quality, but they unanimously agreed that the system was a great improvement from the television speakers. When they listened to dialogue through the center and left/right main speakers, it sounded boxy and muffled â€“ like there was a box placed over the speakers. Boxy sound quality lacks brightness and sharpness, leaving the audio sounding dull.","The bass response of the subwoofer adds the presence of low-hitting frequencies, but it didn&#39;t stand out in our comparison. The 8-inch down-firing driver has good tonality, showing a natural sound quality to the bass, but it doesn&#39;t have the dynamic volume range that others boast. We had to crank this subwoofer to about three-fourths of its total volume to not only volume match with other subwoofers, but also to make any sort of impact on the overall sound quality."]},"id":"7b9d4cac-8831-4003-9376-7ce9671db1c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d1d0172c-24b9-4979-bbea-96d8b7a095c8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Monoprice Premium 5.1 home theater system is ideal for those on a tight budget looking to add surround sound to their home entertainment experience.
