Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Tom Tom XL 340 S is the least expensive in TomTom&#39;s XL 340 series, which is not all that feature-rich to begin with, at least comparatively. There are still things to like, though. This <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> unit comes loaded with more than 7 million points of interest, for starters. Also, the IQ Routes function is designed to give you the fastest route to your destination. That should come in handy any time you&#39;re running a bit late.","This navigation GPS unit comes with premium maps of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Tom Tom takes their maps seriously too. They start with one million more miles of roads than any other brand and they update their maps on-demand. Those updates include things like a change in traffic direction, new roads, new buildings and points of interest. It even includes verified user updates. Tom Tom navigation GPS units include information about which route is best depending on the time of day.","This navigation GPS receiver is easy to customize too. Users can select from a gallery of licensed art and professional designs so your unit reflects your personality. You can even use a favorite personal photo and personal text to wrap your new GPS. External touches can make a real difference, especially if you are buying one of these as a gift. We thought the Happy Mother&#39;s Day text was a nice touch on one of the example units.","You can also have a celebrity voice speak the directions to you from your navigation GPS, including characters like Yoda, Homer Simpson, SpongeBob Squarepants and C-3P0, as well as real voices like John Cleese, Kim Cattrall and Mr. T.","We were looking for quite a few features that just weren’t there, though. We&#39;re not thrilled with the relatively short battery life, for example. And other navigation GPS units we looked at had a way to program custom routes. This unit can&#39;t help you with that either.","There is also no voice recognition feature. Being able to call out addresses, favorite locations and more is a wonderful convenience as well as a great safety bonus. Anything that keeps your hands on the wheel when your car is in motion adds to safety, which leads us to our next disappointment with this unit – no Bluetooth capability. Here again, the increased safety is key. Many of our favorite GPS receivers allow you to make a hands-free call as long as your phone is compatible. Tom Tom XL 340 S is not one of them. This will not matter to every user, but this feature should be a consideration for any GPS device."]},"id":"be48d66e-3d63-482c-8579-9daa67b4a569","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3ec2e98d-c459-4473-8571-6e6840a8332a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This navigation GPS unit is a little pared down compared to others in the 340 line, and to other competitors in general, but the price is relatively small and you really do get quite a bit for your money here.
