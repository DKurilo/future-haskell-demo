The original review is below, but check out our current top products about </em><a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\"><em>Hardwood Floor Vacuum Cleaners</em></a><em> here.</em>","The iRobot Roomba  770 is excellently suited for use as a hard floor vacuum. Like other robot vacuums, it automatically whirs around a room, vacuuming dirt and debris so you do not have to. While Roomba 770 does not have the suction power of many comparably priced non-robotic vacuum cleaners, it has plenty of power to function effectively as a bare floor vacuum.","Roomba features a three-stage cleaning system. First, a spinning edge brush captures dust along the side of the robot to make sure your wall edges are clean. Second, two counter-rotating brushes channel dirt and debris into the suction path of the vacuum motor. Third, the vacuum pulls debris into the dustbin. <br/>After  the debris falls into the dustbin, the air passes through a filter before being expelled by the exhaust. The filter ensures that dust and particles that are too small to be captured by the dustbin will not be put back into the air of your house. Roomba uses dual HEPA filters that remove 99.97 percent of all particles that are larger than 0.3 microns. This makes the Roomba 770 an ideal wood floor vacuum if you suffer from allergies, because the dual filters will capture most of those aggravating particles.","The Roomba 770 cleans using an  algorithm-based cleaning method that uses the Roomba 770&#39;s optical and acoustic sensors to adjust to the peculiarities of the room, such as furniture and corners. This algorithm-based system means that the Roomba 770 will pass over each spot on your floor multiple times during its cleaning cycle.  One of the most useful features of the Roomba 770 is its ability to recognize extra-dirty areas and roll over them multiple times. This human-like response to problem areas means you can place trust in the Roomba 770&#39;s thoroughness.","The Roomba 770 automatically goes back to its base to recharge after a cleaning cycle, so you do not have to monitor its charge. You can control the Roomba 770 with either the touchscreen  onboard control panel or the included remote control. The remote is especially useful because it means you do not have to catch the Roomba 770 when it is in the middle of cleaning.","Robot vacuums are not for everyone, as their small size and on-board battery power creates suction power limitations, especially on medium- to high-pile carpet. However, when used primarily as a hard surface vacuum, the iRobot Roomba 770 is a well-designed alternative to a conventional vacuum."]},"id":"4714fd45-6dd8-4d40-b7c5-491e4b179e54","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59427","url":"/irobot-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-28T15:35:50Z","datePublished":"2014-04-28T15:35:50Z","name":"iRobot Roomba 770","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks in our lineup.
