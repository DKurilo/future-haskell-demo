You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","The resolution for the Elo 2242L <a href=\"/best-touchscreen-monitors\">touchscreen</a> isn&#39;t as high as other monitors we reviewed. However, it has a fast response rate and is one of the brightest screens we reviewed. The monitor has a beveled edge and weighs nearly 20 pounds.","The Elo 2242L has a 1680 x 1050 resolution, which is high definition, but it doesn&#39;t have as many pixels as a 1920 x 1080 screen. However, since the screen size is only 21.5 inches, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll notice a difference. This touchscreen monitor has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which in the past had been the standard aspect ratio for computer monitors. The brightness of the screen reaches 300 candela per square meter. The Elo 2242L has one of the brightest screens among the monitors we reviewed. The Elo 2242L touchscreen has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, which is standard among the monitors we reviewed. It has a 5ms response rate, which is also the most common speed. This rapid response speed will help your picture be crisp. Otherwise, you&#39;d see blurring or ghosting on the screen. Elo doesn&#39;t publish the pixel pitch, or space between pixels, for its monitor.","Elo uses surface acoustic wave technology. This type of LCD touchscreen uses ultrasonic waves to identify where your fingers, gloved hand or stylus touches the screen. Like almost all of the other touch screen monitors we reviewed, the Elo 2242L has an inlayed screen, which makes accessing the screen along the edge of the beveled monitor more difficult than a totally flat screen would be.","The viewing angles for this monitor are only 160 degrees vertically and horizontally. You should be able to recline the LCD touchscreen enough so that your arm can rest comfortably when you work on it. For this reason, it&#39;s important that the viewing angle be as large as possible so that you have a good view of the screen no matter how reclined the touchscreen is.","Since you&#39;ll probably adjust this touchscreen more than you would a standard monitor, it&#39;s important to have a touchscreen that&#39;s as light as possible. The Elo 2242L weights 19.3 pounds and is one of the heaviest monitors we reviewed. However, the stand has a very short spine, which means it sits very low, making the monitor more ergonomic."]},"id":"82aba2fa-3a3d-4226-b687-d0d97e4d03a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5e50db42-bcb9-458a-9d1f-6481e33e4e6b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Elo 2242L touchscreen monitor uses surface acoustic wave technology, which effectively conveys your movements to your PC.
