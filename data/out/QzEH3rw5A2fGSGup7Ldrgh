You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Corehan CHUN-ZZH-AN-01 is an in-dash navigation unit with Bluetooth compatibility as well as some basic smartphone connectivity. It has a large 7-inch capacitive touchscreen as well as a variety of ports and integration options. It has maps of the United States, Canada and Mexico preloaded. Though it lacks some connectivity and navigation functions, the Corehan GPS navigation is a good deal for its low cost.","The touchscreen <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">navigation system</a> runs Android 5.1 OS and has a quad-core 1.6GHz CPU, Mali400Mp2 GPU, 1GB DDR3 ROM and 16GB EMMC RAM. Via USB, you can connect mirroring for your Android smartphone. It is already set up to connect with a rear backup camera and will connect with the camera to show you the image live on the TFT LCD screen. The screen itself is in 16:9 ratio aspect and has high-definition 1024 x 600 resolution. It can also connect to your steering wheel controls so you can still use them to adjust the volume with this unit.","While the ability to play FLAC files and other file types is a huge positive for a music fan, the Corehan only allows you to play stored media files via an external storage device, like a USB drive. It isn’t able to play DVDs or CDs, unlike most other units on the market. Additionally, the navigation system is compatible with Bluetooth and Apple Airplay, which allows you to play music from your phone as well as make and receive phone calls hands-free. You can customize the background of the device’s interface but not the backlight color, which is set to blue.","The double-din unit comes with a VTR cable, harness, GPS antenna, and user and installation manuals. If you have questions, you can look though the informational resources on the manufacturer’s website or contact the technical support team directly via email.","The Corehan CHUN-ZZH-AN-01 is not feature-rich but it is affordable and does offer a large, high-resolution screen, decent smartphone integration, and basic navigation functionality found in most other aftermarket in-dash navigation systems. Considering its low price, it’s one of the best values on the in-dash GPS market."]},"id":"29470045-f04e-43f8-8838-45ab3202e5a1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69234","url":"/corehan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-04-17T14:59:22Z","datePublished":"2017-04-17T14:59:22Z","name":"Corehan CHUN-ZZH-AN-01","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":40,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-04-17T14:59:22Z","id":"QzEH3rw5A2fGSGup7Ldrgh","meta":{"title":"Corehan CHUN-ZZH-AN-01 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Corehan CHUN-ZZH-AN-01 has a large customizable display and lots of connectivity and integration options.
