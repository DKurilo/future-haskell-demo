Unlike most of our reviews, our goal with hearing aids isn&#39;t to find the best hearing aid, but to be a resource for your purchasing decision.","I cannot stress this enough, but I am not an audiologist. I have extensive experience reviewing the audio quality of speakers and headphones, and I&#39;ve reviewed senior care products since 2013, but I am not an expert in hearing loss. For the best hearing aid, you should consult with an audiologist so that you know what kind of hearing aid is best for you. Audiologist can also help with the customized fitting and customized programming, which is an important part of a hearing aid.  ","<strong>What We Tested</strong>","Since the best hearing aids are largely dependent on your hearing loss situation, we can&#39;t effectively test these devices for a comparison. Hearing aids really are dependent on the user&#39;s degree of hearing loss, ear configuration and comfort preferences.","Instead, we researched the best and most popular hearing aids on the market. We looked at user reviews and considered the specifications to provide excellent examples of how different types of hearing aids work for different types of hearing loss.","<strong>Hearing Aids: What to Look For</strong>","While you don&#39;t need a diagnosis from a physician or a prescription to purchase a hearing aid, we recommend you consult with an audiologist (a physician that specializes in hearing) to diagnose your hearing loss. Often, you need an audiologist to customize your hearing aid’s fit and programming so you can hear as well as possible. However, if you already know what type of hearing loss you have, you should consider the following features:","<u>Audio Format</u><br/>Hearing aids either use an analog method of amplifying sounds or a digital signal processor. The analog versions simply receive sound and amplify it. In many ways, this type of hearing aid creates a more natural listening environment. However, since age-related hearing loss is typically the result of your ears picking up a narrower frequency range than before, it is likely less about needing amplification and more about not being able to differentiate between many sounds – for example, being able to pick out your granddaughter&#39;s voice in a room full of people. In this case, an analog hearing aid isn&#39;t going to be much help. ","Digital hearing aids, pick up sound with a microphone and analyze and process it before it’s amplified. This means the hearing aid can focus its amplification and filter out background noises. In other words, you can hear your granddaughter in a room full of people. The advantage of digital is clear, which is why you won&#39;t find many analog hearing aids on the market. That said, analog hearing aids are more affordable, so they might be a good option if you&#39;re hearing loss is mild.","<u>Size &amp; Type</u><br/>The type of hearing aid you need depends on the nature and severity of your hearing loss. Minor hearing loss, namely that associated with age, is often improved with the use of an in-the-canal aid. Moderate loss requires more power, and in-the-ear models can help improve hearing quality. If you suffer from severe to profound hearing loss, though, you need more amplification, and that comes from the behind-the-ear and receiver-in-canal hearing aid models.","<u>Telecoil</u><br/>A telecoil is a small copper coil built into a hearing aid that makes talking on the telephone much easier, and it’s a common feature. Hearing aids with a telecoil filter out background noise and only pick up sounds from the telephone receiver. Some advanced models automatically switch to telecoil when you pick up a phone, while others transmit the signal to your other ear so you can talk using one hearing aid but hear the sounds coming from the receiver with both ears. If you work in a profession where you use the telephone frequently, you should look for an aid with a telecoil option.","<u>Additional Features</u><br/>There are additional features you&#39;ll want to consider when purchasing a hearing aid. For example, directional microphones help pick up sound when you&#39;re in social environments with lots of background noise.","In addition, advanced models have wireless connectivity, which lets you sync your aid to Bluetooth-compatible devices, such as your cell phone or television, and direct audio input lets you connect your hearing aid to audio devices. If you wear two hearing aids, some models can sync together so adjustments made to one are automatically made to the other.","Another feature you want to pay attention to is a hearing aid&#39;s ingress protection or IP rating. The IP rating indicates the degree to which the hearing aid is protected against dust or water.","<strong><strong>How to Choose the Right Hearing Aid?</strong></strong>","Finding the best hearing aid is a lot more complicated than reading about a comparison of brands and choosing the most affordable, least noticeable or most comfortable.","Here’s a quick step-by-step guide for choosing the best hearing aid:","<u>Step 1: Meet With an Audiologist</u><br/>Hearing aids aren’t one size fits all – different types of hearing loss require different types of correction. Hearing aids don’t simply amplify sound. Rather, they need to be tuned to amplify specific frequencies according to your hearing loss. This means you need to have your hearing loss diagnosed by an audiologist. Not only can they determine what kind of hearing loss you have, but they can also tune your hearing aid so it’s optimized to your hearing.","<u>Step 2: Consider Comfort Over Discreteness</u><br/>When you meet with an audiologist, ask to try on as many kinds of hearing aids as possible. If you don’t already wear hearing aids and have a comfort preference, this is essential to make sure you find a comfortable pair. Don’t underestimate comfort – it doesn’t matter how discreet your hearing aids are if they aren’t comfortable because you are more likely to take them out.  ","There are many kinds of fittings:"]},"id":"f89bd53d-094c-43df-90f4-40dd82b10a4a","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Completely in the canal (CIC &amp; mini CIC)","In the canal (ITC)","In the ear (ITE, full-shell ITE, half-shell ITE)","Behind the ear (BTE)","Receiver in canal (RIC)","Receiver in the ear (RITE)"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a9db2721-510f-4c84-8025-e809d06b6049","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Each fitting is designed for specific comfort preferences and hearing loss types. Choosing a hearing aid based on whether people can see it or not might not be ideal for your hearing loss.","<u>Step 3: Determine Budget</u>  <br/>With a lot of consumer products, you should set your budget before you go shopping. But with hearing aids, the above steps need to be worked out before you know what is even available. After finding out more about your hearing loss and comfort preferences, your audiologist can help you narrow down the list of appropriate hearing aids, which will vary in price, convenience features and battery life. How much you’re willing to pay can help you decide what convenience features you can afford. For example, if you have a smaller budget, you may not want hearing aids with Bluetooth and app control."]},"id":"f6affeb1-f584-4b83-8de2-b32c843a74c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f797f535-cdf8-4f65-a108-840e015fb8dd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://shop.audicus.com/products/dia-digital-hearing-aid?gclid=Cj0KEQiA1NWnBRDchObfnYrbo78BEiQA-2jqBSsFC2p-qVvJIfX5TrGEfmjKVsfVUF86QMS6NnCo3IMaAkDA8P8HAQ\">Audicus Dia</a>","<a href=\"http://shop.audicus.com/products/uno-digital-hearing-aid?gclid=Cj0KEQiAsdCnBRC86PeFkuDJt_MBEiQAUXJfLeDIdPgcDn-KMr1N62MYlw4RdUylcE6d5YLY-xG_JucaAia_8P8HAQ\">Audicus Uno</a>","<a href=\"http://advancedhearing.com/hearing-aids/hcx-hearing-aid?utm_source=Unbounce&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=HCX-HearingAids\">HCX</a>","<a href=\"https://www.hihealthinnovations.com/product/bte_power_plus\">hi BTE</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ovationhearing.com/ovation-boost-hearing-aid.shtml\">Ovation</a>","<a href=\"http://choicehearingaidproviders.com/hearing-aids/phonak/phonak-audeo-v-hearing-aids?kwd=%7Bkeyword%7D&source=google&ad=%7Bcreative%7D&med=cpc-pla&network=g&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc-pla&utm_campaign=Phonak_Audeo_V_PLA&cpgn=Phonak_Audeo_V_PLA&gclid=CPuzorLI_McCFQqDfgod7oMIxQ#.VfnoIhHBwXA\">Phonak</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Ears-Protection-Amplification-Discreet/dp/B005MVS42I/?tag=ttr_hearing-aids-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1572[art|NA[pid|66400[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Pro Ears</a>","<a href=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=50e01c1932669308687444846f8526fb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSimplicity-Hi-Fi-EP-Hearing-Aid-Left-Ear%2F14004242\">Simplicity Hi Fi</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f9a1ee70-44c7-4848-8c9b-c98c67fdfb40","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1572","url":"/best-hearing-aids","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-24T18:16:34Z","datePublished":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","name":"Best Hearing Aids","synopsis":"Your hearing is one of your cherished senses.
