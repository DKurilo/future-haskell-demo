It produces up to 6,000 British thermal units (Btu) of energy, which is enough power to cool a room up to 250 square feet.","This SPT unit is a good option if saving energy is important to you. It has an Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of 11.2, and while that isn’t the best EER we saw, the WA-6022S meets Energy Star requirements.","We estimated how much it costs to operate this air conditioner per year, based on running it eight hours a day for a three-month period – about the length of an average summer. The WA-6022S is estimated to cost $48 to operate per year, which is above average compared to other window ACs we reviewed but still competitive.","This SPT model has three fan settings that can run independent of the compressor to conserve energy. In addition, there is a dry mode, sleep mode and energy-saving mode. The dry mode removes excess moisture from the air – up to 1.8 pints per hour, which is better than average. The WA-6022S also has an auto-restart feature, so if its power supply is interrupted, the AC resumes its previous settings when electricity is restored.","SPT includes a remote control with this unit, so you can change settings from anywhere in the room. You can also make adjustments on the AC’s display panel.","Like many of the best window AC units, the SPT WA-6022S is compact – approximately 13 x 18 x 15 inches. It also weighs just 45 pounds, which is light compared to many similar window AC units, some of which weigh 50 pounds or more.","SPT includes a one-year warranty with the WA-6022S. Many similar products, including the <a href=\"/frigidaire-ffre0633u1-review\">Frigidaire FFRE0633U1</a>, carry five-year warranties on their compressors, so SPT’s coverage is a little disappointing. You can talk to a company representative by email or telephone, and there is a user manual on SPT’s website.","The SPT WA-6022S is a good option to consider. It has a variety of settings, including a dry setting that acts as a dehumidifier, and enough power to cool a room up to 250 square feet. This unit is also energy efficient, though its annual operating costs are slightly above average. However, the warranty is below average."]},"id":"19854c24-cc66-4beb-9c26-30e29cb21197","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64971","url":"/spt-wa-6022s-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-19T23:13:23Z","datePublished":"2015-05-19T23:13:23Z","name":"SPT WA-6022S","synopsis":"The SPT WA-6022S is an energy-efficient, compact window air conditioner.
