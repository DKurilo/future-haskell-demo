The glossy front panel is a great visual frame for the 5-inch midrange driver, which is made of yellow woven glass fiber. In addition, you can choose either a black ash or natural walnut finish for the MDF cabinet. This makes it easy to match the speakers to your current home décor.","They have dual 8-inch low-frequency drivers made of polypropylene, which delivered accurate, well-proportioned bass during our movie-listening test. The word “warm” was used multiple times to describe the speakers’ sound as we watched action scenes from “Mad Max: Fury Road.” We sat 12 feet from the TV and speakers during our test but found that the bass became even more prevalent 15 to 20 feet away. This means the Signature Series speakers aren’t a good choice for small rooms, particularly if you sit less than 10 feet away from your home theater system. You may want to consider smaller floor standing speakers like the <a href=\"/elac-debut-f5-review\">ELAC Debut F6.2</a> if you have a small entertainment room.","We listened to songs from a variety of genres for our music test, including Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky.” This song has a good mix of all the important frequencies for speaker testing. We found that the Signature Series towers had a hard time projecting the treble frequencies at a proportionate volume to the bass frequencies. There were moments when the guitar part was hidden by the chest-thumping bass guitar and kick drum, unlike with the best speakers we reviewed.","The speakers’ design is not just visually stunning, but it also has some unique and useful features. The binding posts, found on the back panel, are designed better and more durable than on any other speaker we tested. In addition, the speaker grille attaches to the front panel magnetically. This grille hides the glossy front panel, but that may be for the best considering how easy it is to see fingerprints and smudges on the shiny surface.","The rear-ported cabinet needs to be placed at least 3 feet from flat surfaces to ensure that the low-end response sounds its best. Also, the well-designed floor spikes and outriggers make the speaker even wider but ensure that these heavy speakers do not tip over if they get bumped.","Fluance offers the best warranty and support options of any speaker manufacturer in our review. It covers parts, labor and return shipping for the life of the speaker, as long as it isn’t damaged by accident or misuse. If the speaker can’t be fixed or is discontinued, Fluance replaces it. You can contact the manufacturer by phone, email and live chat if you have any questions.","The Fluance Signature Series floor speakers deliver warm- and accurate-sounding music and movie content. These speakers are a significant audio upgrade for your home theater, though we don’t recommend them for small rooms."]},"id":"a0c229a8-4579-4a02-9cf4-19263a3877fa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69453","url":"/fluance-signature-series-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-06-12T14:54:56Z","datePublished":"2017-06-12T14:54:56Z","name":"Fluance Signature Series","synopsis":"From the moment we unboxed the Fluance Signature Series floor standing speakers, there was no doubt that they would be the best-looking speakers in our review.
