You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Torch <a href=\"/best-internet-browser-software\">internet browser</a> joins the ranks of the best browser services in style. This Chromium-based software works great for daily browsing, but also has a few unique aspects that work in sync with your toolbar. This commercial freeware places a large focus on music downloads and, oddly enough, torrents. It currently works on every version of Windows.","Not much differentiates the look of Torch&#39;s interface besides the specialized icons directly to the right of your browser bar. The first, the share button, allows you to instantly post to Facebook or Twitter without visiting the sites themselves. The media button is fantastic if you casually listen to music while on the net. When you find a song file that you want to save, the media grabber allows you to save it instantly.","While it may not sound like a service a major internet browser would want to brag about, the torrent icon brings up a simple chart showing all current downloading tasks. Lastly, the Torch Music icon allows you to sync up music and share it on your mobile device. These four icons are very specialized and give this browser the necessary bump to rank it above similar browsing services.","The major downside to Torch is that the search browser does not lend itself to a browsing app. It has developed a quality Torch Music app, but it doesn&#39;t help much if you want synchronization with your browsing history and favorites.","We can see definite speed improvements of Torch&#39;s browsing speed over past versions. We cold-booted the browser and loaded our site, and it loaded in an above-average 2.53 seconds. The average refresh, based on 10 refreshes, is an impressive 1.5 seconds. This speed places Torch among the fastest internet browsers.","Torch provides the basic features needed in a quality browser. This open-source service has a great download manager, an incognito window for private browsing and the possibility for several add-ons. The current version is missing a few features, such as a password manager, mouse gestures and voice interactivity, which holds it back from ranking higher."]},"id":"a697a5fd-c098-4d6d-a352-a3fba0cfb8d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4690d698-7784-44da-865f-6d6aa2ebf824","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Torch internet browser provides an above-average browsing experience on your personal computer.
