You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Samsung ME21F707MJT over the range microwave has standard features and a stainless steel design. While it does not stand out as the best <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">over the range microwave oven</a> on the market, it is a good choice for a solid and basic microwave.","This over the range microwave has a strong power level of 1,000 watts. In case you need to cook certain items with more than one power level, this microwave offers multi-stage cooking. You can program up to two cycles with any one of the 10 power levels for a specific time, and the microwave automatically adjusts the power level while your food is cooking. If you know best how much power and how long your favorite item needs, you can program the custom-cook button. This built-in microwave has an average-sized exterior and a larger interior capacity than most – 2.1 cubic feet – which is always helpful.","By detecting the moisture in your food, sensors automatically adjust the cooking time so your food reaches the perfect temperature. This over the stove microwave has more sensor options than many models we reviewed. The sensor cooking includes settings for popcorn, pizza, potatoes, veggies and frozen foods. And the sensor reheat brings your leftovers back up to temperature, ensuring that foods like pasta will not be dry or overdone.","Several auto cycles are programmed for specific foods. Auto defrost will take care of your frozen beef, chicken, pork and fish. There are presets for softening butter and cream cheese, melting butter or chocolate, and cooking kids&#39; snacks like chicken nuggets, French fries and pocket sandwiches. The keep-warm setting makes sure that your food is waiting for you at the perfect temperature if you aren&#39;t ready to eat right away. However, it does not offer convection cooking, so you can&#39;t bake with it. This model also lacks a delay start feature so if you were hoping to get that feature, look at the <a href=\"/kenmore-elite-review\">Kenmore Elite</a>.","Clearing the air at 400 cubic feet per minute and at four different speeds, the ventilation system in this model is second to none on our lineup. It can move air to the exterior of your home, but if your kitchen can&#39;t support exterior venting, this over the range microwave oven still filters and recirculates polluted air in the kitchen. It even starts clearing the air automatically when it detects too much heat, steam or smoke radiating from your stovetop.","This microwave is available only in stainless steel, which means it doesn&#39;t fit every kitchen&#39;s color scheme. You do get a cooking rack to increase your cooking space, and you can turn off the turntable if the dish you are cooking is oversized or extra heavy. The manufacturer offers a solid warranty, with the standard one year on parts and labor and a full 10-year warranty on the magnetron, the main cooking component in your microwave. The website is well organized and easy to use. It provides a phone number and email address for customer service as well as live online chat, which is a nice support option."]},"id":"2ec26746-01b8-4f8e-9755-78145f65f2f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"495ff7cf-a2a2-4828-a68f-2e24f07cb5de","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung ME21F707MJT is a notable over the range microwave with plenty of sensor and automatic cooking options, ample space, and powerful ventilation, although it lacks the convection abilities of some other microwaves.
