You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When it comes to laundry, few <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">all-in-one washer dryers</a> compare to the GE Spacemaker. It contains all of the washing and drying programs expected of standard appliances, wrapped into a compact and stacked package. Separating the washer and dryer lets you run both appliances at once, maximizing the efficiency of your laundry time without taking up too much space in your home.","There are several reasons the GE Spacemaker is one of the best washer dryer combos on the market. First, it contains a moisture sensor, a critical feature in saving energy and preventing damage to clothes caused by over-drying. Second, it offers a capacity of 3.3 cubic feet in each device for greater speed in cleaning and drying. Third, it uses nine wash programs and four drying settings for individualized laundry care.","An important feature of note is the machine&#39;s requirement of a 240-volt outlet. The GE Spacemaker uses a larger four-pronged receptacle and thus cannot plug into a standard household socket. Some compact dwellings may not have such an outlet, which restricts the number of consumers able to use the combination washer dryer. However, if your home has the needed outlet, you’ll be able to run the washer and dryer at the same time for maximum efficiency.","The GE Spacemaker isn’t among the most compact of combination washer dryers, due to its stackable design. Whereas other appliances might combine both washer and dryer functions into a single device, this device is designed more for the consumer who likes being able to run both the dryer and washer at once. The appliance measures at 26.8 inches wide, 75.5 inches tall and 30.9 inches deep. This device is quite tall, and thus  so you won&#39;t be able to place shelves above the appliance, as many users do in their laundry room.","While better than most washer dryer combos on the market, the Spacemaker suffers from some infrequent design flaws. Its wash basket is made of plastic, a much less durable material than the stainless steel used in most standalone washers. The dryer&#39;s lint filter, meanwhile, can sometimes damage clothes by catching on buttons and strings.","The GE Spacemaker is a popular, reliable, stackable combo washer dryer. If your home has a 240-volt power outlet, you’ll be able to take full advantage of its benefits. With the efficiency of its dryer and the cleaning power of its washer, this is an appliance capable of performing almost any laundry job."]},"id":"003a3612-caad-46dd-b5c9-9867c71e82c4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58680","url":"/ge-spacemaker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-23T15:05:09Z","datePublished":"2014-01-23T15:05:09Z","name":"GE Spacemaker","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
