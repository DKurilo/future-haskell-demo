You&#39;re uneasy about it, but there is no way around it; you just can&#39;t be in two places at the same time. However, thanks to modern technology, there is a way that you can see what&#39;s going on at home when you are not there. This piece of equipment commonly used to observe babysitters is known as a <a href=\"/best-nanny-cams\"><strong>nanny cam</strong></a>.","Nanny cams are small spy cameras that can be hidden in various places and disguised in various ways so that the actual camera goes undetected. Like all technological gadgets, a nanny cam used to be a huge investment, but now you can get your very own for a minimal expense. At TopTenREVIEWS, we have reviewed the best nanny cams and listed the pros and cons of each one. What you are looking for will determine what the best spy camera is for you.","Of the models we reviewed, the cheapest nanny cam is $59.99 and is disguised as an alarm clock. This form of spy camera has all of the basic features that you need to record your children and babysitter. At $59.99, the expense shouldn&#39;t break the budget either. The most expensive nanny cam we reviewed costs $449 and is disguised as an iPod docking station. The overall rating for this nanny cam is one star less than the $60 nanny cam; however, it does virtually the same thing with minimal differences. If you are looking for an average nanny cam for a minimal expense, try the nanny cam that is disguised within a smoke detector. The overall rating on this camera, however, is lower than other models we reviewed, and it has minimal features compared to other types of spy cameras.","If you are searching for a recommendation on a good and reliable nanny cam, look no further than our recommendations. The three top-rated nanny cams include the Streetwise Security <a href=\"/dvrdmdc-alarm-clock-review\">DVRDMDC Alarm Clock</a>, the <a href=\"/svat-alarm-clock-review\">SVAT Pl300-SD Alarm Clock</a> and the <a href=\"/svat-recording-system-review\">SVAT Pl1000 Recording System</a>. Based on expense, the cheapest nanny cam is Streetwise Security DVRDMDC Alarm Clock, which is reasonably priced at $59.99. The SVAT Pl1300-SD Alarm Clock is priced at $239.95, while the SVAT Pl1000 Recording System is priced at $330.90.","For a basic and simple nanny cam for those who want to keep their expenses to a minimum, you can purchase the Streetwise Security DVRDMDC Alarm Clock; however, if you want to upgrade and get something a little bit more high tech and pricey, then one of the other two listed above is the way to go. You get what you pay for, which includes time-scheduled recordings, adjustable recording qualities, motion masking, overwrite selector and an RCA Video Output.","If you are searching for a nanny cam, it is probably safe to say that you have some concerns about your babysitter and the safety of your children. If you suspect something or find evidence that there are issues between your child and babysitter, go with your gut feelings. It is better to be safe than sorry, and the money that you use to invest in a nanny cam is a minor expense when it comes to the safety and well being of your child.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To."]},"id":"4ddde455-22e2-4730-b532-8a032003c58c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6462","url":"/which-nanny-cam-is-right-for-your-family","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"stephanie-bowen","url":"/author/stephanie-bowen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Stephanie Bowen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"Ekz9StiaJGBnoM6LrpGdL7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-17T15:39:21Z","datePublished":"2011-08-17T15:39:21Z","name":"Which Nanny Cam is Right for Your Family?","synopsis":"So, you've hired a babysitter to watch after the kids while you are at work or running errands.
