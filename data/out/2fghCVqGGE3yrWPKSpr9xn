You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Motorola is one of the best-known brands for smartphones, but the Motorola S11-Flex HD has been among the best Bluetooth earphones for a long time. It features a sweat-proof design that makes it a good companion for the gym, so long as you&#39;re able to find a comfortable fit with the bulky design.","Motorola markets the S11-Flex HD as having better sound quality than wired in-ear headphones, but we didn&#39;t find this to be the case. The audio quality is good but not great. It&#39;s indicative of Bluetooth technology, which has limitations because it compresses the audio signal so that it can transmit wirelessly. It&#39;s one of the few wireless earphones with internal EQ settings to boost bass, mids and treble frequencies. However, the EQ settings never seemed to improve on the original audio quality.","The best feature of the S11-Flex HD is the quick-charge technology. For every five minutes plugged in, you get an hour of battery life. With six hours of battery life, that means you can fully recharge it in less than 30 minutes. The average recharge time for <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">wireless Bluetooth earbuds</a> is two hours. The downside to the charger is that it requires a wall plug. You can&#39;t plug it into your computer&#39;s USB port like most wireless earphones.","This earphone set boasts of a flexible design that features five points of adjustability so that you can get a customized fit. Unfortunately, no matter how much we adjusted the five points, we couldn&#39;t find a comfortable fit. Unlike most wireless earbuds, it has a rigid neckband. Within this rigid neckband is a soft gel neckband that you adjust to fit the size of your head for a secure fit. The problem with this design is that it&#39;s too secure. Every time you move your head, it pulls on the neckbands, which pulls on the earbuds. You&#39;re always aware that you&#39;re wearing it, which is not how your wireless earbuds should be.","The S11-Flex HD is sweat-proof like most wireless earbuds for running, but it&#39;s not water resistant, impact resistant or sand-proof. It can handle your workouts and leisure listening, but you wouldn&#39;t want to run on the beach or take it out in the rain. It doesn&#39;t come with a carrying case, which you&#39;ll want because of the bulky size and lack of durability. You can&#39;t just throw these in your gym bag or backpack and expect them to survive."]},"id":"bb4b9fed-4817-4464-bea3-0da47cd1fe93","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dbb774de-caa7-41dd-b064-86590227b86b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola S11-Flex HD has a sweat-proof design.
