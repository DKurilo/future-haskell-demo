But are they worth the extra money?","All of the new hybrids are really heavy. The inclusion of pocket springs makes these mattress a two-person job to move them around. When I unboxed the Leesa Sapria, it only took a couple minutes to take shape. Like the other Leesa mattress, the plastic smell after unboxing tends to linger longer than most. It took a couple weeks for the smell to completely dissipate. I slept on the Sapria mattress for a week and found it to be comfortable. This mattress includes pocket springs below a layer of avena foam and memory foam. It’s incredibly soft feeling. For me – a natural stomach sleeper – it was a bit too soft. It is very comfortable, but after long periods in bed, my lower back would get a bit sore. I would say for someone who sleeps on their side, this could be a good option.","My co-worker took the GhostBed Luxe home with him for an extended period of time. Like the Leesa Sapria and the Purple 2, this mattress is very heavy. Please exercise caution when getting this into your home. He said the plastic smell after unboxing dissipated after a full day, which is good and more on par with other mattresses. However, he felt indifferent about the mattress.

I think you get as much comfort and support with the original Lessa, Purple and Ghostbed mattresses when compared to their luxury hybrid models, and you save money.","<strong>What Kind of Sleeper Are You?</strong>","Do you tend to sleep on your side, stomach or back? Do you share a bed with your partner? These factors should influence the type of mattress you buy. Side sleepers put most of their weight on specific pressure points – hips, knees and shoulders. Side sleepers generally benefit from the pressure relief properties of memory foam mattresses and medium to medium-soft mattresses.","Back sleepers need a supportive mattress that is comfortable. Back sleepers can benefit from a variety of mattresses including foam, latex and spring mattresses.","Stomach sleepers desperately need supportive mattresses. They generally suffer from lower back problems because the back is concave. Breathing problems can also occur from all of their weight being on their chest during sleep. Firmer and more supportive mattresses are often the best solution for stomach sleepers.","If you sleep with another person in bed, you’ll want something with minimum motion transfer.

You can get organic latex foam that isn’t made from any unnatural processes. This is good for people who prioritize being environmentally conscious, as well as people looking for a hypoallergenic mattress.","Spring Mattresses<br/>More-traditional spring and pillow-top mattresses tend to not last as long. The springs or coils within the mattress eventually wear out, and the mattress will begin to sink and ultimately lose support. That said, spring mattresses are usually easy to find and relatively inexpensive (in most cases). Plus, there are varying levels of firmness to choose from to find one that’s comfortable for you. <br/><strong><br/>How Much Does a Mattress Cost? </strong>","Another thing to keep in mind is cost. Mattresses vary widely in price depending on the company and the materials used to build the mattress. Based on our research, the cost of a queen-size mattress can run anywhere from $600 to $1,600. Purple’s newest mattress, the Purple 2, uses hyper-polymer technology coupled with pocket coils for extra support. Its comfortable and supportive but costs $1,600 for a queen – twice as expensive as our budget pick.","<strong>More Guides to Help You Sleep Better:</strong>"]},"id":"de2c19a2-0b9a-4794-8b6d-c66eb1bd4145","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-alarm-clocks\">The Best Alarm Clocks</a>","<a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">The Best Humidifiers</a>","<a href=\"/best-sound-machines\">The Best Sound Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-smoke-detectors\">The Best Smoke Detectors</a>","<a href=\"/best-programmable-thermostats\">The Best Smart Thermostats</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"357120e2-13d2-4464-9a6d-3c231bbd6500","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_50","url":"/best-mattress","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T02:59:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T02:59:00Z","name":"Best Online Mattresses of 2019","synopsis":"I ordered 10 mattresses online, slept on each one and tested each company’s free-trial and return promises.
