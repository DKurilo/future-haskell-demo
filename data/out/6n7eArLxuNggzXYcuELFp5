It&#39;s intuitive and offers a clean, stylish interface befitting any modern Mac application.","This drawing program for Mac is designed to work with a pen tablet. It has an upper toolbar and lower curved tool palette to access the same tools. You simply click on a tool in the palette and a circle of related tools pops up.","Autodesk SketchBook Pro is not a vector-based program. This means that the images you create are not well suited for print, unless you print them quite small. So if you create fliers or T-shirts with your images, your graphics will appear pixelated if you blow them up too large.","It offers a host of features and tools, but not many of the  tools that some of other drawing apps commonly offer, like tools for designing house layouts or landscapes. This Mac drawing app is more of a creative tool and less of a professional design or planning tool. However, it does include some popular tools for creating lines and shapes, like a select tool, lasso select tool, ruler, ellipse, French curve, and horizontal and vertical symmetry quadrants to help you center and section your drawings.","This drawing app offers different line strokes. You can crop images and change the responsiveness of the stylus. You can also work in different layers, which merge when you save, and scroll in or out to focus on drawing details.","Autodesk SketchBook Pro has an impressive brush library. The brushes can simulate the texture of a ballpoint pen, pencil, marker, felt-tip pen, paintbrush and more. You can create your own custom brushes and save them for future use. You can also share your custom brushes with others.","It&#39;s easy to create artwork in this Mac drawing software with a pen tablet, but you can just as effectively use your mouse or a trackpad. This Mac drawing app is available for iPad.","Autodesk offers full support for its customers. It gives you the options of online FAQs, a user forum, video tutorials, and email and phone support.","Autodesk SketchBook Pro has a simple user interface with extensive, flexible drawing and writing tools. It doesn&#39;t have all the tools and features common in other Mac drawing apps, but you can still use this Mac drawing software to create beautiful works of art."]},"id":"8beadaaf-50fd-406e-bf2c-332b78876983","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68555","url":"/autodesk-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T13:49:37Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T13:49:37Z","name":"Autodesk Sketchbook Pro","synopsis":"Autodesk SketchBook Pro is easy-to-use Mac drawing software.
