We did our homework by researching coffee makers in general, studying online reviews, examining sales trends and investigating a wide variety of sources. We also consulted long-time baristas and restaurateurs about what they look for in a home coffee maker."]},"id":"95cdb02d-4f2e-44d5-a43a-0f911e0ff9e9","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/RAupYhVEAam9xZoRfczwdW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/coffee-makers-krups-savoy-ec314050-testing-001/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9KL0cvNzc4MzAwL29yaWdpbmFsL0NvZmZlZS1NYWtlcnMtS1JVUFMtU2F2b3ktRUMzMTQwNTAtVGVzdGluZy0wMDEuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RAupYhVEAam9xZoRfczwdW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"RAupYhVEAam9xZoRfczwdW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RAupYhVEAam9xZoRfczwdW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"189e3c0b-42ce-4463-a02c-8b84926a252e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Afterward, we trimmed our list, chose products and embarked on three days of testing in our kitchen test lab. Our tests included tasting sessions with several coffee-loving panelists who made notes and offered comments on the coffee produced by each machine.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We lined up the machines side by side and prepared full pots of coffee using tap water and a well-known, popular brand of grounds, following the instructions and measurements described in each user manual. We repeated the process then asked a panel of coffee lovers to rate each machine’s coffee for taste, strength and aroma as well as to note their general observations.","We tested the temperature of the coffee immediately after brewing and later noted the temperature after it had been on the warming plate or inside the insulated carafe for 15 minutes and 30 minutes. We did this to see how well each coffee maker maintains temperature. In addition, we evaluated the machines’ brewing speeds by timing how long it took to brew four cups and eight cups of coffee, and we repeated the tests to ensure we got a fair picture of each device&#39;s capabilities."]},"id":"7fcedd5d-1c0e-45e3-9607-9bd44497687e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/xbEamRqNut7sLWdWgEteDb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/coffee-makers-testing-002/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9KL0kvNzc4MzAyL29yaWdpbmFsL0NvZmZlZS1NYWtlcnMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDIuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbEamRqNut7sLWdWgEteDb.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"xbEamRqNut7sLWdWgEteDb","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbEamRqNut7sLWdWgEteDb.jpg","alt":""},"id":"76e058fc-893a-401b-8fe4-c48a62f707a7","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>As we tested, we made notes about ease of use, including how easy it was to program and set up each machine. For example, we recorded details about how troublesome it was to plug an extra-short electrical cord into a nearby outlet. In addition, we considered whether each machine has features that make it easy to adjust the coffee it brews to your preferences.","<strong>How Much do Coffee Makers Cost?</strong>","Good quality home coffee makers run the gamut from $25 to more than $200, but price alone does not guarantee exceptional quality. Even modestly priced coffee makers intended for home use can produce excellent coffee and offer enough features to satisfy the most discerning coffee aficionado.","<strong>Further Information</strong>","Jeff Furton, owner of Daily Rise Coffee in Utah, has clear ideas about what he wants in a home coffee maker. &#34;What I look for is a thermal carafe so the coffee&#39;s not going to burn after it&#39;s brewed. I like a cone brew basket and a large shower head that pulses.&#34;","The big, pulsing shower head emits some hot water first to saturate the coffee grounds before the actual brewing starts, which helps extract the greatest amount of flavor from the grounds. A cone-shaped brew basket compresses coffee grounds, which also assists in getting the greatest amount of flavor from them.","Even if you buy a modestly priced coffee maker, the quality of your coffee can make an enormous difference in taste, according to Furton. Fresh, local and organic coffee beans typically yield excellent flavor. He also strongly recommends grinding whole coffee beans right before brewing to get the best taste.","Although preprogramming coffee makers the night before is not the ideal arrangement, it does help many people, Furton said. It just won&#39;t make the very best coffee. &#34;There&#39;s a convenience factor there, and you&#39;re still going to get a pretty good cup, but you&#39;re probably going to want to grind it right before brewing.&#34;"]},"id":"de50ecea-5c6b-4fc2-b483-10b86cbaa03f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/wwz25CyjPk9GHtLNHro4Ae.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Eric Hatch, the lead roaster at Millcreek Coffee Roasters, said he believes the water in a home coffee maker has to reach around 200 degrees Fahrenheit to do the best brewing job. &#34;Some of the cheaper models don&#39;t get that warm, and to get proper extraction, you need hot water.&#34;","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/coffee-makers-testing-001/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9KL0ovNzc4MzAzL29yaWdpbmFsL0NvZmZlZS1NYWtlcnMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDEuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wwz25CyjPk9GHtLNHro4Ae.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"wwz25CyjPk9GHtLNHro4Ae","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wwz25CyjPk9GHtLNHro4Ae.jpg","alt":""},"id":"23cd79a3-79c3-4bad-92ae-1078a8e035c6","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Hatch also looks for a shower head that distributes the hot water evenly onto the coffee grounds. &#34;A lot of units will throw water heavily to one side or the other, so one half is over-extracted and the other half is under-extracted.

One of the best things a person can do is buy a coffee grinder. Buy whole beans from a local roaster, beans that you know have been roasted within the past week.
