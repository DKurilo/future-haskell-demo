Unfortunately, it brings up the tail end of our product lineup because it lacks most of the key features we looked for in this category.","The best thing this software has to offer is the quality of the copy it produces. In our tests, this product produced a perfect 1:1 copy of a commercial disc. It also has the ability to compress the contents of a DVD to fit onto a smaller-capacity blank disc; however, this option reduces the quality. Of the ten programs we reviewed, this was one of the best at producing a high quality compressed file. So it performs its primary function exceptionally well.","The program is also straightforward to use. The entire interface is two screens. The primary screen allows you to begin copying a DVD with a single click. The options menu is similarly simple. There are a few technical options here, among them is the ability to burn an exact copy of your disc on DVD-9 with no quality loss. If this option is not selected, the program will automatically compress your copy to fit onto a smaller DVD-5. You can do all this in seconds before you start the copying process.","You can make a copy of a disc in less than an hour using this software. If you’re making a compressed copy of a disc, it takes a little more than 30 minutes and a little less than an hour to make an uncompressed copy. This is about the average speed of the products on our lineup.","By default, however, this program will not bypass the copy encryptions found on commercial discs. If you want to make copies of mainstream DVDs, you’ll need to download and install a plug-in from a third party site. This is something of a chore, but you only have to do it the first time you use the program.","As good as this program is at copying DVDs, it’s missing many of the critical features we looked for in our review: The best DVD copy software gives you the ability to copy the ISO of a disc onto your computer so you won’t need the original disc to make future copies. They also allow you to select exactly which content you want to copy onto a new disc or split a large commercial disc onto two smaller blank DVDs. All of these features are absent from 1Click DVD Copy."]},"id":"34205c41-d09c-4d5e-9b65-6175e9aea952","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5c0e7ce2-52e9-47bc-afa5-17406ba43cf7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This program copies DVDs as well as or better than all the products on our side-by-side comparison chart.
