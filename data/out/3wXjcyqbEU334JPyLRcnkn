For example, it has a reversible door – you can attach the door hinges to either side of the frame. As such, you can choose whether the door swings open to the left or the right based on where you plan to put your fridge.","This mini fridge has a 2.4-cubic-foot capacity, and you can adjust the wire shelves inside to four positions to accommodate different size foods. The door houses two shelves, one of which is large enough for a couple of 2-liter bottles. The door’s top shelf is a good size for condiment bottles and other small items.","The Midea WHS-87L1’s freezer compartment is separate from the fridge body and has a hinged plastic cover. Although it is quite small, especially compared to the full-width freezers on other models we reviewed, it can hold microwave meals and an ice cube tray. You control the fridge and freezer temperatures with a dial that sits inside the fridge in the top left corner.","The freezer doesn’t have an automatic defrost feature, so you need to empty the fridge, unplug it and open it up to defrost when it needs to be cleaned. This is a bit inconvenient but not as big of a deal for a mini fridge as a regular-size one. Also, the inside is easy to wipe clean. If you want a mini fridge with an automatic defrost, the <a href=\"/edgestar-review\">EdgeStar CRF321SS</a> might be a good choice.","You can buy the Midea WHS-87L1 in three finishes: white, stainless steel or black. Midea covers this model with a one-year warranty, which is standard for this type of appliance."]},"id":"d4342dbc-ce71-4ef5-a93d-526aacf8d2e0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62342","url":"/midea-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-01-27T22:11:23Z","datePublished":"2015-01-27T22:11:23Z","name":"Midea WHS-87LW1","synopsis":"The Midea WHS-87LW1 mini fridge is a good choice for a dorm room, office or other small room thanks to its space-saving design.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"Because of its size and reversible door, the Midea WHS-87LW1 is a good option for a small space such as a dorm room.","pros":["You can move this fridge&#8217;s two racks into four positions."],"cons":["It doesn&#8217;t have an auto-defrost feature."]},"strapline":"The Midea WHS-87LW1 mini fridge is a good choice for a dorm room, office or other small room thanks to its space-saving design.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-02T00:00:00Z","id":"3wXjcyqbEU334JPyLRcnkn","meta":{"title":"Midea HS-87L Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Because of its size and reversible door, the Midea WHS-87LW1 is a good option for a small space such as a dorm room."},"products":[{"slug":"midea-whs-87lw1","url":"/product/midea-whs-87lw1","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","name":"Midea WHS-87LW1","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","id":"TXLJZGau5XZBRBQySFpC5Q","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/3cXHA4jFB9YCdcCvsZLzHM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"20faaca8c16af176c3adb615ab2edd2f.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/20faaca8c16af176c3adb615ab2edd2f.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","id":"3cXHA4jFB9YCdcCvsZLzHM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3cXHA4jFB9YCdcCvsZLzHM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Midea HS-87L Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Because of its size and reversible door, the Midea WHS-87LW1 is a good option for a small space such as a dorm room."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/3cXHA4jFB9YCdcCvsZLzHM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"20faaca8c16af176c3adb615ab2edd2f.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/20faaca8c16af176c3adb615ab2edd2f.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","id":"3cXHA4jFB9YCdcCvsZLzHM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3cXHA4jFB9YCdcCvsZLzHM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Midea HS-87L Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Because of its size and reversible door, the Midea WHS-87LW1 is a good option for a small space such as a dorm room."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/midea-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"refrigerators","url":"/kitchen/refrigerators","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","name":"Refrigerators","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:06Z","id":"hGnCzHoUh2aAKgnXsQGcFg","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
