Both work, but depending on your needs, each has advantages over the other. Wireless boosters create an amplified signal within a wireless coverage area, so both you and your passengers can take advantage of its effects. Cradle boosters only provide amplified signal to the connected device but are much cheaper than wireless products.","<strong>Signal-Boosting Performance</strong><br/>Signal boosters for cars max out at a 50 dB gain, in accordance with restrictions laid out by the FCC to prevent over-amplified signals from interfering with cell towers. All but one of the wireless boosters we reviewed feature 50 dB amplifiers (and the one still comes close at 45 dB). Cradle boosters generally provide lower amplification that is still perfectly serviceable for the one connected device.","Another signal-boosting factor to consider is the range of frequency bands supported by the signal booster. The best ones cover five bands and support 4G.","<strong>Antenna Features</strong><br/>Cell phone boosters have both outside and inside antennas. The first sends and receives signal from the nearest cell tower and the second transmits the boosted signal to your phone. High-gain (5dBi or higher) antennas have a long range and are ideal for rural areas where distance is the main factor weakening your signal. Lower-gain antennas are better for mountainous terrain and places where there are physical barriers blocking signals.","<strong>Installation Features</strong><br/>Cable length is key when determining where to install each component of your signal booster. Wireless boosters have two antennas that connect to the signal amplifier with coaxial cables. Longer cables make installation easier in larger vehicles like RVs. Cradle cell phone boosters house the amplifier and inside antenna within the cradle, so the only thing to consider is the length of the coaxial cable for the outside antenna.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Most of the cell phone boosters we reviewed have a two-year warranty and helpful informational materials available online. The best products’ manufacturers offer phone, email and live chat communication for help registering your device with your cellular provider, technical difficulties or any questions or concerns.","<strong>Home Cell Phone Boosters</strong>","We focused on reviewing in-vehicle cell phone boosters, but a stationary cell phone booster is also a great investment if you lack bars in your home. Bad cellular signals aren&#39;t just a problem in rural areas that are far away from cell towers – signals are also interrupted by physical obstructions like trees, mountains and buildings. Home and vehicle signal boosters look similar. They both consist of an outdoor antenna that communicates with the cell tower and an indoor component that broadcasts the boosted signal and communicates with your devices.","However, there are a few fundamental differences between car and home cell phone boosters, most important of which is the booster’s range. Stationary cell phone boosters are allowed up to 70 dB gain, while mobile devices are limited to 50 dB. These rules are set by the FCC to ensure your booster doesn’t interfere with the network, and 50 dB is enough power to boost signal coverage for your vehicle without messing with signals for the cars around you. Some vehicle boosters pair with an AC adapter to provide extra power when stationary, which is ideal for RVs. Home cell phone boosters can extend the signal to cover much more square footage, which is necessary in a larger space like an apartment or house.","Another difference between the two types of boosters is the antenna. Most car outdoor antennas are magnetic and compact. Home booster antennas are meant to be installed more permanently and are therefore larger. Also, since the installation is permanent, you have to take much more care when placing your antenna to get the optimal signal. Generally, higher is better, with as few obstructions between the antenna and cell tower as possible."]},"id":"d3d62958-ebf0-4616-aa5d-8e42891b79fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"5cc798df-76e7-485a-8aac-7fdf3c89c661","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/weBoost-470108-Cellular-Amplifier-Enhances/dp/B00RHMFPEU?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">weBoost Drive 4G-M</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KBCNOSW/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">SureCall TriFlex2Go</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015NK6R1M/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">SmoothTalker Mobile X1</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RHMFPLI/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">weBoost Drive 3G-X</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KAHCDFI/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">SureCall Flex2Go</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RHMFQX0/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">weBoost Drive 3G-M</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RHMFPEK/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">weBoost Drive 3G-Flex</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RHMFPIG/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">weBoost Drive 3G-S</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2886d87e-eb02-4d18-8ed1-7e701f1d18d0","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_842","url":"/best-cell-phone-boosters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-06T15:04:37Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T18:57:57Z","name":"Best Cell Phone Boosters","synopsis":"If you drive a lot, a cell phone booster can save your battery and increase the call quality in areas with spotty service.
