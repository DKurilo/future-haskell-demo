The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-indoor-electric-grills\">Indoor Electric Grills</a> here.</em>","The Livart LV-982 is a fun, convenient open-faced grill that looks like a miniaturized beach grill, complete with a removable rack. This tabletop electric grill is a great choice for people who like to cook yakitori-style skewered foods at their dinner tables or who want their meat and veggies to have a fresh grilled flavor.","The grilling surface on the LV-982 is open, unlike the clamshell-style electric grills like the <a href=\"/hamilton-beach-review\">Hamilton Beach 25335</a>, giving you full access to your food. The tradeoff for having an open grill is that the cooking times for your meals are longer than with its clamshell counterparts because there isn&#39;t a heating element simultaneously cooking the top of your food. If you are looking for an electric grill to cook your food rapidly, this is not the grill for you. However, if you enjoy fresh grilled flavor and want to have control over your cooking, then the LV-982 orange electric barbecue grill is an excellent choice.","You can cook a wide variety of foods with this indoor electric grill, including steaks, chicken, shrimp, burgers and chopped vegetables. You can even cook fish fillets and use it as a hot plate for a pot. One helpful feature we found while conducting our tests was to flip the grill rack over when cooking full-size meats such as burgers, as the design of the rack drops it closer to the heating elements. Unfortunately, we found that while the LC-982 cooked very well when the food is close to the center where the heating element is, the outer edges suffered from inconsistent heat.","Unlike the other electric grills we reviewed, the heating elements on this appliance are exposed instead of being integrated into the heating surface. This unique design may seem like a safety hazard at first, but the juices and grease that drip from the food above evaporate on contact. Anything that does not come in contact with the elements is collected in the drip pan below. The manufacturer states you should add water to the drip pan to help ease cleaning and reduce splatter.","Another nice feature of this tabletop grill is you can place food in the pan below the heating element and use it to bake or broil. While it&#39;s not as powerful as a toaster oven, you can heat up food or melt cheese with ease using this method.","Cleaning this electric grill can be hard at times, mainly because the juices and fat do not collect around the food while cooking, resulting in baked-on food residue. This problem can be alleviated by soaking the grill rack and drip pan in hot water with dish detergent for about 10 minutes to help loosen stubborn food."]},"id":"4b3de858-201a-4b6a-ac45-80f3add7ef89","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dc00783a-7b1b-46f9-a6cb-2bb91ac454af","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Livart LV-982 is a fun little grill with a unique design, but it may seem limited when compared with the best indoor electric grills on our lineup.
