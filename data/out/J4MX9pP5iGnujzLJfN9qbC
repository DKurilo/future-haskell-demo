For this recent update, we looked at banks that lack physical branches and offer checking and savings accounts. More and more banks are developing sophisticated online platforms to manage your finances, so the main benefit of an online only bank is the high interest rates they offer, much higher than the average brick and mortar bank. Online only banks also tend to have fewer fees and lower minimums to start earning interest. The banks we looked at are FDIC insured, have two factor authentications and offer mobile banking apps. We also make sure none of the banks we review have had any recent legal action or data breaches.","<strong>How We Tested?<br/></strong>Interest rates are the most important and appealing aspects of online only banks, so we focused on them first. One of the main benefits of a checking account through an online bank is that even the basic account earns some interest. It’s small, ranging from 0.10% to 0.76%, but even at the low end it beats what you can get in a brick and mortar bank. For better interest rates, look at your bank’s rewards credit options. Some accounts provide more interest for higher balances, while others provide the same high interest rate regardless of the account’s balance. Some offer cash back rewards instead of earning interest. So no matter how you plan to use your checking account, there’s an option suited to you.","Savings accounts at online banks don’t have any monthly maintenance fees or require any minimum balances. Opening deposits aren’t more than $100. These savings accounts offer excellent interest rates that beat the best offered by physical banks. Money market accounts and CDs follow this trend as well, offering rates that outpace other banks. CD deposit minimums range from $1,000 to $2,500.","Many of the online banks we looked at are members of one or more ATM networks, so you’ll be able to use ATMs surcharge free. You can use tools provided on the bank’s website or app to find the nearest ATMs. If there isn’t one nearby, most offer some reimbursement of the fees. ","<strong>What Rates Do Online Only Banks Have?</strong>","Because they have fewer branches and less overhead, online only banks tend to offer higher interest rates than brick-and-mortar banks. This is especially true of basic savings and checking accounts. The average APY on a savings account is 0.08%, and many large banks only offer 0.01%. Checking accounts at traditional banks don’t fare much better, with average rates of 0.05%. The online banks we reviewed have savings account rates of up to 1.85% and checking accounts with interest rates up to 1.25%.","<strong>Benefits and Drawbacks of Online Only Banks<br/></strong>When deciding to join an online bank or stick with one that has physical branches, there are some things you’ll need to consider before making a choice.","Benefits<br/>Low rates: Because online only banks don’t have the overhead costs of brick and mortar branches, they can offer higher rates on checking, savings and CD accounts.","Low fees<br/>Many traditional banks charge fees on basic checking and savings accounts, either for inactivity or if you fail to maintain a certain balance. Many brick and mortar banks will offer enticing promotions to start an account, but if you look at the fine print you’ll find they charge multiple fees.","Similar services<br/>An online bank offers a lot of the same services you can find at traditional banks. Many of the banks we reviewed offer home and auto loans, as well as rewards credit cards.","Drawbacks<br/>Limited Customer Service: If you value a more personal touch, a traditional bank may be a better choice. Especially if you’re buying a home or getting a loan, working with a loan office at a local bank can make a complicated process easier. Not many online banks have 24/7 customer service, but they can always be reached by email.","ATM fees<br/>Most banks have their own ATM networks that are broad and help you avoid fees. Several online banks partner with ATM networks, but those tend to have fewer locations than the big banks. Many online banks do reimburse you for some of the fees.","Outages<br/>Websites do go down, either for maintenance or unexpected outages. Having a physical location where you can do your banking is one way to avoid any issues with an unreliable website. All the online banks we review are FDIC insured, so if any economic calamities happen your money will be safe.","<strong>What About Online Credit Unions?</strong>","Credit Unions can be attractive alternatives to banks. They tend to offer lower rates on loans, and their interest rates on checking and savings accounts are competitive with those offered by the best banks. Credit unions differ from banks in that they have membership requirements – most often you need to be an employee or member of a certain organization to join. Relatives of existing members can also join, and some credit unions allow you to donate to certain charities for membership.","Like online-only banks, there are online-only credit unions. They have the same benefits of an online-only bank, such as low rates and fees, as well as the advantages of a credit union, including ATM reimbursements and no monthly maintenance fees. Many online credit unions operate a few physical branches, but anyone can join online.","Here are a couple online credit unions worth considering:","<a href=\"https://www.alliantcreditunion.org/\">Alliant Credit Union</a> is one of the largest credit unions in the U.S. It has a few branches in Chicago but offers most of its services online. Alliant has a high-interest-earning savings account that earns 2% as long as you maintain at least a $100 balance. Also, its checking accounts can earn up to 0.65% when you sign up for eStatements and get direct deposits. To join Alliant, you need to be a member or employee of a partner organization or make a donation to Foster Care for Success.","<a href=\"https://www.dcu.org/index.html\">Digital Federal Credit Union</a> is another good option. You can earn  up to 6.17% on the first $1,000 in your savings account, with a $5 minimum balance. DCU also offers a free checking account and an interest-earning account. The interest-earning account has a rate of 0.05% and requires a minimum balance of $2,500.
