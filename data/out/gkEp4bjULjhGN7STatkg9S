You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Samsung has positioned itself as one of the premier LCD TV makers which is no wonder with models like the Samsung UN55B8000 which is a year old and still stands out. This offering from Samsung features a 55 inch screen perfect for watching movies at home. The screen is surrounded by a glossy black bezel which displays the Samsung logo below the screen. The screen itself is only 1.2 inches deep which allows this model to be mounted on your wall with ease when using Samsung’s wall mount. This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TV</a> only protrudes from the wall an amazing 2 inches. The slim screen is supported by a crystal-clear neck which fits nicely with any room’s décor."]},"id":"555efb33-ac31-4ebd-a41b-0af796725c4f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"4450c7fe-901d-43ec-b545-ea21a4fd6adb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung UN55B8000 comes with two remotes: one that controls all the functions of the television and another, smaller one that only controls basic functions such as power, next channel and volume. The TV menu is not accessible using this remote. It is also important to note that the B8000 is one of their most eco-friendly LED TVs. It consumes as much as 40 percent less power than traditional LCD TVs and is mercury free. Not a bad feat considering LCD TVs already consume less power than traditional TV sets and plasmas.","The Samsung UN55B8000 LED TV also features networking capabilities. Now you can download additional content from various providers. This LED TV provides more entertainment options than you have time. It also offers some of the most advanced features found on televisions today."]},"id":"c9aad441-d279-4151-9abf-867f3043a6fb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"0cbf35bc-3a54-4add-9573-c1a5683d376d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LED backlight technology featured on the B8000 series allows this LED TV to produce brightness levels that weren’t possible before. In addition, since it uses LED technology, the TV is able to dim certain portions of the screen allowing for greater contrast. While some LEDs burn as bright as possible, others could be turned down or even off to allow for better depth and detail in dark scenes. The contrast ratio of this TV however was a little below par for a high end television, at only 5,000,000:1 it could greatly use some improvement.","Since the Samsung UN55B8000 refreshes at a rate of 240 Hz, there is virtually no motion blur. This is especially noticeable while watching sporting events or any other program with fast moving objects. This makes everyday TV viewing more enjoyable as well. 4 HDMI inputs are enough for even the most serious videophile. Connect your HD cable or satellite box, your Xbox 360 or PS3, HD camcorder and any other number of devices that utilize the HDMI connection.","The brightness levels were very high while also being able to maintain deep, detailed blacks. The video performance was quite good but did have some fading when the TV is in well lit areas. Gone are the days of slow responding LCD TVs. Since this TV uses LED backlighting it is also more environmentally friendly. The aesthetics of the Samsung UN55B8000 also impressed the critics. The swiveling stand rotates 20 degrees which allows for better viewing angles when necessary."]},"id":"f8dcde60-0bed-404e-95c5-a5fe8e38ad10","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Smart Features"},"id":"de8246ce-c730-4b1f-8cf1-2ec7400f8a9c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You will be able to find a number of HDMI inputs, component inputs and a variety of other connections.
