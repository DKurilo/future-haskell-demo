This LED <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/buyers_guides/camping-lantern-buyers-guide\">camping light</a> is useful for camping, to take along in your vehicle for emergency repairs or at home when the electricity fails. In addition, since it has a sturdy handle, you can carry it with you to use as a flashlight.","This lantern includes a 6-volt sealed lead-acid battery that will not leak, a switch to turn it on and off, a foldable handle, and an AC adapter to recharge the battery. When you use this camping lantern at home, the light automatically comes on if your power goes out. While this lantern functions in areas with a wide range of temperatures, it may not work as well in areas with humidity above 90 percent.","If you keep the camping light unplugged, you need to recharge it every 90 days to ensure that it will work when you need it. In addition, if the light dims while the lantern is in use, you must change the battery so the one in the lantern does not sustain damage.","While it does not have adjustable settings, this outdoor camping lantern puts out 300 lumens that can light up an area about 25 feet away. The lantern will work for about seven hours before it requires recharging, and you can plug it into any 110-volt outlet. Recharging the battery takes around 20 hours. It measures 3.25 x 8 x 3 inches, which makes it convenient to store or carry along with you. The body is plastic, and this lantern is not appropriate for use in damp or rainy weather because it does not have waterproof features.","One spec that may be of consideration to those looking for a battery-powered camping lantern is the 2.4-pound weight of this lantern. The battery can add considerably to the weight because of its type. While that may not be an important factor when using it around the house, taking it camping might be cumbersome and add unwanted weight to your load.","The Gama Sonic DL-713LS Lantern provides you with seven hours of bright light and comes with a battery and AC adapter to recharge it. While the lack of waterproofing and weight may be a consideration for those looking for a lantern to use outdoors, this battery-powered lantern is also suited to home use."]},"id":"018bee4a-1bf5-4427-8374-2840418eb56b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65250","url":"/gama-sonic-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","datePublished":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","name":"Gama Sonic DL-713LS","synopsis":"The Gama Sonic DL-713LS is a small lantern that comes with 40 LEDs that shine light in one direction.
