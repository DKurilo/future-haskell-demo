You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Cambridge SoundWorks HT55 is a <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker</a> system that will get the job done, but it will leave most feeling that the sound is lacking a little. This is because the system doesn’t have a great frequency range or a dedicated central speaker. However, the sounds that are picked up and projected will sound great since Cambridge uses THX-certified technology during the manufacturing of this system.","This surround sound speaker set doesn’t come with a central speaker. You can easily use one of the five small speakers as a central speaker, and the subwoofer will make sure the right bass sounds are projected, but it’s not as impressive has having a dedicated central speaker. The sound will be good, just not as deep and full as sound from the other surround sound speakers we reviewed.","The subwoofer has a base reflex enclosure. This means it has an amplifier inside to further enhance the bass sounds. Unfortunately, the minimum frequency response isn’t quite low enough to capture the lowest bass sounds within the human hearing range; it’s only 39Hz. The maximum frequency is equal to the high sounds a healthy hearing person can hear. This means the HT55 will miss some of the deep, booming sound effects of the greatest Blockbuster films.","All five speakers that come with the HT55 are wall mountable, so you can position them anywhere in your room for optimal sound. They have a sleek design, so the entire system will easily compliment most home theater decor.","Unlike other home theater systems we looked at, the HT55 only has a one-year warranty. This home theater speaker system should last well beyond that, but it’s disappointing that Cambridge SoundWorks didn’t include an industry standard five-year warranty.","You do have some support options if you need assistance with your home theater speakers. Cambridge SoundWorks doesn’t provide telephone numbers on its website, so you will have to contact representatives via email. They eventually get the answers back to you, though don’t be surprised if it takes longer than a couple of days. You can connect with support staff and other HT55 owners on Facebook. The Cambridge SoundWorks website has a FAQs section and user guide you can download."]},"id":"77c23261-b70a-4d0e-b3ce-87bd721dbddd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3f3be5cd-5e95-4c6c-b8d7-2169d4e32291","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cambridge SoundWorks HT55 home theater speaker system has good sound quality.
