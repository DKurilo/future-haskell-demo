Charging in this way is faster than charging in the sun, taking the overall time from 12 hours to just 5.5.

This means some devices will take longer than others to charge. The Orange has enough power to fully charge an iPhone 6 in just over one hour and 48 minutes, an iPhone 6 Plus in just under three hours, and a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 in three hours and 13 minutes.","Curiously, the Orange comes with two cables: a black one for plugging in and charging your mobile devices and a white one for charging the battery pack and communication with your computer.
