Its unique motor design prolongs the lifespan of the fan, so that it will continue to deliver impactful performance all while reducing electrical consumption. It comes with a high level of airflow in addition to an incredible airflow efficiency rating, and a lengthy warranty on the motor ensures you receive many years of effective circulation.","This is a fairly expensive ceiling fan, around $560, though it&#39;s still more affordable than the <a href=\"/fanimation-review\">Fanimation Odyn</a>. The fan has two finish options: brushed steel and oil rubbed bronze, which allow you to get the one that better suits your tastes. The blades also have two color options, walnut or dark mahogany,","Energy efficiency is a key concern among most electrical devices, and this top ceiling fan meets the trend head-on with an incredible level of performance. At its highest speed, the 54-inch fan is capable of circulating 6,974 cubic feet of air per minute. The fan operates at 33 watts for an airflow efficiency of 210 cubic feet per minute per watt, an incredibly-high rating more than double the industry average. The end result is a quiet fan motor that costs less than a penny an hour to run.","In addition to a low overall cost to operate, this ceiling fan’s efficiency also impacts its lifespan. The unique engineering of its motor allows it to run cooler in comparison to other fan motors. By generating less heat, it increases the motor’s life to keep its five blades spinning for ongoing use. The motor is further protected by a limited lifetime warranty and a one-year warranty on parts and electronics.","Though this is one of the best ceiling fans with lights, you can remove the lighting kit and use an optional plate to cover it. If you leave the kit in place, the opal matte fixture comes with two mini-candelabra halogen bulbs rated at 50-watts for bright lighting. The lighting, in addition to the fan itself, can be controlled using a wall control that utilizes the fan’s six speeds and is compatible with a handheld remote that is sold separately."]},"id":"25d77794-0548-4fca-907d-f1345109f765","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66307","url":"/luxe-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:05:24Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:05:24Z","name":"Emerson Luxe Eco","synopsis":"The Emerson Luxe Eco is a unique and energy-efficient ceiling fan designed with longevity in mind.
