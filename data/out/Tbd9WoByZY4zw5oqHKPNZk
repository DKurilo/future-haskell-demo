Chief among them is something unique to the platform: the throw ratio, or the distance the projector is from the screen versus the size of the projected image. If you’re working in a small or unevenly lit viewing environment, the Optoma ML750ST’s short throw is ideal.","The Optoma’s specifications make it an excellent choice for both home and business users. The projector touts a native resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, and it can upscale video content to 1080i. Its excellent benchmark performance was confirmed in our hands-on testing. We used the ML750ST to view a variety of high-definition videos in dark and light environments, and those with ambient light and image quality fared quite well in both settings. Fine on-screen details were rendered in clear focus, and even on high brightness settings, color levels remained consistent and didn’t appear washed out.","The ML750ST’s short throw ratio of 0.8:1 also contributes to its pristine image quality. Short-throw projectors like the Optoma don’t need to be as far away from the display surface as typical projectors – you’ll only need to place the projector 4 feet away from a surface in order to produce a 6-foot image.","This projector has the standard connectivity options, and it even boasts an integrated document reader, which is useful in office settings. You can display common file formats, such as PDFs and DOCs, from a USB drive, so you aren’t obligated to connect to a laptop.","The Optoma houses its ports on its backside, and the selection includes HDMI, USB, 3.55mm audio output and a microSD slot. As with most business-centric mini projectors, the Optoma doesn’t support Bluetooth devices or out-of-the-box wireless mirroring, which is an inconvenience for home users. For that functionality, you have to purchase the optional USB dongle from Optoma.","The projector’s exceptional hardware suits its outward design. It measures 4.1 x 4.2 x 1.5 inches and weighs 0.8 pounds. Its vented black siding complements the durable white plastic on the top, and an adjustable leg on the bottom lets you adjust the projection angle for large screens.","During long test sessions using the power adapter, we never had problems with the projector’s fan. Even at peak usage, the fan maintained steady performance at a low whirr. Especially when you use it for movie watching, its ability to stay quiet is a plus. The included carrying case provides ample protection when you’re on the go, and it even has a tethered rubber bulb cover. It’s a nice added touch that further protects the projector from fingerprints, scratches and damage.","In general, these small projectors have middling sound quality, and you’re often better off connecting to an external audio source. But if you’re using the projector inside or with a quiet group, you’ll find the audio to be more than sufficient. The audio from this Optoma does sound clear. However, serious audiophiles will find that bass and low-end definition are somewhat lacking, for whom we recommend the <a href=\"/epson-ex3260-review\">Epson EX3260</a>. Still, the speaker can project loud enough for videos and presentations. As with most high-end mini projectors, the Optoma doesn’t have an internal battery, so you have to keep it within reach of a wall power outlet.","Optoma offers a one-year warranty on the ML750ST. You can also get troubleshooting assistance from the company via live chat, email and phone agents. There is also a large and helpful online support section."]},"id":"484158d1-413e-4f6a-adeb-de1d63f5ce5e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68481","url":"/optoma-ml750st-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-29T22:47:47Z","datePublished":"2016-09-29T22:47:47Z","name":"Optoma ML750ST","synopsis":"As you make the leap from a traditional TV to a mini projector, there are a few things to consider.
