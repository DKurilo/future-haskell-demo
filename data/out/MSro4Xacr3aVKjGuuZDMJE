Both Blu-ray disc players have the same façade –  a clean-lined, modern exterior – but there are a few differences in functionality. With the BD-C7900 you receive upgraded software that fixes bugs encountered in the BD-C6900. Surprisingly, the Samsung BD-C6900, which is less expensive, has a 7.1CH analog output capable of surround sound, much better than the Samsung BD-C7900’s measly 2CH analog output.","The technology in a 3D Blu-ray player is complex and confusing, but luckily for us the essential features are easy to enumerate. If a Blu-ray disc player doesn’t have 24p true cinema, deep color, HD upscaling and full HD 1080p on its specifications sheet, don’t bother with it. The Samsung BD-C6900 needn’t be overlooked because it has all of these characteristics. It even goes above and beyond the norm by playing rewritten formatted discs like BD-R/RE and DVD+/-R/RW.","The Samsung BD-C6900 is capable of surround sound with 7.1CH analog output. It is also equipped with the two best audio features a 3D Blu-ray player could have: Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD. Combined, these two features have the ability to turn your ordinary speakers into recording studio-worthy speakers.","Connecting external devices like speakers, iPods and cameras is available through any of these I/O ports:"]},"id":"89d18b7b-a62a-477a-bb3a-a8c07faff21f","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["One HDMI Output","One Analog Audio Output","One USB Port"],"type":"ul"},"id":"abbf0a0f-4851-44e5-a342-ba94d8d30d95","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["1GB of built-in memory is also accessible through this Blu-ray disc player for any other external content you may want to save."]},"id":"77ef24d2-630d-4d67-9e5f-02915246ead6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"df7a72ac-3715-4a2a-98fa-c3cf68301c79","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung BD-C6900 may be at the bottom of our list, but that’s because it has some pretty awesome players competing with it.
