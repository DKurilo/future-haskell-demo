You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Walkera Genius CP RC Helicopter is a small six-channel firecracker. Its amazing flying capabilities ensure that everyone will be nose-up watching this helicopter fly. This remote control helicopter is particularly good at acrobatics and tricks of all sorts. While the Walkera Genius <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">RC helicopter</a> lacks a gyro stabilizer, it makes up for it with its barrel rolls, figure eights and other outrageous maneuvering capabilities. It&#39;s built with a sturdy, hard-polymer plastic frame. Its basic and traditional design is perfect for those who are looking for a standard remote controlled helicopter. However, it is missing some of the competition&#39;s advanced features, such as cameras and crash-alerts sensors.","This impressive helicopter is perfect for both outdoor and indoor flying. With its state-of-the-art motor and six-axis directional capabilities, it flies with precision but doesn&#39;t focus on stability. It has the agility to do almost any trick in the sky, and because it&#39;s so fast, it will make you look like a professional flyer, even if it&#39;s one of your first remote control helicopters.","The 3.7-volt lithium polymer battery takes about 30 minutes to charge and will allow for about five to ten minutes of flight time. This is relatively standard for similar mini RC helicopters.","The remote control helicopter is missing some advanced features that other RC helicopters offer, such as a high-definition camera. Another missing feature is an ultrasound alert, which would sound an alarm before an imminent crash.","The helicopter&#39;s construction is very solid. There are no loose parts, and the hard plastic can handle repeated collisions without facing any problems. The strong construction is necessary because it will take you some time flying this remote control helicopter before you are able to master all the controls and learn to perform all the aeronautic acrobatics it&#39;s capable of. Plan to face a crash or two before you&#39;ll be able to fly it comfortably.","With the exception of a few replacement parts or a few scratches, this Genius CP helicopter can only be described as long lasting and high performing. Some highlights of this small yet powerful remote controlled helicopter are the flight controls. You&#39;ll have absolute control and be able to perform every trick in the book. However, it may take some getting used to before you&#39;ll have complete command of this radio controlled helicopter.","The Walkera Genius remote control helicopter is not designed for extremely balanced or extremely fast flight. Instead, it is a good fit for those who are looking for a basic model that can perform excellent tricks and stunts. Although there is a learning curve, even children can master the controls."]},"id":"b8614082-0a20-4cf3-a4d9-33c15651f01e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"990473b7-a1f0-41ce-afd8-bdf5d4f8dc59","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Walkera Genius CP RC Helicopter is a high quality remote control helicopter.
