The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-cordless-drills\">Cordless Drills</a> here.</em>","The Skil 2898LI-02 is not be the best cordless drill we reviewed, but it is still nicely versatile, offering 20 clutch settings and acting as both a power drill and screwdriver. However, it lacks some features that would make the job go smoother. For instance, it only offers one battery, which takes an hour to charge, and lacks a work light.","The speed of a drill directly correlates to its ability to drill holes, so the 2898LI-02&#39;s maximum speed at 1,400 RPMs falls below average and won&#39;t punch holes with the ease of other power drills. The drill produces 400 inch-pounds of force, which isn&#39;t too impressive either, but it is far from the worst. High torque, or turning force, makes it easier to use the drill as a screwdriver, so the 2898LI-02 can sink screws, but it has some trouble with larger screws or harder material. This cordless drill also has 20 clutch settings that you can adjust to apply a specific amount of force, which helps you avoid damaging the material or the screw.","This cordless drill sports an ergonomic design, which means it is lightweight and balanced. The little weight that is present is balanced both above and below the grip, which gives you a high level of control. The tool also uses a keyless chuck, which means you can fasten drill bits to the tool by hand. This particular feature is incredibly convenient, as you don&#39;t have to worry about misplacing a chuck key. Unfortunately, the 2898LI-02 does not have an LED work light, which means you&#39;ll need to carry a spare flashlight when working in low-light settings.","The Skil 2898LI-02 lets you switch between 18-volt lithium-ion and nickel-cadmium batteries. The lithium-ion battery, like all others, is lightweight and holds a charge for long periods of time without losing its juice. The drill incorporates a battery meter so you can check the charge level periodically. Unfortunately, the drill only comes with one battery, meaning that as soon as it is dead, you have to wait for it to charge. It takes a full hour to charge completely, meaning any project you are working on has to wait an hour before you can start up again.","If you have any questions about this drill, you can contact the company via email or phone. The company also includes a FAQs section and user manuals on its website. Unfortunately, Skil offers a short warranty period for the drill and battery – only one year. This warranty is one of the shortest we have seen out of all the cordless drills we reviewed. However, the warranty does protect you against manufacturer defects."]},"id":"0621dad8-d71e-4502-a9cf-aedbd129f97c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"84b99cd6-82d4-4068-ab21-c1564ebed762","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Skil 2898LI-02 is not the best cordless drill we have reviewed, but it still offers the power to get many tasks done.

Unfortunately, the drill comes with only one battery, which takes a full hour to charge, meaning that as soon as the battery dies, you&#39;ll have to pause your project.
