many telecommunications companies, Cox Communication&#39;s roots go deep, back to 1964 when the Cox Broadcasting Corporation (later renamed) was formedÂ officially. It has now grown to serve over 6 million customers and employ over 22,000 employees. Cox is active in providing <a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">internet service</a> to underprivileged children, first through its Cable in the Classroom program and now with its participation in EveryoneOn.org. This ISP offers a wide variety of high-speed internet options ranging from 5 Mbps to 150 Mbps to select areas of the United States, including large cities like San Diego, Cleveland, New Orleans, Las Vegas and Phoenix.","This ISP provides cable internet with plans offering download speeds ranging from 5 Mbps to 150 Mbps. The moderate price range has download speeds of up to 25 Mbps and upload speeds of up to 5 Mbps. The upload speeds offered by Cox range between an impressive 20 Mbps and a less impressive 1 Mbps. In third-party speed tests, Cox performs in the top third of the major ISPs, and in some areas Cox provides speeds that easily test at over 50 Mbps. In many areas this company serves, test results show Cox to be the fastest internet provider available. So unlike a few other ISPs, Cox seems to be able to deliver what it advertises.","Cox Communications provides internet, phone and TV services in select areas of 19 states, including California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Virginia. Since the company only offers services in targeted areas, it was only able to provide services to one of our eight random test addresses, but overall Cox provides cable internet to just short of 4 million customers.","With your internet plan, you also receive 10 email addresses with 2GB of space, the Cox Security Suite powered by McAfee, anti-spam software and cloud storage. With the Ultimate plan, you receive 10GB of email space rather than 2. All plans come with the Cox Security Suite Plus that can protect up to five PCs and the McAfee Family Protection program for three computers. This added software includes a personal firewall, parental controls, the McAfee site adviser and up-to-date virus protection. Cox Communications also offers other types of services including cable TV, phone and business services.","You can contact Cox Communications by phone, email or chat. The company provides round-the-clock toll-free technical support in some areas, but in most locations, it offers only regular business hours. You can also visit Cox service centers to test products, pick up, drop off hardware or make payments. The website contains helpful information such as FAQs and tutorials. Generally, we noticed fewer customer complaints about Cox technical support than other ISPs; however, we had to wait over 13 minutes for chat support to respond in the middle of the workday, which was frustrating."]},"id":"2bb4e7c3-0cca-4a8b-a01a-367f241c5056","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a6a01197-f484-4052-afc2-ecb687d02d6b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When looking for the best ISPs, we looked for companies that can provide consistently fast connection speeds balanced with responsive customer support. Cox Communications surpassed most of the competition in both areas. Cox continues to deliver fast internet speeds and manages to maintain a better service reputation than most internet companies do.

Cox does not provide services to as many areas as some other ISPs, but if it provides fast internet options in your area, it is well worth contacting for services."]},"id":"498200b8-dddf-4fee-8d91-08e25c8eb920","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1409","url":"/cox-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-20T14:38:33Z","name":"Cox","synopsis":"Like many telecommunications companies, Cox Communication's roots go deep, back to 1964 when the Cox Broadcasting Corporation (later renamed) was formedÂ officially.","review":{"rating":89,"verdict":"If Cox high-speed internet services are available in your area, we highly recommend it for its fast speeds and above-average customer service reputation.","pros":["Cox Communications has proven to provide fast internet speeds that match or exceed their advertised rates."],"cons":["Cox is not available in all areas and do not provide dial-up or DSL services to rural residents."]},"strapline":"Like many telecommunications companies, Cox Communication's roots go deep, back to 1964 when the Cox Broadcasting Corporation (later renamed) was formedÂ officially.","language":"en","dateModified":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"GEotLydiX8vi3ZmQ4mpuVJ","meta":{"title":"Cox Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you are looking for a variety of high-speed internet options, read our review to learn more about Cox Communications."},"products":[{"slug":"cox","url":"/product/cox","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","name":"Cox","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","id":"LH8HF7DZ89wvaBBpDfammW","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/jEwZ5zakNUXxkEzyC7Go2W.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"ab22ed4b06faa49b60305c686e32f1a3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/ab22ed4b06faa49b60305c686e32f1a3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","id":"jEwZ5zakNUXxkEzyC7Go2W","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jEwZ5zakNUXxkEzyC7Go2W.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cox Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you are looking for a variety of high-speed internet options, read our review to learn more about Cox Communications."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/jEwZ5zakNUXxkEzyC7Go2W.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"ab22ed4b06faa49b60305c686e32f1a3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/ab22ed4b06faa49b60305c686e32f1a3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","id":"jEwZ5zakNUXxkEzyC7Go2W","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jEwZ5zakNUXxkEzyC7Go2W.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cox Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you are looking for a variety of high-speed internet options, read our review to learn more about Cox Communications."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/cox-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"internet","url":"/electronics/internet","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","name":"Internet","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:58:06Z","id":"LCUKUvCZbgdUfBxKowMKeK","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
