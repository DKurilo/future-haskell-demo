It stores just over 13 ounces of food or liquid and keeps it hot for up to five hours.","During our heat test, the contents of the MIRA cooled down by 40 degrees. This is a heat loss of around 16 percent. And when we looked at how cold water stayed after 24 hours, the length of time MIRA claims to keep liquid cool, it warmed up only 20 degrees.","We found it a little tricky to line up the lid threads that are located on the inside of the thermos mouth and twist the top on straight. But once secured the cap didn’t leak no matter how much we tipped, shook, jostled and bounced this thermos around. The mouth is wide enough to fit over your nose if you are drinking from this thermos, but not wide enough to prevent most spills while ladling foods into it. The <a href=\"/zojirushi-review\">Zojirushi</a> is a good alternative with a wider mouth, and it’s easier to open and close. However, the Zojirushi is also double the size of the MIRA and may be too big for a child’s school lunch.","The MIRA food thermos is BPA free and didn’t leave any off taste in the chowder, soups and pasta we used during testing. The foods also didn’t leave any odor in the thermos when we were done. This thermos isn’t dishwasher safe, so we had to handwash it after each use. Also, because the lid threads are on the inside, it provided a place for some food to get caught, making it a bit harder to get clean."]},"id":"f731988b-3881-47bd-a39e-6dee3c8a2a1e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aa708bb9-69e7-4510-8ebb-17b4569e9347","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MIRA Lunch Food Jar has a smooth coating outside that helps you grip this thermos and keeps the outside walls from becoming too hot or cold from the food inside.
