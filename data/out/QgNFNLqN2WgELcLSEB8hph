After scrolling through half a page of hertz and watts, you still don&#39;t know if the subwoofer will sound good.","Before you decide by casting lots or playing Eeny-Meeny-Miny-Moe, let us translate these numbers for you. Frequency and power figures may be Greek to you now, but after this article, you&#39;ll be able to comfortably explore the numbers and find a powered subwoofer for your home audio system.","Beginning with frequencies, every sound travels as a wave. We measure sound frequencies in hertz (Hz), which is the number of wave cycles per second. Low sounds have longer wavelengths with low frequencies, while high sounds have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies. The average human can hear sounds between 20Hz and 16,000Hz. At the low end, sound waves from bass guitars and explosions usually travel at around 30Hz, while Eddie Van Halen&#39;s guitar solos might be in the 4,000Hz range.","Your home audio subwoofer should readily handle 40Hz, a low frequency that some cabinet speakers have trouble reproducing. However, the best home subwoofers will easily handle sounds as low as 16Hz. Unfortunately, these are usually used in commercial settings, so you&#39;re not likely to find an affordable home subwoofer capable of producing sounds this low.","Instead, you want to judge your subwoofer&#39;s low frequency performance according to your needs. A thumping Victor Wooten bass track will stay in the mid-80Hz range, but explosive action in movies will push any subwoofer&#39;s capabilities by dipping into the 20Hz range.","Looking at that, you might start thinking that the lower the frequency response, the better the sub. Just because a sub gets down to 24Hz doesn&#39;t mean that it will make an 80Hz track sound crisp and clean. Instead, if you want a subwoofer that can handle both movies and music, you want to look at the crossover frequency.","In most Dolby Digital setups, your audio/video receiver will manage the crossover frequency, which is the cutoff frequency level below which all frequencies are sent to the subwoofer instead of the other speakers. With Pro-Logic receivers, however, you&#39;ll have to set up the crossover frequency manually. Here, you want to find the sweet spot for what you&#39;re listening to. If you&#39;re playing Pink Floyd, you&#39;ll want to give the bass track plenty of travel room and set a higher crossover frequency. During a film, you want to keep the dialogue and most of the music in your regular speakers and turn the crossover frequency below 90Hz. Then, when a car explodes, the room will rumble and the deep sound will become a physical experience.","Now that you understand frequencies, it&#39;s time to look at the more confusing specification of every subwoofer: the power. Many manufacturers love to brag about the dynamic peak power of their subwoofers, touting numbers as high as 1,000 watts (W). Without fail, that number is always a misleading statistic. The real number to pay attention to is the Root Mean Square (RMS) continuous power, or the number of watts an amplifier can continuously deliver.","So why do manufacturers advertise the dynamic peak power? Because you need to know how much power your subwoofer&#39;s amplifier can handle without damaging the unit. Sometimes, you might crank the volume dial or play with the subwoofer to hear what the fully maxed settings sound like. While it will be a cacophonous mess, your subwoofer will be able to handle the noise through its powerful amplifier.","The more important number for choosing a subwoofer is the RMS continuous power. Subwoofers that can readily handle more than 200W of power will be able to run at your desired level for long periods of time without being damaged. This means that you can throw a dub-step party or have a &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; Extended Cut marathon without worrying about blowing your home subwoofer&#39;s amplifier.","When you look for your next home subwoofer, take a moment to refresh your understanding of what the numbers that companies show you mean, and then use those numbers to help you make a decision based on your entertainment needs.","Â "]},"id":"6deda97e-2570-4812-a43e-e526d216500e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7568","url":"/home-subwoofers-behind-the-hertz-and-watts","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ben-davis","url":"/author/ben-davis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ben Davis","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"L52JmDizAnNgRQPUr9kch6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-09-18T18:28:35Z","datePublished":"2012-09-18T18:28:35Z","name":"Home Subwoofers: Behind the Hertz and Watts","synopsis":"As you look for a new home subwoofer, you'll notice manufactures talking about their peak dynamic and RMS power, or their frequency response and crossover frequency.","review":{},"strapline":"As you look for a new home subwoofer, you'll notice manufactures talking about their peak dynamic and RMS power, or their frequency response and crossover frequency.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-11T16:26:12Z","id":"QgNFNLqN2WgELcLSEB8hph","meta":{"title":"Home Subwoofers: Behind the Hertz and Watts","description":"Home subwoofers deliver impressive specs, but unless you understand the numbers, you&#039;re taking a chance.
