Your Social Security number (SSN) is the most important, and most valuable, form of identification you have from the government. A thief can use it to do anything you could do with it   including purchasing property or opening new financial accounts. Your SSN could be sold to foreign people staying in the U.S. illegally or even used by criminals to commit crimes under your alias. Unlike with a lost or stolen credit card or debit card, you cannot close your  account  when your Social Security card goes missing, so you need to take this series of steps as soon as you can.","<strong>Steps to Take When Your Social Security Card is Stolen or Lost</strong>","Even if you only lost your card and do not suspect foul play, you need to search thoroughly in every possible location.
