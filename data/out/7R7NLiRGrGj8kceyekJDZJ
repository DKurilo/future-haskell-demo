Similar to the <a href=\"/deltran-battery-tender-review\">Deltran Battery Tender</a> and the <a href=\"/black-and-decker-review\">Black &amp; Decker BC15BD</a>, it can charge and maintain 12-volt and 6-volt lead-acid batteries. However, this is the only <a href=\"/best-car-battery-chargers\">battery charger</a> we reviewed that can also charge 6-volt batteries and lithium-ion batteries. It is also the most compact battery charger we researched. The G3500’s smart design and safety features make it the best battery charger you can buy.","Not only can the G3500 charge and maintain a wide variety of batteries, but it can also repair old 12-volt batteries. The 12-volt repair mode is a progressive battery recovery method that restores lost capacity in heavily sulfated batteries. Most chargers cannot save a battery once it drops below 3-volts, but the G3500’s repair mode recovers charges as low as 2-volts.","Safety features are important for battery chargers because they are left unattended for hours at a time. The G3500 monitors battery activity and only charges when needed, to avoid overcharging. It also has technology that keeps the alligator clips from sparking when they come in to contact with each other. In addition, it has reverse polarity protection, so you don’t have to worry about damaging your battery if you accidentally connect the clips to the wrong posts.","This NOCO model only has one button to figure out. You use the Mode button to select the type and size of battery you’re charging. The G3500 alerts you to the charging progress with four LEDs on the top of the front panel. There is also a standby LED that lets you know when the charger has completed its duty and gone into sleep mode.","If the G3500 accidentally gets unplugged or the socket it is plugged into loses power, it will remember the last charge mode it was operating in. This memory capability along with the zero-overcharging feature means you can safely leave this charger connected to your battery for long periods of time.","The G3500’s compact and rugged design is waterproof, shockproof, dirtproof and dustproof, but if it does stop working, NOCO covers it under a five-year warranty. You can contact the manufacturer by phone, email or live chat if you have questions. NOCO is the only manufacturer we researched that offers chat support, which is the fastest way to get answers to most questions."]},"id":"23855a63-7940-4fd7-8f5e-eb7977fc44d6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69546","url":"/noco-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-26T13:37:53Z","datePublished":"2017-07-26T13:37:53Z","name":"NOCO Genius G3500","synopsis":"If you need to maintain a variety of batteries in a range of sizes, the NOCO Genius G3500 has you covered.","review":{"rating":35,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you need to maintain a variety of batteries in a range of sizes, the NOCO Genius G3500 has you covered.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","id":"7R7NLiRGrGj8kceyekJDZJ","meta":{"title":"NOCO Genius G3500 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The NOCO Genius G3500 can safely charge 6-volt and 12-volt batteries of all sizes.
