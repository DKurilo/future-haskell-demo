The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-audio-editing-software\">Audio Editing Software</a> here.</em>","Mightsoft’s Audio Editor Pro is basic audio editing software that offers some good tools for manipulating your music files. It is designed to convert audio files to other formats and can instantly record streaming audio to produce a smooth, flawless sound file.","Although it cannot boast the extensive collection of audio effects that the top products in this category have, Audio Editor Pro has a pretty good list. It includes cross-fading, flange, echo delay, stretch, chorus, vibrato and other tools to help you make musical masterpieces.","Some of the features we prefer to see are noticeably missing from this software, though. Unlike our top-rated products, Audio Editor Pro doesn&#39;t support MIDI Files. The quality of the audio recordings is not that exceptional, and we are disappointed that there is no ability to preview changes before applying them to the audio file.","Also, you cannot burn CDs with this product, although you can record and insert audio files pretty easily. You can record music with the application using a line in, streaming audio, your computer&#39;s sound card, video files and by importing CDs.","This audio editor is easy to use. It has a mouse-scroll zoom, right-click edits and Windows keyboard commands. Audio Editor Pro is compatible with a wide range of audio formats, including MPEG (MP3, MP2), PCM, WAV, RAW, Windows Media Audio (WMA), Ogg Vorbis, Audio Tracks and Dialogic VOX.","Since it can easily work with WAV and MP3 formats, it may be a good companion to your iPod, iPhone or iPad. Additionally, with this audio editing software, you can convert WMA files to WAV or MP3, which is a handy feature. This is not the best choice for those who are interested in restoring audio tracks because it does not include functions like pop/click removal, smoother, FFT or noise-reduction filters.","This audio editor has an intuitive design and navigation. A menu lines the top of the screen that offers a variety of tools and functions. Making changes and utilizing the features and effects is easy; however, you must open files in this audio editing software application through the menu bar. We tried dragging and dropping files into the application, but were unsuccessful. Audio Editor Pro does provide a fast and simple method for converting files to other formats, which is a great benefit.","This product does not provide an online user forum, product manual or video tutorials for beginners. Through the support tab on the left-hand side of the screen, you can access an online support-request form and Mightsoft&#39;s contact email addresses.<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"ca8a8452-d95c-419d-af5a-d8505e17a422","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f4c98659-c304-4809-81a0-a22216087c13","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Audio Editor Pro doesn’t provide the number of features that top audio editing software provides; however, it has a number of effects that make it a good choice for some people.
