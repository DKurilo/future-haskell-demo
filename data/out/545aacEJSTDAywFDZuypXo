LED bulbs are energy efficient and eco-friendly, and this GE bulb is no exception. This bulb uses 11 watts of power, and costs an average of $1.32 per year to use. This is an exceptional price difference when compared with the cost of incandescent light bulbs.","This LED light contains no mercury or other harmful materials, making it safe to use around your home and easy to recycle. It provides a constant soft white light that is suitable for most table and floor lamps and in bedrooms. Soft light can often give off a yellowish hue, and the GE 89888 does as well. Soft light such as the light this bulb gives off is optimal for rooms where you don&#39;t need to see stark details, such as workshops, craft rooms or in the kitchen.","GE is well known for making quality lighting products and while this LED is much better than an incandescent light bulb, it is not as good as our best LED lights, mainly because of its short lifespan. The best LED light bulbs last up to 22.8 years, with an average use of three hours a day, seven days a week. The GE Lighting is designed to only last up to 13 years. This is disappointing as LED bulbs can save you a lot of money and power over their lifetime.","Fortunately, GE provides a five-year warranty if the bulb proves defective. This LED bulb is designed for indoor use only, and is not suitable for your porch lamp or in any other environment where it can be exposed to the elements. The GE LED fits into standard light bulb fixtures and you can use it with dimmer switches as well. One of the best features of this light bulb is that it comes on immediately, unlike CFL bulbs that take a while to warm up to get to their full brightness."]},"id":"e3197f59-6143-4098-be4e-3f7affe96c36","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d1b659f2-d057-4981-b523-35fc5d0294ac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the GE Lighting 89888 light bulb offers quality soft light, it does consume more power and lasts fewer years than our best LED light bulbs.
