You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Skull Shaver Essential is an <a href=\"/best-electric-head-shavers\">electric shaver</a> that is designed to shave hair on both your head and your face. This electric device features five shaving heads that spin in a circular motion to give you a close, smooth shave. During our testing, this electric shaver performed well and provided impressive results. Additionally, it is cordless and can run up to 70 minutes on a single battery charge. It also provides easy maintenance and is covered under a one-year manufacturer warranty.","The shaving technology and design of the Skull Shaver Essential set it apart from similar electric head shavers. This device features five rotary cutters that move in a circular motion, which allows you to get a close cut. The design of the shaver is unique, with the blades attached to the side of the rectangular handle instead of on top.","With this device, you don’t have to use shaving gel or other product as you shave. You can use it for a wet or a dry shave, which is excellent. Many similar products are only designed for dry shaves.","When we put this electric head shaver to the test, it only took six to seven passes to shave an area of the head. It provided a close, smooth shave and our testers found it extremely easy to use for shaving all areas of the head.","This electric head razor uses Li-ion batteries as its power source. The device will run approximately 70 minutes on a single battery charge. This is one of the longest run times we saw on a head shaver. However, it does take up to five hours to fully recharge the electric razor. This is a much longer than average. Many products can fully recharge in an hour or less.","Cleaning and maintenance for this Skull Shaver product is simple. You can rinse it off under tap water. You do not need to worry about cleaning oils and brushes with this product. However, it has no pop-up, built-in trimmer as you can find in similar devices. A trimmer would allow you to get a more definite line and shape to your necklines and sideburns.","This shaver is covered under a one-year manufacturer warranty. This is one of the shortest warranties we saw offered on an electric razor."]},"id":"75be9712-031f-4f7a-af42-e24f5fc90949","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5a44626a-b34a-4ca3-8214-eb36e90e59c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Skull Shaver Essential has a long battery life, five rotary cutters and an ergonomic handle.
