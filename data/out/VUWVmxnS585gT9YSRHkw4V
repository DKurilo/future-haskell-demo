You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool WCG75US0DS is a 30-inch <a href=\"/best-gas-cooktops\">gas cooktop</a> with continuous cast iron grates. As such, you can slide hot, heavy pans from one place to another, rather lift them and risk spilling or getting burned. The cooktop has only four burners, but they have a good selection of heat outputs.","Its low-simmering, 5,000 Btu burner is useful for melting delicate foods like butter and chocolate as well as for making sauces that can’t withstand high heat. The primary burner reaches 18,000 Btu, which is hot enough to quickly bring water to a rolling boil. There’s also a 12,000 Btu burner and a 9,100 Btu burner, which round out the heat selection nicely – you can cook a wide variety of foods on this gas cooktop.","The burners are sealed and the cooktop’s edges curve up to keep spills on the surface where they’re easy to wipe up. Over its cooktop surface, this Whirlpool model has unique grates that hinge on the back. As such, you can lift them upright and out of the way when you wipe up spills. You can also remove the grates and run them through the dishwasher. The grates are slightly more raised than those on many of the other cooktops we reviewed, which mean your pots are slightly farther from the heat source.","The control panel sits front and center on the cooktop surface, so it’s out of reach of children. The knobs are dishwasher safe, but because they are not made of metal, they feel lightweight. Since it’s a basic, budget model, the WCG75US0DS is missing some of the features the best gas cooktops include such as automatic reignition and a hot surface indicator light.","Whirlpool includes a free LP conversion kit – something a few manufacturers make you pay extra for. The manufacturer covers the WCG75US0DS with an industry-standard, one-year warranty. If you prefer a cooktop with a longer warranty, consider the <a href=\"/kitchenaid-review\">KitchenAid KCGS556ESS Pro</a> – some of its parts are covered for five years, and the entire cooktop is covered for one year."]},"id":"2cb20504-9fdb-4106-b66d-45764a265dc3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57802","url":"/whirlpool-gas-cooktop-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-16T13:19:11Z","datePublished":"2013-10-16T13:19:11Z","name":"Whirlpool WCG75US0DS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":79,"verdict":"The Whirlpool WCG75US0DS is a budget gas cooktop.
