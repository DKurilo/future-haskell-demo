While it doesn’t reveal what a speaker will actually sound like, it is a good indicator of the depths of bass and the heights of treble sound that can be expected. That’s why we were a bit disappointed to note the range for the CS 226 was 46Hz to 25kHz.","Descending only to 46Hz removes the possibility of accurately reproducing the lowest notes that are played by some musical instruments. While we don’t expect a main speaker, especially an economically priced one, to extend to the 20Hz lower limit of human hearing, we would like it to be able to produce the low E of a bass guitar. Recognizing this limitation, the manufacturer recommends the addition of a powered subwoofer. We agree with the suggestion.","On the other end of the spectrum, the speaker excels. The typical human ear can hear frequencies up to 20kHz. Reaching up to 25kHz allows the CS 226 to reproduce not only audible tones but those higher overtones that we can perceive giving music its sense of reality."]},"id":"5df7a303-b990-4796-8a54-528bc3d6e638","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Peformance"},"id":"cb7f1a79-c6ad-426e-889b-9714ce8976df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["These are rather efficient speakers with a sensitivity rating of 89dB. That doesn’t compare favorably to floor standing speakers that we’ve ranked higher in this survey. That is not to say, however, that there aren’t some sonic benefits to the specification. Many of today’s speaker systems are more spectacular in their individual characteristics, almost as though they’re trying too hard to impress and awe the listener. The Boston Acoustics CS 226 offers a rather more subdued effect that can be appealing. It seems to offer a sense of purity and musicality that is often lacking.","The manufacturer recommends amplifier power from 15-250 watts. Though it certainly performs better when powered by high quality electronics, it doesn’t seem to reveal component shortfalls as readily as we saw with the hypercritical JBL ES80."]},"id":"7f0895b7-6d4a-4083-80ec-addde32d8106","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Speaker Design"},"id":"0921fb62-cadb-416e-a690-9b2d1adb13b3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Only two different drivers are included in the BA CS 226 floor standing speaker. A pair of 6½-inch woofer/mid-range drivers share everything from the lowest available bass up to 2800Hz. Their cones are constructed of plastic with graphite injected for a feature that Boston Acoustics calls Deep Channel Design. They say this produces more bass from less amplifier power. Though that may be the case, trying to cover such a broad range of frequencies is a tall order for any single driver of this size.
