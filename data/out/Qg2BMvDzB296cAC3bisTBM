This electric oven will help you to create gourmet meals for a crowd of people or simple dinners for two.

It has two 8-inch burners for larger pans and two 6-inch burners for smaller ones.

At 5.3 cubic feet, you will have enough room to cook a ham for Christmas dinner while still being able to bake a string-bean casserole at the same time. Having the ability to cook multiple dishes at once will free you up to do other tasks around the kitchen before your guests arrive.","One of our favorite features of this electric range is that its oven is self-cleaning. If you have ever spent time with your head inside an oven, scrubbing it out while inhaling harsh cleaning chemicals, you will agree that a self-cleaning oven is a great invention. This electric oven uses high temperatures to burn stuck-on food particles into ashes. When the cleaning cycle is complete, you are left with only a pile of ashes to wipe up. Because the self-cleaning cycle uses such high heat, it also includes a self-locking feature that will ensure that no one is able to open the oven door while the cleaning is in process."]},"id":"c88c4d17-97d6-4e92-bf72-9b895c8d6408","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Conveniences"},"id":"471bdfd0-9542-4253-9031-4d9349b49b7e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For those who are concerned about catching spills from items boiling over, this electric range offers an oven window.

In addition, you can also see how your cuisine is cooking without having to open the door and losing precious heat. In addition, this unit&#39;s oven comes with an interior light so you can see your food items well.","The Kenmore 9021 electric range has a storage drawer underneath the oven. This allows you to store items such as cookie sheets, cake pans and other kitchen utensils that would otherwise clutter up your counter top or cupboards. Having your cookware underneath the oven is also convenient because you will always know where your pots and pans are.","We were pleased to find that this electric range also offers a few safety measures to help ensure that you and your family are kept out of danger. The Kenmore 9021 includes a control lockout. By pressing a few buttons, you can lock the control panel so that the stove cannot be accidentally turned on. In addition, this unit also comes with an auto shutoff feature. If someone happens to leave the oven on for more than 12 hours, it will automatically turn itself off.","While we would have liked to see this product available in more colors, we feel that the three different colors choices are sure to match any kitchen décor.
