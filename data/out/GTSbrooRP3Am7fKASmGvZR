Additionally, it boasts an EcoBoost option, which gives you even more energy efficiency by lowering the wash and rinse temperature and increasing the tumbling without sacrificing wash performance.","Whirlpool includes 12 wash cycles on this front-load washing machine, which is more than sufficient. It has an impressive 14 preset options. Additionally, you get four soil levels and four wash and rinse temperatures to choose from for each load of laundry you do. Some of the cycles on this machine include allergen, sanitize, quick wash, cold wash, heavy duty, and a wash and dry cycle.","This washer has a unique feature that implements Whirlpool’s FanFresh technology. A fan activates after the wash cycle, and the clothes are tumbled for up to 12 hours. In this way, it will dry a small, 2-pound load of lightweight fabrics. This option doesn’t work with oversized or heavy-duty loads. However, it’s a nice option if you want to leave a load of clothing in the washer overnight and have dry clothes waiting in the morning.","The Presoak option will add additional time for soaking prior to the wash cycle. You can select up to an eight-hour time frame, and the wash cycle you selected will immediately begin after the selected soak time completes.","Whirlpool falls short on the warranty for this front-load washer. You only get a single year of coverage all around for parts, motor and washtub. This is well below average, especially when compared with the best products in our front-load washer reviews.","You can contact Whirlpool by phone, live chat or an online contact form on the Whirlpool website to have the manufacturer contact you via email for support. Whirlpool also makes this product’s user manual and some FAQs available on its website for you to reference at any time."]},"id":"7448d782-63b4-416f-aaab-a07a59efd5c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"479d750d-b2af-45aa-9292-1eaa617aca96","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Duet WFW95HEDU front-loading washer boasts a large capacity washtub and a nice selection of wash cycles and options, like the FanFresh feature.
