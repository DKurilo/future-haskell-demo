This feature makes it easy to keep your lawn cut to the exact height you want.  <br />\n  <br />\nThe blades have twice the cutting surface as a standard blade, which gives you a smooth, clean cut and keeps clippings from clumping together. The mower also features a discharge bag that is about 25 percent bigger than those on the other lawn mowers we tested. That means you’ll spend less time emptying the bag.   <br />\n  <br />\nThis lawn mower is quite loud. So, if you are going to use it often or for extended periods of time, you might want to invest in some earplugs.
