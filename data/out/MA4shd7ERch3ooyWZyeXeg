Every year, hundreds of hours are devoted to testing, researching and evaluating products in these categories, all with the aim of helping you make the best purchase for you.","I&#39;ve been an expert reviewer for Purch since 2013, reviewing a wide variety of senior care products for Top Ten Reviews and Dignifyed. I&#39;ve reviewed medical alert services, fall detection pendants, GPS medical alert systems, glucometers, power scooters, stair lifts and hearing aids.","For products I can test hands on, I use a thorough and devoted approach to testing. For example, I pricked my finger multiple times a day while testing blood glucose meters. For fall detection pendants, I literally fell to the ground dozens of times. With products that aren&#39;t easily testable, I bring years of experience, which includes three years as a graduate student, researching the finer details of products and services so I can make appropriate evaluations.","<strong>How Much Do Telemedicine Services Cost?</strong>","If the telemedicine service accepts your insurance, the cost of an appointment is no different from whatever co-pay your insurance requires. However, some services don&#39;t take insurance but each service does accept patients regardless of insurance coverage. If you don&#39;t have insurance, most services charge between $30 and $75 per visit. That said, it depends on the kind of doctor you request to speak with. The more specialized a doctor is, the more expensive the appointment is.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Testing telehealth services is not practical, as we don&#39;t feel its ethical to waste doctors’ time with unnecessary appointments. It&#39;s also worth noting that our pick for the best telemedicine service may not be the best choice for you – it matters little how many doctors a service has or how well the site is designed if you don&#39;t get the help you need for your specific problem. Of course, this is an issue relative to all medical practices.","As such, we based our picks on research and evaluation of available features. We treated the websites like the physicians’ offices – evaluating how easy they are to navigate and how transparent they are about payments, insurance and patient privacy. The best telemedicine services are upfront about the costs, insurance coverage and the conditions they can treat. In addition, they should be upfront about the types of medications they can and cannot prescribe. And they should provide background information for each doctor in their databases.","We looked closely at how each service’s website is designed, preferring those like Amwell’s, which provides exceptionally detailed information about the conditions it can treat, including a searchable page of the conditions. We also checked what the minimum payment is, what insurance plans the service accepts and the number of conditions it covers.","<strong>What Else You Should Know About Telemedicine Services</strong>","Unlike when you go to the ER and are under the care of whichever doctor is on call, you get to choose the best telemedicine service for you. Whether you choose one of the 10 services on our list or seek out another one, take time to find out if the company offers qualified and competent medical staff that fit your needs. Here are some tips to help you:<br/><br/>Licensed in your state as well as their own.<br/>Each state has its own medical licensing laws and regulations, and while most states are enacting laws that take telemedical services into account, not every service works in all 50 states.","Even if a telehealth service works in your state, with some, you may have limited choice in doctors. This is especially important to consider when consulting with specialists, as you are less likely to find one licensed in your state than if you are looking for a family physician. Further, some states require separate protocols for prescribing medication virtually, so be sure to ask about this as well.","Member of the American Telemedicine Association (ATA).<br/>The ATA is a non-profit professional association with 10,000 members in the health care industry. It offers its members training through webinars, courses and conferences. Physicians and companies who are members of the ATA have access to cutting edge telemedicine technology and the latest advances, plus continuing education specifically focused on treating patients in the virtual arena.","Vetting processes.<br/>Just because a doctor is licensed does not mean they are the best. Check online bios, FAQs and hiring pages to get a feel for what experience and qualifications the telehealth service considers when bringing physicians and nurse practitioners into its group. Look for:","- Years of practical experience<br/>- Specializations<br/>- Completed background checks<br/>- Training on virtual consultation and protocols","Diagnosis and testing procedures.<br/>In cases where you may need more specialized tests, check the procedures. You may need to visit a local lab or purchase or rent specialized equipment. In some cases, especially when looking for a specialist, your local primary care physician may conduct the tests.","When you meet with your new doctor, ask questions and bring up concerns, just as you would with a regular doctor. In addition to making sure you are clear on matters concerning your health, it gives you the chance to see if this is a doctor you might like to &#34;visit&#34; for routine matters in the future.<br/><strong><br/>Other Questions About Telemedicine Services<br/></strong><br/>How can the doctor diagnose me without a physical examination?<br/>In many cases, a description of the symptoms and your medical history is enough to diagnose common ailments. With video technology, you can send photos or video to the doctor – such as if he or she wants to see a rash. If they think the issue needs a physical examination, they will recommend you see your doctor or go to the emergency room.<br/><br/>Can I use the same telemedicine company when I&#39;m traveling stateside?<br/>Yes! If you have telemedicine services through your insurance company or health care provider, you will need to check the rules. Otherwise, if the telemedicine service can serve the state you are visiting, then you can receive care through it. Some services provide international care; find a service before you go abroad. <a href=\"/healthtap-review\">HealthTap</a>, which is on our list, provides worldwide health care.","Are there budget telemedicine services available or budget versions of the services?<br/>Aside from SecondOpinions.com, the services charge a flat rate per visit unless they allow individual doctors to set their own prices. The prices are usually lower than a standard doctor visit, though not always less than a co-pay, and definitely less than an emergency room visit.<br/><strong><br/>Why You Should Use Telehealth Services</strong>","Telehealth and telemedicine services are still in their infancy, and many people are reluctant to give up their visit to the doctor&#39;s office. However, unless you have an emergency or need lab work done, there really is no reason to avoid a virtual doctor appointment. All you need is a smartphone or a computer with a camera. Even if you don’t have insurance, visits are comparable in price to most insurance copays.","Here are some great reasons to jump on the telemedicine bandwagon:"]},"id":"fff3aa04-1d1e-46d0-8b4f-aa66bfb02c12","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<em>Limits Spread of Disease:</em> Doctors&#39; offices and hospitals are some of the most germ-filled places you can visit. By consulting with a doctor online, you both avoid and limit the spread of infectious illnesses like the flu.","<em>Shorter Wait Times:</em> Most telemedicine appointments have no wait times. With most services, you can see a list of the doctors who are available for an immediate appointment.","<em>More Choices:</em> Telemedicine services provide a list of doctors with their specialties and bios, allowing you to choose one based on your preferences. However, since the doctors meet with you remotely, the services can have more providers under their purview. This means you have greater choice.","<em>Provides Care in Rural Areas:</em> If you live in a rural area, you might have to travel great distances for a simple doctor visit. As such, you may avoid going to the doctor until it’s too late. With telemedicine, you just need a reliable internet or cellular connection.","<em>Private and Secure:</em> Telemedicine services are subject to the same privacy laws as doctors&#39; offices.
