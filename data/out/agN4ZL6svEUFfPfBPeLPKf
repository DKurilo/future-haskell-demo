You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Whirlpool is the largest manufacturer of home appliances and owns several of the brands we reviewed. Under the Whirlpool brand name are two series of <a href=\"/best-french-door-refrigerators\">french door refrigerators</a>. The GI6FARXXY is one of the french door fridges in the Whirlpool Gold series. This is a rather spacious model with a total capacity of 25.6 cubic feet. Both the fresh food section and the freezer have plenty of space at 19 and 6.6 cubic feet, respectively.","This refrigerator has five shelves in the fresh food compartment, four of which are adjustable. One of the shelves is the full width of the compartment, three are half width and there is one mini shelf. This smaller shelf is an attempt to make some useable space around the icemaker in the refrigeration compartment. The icemaker connects to the through-the-door ice and water dispenser. The two crisper bins, also in the refrigeration compartment, have adjustable humidity controls, and the full-width deli drawer is adjustable as well, but for temperature rather than humidity. The whole compartment, as well as the freezer, is lit by incandescent light bulbs, which are not as efficient or bright as the more advanced LED lighting.","On the doors to the fresh food compartment, you will find six door bins. Of these door bins, two are designed to fit gallon-sized containers such as milk and juice. None of these bins are covered, so you won&#39;t have a dairy-specific compartment. However, the bins are all generously sized, so you&#39;ll be able to fit plenty of condiments and beverages in the bins.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"6f349a38-7a41-4abb-b922-998b02a576c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In this Whirlpool Gold model, you can get a stainless steel, black or white french door refrigerator. Whirlpool only offers a one-year limited warranty on this model of fridge, which is disappointing as you will have no coverage should something happen 14 months out.","The control panel is on the front of the fridge and has electronic touch controls. From this control panel you can choose water, cubed or crushed ice, lock the control panel or choose from other option like Fast Cool. This setting will quickly cool everything in your fridge so that when you bring groceries home you don&#39;t risk spoilage while the food is adjusting to the temperature.
