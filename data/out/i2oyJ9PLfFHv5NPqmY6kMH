You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Bissell CleanView series of <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum cleaners</a> are popular machines that offer a variety of cleaning features. We wrote our review about the Bissell CleanView Complete Pet with OnePass Technology because it stands out in the series with its powerful suction and pet attachments that remove animal hair from your furniture.","This bagless machine is equipped with an odor-absorbing carbon filter and a washable filter. This saves you money because you do not have to buy replacement filters. However, this vacuum lacks HEPA filtration, which is vital for removing allergens and pet dander. If you or someone in your family suffers from allergies, this machine is not ideal.","The height adjustment is automatic and the cleaner moves easily from low-pile carpets to bare floors. It has a roller brush shut-off switch so you can clean hard surfaces and delicate rugs. The clear plastic allows you to see when it is full. However, when you dispose of the contents there is exposure to dust and dirt.","The cleaner weighs 18 pounds and the cord is 27 feet long. The weight is average compared to other cleaners, but the cord is shorter than we like at 27 feet. You will likely have to make frequent stops to plug in and out of electrical outlets. This upright vacuum does not have any notable maneuverability features, and the handle does not recline back for cleaning under low furniture.","If you are looking for a vacuum cleaner with pet tools, this cleaner offers an effective pet attachment tool with a spinning brush and suction that removes hair. This vacuum also comes with an upholstery tool, dusting brush and crevice tool. The tools are housed on the cleaner so you do not have to bend to reach them.","This vacuum comes with a three-year warranty, and there is a service center locator on the website so you can find support when you need it. It is easy to contact the company by phone or email. Helpful resources listed on the website include a FAQs page, how-to videos and cleaning and maintenance tips."]},"id":"0a9f0ad4-0c74-4b1e-ba7a-93513090c09c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9e668994-807f-464d-92bf-52bc79a4b7c0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it lacks notable filtration features, the Bissell CleanView Complete Pet vacuum cleaner has many great qualities.
