You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","iCollage helps you create personalized greeting cards for friends and family in addition to calendars, scrapbook pages and photo collages. This card making software for Mac comes with 40 card templates and the option to download more, although the download didn&#39;t work during our evaluation. You can also pick from 40 clip art images and more than 700 fonts. This <a href=\"/best-mac-greeting-card-software\">Mac greeting card software</a> occasionally lost objects on our cards when we pressed Undo, and the editing options are limited to certain portions of the template.","Although the most recent version of iCollage supposedly fixed some of the reasons the software was being unstable, we noticed it still had a few problems. The Undo button didn&#39;t seem to work when we edited images. Instead of going back a step, the image would completely disappear.","The software has some fun and highly unique card designs. It&#39;s easy to customize your iCollage cards, but you don&#39;t have many options. There are far fewer clip art images than you get with most greeting card software. iCollage has 40, whereas the next lowest in our comparison has 16,000. You do have some options, though. You can add effects, adjust the color of imported photos and put masks in your design. You should be able to save your favorite clip art to a favorites file. You would then be able to access this clip art for any project. We were not able to get this feature to work, though. If you&#39;d prefer a program that offers thousands of graphics and templates, you might be interested in <a href=\"/hallmark-card-studio-review\">Hallmark Card Studio for Mac</a>.","With this software, you can adjust the exposure, hue, gamma, saturation, contrast, brightness and focus of your photos. You can resize and rotate photos and clip art. You can also import photos from iPhoto or iSight, but iCollage doesn&#39;t give you the tools to crop, remove red-eye or fix any flaws.","The biggest problem with iCollage is that many of the tools don&#39;t function properly. For example, the circular tool that allows you to rotate your picture never worked during our testing. Half the time it didn&#39;t even respond to our clicks, but when it did, the picture would simply disappear.","You can contact customer service via email, chat or telephone. Wondershare has a manual for iCollage on its website, but it only covers basic information and doesn&#39;t address any advanced features. The 24-page quick guide on the software is a lot more informative. The website for this Mac greeting card software also has a video tutorial. It moves kind of fast and lacks verbal instruction, but it&#39;s still informative."]},"id":"5bbca806-0940-4b73-81d6-01890eb9fac1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d64eda89-090a-415e-bb4e-ac43586350ef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["iCollage Mac has a few bugs in its design, but you can make fun cards with this greeting card software for Mac.
