The most important number, the accuracy, is at 33 feet and some of the better GPS tracking devices can pinpoint your child&#39;s location to under 20 feet. Also, the battery life is disappointing. Whenever you use real-time tracking settings, the battery life of the GPS tracker plummets. However, better units can still power through 48 to 72 hours. Not so with the Meitrack MT90. This tracking device lasts less than 24 hours when using the real-time tracking setting, which updates by the minute. You can track your child through the day, but be sure to charge the device every night, as the device can only survive 16 hours before needing another charge.  On stand-by, you can get about 60 hours of use.","You must provide a SIM card to use wireless networks and the two-way communication ability. You can choose any pre-paid SIM card, but some of the functions will be affected by your choice. For example, you can do two-way communication through the GPS tracker, but you are limited to the number of minutes you purchase without facing overage charges.","The Meitrack MT90 is a basic mini GPS tracker. You can set zone, speed and low battery alerts, use two-way voice communication, and receive text and email notifications. The MT90 is equipped with a panic button and a call button. When pressed, the panic button will start to call the first of three user defined emergency phone numbers. If the first number doesn&#39;t answer, the device will automatically cycle to the next. The tracking device holds another five phone numbers that your children can call if they  feel threatened or need to confirm a pickup time.","Meitrack has both a device manager and a free mapping program that you can use to keep track of locations and the status of your GPS devices. The Meitrack MT90 comes with a one-year warranty, an installation CD for the device manager, a lanyard, an extra battery and a mini screwdriver for removing the back of the device. The website has a digital copy of the user manual and a brief FAQs page, but if you need more help, it may be difficult to reach the company. The phone numbers are Chinese and our attempts to contact the company via email have gone unanswered."]},"id":"b85fa480-3e43-4e76-a6a7-6e4eb86cf9bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f4783d0f-cc47-421b-b3b7-edd8e32a5a1f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re looking for a basic mini GPS tracker that you can add a SIM card of your choice to, then the Meitrack MT90 will allow you to do so.

The battery life is unimpressive, but the amount of phone numbers your child can call when in trouble is more impressive.
