Like the Big Four carriers, it uses its own towers and infrastructure to deliver wireless service, but its availability is limited to pockets, mostly in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest. Though it is the fifth largest cellular network in the U.S., its coverage, particularly 4G LTE, falls quite far behind the competition. If you go with U.S. Cellular and need to wander outside the company’s coverage, it does have roaming agreements with other networks, so you won’t be totally out of luck. Still, if you travel frequently, you may want to consider a carrier with better in-network coverage (like <a href=\"/verizon-review\">Verizon</a> or <a href=\"/att-wireless-review\">AT&amp;T</a>), as U.S. Cellular may terminate your contract if you use too much of your plan out of network.","Though not one of the Big Four, U.S. Cellular isn’t necessarily a budget phone provider. Its prices are comparable to larger carriers, so if you’re looking for lower rates, try <a href=\"/metropcs-review\">MetroPCS</a>, which is cheaper and has better national coverage, or even Sprint. There are three plans with 2GB, 6GB or unlimited data, and they cost $55, $60 and $70 per month, respectively. All include unlimited talk and text as well. Unlimited plans have a high-speed data cap of 22GB, which is standard, though some carriers give you up to 50GB before throttling your speeds.","Compared to plans offered by other carriers, U.S. Cellular’s options are lackluster. They aren’t the cheapest, they don’t use the best network and they don’t offer extra features or perks. U.S. Cellular also has the highest activation fees of any cell phone provider we evaluated. Its plans are all based on the two-year contract model, which feels outdated now that most cellular providers have newer pricing models.","Though not particularly a standout, U.S. Cellular isn’t a bad option. The company tied for first in the North Central region, alongside Verizon, in J.D. Power’s U.S. Wireless Network Quality Performance Study Vol. 1 (2018). It tends to have better customer service than other carriers as well. The main thing holding U.S. Cellular back is its lack of nationwide coverage and availability. We strongly recommend checking coverage maps to see if U.S. Cellular is worth it for where you live."]},"id":"f61a6a44-7243-4a2b-9405-520e37eec1a6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1274","url":"/u-s-cellular-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","name":"U.S. Cellular","synopsis":"U.S. Cellular is a regional cell phone provider.
