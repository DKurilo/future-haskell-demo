The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">Top-Load Washing Machines</a> here.</em>","As high-efficiency top-loading washing machines go, the Maytag Bravos XL MVWB980BW has almost all of the wash cycles and options you could want. You also get a large stainless-steel drum to fit big loads of dirty laundry, which means less laundry every day. Although this Maytag model uses more gallons of water per wash cycle than many of its Energy-Star counterparts, it’s still quite an efficient machine.","According to this unit’s EnergyGuide, it consumes an estimated 159 kilowatt hours annually. That means it will only cost you $17 to operate each year. Add to that the water factor, though, and you’ll be spending about $32 total each year, on average, to operate this machine.","The 16 wash cycles you get with this washer gives you several ways to get your clothes clean, including cycles like normal, heavy duty, delicate, permanent press, whites and more. Specialty cycles like allergen, sanitize and &#34;clean washer&#34; are available, too. This Maytag top-loader lets you choose from four soil levels and five different wash and rinse temperatures, allowing you to customize each load.","Though this Maytag machine offers several options to help customize your loads, you won’t be able to save those options to make your own custom cycle. However, there are helpful options, such as delayed start, which allows you to time your washing cycles so your clothes are ready when you are.","The clean boost with heater option and the water-saving spray rinse option are useful features. You can select the clean boost with heater option if you have stubborn stains that won’t come out with a standard wash cycle. This option uses a heater to keep the wash temperature you select the same throughout the wash time. The water-saving option can be selected when you want to use less water, and the wash cycle will use a spray rinse instead of a deep-water rinse.","Maytag doesn’t provide the best warranty in the washing machine industry, but it’s close. The unit’s parts and labor are covered for one year, while the motor and washtub are backed by a lengthy 10-year warranty.","You can contact Maytag for help and support by phone, live chat or by sending an email through its website. Maytag also publishes the user manual on its website for easy reference. You can also access FAQs, which may be helpful prior to contacting Maytag for help and support."]},"id":"ca87bb26-b8eb-401f-8c87-33a262e55f5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c75c62d2-a2fc-46af-b5df-eafd7d60465e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag Bravos XL MVWB980BW may not top our list of the best washing machines, but it comes close with its numerous wash cycles and excellent warranties.
