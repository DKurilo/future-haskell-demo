This Hitachi machine can blow debris 18 feet in 16.54 seconds; this was the farthest distance of any of the leaf blowers in our lineup. This blower is compact, but it pushes 441 cubic feet of air through its tapered nozzle per minute at a velocity of 170 mph. This is somewhat lower than some of the other models we evaluated, but it can work just fine for a small yard.","Unfortunately, this blower doesn’t have vacuum functionality. It also lacks anti-vibration technology and the handle isn’t cushioned, so while the light weight does make it easier to use, you may get fatigued using it for an extended time.","This gas <a href=\"/best-leaf-blowers\">leaf blower</a> weighs in at 8.6 pounds, which is light enough for most people to use around the yard, on a driveway or along walkways. The lightweight body of this Hitachi contributes to its easy handling. When you need to put the blower down, it has an auto-return switch that resets the power button so the blower starts quickly when you return.","You&#39;ll find the Hitachi RB24EAP is pretty loud at 96.6 decibels, which is comparable to the average lawn mower. As with all leaf blowers, it is best to use ear protection when using them. Those looking for a softer sounding machine should look at the <a href=\"/black-decker-leaf-blower-review\">Black &amp; Decker LSWV36</a>.","This model sports a low-emission engine with a fuel tank capacity of 17.6 fluid ounces. Like many similar gas-powered leaf blowers, this Hitachi model has specific needs for the type of fuel it uses. Before running the machine, be sure you&#39;ve used a proper 50:1 ratio mix of gasoline to oil.","Hitachi recommends 89-octane gasoline, which you can find at almost any local gas station. This Hitachi model complies with EPA standards to limit hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides in the air.","It comes with a seven-year warranty. Like most warranties, any negligence, improper use of or incorrectly mixing the gas and oil voids the agreement, but otherwise, you&#39;re covered for an extended time so you can get years of use out of your leaf blower. The Hitachi RB24EAP leaf blower is compact and easy to carry and rather noisy, but it blows debris, dirt and leaves away well and would work especially well in a small yard.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Hitachi RB24EAP is a high functioning gas leaf blower that blows leaves further than the other products in our lineup at 18 feet. It lacks anti-vibration technology and the handle is not cushioned, so this can add to fatigue after long period of use, but its lightweight design helps with its maneuverability. The seven-year warranty is a big bonus with this leaf blower and provides security if something goes wrong."]},"id":"f8b4e736-e517-40b2-be2b-e10f122e4082","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56470","url":"/hitachi-leaf-blower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-22T23:48:24Z","datePublished":"2013-05-22T23:48:24Z","name":"Hitachi RB24EAP","synopsis":"The Hitachi RB24EAP is a compact gas-powered leaf blower that effectively clears leaves and debris from your yard and is backed by an impressive seven-year consumer warranty.","review":{"rating":67,"verdict":"The Hitachi RB24EAP is a lightweight leaf blower that is easy to handle and maneuver, and most importantly, it effectively clears leaves and debris from your yard.
