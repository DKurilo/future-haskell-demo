However, you need good credit to qualify for this <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security system</a>, and it costs more than others.","The Vivint home security system is entirely cellular-based, so there is no need for broadband or landline connections. This might seem like a disadvantage at first, but wireless systems are harder to disable because they do not depend on landlines or cables that intruders can cut. In addition, it has a backup battery, so it continues to run when the power goes out.","While Vivint now offers a lower monthly monitoring price of $39.99 for its basic plan, it requires you to pay for your equipment either upfront (minimum equipment purchase of $600) or throughout the contract term, so in the long run, you pay the same price. In our comparison, we chose to evaluate the services as if we were paying for equipment throughout the contract, which brings the monthly total to $49.14 before taxes and other potential fees.","However, you might want to pay for your equipment upfront if you can afford to do so. As stated in its <a href=\"https://www.vivint.com/company/policies/terms-of-use\">Terms and Conditions</a>, Vivint doesn’t require a long-term contract if your equipment has already been paid for. As such, there are no early-termination fees and the monitoring contract becomes month-to-month. While there are lower monitoring fees, this option costs the same as the five-year contract, provided you have the system for the same amount of time. The chief advantage is the option to cancel early without fees.","Regardless of how you pay for your equipment, Vivint remains the highest-priced residential security alarm system we&#39;ve reviewed. To qualify for it, you need good credit. Your contract lasts for five years, which is the longest in this industry, and you must pay the full balance if you cancel early. In contrast, companies like <a href=\"/simplisafe-review\">SimpliSafe</a> and <a href=\"/lifeshield-security-review\">LifeShield</a> require neither a minimum contract nor early cancellation fees. Vivint contracts have an auto-renewal policy with monthly or annual renewals, depending on the state where you live.","Vivint&#39;s starting equipment package includes a touchscreen control panel, one motion detector, and three door and window sensors. In addition to a $198 installation fee, every new piece of equipment beyond this increases either your upfront starting costs or your monthly payments.","In the event of a burglary or emergency, the control panel contacts Vivint&#39;s monitoring station and a representative contacts you through the two-way intercom to confirm or dismiss the alarm. Vivint&#39;s equipment comes with a lifetime warranty, which is excellent for the industry. As a safety measure, the company has an employee verification section on its website where you can plug in the badge number of any person claiming to represent Vivint, or you can call to see if the person on your doorstep is truly an employee.","Your Vivint home security system can also integrate with smart home devices such as a smart thermostat. One of the system&#39;s biggest strengths is its support for consumer smart home products like the Nest Learning Thermostat, Amazon Echo and Google Home. You can also add indoor and outdoor security cameras to your Vivint plan as well as a doorbell camera to see who has been on your front porch.","Depending on the sensors you choose, you can get alerts when the system detects motion, door and window activity, spikes in heat or smoke, and intrusion. You can customize which alerts you receive so you don’t get a message every time your family opens a door.","Vivint also sells Vivint Car Guard, which provides security for your car in addition to tracking your car’s location and conditions via a smartphone app. This device plugs into your car’s OBD II port and can also be used without a Vivint security system and costs $199 upfront with monthly fees of $9.99.","Vivint&#39;s online support resources include FAQs, downloadable user guides and virtual product tours. You can contact the company by social media, phone, email or live chat. Vivint has 24/7 customer service. In our experience, company representatives are courteous and informative, and while they are clearly eager for a sale, they don’t use hard-sell tactics."]},"id":"516d7af0-2d2c-476f-a7e6-a9772fb49adf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54927","url":"/vivint-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-07-20T18:34:15Z","datePublished":"2012-07-20T18:34:15Z","name":"Vivint Smart Home","synopsis":"If you want to combine home security with extra energy-saving features, Vivint’s system is a good candidate.
