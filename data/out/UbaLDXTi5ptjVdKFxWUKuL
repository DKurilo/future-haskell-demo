The SCEPTRE X240 24-inch chrome ECO LCD HDTV could be that smaller alternative for you.  The name may not jump out, but this little unit has some good-to-great features that make it worth a consideration. To see how other highly ranked TVs compare, check out our <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LCD TV review site</a>.","Boasting features including a fairly nice picture in Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080), a 16 x 9 widescreen aspect ratio, sound that is acceptable but not Earth-shattering, and a great contrast ratio of 4,000:1, this little TV may be just right for small college dorm rooms or apartments.  It can also act as a second TV for the bedroom, kitchen or anywhere you can put a TV.  With its VGA connection, it can also be used as a computer monitor.","The  ECO  and  green  marketing terms may not be as hot as they once were, but the SCEPTRE X240 is Energy Star 3.0 compliant and uses 40% less power than previous models, helping to save on power bills.","Unpacking the 24-inch SCEPTRE from the box was a little difficult, as was attaching the base to the TV.  But once those tasks were accomplished, it was easy to get set up.  The unit has one of the easier menu systems when compared to other major TV manufacturer s offerings.  Setting up the HDTV, adjusting picture, sound, switching inputs, etc., was fairly simple and navigation was a breeze.  It s definitely a user-friendly menu to work with.","The set of connection ports is located on the back and is a little difficult to reach, since they re laid out under a curve in the TV.  The ports include two HDMI, digital Coaxial, VGA, component (image only), composite (RCA), S-video (image only), and USB.

Tech support can be found online via Live Chat or email; there are also links to a FAQ, some (but not all) manuals, LCD monitor drivers, and firmware updates.  Also, Customer Service is reachable in Southern California via an 800 number or email.","The chrome color is a bit distracting under lights or sunlight, though other colors are available including piano black, red, bronze marble, blue and pink, which is reminiscent of the Apple iPod nanos.  Does one really need a bronze marble HDTV?  Probably not.","Overall the SCEPTRE X240 is a nice unit for its size, features and price, and a quick scan of competing HDTVs shows the price is about average.  The brand may be obscure, but it s a good choice to consider when selecting a smaller HDTV that is under 30 inches.  Hopefully this will help you in your smaller HDTV shopping."]},"id":"4c1c22d2-1e11-4d10-9a37-3de9c381eb1b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4237","url":"/small-sceptre-lcd-hdtv-might-surprise-you","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"heath-mcknight","url":"/author/heath-mcknight","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Heath McKnight","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nzA74pybDSvtEy2edLUeu7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-21T17:12:28Z","datePublished":"2010-04-21T17:12:28Z","name":"Small SCEPTRE LCD HDTV Might Surprise You","synopsis":"Sometimes a big-screen 50-plus inch HDTV just won’t work in some settings, and the need arises for something smaller than 30 inches.","review":{},"strapline":"Sometimes a big-screen 50-plus inch HDTV just won’t work in some settings, and the need arises for something smaller than 30 inches.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-10T13:43:59Z","id":"UbaLDXTi5ptjVdKFxWUKuL","meta":{"title":"Small SCEPTRE LCD HDTV Might Surprise You","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
