This 3D printing business also offers a number of tools to help you improve and optimize your designs.","Sculpteo supports a number of third-party apps, so you create your 3D design with whatever platform you’re most comfortable with. Sculpteo analyzes your 3D file to verify structural features, format and size. If your design is unprintable, you can review the specific issues and make changes using an automatic, semi-automatic or manual repair tool. If you’re a beginner, you can upload and print most 3D files with three clicks. For advanced users, you can override Sculpteo’s repair tool algorithm and manually make needed repairs.","This 3D printing company allows you to optimize your design and coordinate a series of printings directly from the interface. For example, a hollowing tool lets you hollow objects manually or automatically to cut down on printing costs without going back to your design software. For those who want to skip the design process, you can buy 3D designs from other Sculpteo users through the interface. This 3D printing service&#39;s ability to use manual or automatic repair and optimization tools makes the platform accessible to users of all skill levels.","Sculpteo can print your design from plastic, sterling silver, brass, detail resin, alumide and ceramic. Each material offers a range of colors and patterns to choose from, which adds another layer of customization to your design. You can also combine a number of colors and patterns into your product. From there, you’re able to print one-off products or open your own virtual shop through Sculpteo.","The platform lets you embed a virtual storefront on your own website or mobile app. Once a customer orders a model of your design, Sculpteo handles the financial transaction, prints the 3D model and ships it directly to your customer. You set your own prices and, minus the cost of production, keep the profit.","Sculpteo’s versatile repair and optimization tools cater to new and experienced 3D designers. The ability to embed a virtual store stocked with your 3D designs in your own website or mobile app adds another layer of functionality to Sculpteo."]},"id":"e5693706-9e0f-4163-ace1-ef556bbbce34","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66930","url":"/sculpteo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:54:12Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:54:12Z","name":"Sculpteo","synopsis":"Sculpteo is a 3D printing service that allows you to print single 3D files or manage a virtual storefront in which shoppers from around the world can browse and order your products.
