You can, for instance, check to see what your refrigerator lacks while you are out shopping, or check to see if the roast is done before you arrive home. The same is true of LG Smart ThinQ washing machines and <a href=\"/best-dryers\">clothes dryers</a>. You can monitor and control what is happening with your clothes while you are away watching your son’s soccer game.","Granted, this impressive package comes at a price, but it is on par with other high-end smart dryers on the market. The manufacturer&#39;s intent is that the device pays you back by making life easier. For example, if your machine isn’t working right, you can remotely diagnose the cause of the technical glitch from your smartphone on the spot. At least equal to the importance to this space-age technology is its capability to dry your clothes effectively, safely and in a timely manner. The rich feature package and overall functionality combine to make it one of the best clothes dryers on the market, deserving of the Top Ten Reviews Silver Award.","Features:As its name implies, the standout feature of the LG Smart ThinQ dryer, aside from its eye-catching appearance, is the smart technology, which allows you keep track of your dryer’s cycle anywhere or anytime through your smartphone, computer or tablet. But, while you can see what is happening, the app won’t let you actually control the machine from a remote location as a couple of the other smart dryers on our clothes dryer reviews will.","The smart technology has other advantages such as allowing you to instantly diagnose technical glitches that may occur during a cycle. Once the problem is diagnosed, you will be taken through a step-by-step solution by LG’s tech support. From the main menu, you select Smart Diagnosis and then decide if you want an Audible Diagnosis sends sound data to LG Call Center; or a Wi-Fi Diagnosis transmits data directly to your smartphone."]},"id":"13a408cd-4b7a-45fd-9ab4-a7f05043605a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Functionality"},"id":"0c0409f6-5555-47f4-af42-701183a3a0b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/SbvFreQUYnbdSqEja2LnW7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"As its name implies, the standout feature of the LG Smart ThinQ dryer, aside from its eye-catching appearance, is the smart technology, which allows you keep track of your dryer’s cycle anywhere or anytime through your smartphone, computer or tablet.
