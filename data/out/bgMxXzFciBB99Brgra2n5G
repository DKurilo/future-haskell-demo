NOTE: The developer has informed us that their new version, System Mechanic 18, is now available. We will post the new test results and reviews when we next test PC System Utilities.</em>","Developed by iolo technologies, System Mechanic is a full suite of <a href=\"/best-pc-system-utilities-software\">PC system utilities</a>. Each tool is designed to optimize and maintain your computer’s performance, and the interface facilitates this in one easy-to-use application. In our tests, System Mechanic was among the best-performing PC cleaners, and it stands out for its design, ease of use, and intuitive interface.","To find the best PC tune-up software, we wanted to see how well each product improved an old and frustratingly slow computer. We ran benchmark tests using PCMark 10 to gauge the computer’s overall performance both before and after optimization. The benchmarking tests looked at word and data processing, graphics processing, web browsing and video chat quality. We benchmarked the boot speed improvement and looked closely at the application’s diagnostic consistency. We performed multiple rounds of testing on each product to account for variables.","System Mechanic’s overall improvement to our test computer was 9.34 percent. That was about 4 percent above the average in our tests but fell short of the top performer, <a href=\"/glary-utilities-review\">Glary Utilities Pro</a>. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that even Glary’s 12.62 percent improvement wasn’t enough to make our test computer noticeably faster. In fact, our test computer ranked in the bottom 12 percent of computers on the PCMark 10 tests both before and after optimization. In other words, even the best PC system utility software won’t make your computer run like new.","System Mechanic improved some facets of performance by mere milliseconds, boosting word and data processing by 2.98 percent and graphics processing by 5.56 percent. Web browsing and video chat didn’t improve at all.","The software improved boot speed by 42.79 percent, which was significant. However, when we used the computer’s own startup manager, which is found in the control panel, we were able to achieve a 42 percent improvement.","The best part of the System Mechanic startup optimizer is the user feedback. Users rate every tool based on its importance, which helps you make educated guesses when removing apps from the startup menu. This is important because disabling some utilities can have a drastic impact on the software’s overall performance, while removing others may be unnecessary and inconsequential.","The best feature of System Mechanic is its ease of use, which received an A– in our comparison. The interface is easy to navigate, the help section is easy to find, every tool is explained, and the errors have priority levels. All of this makes it easy for even novice computer users to interact with the software effectively. While you can’t expect this product to turn a slow computer into a fast one, it is an excellent maintenance tool for users unfamiliar with similar utilities built in to their Windows machines.","System Mechanic didn’t exhibit great diagnostic consistency during out tests, however, whereas in earlier reviews it was one of the few products to achieve perfect diagnostic consistency. In this round of testing, we’d scan for errors, fix them and scan again, only to find even more errors. Sometimes system repair software is designed to make you think it’s finding more errors than it actually finds, making it seem indispensable.","System Mechanic is loaded with advanced features. While you can scan and fix errors with one click, the advanced tools let you dive deeper into how your PC system works so you can customize it to fit your needs. You can back up and restore your system, recover accidentally deleted files, repair shortcuts and the registry, defragment hard drives, optimize a solid-state drive and optimize your PC’s security. The only advanced tool it lacks is file encryption, but only a few PC system utility applications feature this tool. If the feature is important to you, consider Glary Utilities Pro.","The biggest downside to System Mechanic is iolo’s customer support. While you can directly contact the support team via telephone, the developer doesn’t provide an email or live chat option. Your only option is to call customer support and submit a support claim through its ticket system. The company’s website does include a FAQs page with detailed answers to common questions and issues.","The System Mechanic license comes with unlimited installations, which means you can install the software on as many computers as you own."]},"id":"04245072-3dee-447a-9732-c0677332090d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_819","url":"/system-mechanic-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T00:00:00Z","name":"System Mechanic","synopsis":"EDITOR’S NOTE: The developer has informed us that their new version, System Mechanic 18, is now available.
