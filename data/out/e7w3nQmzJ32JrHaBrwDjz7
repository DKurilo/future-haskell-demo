You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Williams-Sonoma <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">Candy Thermometer</a> features a basic, classic design. It is calibrated to gauge the wide range of heat that is needed for heating sugar for syrups, candy and frostings, and for cooking with oil. If you prefer a digital display, check out the <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">Maverick CT-03</a>.","The Williams-Sonoma thermometer is a rectangular plunging thermometer made of stainless steel, that features a glass thermal unit attached to the main body. The stainless steel unit is stamped with temperatures in Fahrenheit from 100 degrees to 400 degrees and in Celsius up to 200 degrees.","Along the right-hand side of the stainless steel body, next to the metric temperatures, you will find temperature stages for candy including a chocolate melt, soft ball, firm ball and hard ball stage, as well as soft crack and hard crack stage. There is also a deep-fry indicator on the thermometer that you can use when frying anything from cannoli shells to chicken. In total, there are seven different heat stages featured on this Williams-Sonoma thermometer.","At the top of the unit, a stay-cool, easy-grip handle helps you safely pull the thermometer in and out of a pot. An adjustable clip at the back of this device lets you attach the thermometer to the side of any container.","The stainless steel backing of this kitchen thermometer makes it easier to read and identify which stage your candy is in. However, this type of backing is also slightly more difficult to clean. The backing may also move slightly, which could easily change the calibration of the thermometer, so this kitchen thermometer will need to be recalculated before each use. If the calibration is off, you can adjust the backing so that you are getting an accurate read.","Some candy makers prefer the easy-to-read backing of this sugar thermometer. If this is the main feature you are looking for, you can find similar models sometimes at a lower price point. Other features can be very useful for candy makers, such as the larger heatproof handle, which is bigger than most thermometers in its class, and can make this device worth the added expense. Overall, this Williams Sonoma device is a simple but useful kitchen thermometer."]},"id":"272bb62a-f2fb-4a9b-b783-df8470157920","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63291","url":"/williams-sonoma-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:09:25Z","datePublished":"2015-03-06T23:09:25Z","name":"Williams-Sonoma Jam and Sugar","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-06T23:09:25Z","id":"e7w3nQmzJ32JrHaBrwDjz7","meta":{"title":"Williams-Sonoma Jam and Sugar Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Williams-Sonoma.
