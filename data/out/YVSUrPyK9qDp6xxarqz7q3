You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Energy Star compliant, technology driven, anesthetically designed and packed with great storage options, the Samsung RSG257AAWP/XAA is one of the <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">best side-by-side refrigerators</a>. This Samsung side by side may not have the space of our top-rated refrigerators, but it has everything else you need to store and freeze your food, birthday cakes, wine bottles, gallons of milk and so forth.","Spills are inevitable in a refrigerator full of food and beverages. Samsung designed the shelves to have a tray all the way around the edges so that when those spills do happen, they are contained to that one shelf.","If you can&#39;t see it, you won&#39;t eat it. Enter LED tower lighting. This type of lighting uses less energy, gives off less heat and enables you to easily see every item in your fridge.","To keep your food fresh, Samsung uses the Twin Cooling Plus System, which, according to Samsung, &#34;Separates airflow from the refrigerator and the freezer to improve freshness. The refrigerator area stays more humid, keeping fruits and vegetables fresher, longer. Humid air stays out of the freezer to reduce freezer burn, improving the quality of frozen food.&#34;","Although Samsung has created an impressive specimen that ranks with the best side-by-side refrigerators, it only has a capacity of 24.5 cubic feet, which is slightly smaller than your average fridge. The refrigerator section is 15.2 cubic feet and the freezer section is 9.3 cubic feet.","Despite its size, this Samsung appliance has some impressive storage features in the refrigeration area. For starters, this model has four shelves, while many – even the best side-by-side refrigerators – only have three. There are three humidity-controlled crisper bins in this side-by-side refrigerator, and most refrigerators only have one.","Some unique features included in this side-by-side refrigerator are the beverage racks. You can insert the wine shelf that can hold five wine bottles at the top of the main fridge space. The installation of this rack is optional. The soda rack tilts out from the refrigerator door and can hold up to six cans.","The fridge has the following storage:"]},"id":"eefd2ef6-4218-45bd-b180-e8cc164a92df","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Dairy bin","One soda rack","One wine rack","Four shelves","One egg container","Three drawers","Four door bins"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0de62e50-423a-408f-bc2f-1907207038e7","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Samsung designed this freezer with the following storage options:"]},"id":"e79fc38d-6b67-4fac-b2b8-0fe00856c38d","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Four shelves","Three door bins","Two drawers"],"type":"ul"},"id":"68da8013-4d7c-4356-aa1e-83940a477c11","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung RSG257AA WP/XAA is considered one of the best side-by-side refrigerators on the market for many reasons, but the water and ice dispenser is definitely our favorite. Comparatively, Samsung kicks other top-rated refrigerators into the trash when it comes to this feature. The ice maker is designed to fit in the freezer door, freeing up the entire inside of the freezer for storage. To give the illusion of even more free space, the ice maker is clear, so you can see exactly how much ice is in the bucket. Love!","The digital display and tall, well-designed water dispenser are other great features. Samsung, like the rest of the world, has entered a digital era. This refrigerator has a digital control panel that only adds to the overall appeal of this fridge. There are eight buttons on the control panel. These buttons operate the freezer, refrigerator, water and ice. There are several notification icons on the panel too, such as the Alarm icon. If the door is open for more than two minutes, beeping will ensue until the door is closed.","Even though this side-by-side refrigerator is Energy-Star qualified, it still uses more energy than we would expect. The predicted yearly energy use is 616 kilowatts. With this energy use, it should cost you about $60 a year in operating costs. Although this is a low cost, we have seen larger models that use less energy. The warranty for this Samsung model is one year for all parts and labor and five years for sealed system parts and labor.","Like everything else Samsung does, its Service Center is fantastic. Many appliance companies ask you to navigate your way from the main product page to their support section and then search for your refrigerator&#39;s model number from there. Samsung keeps everything centralized and easy to find, providing direct access to the product-specific Service Center.","From the Service Center, you can download the user manual, view warranty information, view the Community Q&amp;A, read the Troubleshooting Guide and navigate directly to Twitter, email and live chat support. You can also watch Product Support TV for this specific Samsung model and read how-to guides. We are very impressed with this selection of help and support tools."]},"id":"9ff5eb9c-0a5e-4f8a-944a-d58d37230d6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9ea2d8a7-9d3f-42a4-beeb-89ad79d57a98","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though the Samsung is smaller than many of the best side-by-side refrigerators, it has many features and gadgets that other refrigerator manufacturers leave out.
