This <a href=\"/money/small-business\">office suite</a> carries a moderate to high price tag, depending on whether you choose the Home &amp; Student, Standard, or Professional edition. While each one is a fully functional office suite, there are considerable differences in features and restrictions among the three software packages.","<strong>What to Look For in Office Software</strong>","Whether you’re shopping for a student, are a writer, or run a business, you’ll most likely find yourself using your office software a great deal. This is why it’s so important to get the right office suite for your needs. Investing in a software package that doesn’t offer everything you need or that you’re not comfortable with is a waste, so keep in mind the following factors when making your purchasing decision.","<strong>Software &amp; Tools</strong><br/>The most obvious and perhaps most important factor to consider is what software and tools come with your office suite. A word processor that can handle complex tasks like writing dissertations and books is essential to many users, while some place more importance on the quality and capability of the included spreadsheet software. Other common inclusions are a drawing program and a presentation builder. Some suites also include photo-editing software.","Some office software bundles include communication and organization tools and software, such as email programs, calendars and organizers. These can prove useful for busy individuals who need a little help to stay on schedule.","<strong>Supported File Formats</strong><br/>If you’re using multiple programs from different companies, or perhaps someone you communicate with and share files with uses a different office suite, it’s crucial that you can still access those files. Therefore, make sure the office software you choose supports a large range of file formats and includes the ones you use most frequently.","<strong>Licenses</strong><br/>The number of licenses each software purchase gives you is really important. Some office suites only provide one license for one PC or one user per purchase, while others, like OpenOffice, are free and have no user limits. Some, like Microsoft Office, let you purchase one license per user and scale up the number of users or licenses as your business grows.","<strong>Support</strong><br/>Whether you’ve been using office suites for decades or you’re brand-new to computing, having solid support on hand can make all the difference. While you can find answers to many questions online and from user-generated content in forums, having bona fide help from the software developer can save you a huge amount of time when you’re learning the ropes or when something goes wrong. The best office suites have robust FAQs and tutorials for self-help, along with product and technical support available via email, telephone or live chat. Some also have dedicated forums where you can get help from official representatives and other users."]},"id":"410d11ff-e7ad-400b-9df3-ce05342cd212","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8a12a9f7-e211-4c0d-822e-5e9e025f5389","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.ability.com/sales/officepro.php?ln=en\">Ability Office</a>","<a href=\"https://www.openoffice.org/product/index.html\">Apache OpenOffice</a>","<a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/\">LibreOffice</a>","<a href=\"http://microsoft-us.evyy.net/c/13013/243952/3327?u=https%3A%2F%2Fproducts.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-affiliate-program-buy-business-premium\">Microsoft Office</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softmaker.com/english/of_en.htm\">SoftMaker Office</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-3627426-11130823-1463178368000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wordperfect.com%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Foffice-suite%2F%3Fhptrack%3Den2bb3%26_ga%3D1.96609180.2065068648.1477939873\">WordPerfect Office</a>","<a href=\"https://secure.avangate.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ZHUHAIKI&AFFILIATE=1896&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.storewpsoffice.com%2Flp%2Fupgrade-to-premium\">WPS</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"082df6e4-d4dc-4322-a1ed-484907d24ee0","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_390","url":"/best-office-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-09-01T21:34:07Z","datePublished":"2016-10-31T18:26:02Z","name":"Office Software Review","synopsis":"Stay organized and on schedule, manage meetings, record minutes, keep track of budgets or performance, and more with the office software that’s the best fit for you.","review":{},"strapline":"Stay organized and on schedule, manage meetings, record minutes, keep track of budgets or performance, and more with the office software that’s the best fit for you.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-06-06T23:45:25Z","id":"VjodMTiLc9zonekZvfeJVm","meta":{"title":"The Best Office Software | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Which is the best office software for you?
