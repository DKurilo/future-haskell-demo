You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Infinity Primus PC250 differs from the PC350 because it is a 2-way center speaker instead of a 3-way center speaker. A 2-way design only divides the audio signal between a tweeter and woofers, whereas a 3-way device uses a midrange driver in addition to the tweeter and woofers. A driver specifically designed for middle frequencies adds texture to the sound and allows the tweeter and woofers to focus on their designated high and low frequencies. Nonetheless, the PC250 still is one of the top ten best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1286-best-center-speakers.html\">center channel speaker</a> options available.","A single 0.75-inch Metal Matrix Diaphragm (MMD) tweeter is the driver in charge of all the high frequencies. MMD technology is a copyrighted design from Infinity where both sides of the aluminum core are anodized. This gives the driver additional firmness that allows for faster vibration. Additionally, two 5.25-inch MMD woofers produce the lower frequencies and the midrange frequencies.","The Infinity Primus PC250 center speaker has a frequency response of 80Hz to 20kHz. This means that it is able to reproduce the highest audible noises heard by the human ear (20kHz), but it can&#39;t create the supersonic noises sometimes put in music and film to help enrich the audio. The average human ear can also hear tones as low as 20Hz, but lower frequencies will mostly be handled by the subwoofer, not the center speaker.","Sensitivity is the measurement of how effectively an audio device can convert energy into sound. A higher rating means that the product uses less power to play at high volume levels. This center speaker has a sensitivity level of 90dB, which is one of the higher ratings in our review.","The PC250 is lighter and more compact than the PC350. It measures 7.6 inches high, 9.6 inches deep and 18 inches long. It also weighs around seven pounds less than the PC350 at 17.6 pounds. This unit should easily sit on top of your entertainment center and can also be mounted on the wall.","This magnetically-shielded center speaker also has a nominal impedance of 8 ohms. Impedance measures how resistant a product&#39;s coil is to the current being supplied by the receiver. Make sure the receiver you are connecting this unit to is rated at 8 ohms or less so that you don&#39;t overheat the circuitry.","A 5-year warranty covers the Infinity PC250. If you need assistance, you can contact customer support by telephone or by e-mail. In addition, you can download the instruction manual for this product on the Infinity website and there is a FAQs page for general questions, but not questions for this specific unit."]},"id":"f95a0b0a-c1fe-4bb7-a5fb-27b081f289ae","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3a579bac-140b-441a-9499-fa74ae6e96fe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Since the center channel speaker is in charge of all of the main dialogue in movies and the lyrics in music, it&#39;s important that you get a high-quality center speaker to keep your audio balanced.
