The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">Floor Standing Speakers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","Cambridge Audio has been around for a long time. The company is best known for its tuners and amplifiers. The company dabbles in various audio and video electronics, including speakers. We say dabble because that is all it is. The Cambridge Audio S70 is the only floor standing speaker that the company currently offers, and it is part of one of the two limited speaker series that it manufactures.","With decades of experience manufacturing audio equipment, we expected a little more from Cambridge Audio. However, building quality loudspeakers is an art that takes a lot of focus and refining, apparently, because this setup is only mediocre in our opinion. In nearly every aspect, we found ourselves thinking, &#34;Well that&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s not great.&#34; There are a couple things that don&#39;t fall under that description, but for the most part, that was our theme for the Cambridge Audio S70.","First, we looked at the range of frequencies that the three drivers could cover, which is 35Hz to 20kHz. The 35Hz low end is right around what we found on similarly priced floor standing speakers, but the 20kHz fell short. 20kHz is the very top of the average human hearing range, so it&#39;s okay, but all of the competition has tweeters that can push beyond into ultrasonic frequencies, which is great. Although most people can&#39;t hear those tones, they still add to the ambiance and feel of the audio.","The speakers&#39; 90dB sensitivity is an admirable show of audio ingenuity. That isn&#39;t the highest we saw by any means, but at least better than some of its competition. We were also pleased to see that the Cambridge Audio S70 comes with dual gold-plated binding posts, which allow you to bi-amp the system for additional audio capability. Without bi-amping, you are stuck with 120 watts as the maximum allowed amplifier power for each floor standing speaker.","The drivers themselves are yesterday&#39;s technology, so to speak. The 1-inch tweeter uses a paper cone rather than the now-common silk, aluminum or titanium. The two drivers that cover both the low and midrange frequencies are 5 inches in diameter and are made of Polyfibre. Yesterday&#39;s technology isn&#39;t a bad thing, especially if you are a fan of the older paper cone drivers. Materials aside, the sound quality of the Cambridge Audio S70 is there, it&#39;s just not phenomenal.","These floor standing speakers are ported and they weigh just more than 27 pounds. Standing at 36.9 inches, they are a bit shorter than the average tower speaker. They are slightly thinner all the way around as well, with a 6.3-inch width and a 9.4-inch depth. The finish is a dark oak noir with a silvery faceplate. This gives it a unique look."]},"id":"e7a791b3-4321-4efd-90ca-b5489e399c57","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5e2fdb7e-d8db-4074-a65c-20bc4b9a750b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cambridge Audio S70 has good audio reproduction.
