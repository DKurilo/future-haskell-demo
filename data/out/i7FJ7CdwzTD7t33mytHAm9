Quality sensors and multiple recording modes give you options when it comes to capture output. Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS help enhance not just your driving experience, but your recorded video history as well. This dual-camera HD design makes it ideal for professional drivers, much like the <a href=\"/blackbox-guard-review\">BlackBox Guard</a>.","With a 2-megapixel Sony Exmor CMOS sensor, the front camera records in 1920 x 1080p full HD at 30 frames per second. Additionally, the front camera has a 129-degree viewing angle, which will help you easily capture all traffic in front of you. The rear camera also records in HD, though at a slightly lower resolution of 1280 x 720p at 30 frames per second. This dash camera features a 1-megapixel CMOS sensor.","Both front and rear cameras have coaxial cables to reduce signal noise. You can easily adjust your viewing angle on either camera since the cylinder rotates 360-degrees, ensuring that you will be able to capture any incident involving your vehicle or even just some nice scenery from a Sunday drive. You can also choose whether or not you want to record sound.","This dash cam comes with a 16GB SD card, though you can use an SD card up to 64GB. You can choose from three different recording modes: Normal, Event and Parking. The camera houses G-sensor technology, much like the <a href=\"/garmin-review\">Garmin dash cam</a>, that automatically detects a collision and marks the date and time on the recording, which you can save for evidence if needed.","This BlackVue dash cam features built-in Wi-Fi and GPS capabilities. The GPS automatically records the time, date, speed and location of your car into your videos. The accompanying BlackVue app lets you watch live and recorded video from your dash cam on your smartphone, and it even lets you adjust your dash cam settings and preferences.","Both the front and rear cameras have small dimensions, measuring less than under 1 inch by 5 inches. It&#39;s also solid black. These attributes mean the camera can be placed discreetly if this is a concern for you. However, there are LED lights on both cameras, which may call attention to them.","The BlackVue DR650S-2CH dash cam offers high-definition video capture for the front and rear of your vehicle. Multiple recording modes let you customize the camera&#39;s output, and storage up to a 64GB SD card allow you to keep a large amount of videos. With its small dimensions, the dash cam can also be discreet."]},"id":"e6d04a64-7ce7-4aa5-b0ca-92ddd7e9b2bb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63862","url":"/blackvue-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-31T21:36:37Z","datePublished":"2015-03-31T21:36:37Z","name":"BlackVue DR650S-2CH","synopsis":"The BlackVue DR650S-2CH dash cam comes with both an HD main front and HD rear camera, so you can capture what’s going on in front of and behind your car.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The BlackVue DR650S-2CH dash cam comes with both an HD main front and HD rear camera, so you can capture what’s going on in front of and behind your car.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-31T21:36:37Z","id":"i7FJ7CdwzTD7t33mytHAm9","meta":{"title":"BlackVue DR650GW-2CH Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The BlackVue DR650GW-2CH dash cam comes with front and rear HD cameras and multiple recording modes.
