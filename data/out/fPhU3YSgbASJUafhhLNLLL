Installation is easy – you just need to place the loop wire around the perimeter of your yard and staple it to the ground. You can also choose to have an expert installer come to your home to install the wire for you, though this adds about $300 to its price tag – $1,100 at the time of writing. While this may seem like an unnecessary expense, it’s worth considering to make sure it’s installed properly.","This <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">robot lawn mower</a> is fully programmable, so you can set it to mow at specific times and cutting heights, as well as in zones in your yard. It can handle a .25-acre lawns, which is good enough for small to average-size lots. However, other models we reviewed can handle up to one-third of an acre or more.","Like most robot lawn mowers, the ROB 1000 mows in a random pattern to avoid creating track lines in your grass. This may seem like it would produce uneven results, but it actually delivers a surprisingly smooth and consistent grass level. This is because it’s meant to mow every day so it doesn’t miss any part of your lawn. The ROB 1000 can handle inclines and hills fairly well, with a maximum gradient capacity of 25 degrees.","When the ROB 1000 runs low on battery power, it automatically returns to its charging station. It takes about 50 minutes to fully recharge, which is in line with most of the other models we reviewed. And while it’s good, it’s certainly not exceptional.","This robot lawn mower is extremely quiet. It only makes about 57 decibels of sound while it mows, which is quieter than most average conversations. This makes it the quietest mower we reviewed. For comparison, our top pick, the <a href=\"/husqvarna-review\">Husqvarna Automower 315</a>, produces 65 decibels of noise.","It also includes standard theft-prevention and safety features. For example, if someone takes it outside its operating area, a loud alarm sounds and it shuts off. There is also a time lock that keeps it from running during certain times a day. In addition, when you lift it off the ground or it tilts too far, the mower automatically shuts down. After it shuts down, you must use your PIN code to reactivate it."]},"id":"119b2b53-08a5-4117-8c11-7d7530dc62ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4a17ae96-1beb-45e6-b4c7-140846d2daf3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MuCulloch ROB 1000 is worth considering as you shop for a robotic lawn mower.
