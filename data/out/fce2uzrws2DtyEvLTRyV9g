Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Spongebob Underwater <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">Digital Camera</a> is a simple camera that comes with a waterproof housing for underwater use. As an inexpensive option, it lacks many of the features we found in more expensive competitors. Yet for kids who just want to be able to capture their adventures in the pool or local water park, it’s a good option.","The first things that kids in our test group noticed about the Spongebob Underwater Digital Camera is that its screen isn&#39;t capable of displaying previews, capturing images or doing anything other than displaying the current shot count. This means that rather than offering games, editing or other fun features, this camera&#39;s sole purpose is capturing images.","Unfortunately, the camera doesn&#39;t even fulfil this singular purpose very well. With a 0.3-megapixel resolution, images have very little detail and are rarely visually appealing. On the bright side, it&#39;s the ability to take these pictures underwater that kids will enjoy.","Even if the images are smudgy, blurry or lacking in detail, they&#39;re still underwater, and that&#39;s something most digital cameras for kids can&#39;t boast. Furthermore, its waterproof housing protects it from dirt, sand or short falls. This reinforcement is important because otherwise the camera is pretty vulnerable.","With any product for kids, ease of use is an inherent concern. Before a child can have fun with a toy, he or she must first figure out how to use it. But with just two buttons and a small monochrome LCD, this kids camera isn&#39;t exactly knocking it out of the park. Thanks to an unintuitive menu system, navigating the menus, deleting images and changing settings is difficult. To make matters worse, kids can&#39;t review images in-camera, making it impossible to safely free up space by deleting unwanted images. A relatively small capacity of 154 images further exacerbates this issue."]},"id":"218ffdb8-65db-44df-b850-3a559864d6d3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6566b517-3f0f-4f15-bb26-b9ceca986bc6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Spongebob Underwater Digital Camera isn&#39;t impressively durable, doesn&#39;t have any games and sports a lackluster camera with no preview screen.
