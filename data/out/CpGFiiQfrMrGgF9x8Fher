It has a small footprint with a large build-plate and an intuitive interface, and it prints via Wi-Fi.

It’s less expensive than other FFF 3D printers, but it also has a built-in computer, slicer and 3D scanner, which is unheard of at its price point. The AIO Robotics 3D printer isn’t large and doesn’t produce high-quality models, but it gives you lots of features and flexibility for a significantly lower sticker price.","The most beginner-friendly 3D printer is the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/makerbot-replicator-plus,review-3979.html\">Makerbot Replicator+.</a> This easy machine requires minimal setup and has a navigation screen, and it reliably produces good results. For more advanced users, the machine’s onboard camera and Makerbot software accelerate creativity and control.","Not all 3D printers work the same. All the models we tested are FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) machines, which means they print with plastic. This type of machine is the easiest and cheapest way to break into 3D printing for most novice to intermediate users. "]},"id":"c1fc5e9c-8b37-4303-8df0-aa39574a8739","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/q5Hya6Duc4Vy7TBQHCx2To.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/ttr/comparison/1032/4%20Ultimaker%203.JPG","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5Hya6Duc4Vy7TBQHCx2To.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"q5Hya6Duc4Vy7TBQHCx2To","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5Hya6Duc4Vy7TBQHCx2To.jpg","alt":""},"id":"0a10d566-db72-4af7-95e6-8ce3b7fdaa4b","type":"image"},{"data":{"text":"<strong>How We Tested 3D Printers </strong>"},"id":"53f43c59-84cb-4306-afc6-59afc4ed9e61","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We used two models to test all the 3D printers in our lab.

Comparing all the models together helped our team find the best surfaces and edges. The Ultimaker 3 3D printer and the Makerbot Replicator+ were the best at everyday print jobs just like this.","<strong>Stress Test </strong>","When you dive deeper into 3D printing, you find more and more complicated pieces to create. Our stress test evaluated how well each printer handles difficult models.

Think of a 3D printer as a smart glue gun machine. Software slices a model into hundreds of layers, tells the printer where and how thick to lay the layers, and shifts upward until the top layer is complete. There are many types of 3D printers. Some print with lasers, and others have stationary beds or a moving axis and other design elements.","The quality of 3D-printed models is similar to that of those made using plastic molding, which produces cheap toys that have an awkward seam and slightly off-kilter paint jobs. 3D printers produce pieces that are far more solid and accurate, but they do sacrifice the smooth surface of a one- or two-piece plastic component. The real benefits of having a 3D printer are the customization opportunities and educational advantages of modeling and engineering your own objects."]},"id":"d0fc7d7c-3c87-4d20-aa51-23ac0b87f955","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/LtsChjf24JGTuBiJ9oykaF.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/ttr/comparison/1032/IMG_6904.JPG","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtsChjf24JGTuBiJ9oykaF.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"LtsChjf24JGTuBiJ9oykaF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtsChjf24JGTuBiJ9oykaF.jpg","alt":""},"id":"6f3a1dca-482e-407b-8339-14de85ef5aaa","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Cost of 3D Printing</strong>","When you buy an inkjet printer, it’s not the cost of the machine that’s prohibitive, it’s the cost of the ink over time. Similarly, 3D printer filament can be super expensive over the life of your printer. Choosing a printer that accepts universal filament or whose manufacturers sells cheaper filament can keep future costs low. A 1 kg filament spool can range from $20 to over $100 – this makes about 400 regular-size chess pieces. Also consider how often you have to replace cartridges and how many colors you want to use. If all your projects require painting, choose a cheaper white or tan filament as opposed to a fancy metallic or glow-in-the-dark variety.","If cost isn’t a factor for you, consider printing with materials other than the standard PLA or ABS. PET and TPE are flexible materials perfect for toys and phone cases. Materials like PETG are super durable, so you can print mechanical parts. There are also copper-, wood- and metal-like filaments for elegant printing. While these filament cartridges are more expensive, it could still be cheaper to purchase a 3D printer, the filament and the model file than it is to custom order models individually."]},"id":"125a690c-ab98-4ef8-b76f-d3875963a7ab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8e896019-0630-451c-902f-811bc9c226fb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M66TXYD/?&tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|58244[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Ultimaker 3</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7474372-12612265?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tigerdirect.com%2Fapplications%2Fsearchtools%2Fitem-details.asp%3FEdpNo%3D5094041&cjsku=40434936\">Airwolf 3D AXIOM</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DLU3M3M/?tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|59734[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Lulzbot TAZ 6</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LTIA9Y8/?&tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|56084[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Makerbot Replicator+</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FXBFP24/?tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|68663[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">AIO Robotics</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015ZHVLXC/?tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|60973[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cubify CubePro</a>","<a href=\"https://store.typeamachines.com/collections/3d-printers-new/products/series-1-pro?hsCtaTracking=a13975cd-34a7-401c-9a1e-3cd678ab94fb%7C8cc5cd25-e8c9-4185-833c-21fe9ce50c0d\">Type A Series 1 Pro</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S54E1AI/?&tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|65867[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Lulzbot Mini</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PUXJWTM/?&tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|65865[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">CEL Robox</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OVI3QLW/?&tag=ttr_3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1032[art|NA[pid|65866[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">DeltaMaker</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"db17d50b-1d13-43e6-9e79-0633452f574e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1032","url":"/best-3d-printers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"bethany-gordon","url":"/author/bethany-gordon","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Bethany Gordon","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"tegXFQJXWkzcKPbfwtRhn7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-07T15:41:34Z","datePublished":"2017-04-18T22:23:33Z","name":"3D Printers","synopsis":"Use a 3D printer to create completely unique 3D models for your home or business.
