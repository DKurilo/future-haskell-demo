Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security Complete covers five devices with one license, and you can use the program on any combination of PCs, Macs, and Apple or Android smartphones and tablets. Although Webroot doesn’t consistently choose to participate in independent lab evaluations that test malware detection abilities, computer performance loss and usability, when it does, it scores well.","SecureAnywhere Internet Security Complete detects malware on both Windows and Mac computers. This <a href=\"/best-computer-protection-software\">computer protection software</a> also has an antiphishing feature that protects your usernames, passwords, financial data and other important information. In addition, the program includes a personal firewall for each operating system as well as safe browsing tools, which remove adware, bots and cookies.","The Mac and Windows components also have identity theft protection features that shield your personal information online and a password manager that prevents people from swiping your login credentials on email, banking and online shopping sites. You can use the computer protection program’s system optimizer to clear your computer’s cache, delete unused files and search for outdated software to make your system run faster and secure weak points where hackers and other threats can sneak in.","The Windows module comes with a gamer mode, so you can watch movies or play games on your computer without being interrupted by notifications. Webroot also includes a Windows registry cleaner that removes unwanted registry keys that are left behind when you get rid of applications. Along with these features, this component has a file shredder that destroys deleted files so they can’t be retrieved, and the software can detect malware on USB thumb drives and other removable media when you plug them into your PC.","Although SecureAnywhere has a number of helpful Windows protections and features, it’s missing some important ones its competitors offer. For instance, it doesn’t have a rescue mode you can use to restore files while rebooting an infected computer, parental controls to protect your children online or a secure file vault.  If these are tools you need, consider <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Security</a> that include additional protection tools.","Webroot&#39;s Android module includes an application advisor that monitors risky apps as well as antitheft features, antiphishing tools and call blocking. However, the iOS module only has antiphishing tools, without the other important features.","SecureAnywhere Internet Security Complete’s useful software management dashboard shows the status of your installations on PCs, Macs and Android devices; however, it doesn’t show iOS devices. You can use this online portal to control features such as your online backup account and antitheft tools – most all-in-one internet security programs only let you manage your subscriptions and antitheft features from the dashboard. You can also scan your Macs and PCs for potential issues from the dashboard, though you have to start scans on your smartphone and tablet on the devices themselves.","Webroot provides good customer service, and you can contact the company through online chat or email if you encounter problems or have questions. Phone support is available from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. This is certainly helpful, but less so than the 24/7 phone support some of Webroot’s competitors offer."]},"id":"7e22539b-8cf7-46a1-8b98-36ac83f4dc6c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5fdf42a5-7736-45c0-9346-92c6b386ea89","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security Complete has some useful features and is adequate for individuals and families who own a variety of devices that run different operating systems.
