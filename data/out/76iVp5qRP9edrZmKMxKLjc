Not a large list, but it does cover the basics. However, we would have liked the ability to convert VOB (DVD) and FLV (Flash) files.","Softpepper Video Converter outputs to WMV, AVI,MPEG, MP4, MOV (for iPod only), RM and 3GP (for cell phones.) The list of outputs also includes selections for iPod and PSP; however, if you are planning to convert to other media players you have to go into the advanced settings and adjust the video dimensions manually.","Some additional features include the ability to extract audio, save frames of your video as pictures, and manually adjust features like codecs and bitrates. Unfortuantly, you can not set start and stop times, merge multiple files into one or add effects.","As a whole Softpepper Video Converter is a average, run-of-the-mill video converter except it’s help and support is nonexistent. There is no in-program guide, our emails were never answered and the FAQ section online is one question regarding the software’s system requirements. Has one of these items been present the Softpepper Video Converter would have appeared much higher in our review.","For a program with a similar interface, with more features, compatibility and responsive help please read our review on <u>Movavi.</u>"," "]},"id":"fad56fd8-4bd0-4f72-b4b6-58dfb1f8cfcb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2514","url":"/softpepper-video-converter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
