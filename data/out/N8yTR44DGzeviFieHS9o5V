You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Despite the claim by Sears Holdings Newsroom that Kenmore is the number one player in the appliance industry and is ranked one or two in every major appliance category, the Kenmore 4472 is an excellent <a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">portable washing machines</a>. As the second most expensive portable washer in our lineup, you may be paying more for the Kenmore name than for the machine itself.","The Kenmore 4472 is a sturdy, 148-pound workhorse. It&#39;s made of painted steel with a stainless steel wash basket that you can load with up to 2.1 cubic feet of laundry. It is a bit cumbersome to move around because on the bottom. If you permanently install this washer, the absence of casters is not a problem. If you do need to move it, use the inset handles on either side of the cabinet.","This washer is great for those who are not too fussy about their laundry. Four automatic cycles get the job done. Select which is best for your load from Heavy Duty, Normal, Permanent Press and Hand-Wash. Heavy Duty washes clothes for 18 minutes and is for grimy items, while Hand-Wash washes gently for only six minutes and is best for loosely knit items and lingerie. If these four cycles are all you need to choose from to get your laundry done, this portable washing machine is right up your alley.","This portable washer has no option for adding an extra spin, rinse or soak cycle. The only available cycles are those that are pre-programmed. A removable lint filter in the tub catches lint before it makes its way to your sink drain to cause potential clogs. You can select your water level – medium or high – based on the size of your load of laundry.","The digital control panel of the Kenmore 4472 is small and simple. Light-up circles indicate which cycle and water level you have selected. The washer does not have an LED display, a cycle-countdown timer or an end-of-cycle signal.","When using liquid detergent in the Kenmore portable washing machine, you must pour it in the bottom of the tub. However, if you use powdered detergent or powdered color-safe bleach, you can add it to the detergent tray. If you choose, add liquid chlorine bleach to the bleach dispenser for automatic distribution during the wash cycle. You can add to the dispenser at the top of the agitator so you don&#39;t have to babysit your machine and add it manually at the appropriate time.","If you own an electric water heater, the Kenmore 4472 costs approximately $41 per year to run. If you own a natural gas water heater, the cost of running the portable washing machine drops to about $24 per year.","Customer support information for Kenmore through Sears is available online. Trying to find the correct Kenmore customer support representative is a bit of a maze, however. Once you get through to the correct department, the representatives are well informed about the products and are eager to help."]},"id":"3e2cfc26-2fe0-4706-b6b6-7abde939c6b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aff05f5a-b3b1-4635-8241-58bd8d97864e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 4472 portable washing machine is inflexible because it lacks cycle customization options and casters, which means decreased mobility.
