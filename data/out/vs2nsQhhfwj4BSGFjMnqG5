The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-vacuum-food-sealers\">Vacuum Food Sealers</a> here.</em>","The Seal-a-Meal Vacuum Sealer VS107 is a completely hands-free vacuum food sealer that has a sleek, space-saving and compact design. This sealer model is intended for basic food sealing use, which makes it easy to use for beginners.","Like many other sealers, the Seal-a-Meal Vacuum Sealer removes air from bags of food, and then uses a heat seal to keep food fresh. You can use this food sealing model to save time, money and space in your fridge or pantry.","To seal fresh food and preserve valuable nutrients, you simply need to place your bagged food into the sealer’s drip tray and then press on both sides until the hands-free indicator lights up. The hands-free and sealing indicator light is one of this model’s primary features, making the sealing process easy and smooth. The machine will then automatically complete the sealing, and the indicator light will turn off. You can cancel the sealing process at any time by pressing the “open/cancel” release button, which raises the lid and releases the vacuum-sealed bag.","The Seal-a-Meal Vacuum Sealer includes other features that contribute to its usability. A removable drip tray catches food and liquid that might drip out during use, ensuring mess-free sealing. This sealer comes treated with Microban Antimicrobial Protection to prevent bacteria from ruining your sealer. In addition to the vacuum food sealer, you also receive starter bags and a user manual. This sealer comes with an accessory port.","This machine is just over five pounds. Because this Seal-a-Meal model is lightweight and compact, it’s also easy to store, which can be a bonus if you’re working with limited space. This product comes with a one-year limited warranty.","Most complaints about this model center on the strength of the machine for sealing moist foods.  Users say that this works best when the food is completely dry. However, many users have complimented the suction, based on its small size and price tag. The Seal-a-Meal Vacuum Sealer VS107 is one of the more inexpensive sealers, but is a good vacuum food sealer for the price, especially with its compact design."]},"id":"e24d0fb9-6cce-48d4-bf23-abf89b3a74be","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61771","url":"/seal-a-meal-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-22T16:57:09Z","datePublished":"2014-12-22T16:57:09Z","name":"Seal-a-Meal VS107","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-22T16:57:09Z","id":"vs2nsQhhfwj4BSGFjMnqG5","meta":{"title":"Seal-a-Meal VS107 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"For a vacuum food sealer for a beginner that is compact and powerful, the Seal-a-Meal Vacuum Sealer VS107 is a good model.
