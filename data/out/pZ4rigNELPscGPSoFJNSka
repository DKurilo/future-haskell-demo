You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","National Roadside Assistance is a roadside assistance service known for providing excellent coverage in Canada and the entire U.S. Their 24- hour dispatch center will assist with any emergency you encounter on the road, and a fully-loaded personal concierge service is included with each membership– in fact, this is one of the most impressive concierge services you’ll find with any auto club. From their versatile family plan to discount auto rentals, National Roadside Assistance is a fine additional to our <a href=\"/best-roadside-assistance-services\">roadside assistance</a> review.","National Roadside Assistance offers one main plan, which they call their “Basic Plan.” This plan covers you, the primary member, as well as an additional adult household member. They also allow dependent children between the ages of 16 to 23 to be added to  the plan as an Associate Member. Vehicles eligible for coverage include cars, motorcycles and small trucks under one ton. National Roadside Assistance does not provide an on-time guarantee, nor do they guarantee their dispatch center will always be able to find help. In a situation where they cannot find assistance, they will reimburse you up to $80 for the cost of your service.","Your National Roadside Assistance membership ensures you’ll have coverage for a range of roadside services. They provide battery jumps, as well as any minor roadside adjustments needed to get your car started. They also provide flat tire services, fuel delivery and extrication (in case your car gets stuck in the mud or snow). They will reimburse up to 30 minutes of winching, and the member pays for any further extrication services past the time limit. They also provide towing services, with a reimbursement cap of 15 miles.","National Roadside Assistance includes exciting extras with their membership that makes them a memorable service. You receive discounts on auto rentals with all the major companies. They also offer hotel discounts of up to 50% off published room rates in the U.S. and Canada. Using your member ID, you can also log in to MyHotelSolutions.net, where you can speak with a hotel booking expert for assistance with finding the perfect hotel room.","While they may not provide RV roadside assistance, National Roadside Assistance does provide easy bookings for motor home holidays. They offer 10% off time and mileage charges when you rent an RV with Cruise American or Cruise Canada. Cruise America is a popular RV rental and sales company that offers a huge selection of RVs and vacation ideas.","The personal concierge service included with a National Roadside Assistance membership can’t be beat. They provide recovery services, cash transfers, medical emergencies services, emergency interpretation, international dining recommendations, golf course information, location information, bookings, gift delivery and their “Home from Home” service, where they provide up-to-the-minute global news headlines and local sports news information from your hometown.","If you have any questions for National Roadside Service, you can contact them through a toll-free phone number. Representatives are available during regular business hours, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m, Eastern Standard Time. An email address is also listed as a contact option, as well as three separate post addresses. There is also a link to FAQs at the top of their main page."]},"id":"c68f6884-f434-44e6-a1e6-4ed616de7780","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"80b98bf8-2b63-4a1a-be2f-71697165cd3d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["National Roadside Assistance is a great option to consider, particularly if you live or travel in Canada, or if you’re a fan of full featured personal concierge services that can assist with just about anything.
