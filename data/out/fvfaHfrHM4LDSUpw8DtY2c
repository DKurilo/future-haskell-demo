It provides many of the features you find on similar products such as a control-lock option, power-boost capabilities, a bridge element and indicator lights to alert you to a hot surface. However, there are a few areas where we would like to see improvements, such as a wider range of power and a multi-burner timer.","The cooking capabilities are average. There are four burners on this product that range in power from 1,400 watts to 3,150 watts. This range provides enough power to easily simmer foods or boil water, but it is not as powerful as many of the cooktops on our lineup. The best products offer up to 3,700 watts, which can save you time in the kitchen. There is a power boost capability on three of the productâ€™s burners, but you can&#39;t use it on all three heating elements at once.","There are four burners featured on this cooktop, with the largest being 10.5 inches in diameter. There is also a bridge element, which means that you can sync two heating elements together to create one large element that works well for pans such as griddles.","The Wolf CI304C/B boasts a touch display that allows you to easily adjust the settings and temperatures of the burners. On the control panel, you&#39;ll find indicators that alert you when the cooktop is activated as well as other notifications. For example, a symbol will display on the control panel when a burner is turned on, and another symbol will appear to indicate a hot surface. This unit also comes with a control lock to ensure that no heating elements are turned on without your consent. If you have not used the control panel for 10 minutes, the controls automatically lock.","Additionally, this cooktop comes with a timer, but unfortunately, it&#39;s a basic kitchen timer. We would like to see a multi-burner timer, which allows you to set a timer for each individual burner. Besides a multi-burner timer, the best cooktops also automatically shut off the burner when the timer is done. This is an excellent safety feature and helps prevent food from burning in the event some unforeseen event momentarily takes your attention away from the stove.","One of the standout features of this induction cooktop is its warranty, which covers parts and labor for two years. This is one of the longest warranties for induction cooktops."]},"id":"fb97bc24-d14e-454e-99b9-b86f65b4dbf7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0e3f9dce-e97d-4ee8-9c64-d7571e1c21e2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Wolf CI304C/B offers some advantages, including a long warranty and a bridge element that allows you to sync two burners together.
