Unlike many other elliptical machines, this trainer has several different workout programs and resistance levels. As a result, you can vary your workouts substantially.","It is unlikely that you will become bored with the Diamondback 1260Ef Elliptical Trainer. This elliptical trainer offers 15 different workout programs and 20 resistance levels so you exercise at easy and hard levels, with all sorts of levels in between. The trainer’s classic program package includes manual, random cross, interval, hill climb and sprint. You can choose among the other programs that come with the machine, which include five heart-rate interactive programs: target, interval, fat burner, hill and cardio.","You also get three cross-training programs: glute burner, quad builder and total trainer. In addition, there are two custom programs. This elliptical provides built-in warm-up and cool- down functions. Another worthwhile benefit is this elliptical bicycle&#39;s electronic incline motor that will raise or lower the machine, changing the intensity of your workout.","You can check your heart rate in two different ways. You can use a heart-rate receiver that employs a chest strap, or you can grasp the sensors on the machine’s stationery handlebars. With either approach, you can track your heart rate on the display monitor.","You can see what you are doing on the machine’s green LED console display. Among other things, you can track the time you&#39;ve spent exercising, the intensity level, the incline, calories you&#39;ve burned, your speed, your pulse and the distance you&#39;ve traveled.","The Diamondback 1260Ef Elliptical Trainer is not big on fancy extras and does not come with a cooling fan, music plug-ins or speakers. However, you get a handy reading rack so you can pass the time you spend exercising by reading books, magazines or whatever you choose. You also get the convenience of the machine’s quick-start option.","The Diamondback 1260Ef Elliptical has a good warranty package. You get a lifetime warranty on the machine’s frame, a five-year warranty on the mechanical and electronic parts, a 90-day warranty on wear items and a one-year warranty on labor.","On the company&#39;s website is a FAQs section and user manuals. Diamondback also has phone contact and email support options if you run into difficulties or have questions that cannot be answered by checking the website."]},"id":"57cd94eb-8e85-4c26-8d76-5d5f0372b4b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"33d6644f-0f66-49f0-aed8-ecb9fd75a30d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For a comfortable workout that you can adjust or customize, the Diamondback 1260Ef Elliptical Trainer has the features and programs that fitness enthusiasts desire.
