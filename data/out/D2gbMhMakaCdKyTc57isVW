It has five 4-inch paper cone drivers that are powered by a 6-channel 450-watt amplifier. All the components are housed in an attractive black enclosure with a side-firing bass reflex port that delivers surprisingly impactful bass. This sound bar doesn’t come packaged with a subwoofer, but our reviewers didn’t feel the bar was lacking in bass compared to other products, like the <a href=\"/sony-soundbar-review\">Sony HT-CT390</a> and <a href=\"/vizio-soundbar-review\">Vizio SB3621</a>, that have larger wireless subwoofers. Focal makes a subwoofer specifically designed to complement the Dimension sound bar if you want to add theater-quality bass to the stunningly accurate front and center channels. There’s also a subwoofer output that’s compatible with any amplified home subwoofer.","We tested audio performance by playing a two-minute movie clip through each sound bar we reviewed. The Dimension scored among the best in our test group for both dialogue clarity and surround simulation. Our two-minute action movie clip included a scene with multiple vehicles quickly dodging from one side of the screen to the other, and the Dimension did a wonderful job of setting a wide sound stage with accurate panning that made our reviewers look around the room for other surround speakers. The dialogue is placed perfectly in front of crisp and clear high-frequency effects.","This sound bar has a great selection of connectivity options. There are two HDMI ports on the back panel alongside an optical input and 3.5 mm auxiliary input. The sound bar automatically powers up when you turn on the TV if you connect it via the HDMI port. You control volume and input selection with the durable remote control, or with the touch-sensitive control panel on the front of the sound bar that looks like a control surface from a Star Trek spaceship. To activate the control panel, wave your hand in front of it. When you’re done changing settings, the modern-looking text disappears behind the gloss-black panel. There are also switches on the back panel to customize the audio attributes to your room size and mounting position.","The Dimension is a bit taller than most sound bars we tested. It comes with a sturdy wall-mount bracket and slip-resistant rubber feet if you prefer to place it on an entertainment center.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Focal Dimension delivers spectacularly accurate dialogue through a wide and detailed sound stage. The connectivity options are among the best in our test group, and the enclosure looks great alongside modern entertainment room furniture. It’s a bit more expensive than most sound bars we tested, but if you have audiophile-level expectations for a small- or medium-size entertainment room, this is a great option."]},"id":"05f83a94-e24d-4d42-88ed-665d8a9088b9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70268","url":"/focal-dimension-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-02T22:17:29Z","datePublished":"2018-10-02T22:17:29Z","name":"Focal Dimension","synopsis":"The Focal Dimension sound bar utilizes advanced amplifier and speaker technology to deliver a wide and detailed sound stage.
