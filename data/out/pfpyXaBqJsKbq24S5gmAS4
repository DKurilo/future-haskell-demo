Its sensors guide it back and forth across small and large rooms alike, and it transitions well from hard flooring to low-pile carpeting. However, it is not suitable for carpets over 1 inch tall, because it does not have an automatic height adjustment feature.","This robot vacuum cleaner is not equipped with a HEPA filter, which is a disappointment, since HEPA filters offer exceptional filtration to remove allergens. However, it still boasts powerful suction and will remove embedded dirt and debris.","This robotic vacuum cleaner runs on rechargeable batteries. You can expect one hour of operating time per charge. An indicator light lets you know when the batteries run low. If the battery goes dead, the vacuum just stops. To recharge it, you just plug it into an outlet. Unlike the best robot vacuums, this device does not have its own charging base that it can automatically return to when it needs more juice.","The iTouchless does not allow you to schedule automatic cleaning, so you can&#39;t set it to run without your input. It does come with a remote control, though, which makes it easy to operate. You can operate it without having to bend down to use the controls.","Although this cleaner has a built-in cliff sensor to keep it from falling down your stairs, it does not have virtual walls or boundary markers. That means you will need to close doors or use physical barriers to keep it from going places it shouldn&#39;t. It does have a safety feature that automatically shuts it off if it gets stuck, though. This helps prevent the motor from overheating, ensuring the long life of your cleaner.","Its flat profile of 3.4 inches allows it to go under your bed and couch. It measures 13.5 inches in diameter and weighs 7 pounds, so it is easy to lift and carry.","The iTouchless includes a one-year warranty. You can find email and telephone contact information on the company website in case you need customer assistance."]},"id":"292dd237-9f91-41c0-b937-db10cc963f82","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"041d3d26-f322-4064-89cd-ca40c2b9f009","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iTouchless Robotic Pro will clean your floors well.
