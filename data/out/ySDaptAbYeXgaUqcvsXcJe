The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-digital-photo-printing-services\">Digital Photo Printing Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","Although Costco Photo Center is a no-frills, no-fuss digital photo printing service, it gets the job done and gets it done right. Simple to use, this photo printing service allows you to create canvas-size prints, collage photo mugs, calendars, photo books and more that help you preserve those captured memories.","Note: In order to use the Costco Photo Center, you must have a Costco membership.","Costco is known for its wholesale goodies, not photo printing. This fact is made obvious by the photo gifts section. Many digital photo printing services that are dedicated to photo printing have a mile-long list of photo gifts you can create with your favorite images.","One place you can see Costco&#39;s buy-bigger mentality is in its photo sizes. You can print canvas prints, for example, up to 40 x 60 inches, which is huge! Canvas prints and handbags are two of our favorite photo gifts that this digital photo printing center offers because they are true statement pieces. For basic prints, you are able to print your images from wallet sizes up to 20 x 30 inches, which is a fantastic range.","We were impressed with the in-depth editing tools Costco provides. The majority of the other digital printing services offer a crop tool, and that&#39;s it. The Costco Photo Center, however, has a gamut of tools that allow you to adjust the contrast and brightness of a photo, flip or rotate the image and remove red eye. You can also add borders to your images and change the tint.","Uploading new photos is a simple process. With the Costco Photo Center, you are able send photos from your mobile phone – transferring them from your phone to your personal Costco photo printing account, which will save space on your phone. You can also email photos to your digital photo printing account as attachments or upload images straight from your computer or media source. When you upload photos, you can choose to filter them into a new album or use one of your existing albums.","There is a variety of upload choices, but we wish Costco gave you the added bonus of being able to upload photos from your Facebook account, and that it allowed people other than Costco card carriers to use its services.","The Costco Photo Center offers generic customer service options, such as a FAQs section, technical support telephone number and a customer support form. If you have a general question about a general procedure, the FAQs section may be perfect to meet your needs. We were disappointed that there are no video tutorials or live chat support available."]},"id":"ca040d4c-8781-4420-a8b2-459846c525f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"58a099fc-85ab-4089-8c4f-b84f944501e9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Costco Photo Center could have been a super generic digital photo printing service, as the company&#39;s focus is with its other offerings.

The quality of the prints could have been better, but we were still pleased with the vibrant colors in our sunset picture. The excessive cropping at the bottom of our aerial picture was not ideal, however, so we suggest that you specify your cropped areas."]},"id":"3543308c-ff59-4e74-b1c1-67777e6f93c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1319","url":"/costco-photo-center-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-07-13T16:02:03Z","name":"Costco Photo Center","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":59,"verdict":"This digital photo printing service is simple to use and has great editing tools.","pros":["Costco Photo Center has an easy-to-use interface and a simple ordering process."],"cons":["Only Costco members are allowed to use the site."]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"ySDaptAbYeXgaUqcvsXcJe","meta":{"title":"Costco Photo Center Review - Quality, Features, Shipping","description":"Find out how Costco Photo Center ranks against the other services in the digital photo printing category."},"products":[{"slug":"costco-photo-center","url":"/product/costco-photo-center","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","name":"Costco Photo Center","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","id":"57WEZtudUqhhpDArNQ3Xvh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/84Qiw93KdssNcZfPs68GG5.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","mimeType":"","name":"1302-costco-photo-center-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/1302-costco-photo-center-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","id":"84Qiw93KdssNcZfPs68GG5","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/84Qiw93KdssNcZfPs68GG5.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Costco Photo Center Review - Quality, Features, Shipping","description":"Find out how Costco Photo Center ranks against the other services in the digital photo printing category."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/84Qiw93KdssNcZfPs68GG5.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","mimeType":"","name":"1302-costco-photo-center-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/1302-costco-photo-center-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","id":"84Qiw93KdssNcZfPs68GG5","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/84Qiw93KdssNcZfPs68GG5.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Costco Photo Center Review - Quality, Features, Shipping","description":"Find out how Costco Photo Center ranks against the other services in the digital photo printing category."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/costco-photo-center-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"photo-printing","url":"/hobbies/photo-printing","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","name":"Photo Printing","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:57:01Z","id":"z8PD3S7mzqALyx6pv6h2Pi","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
