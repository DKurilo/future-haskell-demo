You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Incandescent light bulbs are slowly phasing out, thanks to government regulations, and that&#39;s not a bad thing. The G7 Power Incline <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">LED light bulb</a> can help you save money and energy by converting your home to a well-lit, eco-friendly domain.","One of the greatest benefits to LED light bulb technology is how long they last compared to traditional incandescent light bulbs. The G7 Power Incline LED bulb lasts up to nearly 23 years, if you use the bulb an average of three hours a day, and it only costs about $1.32 per year to run.","While it may seem too good to be true, the best LED bulbs use less power and produce light equivalent to or better than your old incandescent lights. The G7 Power Incline LED does an excellent job saving you money and power while providing light comparable to a 60-watt incandescent bulb. In addition to being eco-friendly, there are no hazardous materials, such as mercury, to worry about with the G7 Power Incline LED bulb. This makes it easier on the environment as well as for you to recycle the bulbs.","The G7 Power Incline light bulb provides omnidirectional light. Not only does light reach all corners, but this bulb is designed to give you consistent lighting. Many LED lights place the LEDs inside the bulb in patterns that leave a black shadowed area at the top of the bulb, or place them on a straight line. This makes it hard for these bulbs to provide consistent light quality to the whole room. The G7 Power Incline LED has even placement so there is no area lacking for light projection in the bulb.","While the G7 bulb provides excellent light, it is not designed for use with outdoor fixtures. However, the G7 is perfect for your lamps, ceiling fixtures and other indoor light sockets. The bulb is designed to fit in standard light bulb bases so you don&#39;t have to worry if these bulbs are the wrong size when replacing your current ones.","The Power Incline comes on immediately when you flip the switch, just like an incandescent bulb. This helps you see when you need to, instead of having to wait for the bulb to warm up like a CFL light bulb. The G7 bulb is dimmable down to a 10 percent output.","G7 Power backs up its LED bulbs with a 10-year warranty. 10 years is much higher than the average warranty provided by other LED bulb manufacturers and gives you confidence that you don&#39;t have to worry about receiving support if you have to replace a defective light bulb after a few years.","If you have questions about your G7 Power Incline LED bulb, you can contact the G7 Power service department by email or by phone if you prefer to speak to someone in person. The G7 Power website maintains a blog, as well as a learning page with links to articles explaining how LED technology works."]},"id":"12328364-6e71-4b3b-92b8-b684d47e54a0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Bulb Characteristics"},"id":"23b0d8e3-e290-4a9f-9021-d003968e02cb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" "," "]},"id":"686b6925-486d-4e28-bdc6-3bdf359fb98c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"53ec13f9-7281-4eac-83aa-f53e4feb245e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The G7 Power Incline LED light bulb is one of the best LED lights you can choose.
