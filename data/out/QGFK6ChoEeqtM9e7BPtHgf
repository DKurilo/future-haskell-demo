Nettops are desktop computers that have an unusually small form factor. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180 is one such tiny powerhouse that promises all the functionality of a full-sized <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">multimedia computer</a>. Let&#39;s see how the Q180 meets the challenge.","<strong>Tiny, Versatile and Connected</strong>","Our initial reaction upon unpacking the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180 was &#34;how much computing power can really be packed into such a diminutive box?&#34; The unit measures about 7.5 inches wide by just more than 6 inches wide. Our test unit was equipped with the optional DVD player/recorder that piggybacks on the computer, making the total thickness about 1.75 inches. Without that optical drive, the computer&#39;s thickness measures just half that. The assembly feels substantial, and the fit and finish are excellent. It&#39;s also attractive, with a glossy black top and brushed aluminum all around. You can place the unit flat on a desk or mount it upright on the included stand. A VESA mount allows you to connect the component to the back of a monitor or TV.","An intriguing t-shaped remote control is included. It combines the features of a keyboard, mouse and audio/video controller in one unique, handheld accessory. Its layout isn&#39;t exactly that of a standard keyboard, but it&#39;s close. Because of its size, it wouldn&#39;t be practical for heavy-duty typing, but it is perfectly adequate for web browsing and composing emails. The top-row keys are dedicated controls such as play, stop, pause, fast forward and similarly familiar media functions. A responsive, round track-pad provides mouse functionality, and we adapted to using it quickly."]},"id":"b968ffb6-257c-49ce-8bbb-800956266b51","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Ar9sHfHXj2QQwe8vyEBcni.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"mouse. The keyboard is basic, but we found that it works better than expected upon initial examination.

The back includes four USB 2.0 ports, HDMI and VGA outputs, a gigabit ethernet connection and an S/PDIF digital audio output. Fortunately, the front panel adds two USB 3.0 ports because all four rear connections are occupied in the computer&#39;s typical setup: one for the optical drive via USB jumper, one each for the mouse and keyboard, and finally, one for the wireless remote control dongle. The front panel also offers an 8-in-1 card reader and headphone and mic jacks.

A 750GB HDD or a 128GB SSD are available options.","Ultimately, does the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180 live up to expectations? To a large extent, yes. However, opting for the end-of-life Atom D2700 processor is a corner that shouldn&#39;t have been cut. If Lenovo would just update it with at least an Intel i5, this multimedia nettop would indeed be a mighty mini.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"c73e6c20-a9d1-49ec-8734-78a33799eb48","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7343","url":"/lenovo-ideacentre-q180-big-thing-small-package","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"mike-mcpeek","url":"/author/mike-mcpeek","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Mike McPeek","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"zHMn9cGyHw9eJCvSFXXYrJ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-29T17:29:12Z","datePublished":"2012-05-29T17:29:12Z","name":"Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180: Big Thing, Small Package","synopsis":"A hallmark of portable computing today is ever-smaller devices accomplishing greater and greater tasks.","review":{},"strapline":"A hallmark of portable computing today is ever-smaller devices accomplishing greater and greater tasks.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-05-29T18:22:36Z","id":"QGFK6ChoEeqtM9e7BPtHgf","meta":{"title":"Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180: Big Thing, Small Package","description":"The Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180 is among the best nettops available, but does it have what it takes to be a true contender among multimedia computers?"},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T21:00:34Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/2baz2gS63tf4wGW8ke9mF7.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:00:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"7343-lenovo-ideacentre-q180-big-thing-small-package.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/7343-lenovo-ideacentre-q180-big-thing-small-package.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:00:34Z","id":"2baz2gS63tf4wGW8ke9mF7","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2baz2gS63tf4wGW8ke9mF7.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180: Big Thing, Small Package","description":"The Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180 is among the best nettops available, but does it have what it takes to be a true contender among multimedia computers?"},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/2baz2gS63tf4wGW8ke9mF7.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:00:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"7343-lenovo-ideacentre-q180-big-thing-small-package.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/7343-lenovo-ideacentre-q180-big-thing-small-package.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:00:34Z","id":"2baz2gS63tf4wGW8ke9mF7","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2baz2gS63tf4wGW8ke9mF7.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180: Big Thing, Small Package","description":"The Lenovo IdeaCentre Q180 is among the best nettops available, but does it have what it takes to be a true contender among multimedia computers?"}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/lenovo-ideacentre-q180-big-thing-small-package","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:00:34Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:00:34Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
