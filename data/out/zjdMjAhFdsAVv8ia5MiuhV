You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","ADT is a leading name in home security, and it offers a basic <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-systems\">medical alert system</a> and service. The company includes a 24/7 medical monitoring service, a standard feature for all comparable medical alert systems. This type of service means that you or your family member using the system can call and get help from a live representative at any time, even at night or during holidays.","ADT’s Medical Alert Basic system costs $30, which is in line with the monthly cost of most basic medical alert systems. However, ADT doesn’t offer annual or quarterly payment options to bring the price down. The premium package, Medical Alert Plus, costs around $36, which is significantly lower than most premium medical alert systems.","ADT offers two alert systems you can choose from, based on the range you need and the hardware you prefer. The Medical Alert Basic unit is their standard unit with an optimal 300-foot range, which is on the low end for comparable medical alert systems. In our tests, it reached 700 feet outside and 200 feet inside. By comparison, <a href=\"/medical-guardian-review\">Medical Guardian</a> (our pick for best in-home landline system) reached 2,000 feet outside and 450 feet inside. Only <a href=\"/mobilehelp-review\">MobileHelp</a> had a shorter range, reaching just 350 feet outside and 130 feet inside. The range should cover most small homes, but it varies based on the material your house is built from and how many rooms and walls there are.","This unit requires a landline in order to send out calls to the ADT monitoring centers. In the event of an emergency where you use the button, the base station will take control of your phone line to send the call. Any of ADT&#39;s base stations can detect temperatures in case of a fire or other temperature-based emergency that can result in problems.","If you need a larger range, the company offers a package upgrade, the Medical Alert Plus. You don&#39;t need a landline in order to use this unit, so this is a great option for households without a landline. This unit also includes an optional fall-detection pendant, which can detect most falls and automatically send for help in case you can&#39;t.","Both systems automatically check themselves for any issues; if there are hardware problems, the units will send an alert to the monitoring center, which will then contact you to help troubleshoot the system. The emergency pendants are waterproof, so you can wear them during a shower in the bathroom, where there is a high risk of slipping and falling."]},"id":"503205db-ea6f-4a94-b28d-68ec5a862e5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1a3ca527-a472-4598-ab60-b8eaf2295d60","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ADT&#39;s medical alert systems have an average range for its base station and emergency alert pendant.
