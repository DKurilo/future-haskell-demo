It has performance sufficient to win a VB100 award from Virus Bulletin’s antimalware testing. Other independent tests show TrustPort’s performance to be adequate but not as good as some of its competitors. In terms of features, it has many more than the entry-level TrustPort Antivirus product but a few less than average for the product category. There is a premier internet security suite, TrustPort Total Protection, which has more features than TrustPort Internet Security.","Installation is straightforward. You can implement a basic or advanced installation. A system restart is necessary to complete it. TrustPort Internet Security features consist of antivirus protection that extends to threats that attempt to infiltrate via email or websites. It is possible to create a recovery system disk that will boot your system even if it shuts down due to malware infestation. There is also a spam filter to protect against uninvited mail nuisances. Parental controls are included, which allow you to create a safe internet experience for children. You can block unwanted web content according to several categories such as pornography and gambling. The parental lock feature is not just applicable to children; any user can create a profile that blocks selected categories. A proprietary firewall is also part of the suite, even though there is some debate about the usefulness of a proprietary firewall when the current Windows firewall is so effective. With the TrustPort personal firewall, you can monitor all connections between your PC and the internet. The firewall lets safe applications through. If it fails to recognize an application, you can decide whether to allow or block it."]},"id":"7614c667-4fca-4e7d-9281-42bfa271fb06","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"06bd57e7-3bf1-4259-8da8-5f9386fc420f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TrustPort Internet Security is not among our top 10 internet security products despite having objective third-party performance credentials in the form of a VB100 award from Virus Bulletin.
