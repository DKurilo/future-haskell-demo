And it is so much more than just your average optical character recognition software. This document scanner combines the best of both worlds into one fantastic machine. More than just scanning a single document at a time, the Neat Desk document scanner will scan multiple documents simultaneously at an optical resolution of 600 dpi. After the documents are stored on your computer, or wherever else you’d like to put them, the scanner’s software will help you organize and store those digital documents.","The Neat Desk digital filing system comes with very powerful and simple-to-use software that will automatically identify different characters on your documents. Whether the papers you scan are business cards, receipts or legal documents, this optical character recognition, or OCR, software will be able to recognize all the different characters. This is extremely useful because it will make the documents searchable. If you are looking for an expense or a certain client’s information, you can do a simple search and the software will quickly help you find the desired information.","When you’re using the Neat Desk digital filing system, you can import your documents to a variety of different file types and to a variety of different applications. The most basic import is the PDF file format. This is essentially taking a picture of the document and storing it on your computer. But unlike a simple picture, with these PDFs and the Neat Desk system, you’ll be able to search through all the documents. These file formats are relatively compact and won’t take up much of your computer hard drive space. You can also compress the documents into a zipped folder and email large amounts of data to clients, friends or family.","Another simple option is to use the Neat Desk to import documents or other information to a JPEG file format. This is a file format commonly associated with photos, and if you are scanning pictures, this is one of the best options. It will help you preserve picture quality, and it is compatible with most, if not all, photo editing software.","All of these file formats and options offered by Neat Desk are useful and nice. But the features that really make this document scanner stand out from the competition is the compatibility with all kinds of other file management applications.","For example, after scanning in a series of receipts, the OCR software can automatically connect your expenses with QuickBooks. All of your data will be entered automatically, saving you hours of time and headache. The document scanner will also automatically import data to TurboTax, which will make filing your taxes at the end of the year a snap. The document scanner can also help connect all your data and scanned documents with Microsoft Outlook. This is very handy for updating email addresses, phone numbers and calendar events. When it comes right down to it, having this document scanner will make your life simpler and help you stay connected. More than just a simple file backup, the scanner will help you stay connected."]},"id":"96e37f51-5d5a-4f1e-866a-4a3d477da869","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"8dc6fc54-3a9b-4bbe-908b-1e8b662362df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Neat Desk scanner is compatible with both Macs and Windows operating systems.

The 600 dpi optical resolution is very helpful in keeping quality images of all your documents and photos.","The document scanner can process 50 pages at a time. These pages can be of varied length, width and height. You can process receipts, tax records and any other document you might need, all at the same time. This document scanner works extremely well for business needs and also for personal records.
