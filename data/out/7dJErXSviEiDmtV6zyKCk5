For example, it is made of a natural titanium-infused ceramic coating that is free of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid), a chemical used in making non-stick surfaces, and PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), which is Teflon. Although no U.S. agency has stated these substances are toxic, some people prefer to avoid them. The manufacturer says the lining lasts eight times longer than other surfaces, and it won&#39;t peel or flake off. Another safety feature is a magnetic electrical cord that detaches if someone pulls on it or trips over it, which keeps the pot from tipping over and spilling its hot contents.
