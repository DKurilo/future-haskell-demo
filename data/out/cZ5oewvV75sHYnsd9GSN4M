You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","In our research of paternity <a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA tests</a>, we found that most tests offer the same features and are accredited by the same institutions. <a href=\"/paternity-depot-review\">Paternity Depot</a> matched the most expensive companies we researched and had the lowest price, while still advertising 99.99 percent accuracy for its tests. This is the best paternity test you can get because of its fast turnaround and low price.","This company offers both paternity and maternity tests, and you can also order a legally admissible chain of custody test for an additional $50. If you need to test people in two locations, you can ask Paternity Depot to send a split kit to two addresses. Once this company receives both samples, it will send you the results in five days or less, which is about average for this kind of test. If you need results faster, you can order a test through <a href=\"/dna-diagnostics-center-review\">DNA Diagnostics Center</a> and get results in one to two days, but at nearly twice the cost.","Paternity Depot is accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), and it is also ISO 17025 accredited – just like more expensive services. This company does its testing in its own in-house lab and uses 16 different genetic markers to determine if there is a parent-child relationship.","Like other paternity tests we researched, this company can also deal with maternity tests, sibling-relationship tests and avuncular (or aunt and uncle) tests. The maternity test matches the low price of the paternity test, but the other tests are significantly more expensive. If you’re looking for a sibling or avuncular test, Genex’s Swab Test has more affordable versions of both of these tests.","One potential downside to this company is its unprofessional website. Though we were able to contact representatives on two separate occasions by phone, the website has the appearance of being broken. It’s only an appearance, though, and you can still order your tests successfully through the site.","If you have questions about paternity testing, or how to order a legally admissible test, this company has a FAQs section that is helpful. It also has customer service representatives available in English, Spanish or French if you need help.","Paternity Depot is our top choice for paternity tests, particularly if you’re looking for a basic paternity test, because it has a low cost and offers high accuracy."]},"id":"d4ff7da6-5d12-4272-bbdf-0da7397a225b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61518","url":"/paternity-depot-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-12T02:57:52Z","datePublished":"2014-12-12T02:57:52Z","name":"Paternity Depot Paternity Test","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":20,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","id":"cZ5oewvV75sHYnsd9GSN4M","meta":{"title":"Paternity Depot Paternity Test Review - How It Works, What to Expect","description":"Paternity Depot has the lowest price, while still advertising 99.99 percent accuracy for its tests.
