It’s both sleek and discreet, and it comes with a charging case equipped with a leather loop you can use to attach it to a belt loop or purse. The headset itself has a maximum of six hours talk time, and the charging case can add up to 10 more. You can purchase the Voyager 3200 without the charging case, but the portable charging aspect is so useful that we recommend spending a little more for the extra convenience.","<strong>Call Performance</strong>","The Voyager 3200 features triple microphones. Most products we reviewed use dual-mic technology to help filter out background noise, but the Voyager’s additional mic ups the call clarity compared to other products we tested. While the sound quality is good, it is a bit shallower than the more expensive <a href=\"/plantronics-voyager-5200-review\">Plantronics Voyager 5200</a>. Use the button on the side of the mic arm to mute the mic or activate voice assistants including Siri and Google Now. If you try to talk while muted, the headset lets you know.","<strong>Volume</strong>","The Voyager’s speaker has a feature called SoundGuard, which levels out noises to protect your ears. In our volume tests, where we played audio clips of things like shrieking and train horns and measured the sound output while set at max volume, the Voyager 3200 put out a max volume of 84 decibels, which is well below the advertised max volume of 118 decibels. The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/\">World Health Organization</a> sets the max threshold for safe extended listening at 85 decibels for up to eight hours.","<strong>Design</strong>","With three color options, the Voyager 3200 has a versatile design. It’s unobtrusive and professional-looking. It features a power switch, volume controls, a voice button and a main multi-function button. The multi-function button is hidden over the speaker on the outside of the earpiece, but it’s still easy to find and use.","At nine grams, the Voyager is on the lighter side of the products we tested. It’s fairly comfortable over a long period of time and comes with three ear tip size options and an around-the-ear hook for additional stability. Depending on the shape of your face, you may be able to feel the mic arm resting on your cheek. One thing we didn’t particularly like about the Voyager 3200 is that all its ear tips are clear and very slightly sticky.","Overall, the Plantronics Voyager 3200 is a good Bluetooth headset. Its triple-mic setup helps you make crystal clear calls without background noise interference, and the optional charging case is super useful and convenient for staying charged and connected on the go."]},"id":"cfb08962-2ff7-47f5-a8c0-ad16b423660d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70033","url":"/plantronics-voyager-3200-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-13T15:39:39Z","datePublished":"2018-06-13T15:39:39Z","name":"Plantronics Voyager 3200","synopsis":"The Plantronics Voyager 3200 is a compact Bluetooth mono headset.","review":{"rating":87,"verdict":"The Voyager 3200 is a nondescript, intuitive Bluetooth headset that gives you excellent call clarity and charging on the go.","pros":["It comes with a portable charging case."],"cons":["The included ear tips have a sticky texture."]},"strapline":"The Plantronics Voyager 3200 is a compact Bluetooth mono headset.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-18T00:00:00Z","id":"kA6r8g5XVHU5ZxN3qP995R","meta":{"title":"Plantronics Voyager 3200 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Voyager 3200 is a nondescript, intuitive Bluetooth headset that gives you excellent call clarity and charging on the go.
