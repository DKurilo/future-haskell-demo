It does not come with a driver or any built-in software, so what you see is what you get. Also, if you want to film in a smooth 30 frames per second, you have to turn the resolution all the way down to 480p standard definition. It&#39;s a simple plug-and-play Skype camera that lacks the quality and features of the higher-ranked product in our lineup.","The Rocksoul WK-107 is capable of filming in full 1080p HD resolution. It includes a powerful, 5-megapixel CMOS lens for clear images. These capabilities don&#39;t matter if you want smooth video. In order to film at 30 frames per second, you have to turn the resolution down to a standard-definition resolution of 480p. If you&#39;re using this as a Skype camera, you can choose to have a crystal-clear image with choppy frames or to make the video fluid but pixelated.","Rocksoul does not include any extra software with the WK-107. Instead, this HD webcam is treated as a plug-and-play camera. It has a fixed-focus lens and lacks any kind of digital zoom. Because it has a fixed-focus lens, it does not need to have face tracking. And without face tracking, it lacks facial recognition, which would allow you to log in simply by looking at the computer. It has dual, built-in microphones, but it does not have noise reduction. The WK-107 is an HD camera with virtually no features to set itself apart.","The Rocksoul WK-107 has some good design elements. Its docking mount can be used as a stand for the webcam or as a clip that you can place on monitors or TVs. The webcam can tilt forwards and backwards as well as swivel side to side. The biggest issue with this webcam is its plastic lens, which does not perform as well as a glass-lens webcam. Rocksoul supports its webcam with a one-year warranty and offers customer service by email and phone."]},"id":"bfcd0530-b883-4c6e-8a0a-e6b9d29ca8dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d2d20145-e3f4-4299-95ea-d3f04a32e434","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Rocksoul WK-107 is a decent video chat webcam with full 1080p HD resolution.
