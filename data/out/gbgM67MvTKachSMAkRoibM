It actually has five functions on each head, and the number 24 is reflective of the possible combinations between the two. The five functions are wide rain, power massage, stay-warm mist, eco rain and pause. Realistically, you’re not going to use all possible setting combinations, especially because turning on both <a href=\"/best-handheld-showerheads\">shower heads</a> kills the water pressure.","The idea of standing under two shower heads instead of one is great in theory, but it turned out to be rather disappointing. Because of U.S. regulations, shower heads can only have a maximum flow rate of 2.5 gpm (gallons per minute) – that is per fixture, not per shower head. Spreading that flow over two shower heads throttles the water pressure and makes most combination sprays on this product a bit pathetic. Additionally, we weren’t blown away by the spray modes from either head. All the settings were just okay. The massage setting was more like a drenching pour than a massage, so if that’s an important feature, you should try the <a href=\"/waterpik-review\">Waterpik Twin Turbo</a> instead. Notably, the Hydroluxe’s pause setting makes a loud whining noise, which is definitely not what you want to hear when you’re trying to unwind in the shower.","Though not impressed with this particular product, we ended up liking the dual-head setup. One tester noted that because the fixed showerhead sits lower and the handheld a bit higher, something like this might be useful if you have a taller and shorter person using the same shower.","Something else that bothered us about this product is that it is obviously cheap. We noticed the chrome finish peeling off the spray face while we conducted our testing, which was about five days after initially receiving the product. The toggles – both for the individual shower heads and to switch between the two – are more difficult to flip than we’d like. If you’re looking for a two-in-one shower head, we preferred the <a href=\"/delta-review\">Delta In2ition</a> over this product.","The Hydroluxe two-in-one shower head comes in chrome and includes everything you need to install it, including the fixed head and attached mount, hose, instructions and thread-seal tape. It is covered under a 10-year warranty by Interlink Products International, which is fine, though not as good as the lifetime warranties for most other shower heads we reviewed."]},"id":"048063b6-804f-4396-bbd4-39fc4207175b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69736","url":"/hydroluxe-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-02-16T15:22:07Z","datePublished":"2018-02-16T15:22:07Z","name":"Hydroluxe 24 Function","synopsis":"The Hydroluxe Full-Chrome 24-Function is a two-in-one shower head with two separate heads: a fixed and a handheld.
