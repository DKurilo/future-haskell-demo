They think locally, so to get the best success for your brick-and-mortar businesses, you need to reach them locally. This has two aspects: First, you need to be on the right directories so your customers can find your stores, and second, you have to show your customers that you understand the situations and needs of the area in which your store resides. Local level automation software can help with both.","We looked at two different types of local level automation companies. Some, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Moz Local</a>, are concerned with automating your business&#39;s placement in directories like Yelp so that people can find your store and get accurate contact information. Others, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">SproutLoud</a>, are concerned with coordinating national marketing on a local level, assisting the individual stores to create advertising that keeps a local flavor while adhering to the national brand and message. Of these national-level companies, a couple also automate local directory entries. A few of the companies focus on large enterprises, while others are for small businesses with only a couple of branches.","<strong>Local Level Automation: What to Look For</strong>","These companies offer a diverse range of services, and price accordingly. What you choose depends on your budget as well as your needs. Several offer package deals, while some can tailor a program for your needs. Here are some of the most common uses for local level marketing automation and some of the ways these companies tackle them:","<strong>Placement in Local Directories</strong><br/>Local small businesses depend on having accurate information on the internet. People increasingly turn to the internet to find businesses, not only for directions to the store, but also for restaurant phone numbers to order takeout or make reservations, or for a general search of a nearby business that can fulfill their need. There are hundreds of directories online that offer this information. Some, like Yelp and Google, have national or global reach, while others are locally based.","Most businesses strive to be on several directories, but this can get complicated when you have multiple locations. With local level automation software, you can manage all your accounts for all your locations through one service so that if a phone number or address changes, you can input the information once and have all the directories uploaded. Six of the services we looked can handle local directories. For some, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Synup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Universal Business Listing</a>, this is the primary function of the software.","<strong>Marketing Campaign Coordination</strong><br/>Having a focused, unified message is key to a strong business identity. Local level automation companies, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Distribion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Brandmuscle</a>, focus on brand compliance with campaign coordination software that can hold shared items like official logos, allow a process for approving campaigns and distribute co-op marketing funds. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Mindmatrix</a> takes it a step further by helping you create a company playbook in order to ensure all your locations are working with the same directives when creating their own advertising campaigns. Several, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Pica9</a>, have homepage creation software so that your individual locations can have their own local website that still adheres to the company branding and design.","Most software can coordinate email or direct mail campaigns so that flyers can go out over multiple locations with the contact information of the closest branch. A few automate campaigns for you, so you can set them to run on automatic. For example, campaigns can be set so that in November, customers near your Idaho store see ads for snow boots, while those in Phoenix see running shoes. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Balihoo</a> has local pay-per-click automation.","<strong>National Monitoring for the Local Level</strong><br/>Regardless of whether the service is feeding directories or helping you manage large-scale campaigns, nearly all offered some kind of monitoring. Eight of the 10 companies we profile have social media monitoring and analysis. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Yext</a> adds review monitoring as well. Monitoring helps your business&#39;s headquarters as well as your local businesses keep track of the buzz, determine the success or failure of specific campaigns, and find the topics and posts that engage customers the most.","Local level marketing automation covers several bases. The software can simply keep your local directory entries current, or you can get software and services that help you keep your business marketing campaigns coordinated and on track across all your locations, whether you have three stores in one town or hundreds of branches across the globe."]},"id":"8dc433fc-8eef-4354-89e5-0f21f074b05b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"513467cb-e23b-4580-af31-f7eaa6b1cccf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://balihoo.com/solutions/\">Balihoo</a>","<a href=\"http://www.brandmuscle.com/distributed-marketing/distributed-marketing.aspx\">Brandmuscle</a>","<a href=\"http://www.distribion.com/\">Distribion</a>","<a href=\"http://www.mindmatrix.net/pricing/\">Mindmatrix</a>","<a href=\"https://moz.com/products/pricing\">Moz Local</a>","<a href=\"http://www.pica9blog.com/pricing.html\">Pica9</a>","<a href=\"http://info.sproutloud.com/contact-us\">SproutLoud</a>","<a href=\"http://synup.com/pricing.html\">Synup</a>","<a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=113582&b=289827&m=31597&afftrack=&urllink=ubl%2Eorg%2Fcompare%2Easpx%3Fnewlisting%3Dtrue\">Universal Business Listing</a>","<a href=\"http://www.yext.com/products/\">Yext</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"83341535-ee52-4531-b593-d4652b3a0f69","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1825","url":"/best-local-marketing-automation","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-16T15:20:12Z","datePublished":"2015-11-16T23:20:04Z","name":"Local Marketing Automation Review","synopsis":"Local level marketing automation applies to a small business ensuring its listings are optimized for business or a national chain coordinating its local campaigns to stay true to brand.","review":{},"strapline":"Local level marketing automation applies to a small business ensuring its listings are optimized for business or a national chain coordinating its local campaigns to stay true to brand.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-11-11T23:03:13Z","id":"LQCK4LeSWBJdAbQWUb3zPB","meta":{"title":"Best Local Marketing Automation Software","description":"We&#039;ve compared the best local marketing automation software for 2017.
