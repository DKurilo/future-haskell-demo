The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-video-game-consoles\">Gaming Consoles</a> here.</em>","Of the major gaming consoles on the market right now, the Sony PlayStation 4 is a standout success. With a large library of games, a refined controller and console design, and an array of connected services for online gaming and media streaming, the PS4 is a worthy contender for your choice as a gaming system.","More than 200 disc-based video games have been released for the PS4, including entries from popular and beloved games like Grand Theft Auto, Overwatch, Battlefield and The Last of Us, as well as popular sports franchises like FIFA Soccer and Madden NFL. This extensive library includes several franchises that are exclusive to the PlayStation 4, such as Infamous, Bloodborne, Driveclub and Uncharted.","The PS4 game library doesn’t end there, as more than 500 games are available for download through the PlayStation Network, also called the PSN. Some of these are indie titles, while others are culled from past console generations.","Aside from the console itself, the most essential piece of hardware is the included DualShock 4 controller. A standard system comes with one controller, but bundled options may come with two, and you can always purchase additional controllers separately. The PS4 supports up to four controllers simultaneously, though not all games support that many players.","The DualShock 4 connects wirelessly via Bluetooth and can be charged via micro-USB when not in use. A glowing light bar along the front of the controller may be used in conjunction with the optional PlayStation Camera for motion control in a smattering of games, but it also serves to identify which controller is which, and even provides atmospheric lighting in some games. You can buy the DualShock 4 in a variety of colors beyond the standard Jet Black, including Magma Red, Glacier White, Wave Blue or Urban Camouflage, as well as limited-edition color schemes from Sony. Additionally, many third-party companies allow you to purchase a controller that you’ve customized the color of for an extra cost.","The controller has two analog sticks, four directional buttons, four action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, square), two bumpers and two triggers. New features with this version include a capacitive touch pad, a built-in speaker and a 3.5 mm audio jack. There is also a dedicated share button you can use to capture in-game video and screenshots to share on the PlayStation Network, social media and sites like Twitch.tv.","The PS4’s chassis is stylized and made of black plastic. While this model has a two-toned mix of matte and glossy finish, its sister models – the PlayStation 4 Pro and the PlayStation 4 Slim – ditched the fingerprint-prone glossy surface for all-matte exteriors. Measuring 2.2 x 10.8 x 12 inches (HWD), it should fit into most entertainment centers without any trouble. The black plastic chassis has several glowing indicator lights and mechanical power and eject buttons.","There are two USB 3.0 ports on the front of the console, and you can use them to charge the wireless DualShock 4 controllers or to connect accessories and external storage devices. The console itself plugs into your TV via HDMI and supports media playback with up to 4K resolutions, but gaming is limited to 1080p. In addition to audio over HDMI, the system has an optical output for digital surround sound.","While hardware specifications may not be high on your list of buying criteria, it is worth noting a few details about the PlayStation 4’s internals. The system is built to compete with gaming PCs, and the custom eight-core 64-bit AMD Jaguar processor and AMD Radeon-based graphics solution do just that. The processor is paired with 8GB of RAM to keep things snappy. Pitted against the Xbox One, the PlayStation 4 offers similar processing power but better graphics performance, providing an edge in actual in-game visuals. Compared side-by-side, most details look the same, but the PS4 has more consistent output at 1080p and better frame rates.","The hardware detail that is likely to matter most to you is storage. The PS4 comes standard with a 500GB hard drive, but there are versions of the system that double this to 1TB. On a system that requires games either to be installed onto the hard drive from a disc or downloaded to the drive, storage limitations can put a cramp on things if you run out of space for a new game. Unlike most game consoles, however, the PS4 does support hard drive upgrades, allowing you to install a larger 1TB or 2TB hard drive for expanded storage.","The optical drive, used for both games and other media, is a read-only Blu-ray drive, which also supports DVD playback. Even though the previous-generation PlayStation 3 also used Blu-ray media, the PS4 is not backward compatible with PS3 game discs.","The PlayStation console is designed for use with the PlayStation Network, Sony’s online platform for buying and downloading games, game demos and media. It also includes some social features such as online multiplayer gaming, voice chat and messaging, and provides access to various online services.","You can access the PSN if you pay the recurring subscription fee. You can pay either monthly or annually, but the pricing is broken down monthly. This is required to connect with non-local players. It also comes with access to a rotating lineup of free games that changes every month, as well as members-only discounts and game sales.","With its built-in Blu-ray drive and online connection capacities, the video game console is well-positioned to become a central device in your home entertainment center. In addition to Blu-ray and DVD playback, the PS4 also supports a variety of online media services, including YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Video, HBO GO, Hulu and Plex. Sony sells and rents current movies and TV episodes through PSN, and the PS4 has an option to connect directly to your cable or HDTV antenna for live TV. Sports fans can enjoy content via apps such as MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL and WWE. Other entertainment options include streaming from Twitch, online music from Spotify and Pandora, and more.","For those willing to pay the extra monthly subscription fee, Sony also has a bundled media package called PS Vue, which gives you dozens of channels including AMC, Comedy Central, USA and Food Network, along with sports channels like ESPN, Fox Sports and their sister channels. For cordcutters who have struggled to enjoy live TV and sports without a cable subscription, this might be a good replacement.","The Sony PlayStation 4 is console gaming at its finest. It serves up a plethora of game titles, a rich assortment of accessories and an array of multimedia options that make it a central piece of any home entertainment setup."]},"id":"93139096-44af-4778-9c77-6e941d9e78f2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58512","url":"/playstation-4-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-26T19:53:30Z","datePublished":"2013-12-26T19:53:30Z","name":"Sony PlayStation 4","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
