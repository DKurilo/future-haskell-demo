It&#39;s gas-powered, so you can use it anywhere you want to have a flower or vegetable garden and not be tethered to a cord. This cultivator is also quite easy to assemble. However, unlike other rototillers on our buying guide lineup that have a tilling depth of 8 inches, this model tills earth up to 4 inches deep.","Like all small garden <a href=\"/best-tillers\">tillers</a>, the Garden Trax Mini Cultivator requires some assembly. Fortunately, if you stick to the instructions, this is a very easy process. All you have to do is build the handlebar and shaft and then attach it to the prebuilt motor/tine unit. This step only requires you to attach a few nuts and tighten them by hand – no tools are required.","This tiller is gas-powered, which offers several advantages compared to electric models.  The chief advantage is that you&#39;re not tethered by an electrical cord while you till, and you don&#39;t need a lengthy extension cord. The downside with a gas-powered model, though, is that you have to mix oil and gasoline for its fuel. You have to be very careful when you&#39;re doing this – consult the user guide so you know exactly how much gasoline and oil to use and how to mix it correctly.","A garden tiller&#39;s tines are what do the actual work of breaking up hardened, compacted dirt. The Garden Trax four forged-steel tines that turn and cut soil up to 4 inches deep. This tilling depth is sufficient for most casual users with small gardens. It allows water and other nutrients to reach plants&#39; roots more easily. However, other products on our lineup can till dirt up to 8 inches deep.","Weighing in at 30.5 pounds, the Garden Trax is somewhat heavy for a small garden tiller. However, its 2-cycle engine and rear wheels reduce a lot of the exertion needed to push this tiller through your soil. This model also comes with a 4-cycle engine if you require more a more powerful tiller.","When choosing the right garden cultivator for you, the Garden Trax 2-Cycle Mini Cultivator may be an ideal choice. It is an attractive option if you have a smaller garden that doesn&#39;t require you to cut deep into soil or if you have a garden that&#39;s situated too far from an electrical outlet to reach with an extension cord."]},"id":"da0b244a-4655-4dde-b316-f10e1bc20799","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68001","url":"/garden-trax-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-17T17:25:59Z","datePublished":"2016-06-17T17:25:59Z","name":"Garden Trax 2-Cycle Mini Cultivator","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
