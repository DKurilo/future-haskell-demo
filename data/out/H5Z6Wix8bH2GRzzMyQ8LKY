From a company that&#39;s mostly known for its data backup and disk imaging software, Acronis Internet Security Suite is beginning to be recognized as a good choice for all-around PC maintenance and security.  When you first use the program, remember it&#39;s a relatively new entry into their product offerings. And, while it&#39;s more than capable of keeping your computer safe and is definitely worth looking into, its features aren&#39;t strong enough and the feature set is too small for it to compete with its higher-ranked counterparts.
