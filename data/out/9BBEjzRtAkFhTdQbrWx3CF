It helps keep it stable, and the extra power means it&#39;s less likely to be carried away while you fight helplessly against the wind. Inside, however, larger models can be problematic. Their extra weight means that a simple crash can cause serious damage to fragile items in your house.","That&#39;s where RC helicopters like the Syma X12S Nano come in. Their small size means that you have more space to fly in, relatively speaking, so you&#39;re less likely to crash in the first place. And when you do happen to send it flying out of control, it leaves much less destruction in its wake.","The Syma X12S is one of the best RC helicopters we tested for casual indoor flight – it&#39;s small, durable and fun to fly. Small models like this one are a little more difficult to get the hang of, however, as they&#39;re often more sensitive to subtle movements. But once you get the hang of this little quadcopter, you&#39;ll find it easy to command air superiority over your living room. ","It&#39;s important to remember that flight time for miniature models is proportionally miniature. Five minutes is all you get before you need to recharge the Syma X12S. Fortunately, it only takes about 20 minutes to charge it up again. We think it&#39;s a good model to keep in the office when you need a short break from work.","The transmitter is simple and actually quite reminiscent of an Xbox controller. It&#39;s comfortable to hold and provides you with trim control and the ability to make your model do flips on every axis. It doesn&#39;t have a fancy screen like many others, but as this a more casual model it might not matter."]},"id":"a27ab5e5-b739-4919-a13b-cec1597b1e61","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"18861189-28d0-4093-831b-876ae001fdb4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Having a small RC helicopter to fly indoors can be a great way to take a break and relieve some stress.
