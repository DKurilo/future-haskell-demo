You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Deepnet Explorer isn’t nearly as flashy or sleek as most of its competitors, but this <a href=\"/best-internet-browser-software\">internet browser</a> performs its primary function of web browsing well. The browser’s main focus is on facilitating P2P networking and RSS feeds, and while it delivers several useful tools and features, Deepnet Explorer fails to stand out among the competition.","Deepnet Explorer provides most of the fundamental features we were looking for in web browsers. For starters, it provides tabbed browsing, a built-in search function and the ability to bookmark websites. Deepnet Explorer also provides basic toolbar customization, and you can navigate webpages using the browser’s integrated mouse gestures and keyboard shortcuts.","As mentioned above, the internet browser’s standout features are its support of P2P networking and an RSS news reader. P2P, or peer-to-peer, networking is a type of file sharing integrated directly into the internet browser. Deepnet Explorer’s RSS feature comes with many popular news feeds preinstalled, and you can add as many as you want. The browser allows you to organize the feeds in an intuitive tree structure, and you can use the toolbar to search the feeds by keyword.","Apart from those features, Deepnet Explorer doesn’t offer much more functionality. There are no parental controls or synchronization that allows you to access your saved browser data and preferences on any computer. The internet browser also lacks automatic updates and spell check, a minor but nonetheless useful feature.","Perhaps most disappointing about Deepnet Explorer is its security – or lack thereof. This internet browser doesn’t boast the full range of robust security features found on our top-ranked web browsers. It employs an effective pop-up blocker and an antiphishing alarm that protects you from fraudulent websites. If a website is detected as a threat, the browser adds it to its black list of banned websites. The browser gives you complete control to edit the lists of approved and banned websites. While we liked the level of control allowed, we would have liked even more to see additional security measures in place. Deepnet Explorer would greatly benefit from malware, virus and spyware protection.","Although not always as intuitive as our higher-ranked internet browsers, Deepnet Explorer is fairly easy to navigate and allows you to do what you want to do. Tabbed browsing is utilized, complete with a save session function. The at-a-glance security button on each tab is a nice addition, but there is no way to quickly delete a tab. And while the interface is somewhat customizable, it seems clunky and a bit outdated in comparison to other browsers.","While Deepnet Explorer falls short in many areas, speed is not one of them. In fact, the internet browser is right on par with most competitors in terms of speed. Initial startup takes approximately four seconds while the browser’s average startup time and navigation time is even less. If speed is your top priority, Deepnet Explorer proves to be a worthy contender.","We were also impressed with the internet browser’s help and support options. On the Deepnet Explorer website, you can take a quick tour of the browser and get technical assistance through email or a community forum. The website also hosts a decent list of FAQs.<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"ce3b0cec-7be7-471b-aa47-f2fe935d2ceb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"49e311d3-0f38-4dd8-ad13-03fc0542cefb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Deepnet Explorer offers some useful features but lacks the full feature set many of its competitors have.
