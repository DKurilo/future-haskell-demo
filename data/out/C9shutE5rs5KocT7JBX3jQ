Toro does not make trimmer attachments, but it designs this unit so you can use attachments from most other weed trimmer brands. You can whack through undergrowth by replacing the weed eater head with a brush cutter or even connect a cultivator for your garden. Another benefit: Using attachments does not void your warranty. The Toro gas trimmer doesn&#39;t come with a harness or the ability to become a power sweeper.","Regarding anti-vibration technology, this is the best weed whacker in our product comparison as far as anti-vibration technology goes.
