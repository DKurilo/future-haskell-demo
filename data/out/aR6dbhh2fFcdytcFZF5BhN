The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Electrolux IQ Touch EIFLW50LIW front-load washing machine is not only stylish, but has a sufficient number of wash cycles and options to allow you to do just about any kind of laundry necessary. It has a stainless steel drum with a capacity of 4.2 cubic feet to pile clothing and other laundry into, 11 wash cycles, nine options, and five soil levels and wash temperatures.","This Electrolux front-loader washing machine is already Energy Star qualified, but includes a couple additional energy-saving features that help you save even more energy with the laundry you do. These include its eco-friendly option and eco-cold wash. You can expect this front-loading washer to cost you an estimated $15 a year to run and consume an estimated 138-kilowatt hours every year.","This Electrolux front-load washer’s 11 wash cycles include a fast-wash cycle, which we like. You are able to wash a smaller load of laundry in just 18 minutes with this cycle. We were also impressed to see a deep-clean, sanitize cycle available, which is NSF certified and can remove 99.9 percent of household bacteria from laundry.","We were slightly disappointed to see that this Electrolux front-loader washing machine does not include an allergen cycle, but it definitely wasn’t a deal breaker since it has many other cycles and options that should suffice.","This front-loading washer includes vibration control with the Electrolux Perfect Balance System. This system helps keep large loads balanced and decreases vibration, even when this washer is installed on an upstairs floor.","This Electrolux front-loading washer is only available in the Island White color, which was slightly disappointing. This washer is 38 inches high, 27 inches wide and 31-1/2 inches deep. You can get this front-load washer with the optional pedestal drawer, which will make it stand at a more convenient height, but it will cost you extra.","The warranty coverage on this front-loader washing machine falls quite short compared to some other major appliance brands. You get a three-year warranty on parts and a one-year warranty on labor. However, in order to get the additional two-year warranty on the parts, you must register your appliance within 60 days of the purchase.","You can contact Electrolux for help and support via phone and email. However, in order to get email support, you must submit an online contact form on its website for them to contact you via email. You aren’t able to view the user manual for this front-load washer online, but you can view FAQs and product tutorials."]},"id":"00d5dc3b-6771-4bcd-8ffe-20b47afb7a89","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"72fb69b6-7e64-4260-ba1b-09241aed27fa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Electrolux IQ Touch EIFLW50LIW front-load washing machine includes plenty of wash cycles and options to do just about any kind of laundry.
