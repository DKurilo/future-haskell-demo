Early portable TVs were clunky, received poor reception and were usually black and white. Now, portable TVs range from 2.5 to 9-inch screens and frequently utilize the latest LCD technology.","Previously, the portable TV had its place on the kitchen counter; now, they are all over. Here are a few places you may see a portable TV:","<strong>In the Car</strong>Placing televisions in the car has pumped new life into the portable TV. Parents can now go on long road trips and family vacations without hearing the usual arguments over toys. Televisions mounted in a vehicle are usually attached to a DVD player or video game console. Never again do you have to hear The Backyardigans greatest hits CD.","<strong>Sports</strong>Sports enthusiasts have kept the portable TV alive even during its darkest days. Many would secretly watch the game while in church, on a date, at required family functions or in the case of children, after bedtime. A popular use is to take your TV with you to the game. You can be there in the action, but also catch the highlights and replays on your handheld portable TV.","<strong>Campers</strong>Few camp in tents anymore. Many of us have some kind of camper or RV that provides all the amenities of home, including a TV, combined with the great outdoors. Small portable TVs with a VCR or DVD player can be a lifesaver during a rainy weekend when hiking, fishing or Frisbee is out of the question. Additionally, portable TVs are particularly handy for those with younger children or teenagers that don’t like the dirt and bugs.","<strong>Dorms</strong>Traditionally dorm rooms are small; therefore, everything in them needs to be smaller to conserve space. Eight or nine-inch portable TVs are great for those limited in space. Additionally, they are easy to move in case of room changes.","In this site, you&#39;ll find articles on televisions, news stories and comprehensive reviews on the best portable TVs that will help you make an informed decision on which one is right for you. At TopTenREVIEWS – We do the research so you don’t have to.","Portable TVs are great for road trips, children and sporting events. They are basic televisions designed for convenience and ease. Portable TVs have different requirements and shopping for one is different than shopping for a conventional set.","These are the features TopTenREVIEWS looked for when evaluating portable TVs:"]},"id":"932eead7-215e-428a-9bc5-fec7a12e291e","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Display Technology:</strong> Portable TVs are available in two screen types, traditional CRT and LCD. One is not necessarily better than the other. It depends on the size and purpose of the television. LCD screens are most popular in small handheld models, usually five inches or less, and those mounted in cars. Because they use LCD technology, they are sometimes more expensive than portable TVs of the past. Portable CRT TVs utilize tube technology found in older non-flat panel televisions. These are usually used in televisions of eight inches or larger.","<strong>Digital Tuner:</strong> Most portable TVs are not hooked up to cable and rely on an antenna to receive a signal. Make sure the portable TV, no matter how big or small, has a digital tuner, usually displayed as an ASTC or QAM tuner. Without a digital tuner, the portable TV will not be able to receive a signal after February 2009 when all broadcasting switches from analog to digital.","<strong>Color:</strong> Although it is the 21st century, there are still some portable TVs that are only black and white. Although black and white is much less expensive, color is more often preferred.","<strong>Headphone Jack:</strong> Designed more specifically for handheld models, a portable TV without a headphone jack is almost useless. Not everyone wants to hear the football game on the screen."],"type":"ul"},"id":"b18a29f6-19b7-4603-8094-fe85622953be","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"b602f896-4133-4a25-b368-f8ef36c40cfc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0022NHQ00/?&tag=ttr_portable_tv-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|243[art|NA[pid|48383[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Eviant T7</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E78UQY/?&tag=ttr_portable_tv-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|243[art|NA[pid|48379[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Haier HLT71</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"9962235c-9f3a-47e2-bd5f-1f0d6e598ec3","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_243","url":"/best-portable-tvs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-07-01T15:52:28Z","datePublished":"2011-09-13T21:16:32Z","name":"Portable TV","synopsis":"Who says you can’t take it with you?
