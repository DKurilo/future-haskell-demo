This <a href=\"/best-genealogy-software\">family tree software for Mac</a> is compatible with OS X 7 and up. Its charting, search and media capabilities make it a strong contender among the software we reviewed. The most useful tools for citation, charting, listing and organization are all in easy-to-find places. MacFamilyTree also packs plenty of exceptional features, like a 3D family tree and virtual globe, though it lacks the important problem-spotter feature.","The data-entry fields cover the essentials like birthdate, birthplace and death date. You can customize data fields around a central theme in your family like military service or occupations. Even eye color is a detail you can apply to your ancestral records. Sources, citations and documentation in MacFamilyTree are easy to edit and enter. When you add sources, the software prompts you to include basic info like title, author and publication. The privacy settings for each source are located within this window so you know immediately which sources are public and which are not.","This software offers a long list of custom chart types to display your ancestry. The slick templates and backgrounds spruce up all formats of family trees. All the publications populate with your family information automatically based on what you enter into the database. You can also add media and notes, change dates, or add items to the task list. Any photos, videos, audio, PDFs and URLs you use as sources have secure places in the media repository. The galleries tab has tools to quickly edit all the old family photos that may not digitize well.","Beyond charting, there&#39;s the 3D family tree and virtual globe. These features are better visual aids than records. The 3D tree looks like Pixar&#39;s version of your family tree. Information appears in a pedigree format, but you can swivel and move between family branches and see quick facts for each individual from all directions.","Like the 3D tree, the Virtual Globe has a lot of visual value. It pinpoints locations to show the migration of your family throughout its history. You can also view how long ago each migration happened and get a better sense of the distance your family has traveled over time.","Like the 3D tree, the Virtual Globe has a lot of visual value.

You can also view how long ago each migration happened and get a better sense of the distance your family has traveled over time. One of the few omissions of this software is it lacks a tool for mapping DNA results. This tool would allow you to map where your ancestors originated from and help you hone in on possible family connections, but you won&#39;t be able to do that with this program."]},"id":"f7e4846a-7d3d-4852-ad03-051894c7c266","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"11ac21fc-25cc-4af2-85f3-4d9262c0221c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MacFamilyTree is a solid piece of genealogy software for Mac.
