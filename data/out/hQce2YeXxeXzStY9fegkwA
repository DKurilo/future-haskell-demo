It measures 2 x 2 x 1.9 inches and weighs just 0.3 pounds but still does a decent job with both images and sound, and it has an impressive resume of features and abilities. The accompanying accessories round out the package, making it a great option especially considering its low price.","Whether you use it at home or on the go, the Cube’s durable aluminum construction can keep up with you. It comes with a sturdy mount and flexible tripod that you can set on a table or wrap around a pole. The included remote control makes it easy to use the projector once you’re comfortable in your seat. It even comes with a one-year warranty.","The Cube has a native resolution of 854 x 480 pixels and a rated brightness of only 50 lumens, same as the <a href=\"/apeman-review\">Apeman M4</a>, meaning the LED projector’s picture struggled in moderately bright lighting scenarios but fared decently when we turned off all the lights. However, we found that colors never felt totally accurate but were rather hyper-saturated. The Cube struggled to show gradient details when darker objects appeared on-screen. The picture never felt sharply defined, even with the ability to manually adjust focus.","Its sound, generated from a 1-watt speaker, is thin. We recommend using headphones or connecting the Cube to an external speaker. It works if you’re sitting within a few feet of it, but if it will be used in a large room or if audio is important to you, it simply won’t be enough.","Given its small size, the RIF6 Cube does a decent job. It’s missing significant connection options in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and there is no VGA or USB port. It does offer an HDMI/MHL port and supports microSD cards, however, and it can mirror another device. The internal battery lasts for up to 90 minutes, which is long enough for most presentations or a short movie. It recharges via USB Micro port. You can also plug it in to a wall socket and enjoy a movie marathon."]},"id":"1661acea-f2f8-4129-b407-8226e57c24b1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70096","url":"/rif6-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-09T18:04:24Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T18:04:24Z","name":"RIF6 Cube","synopsis":"The RIF6 Cube is the smallest – and the most adorable – mini projector we tested.","review":{"rating":71,"verdict":"Though it could have better audiovisual performance and connectivity options, the RIF6 Cube offers decent performance and functionality at a budget-friendly price.","pros":["A rechargeable internal battery and a flexible tripod make it great for travelling."],"cons":["It lacks Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity."]},"strapline":"The RIF6 Cube is the smallest – and the most adorable – mini projector we tested.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-09T18:04:24Z","id":"hQce2YeXxeXzStY9fegkwA","meta":{"title":"RIF6 Cube Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Though it could have better audiovisual performance and connectivity options, the RIF6 Cube offers decent performance and functionality at a budget-friendly price."},"products":[{"slug":"rif6-cube","url":"/product/rif6-cube","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","name":"RIF6 Cube","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","id":"5hCGURATEGvVLxeRNd7xUn","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FFFA4cVwjLS62WiRYZo9oD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","mimeType":"","name":"19144fa09cb09d868e361eb0e17f9f58.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/19144fa09cb09d868e361eb0e17f9f58.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","id":"FFFA4cVwjLS62WiRYZo9oD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFFA4cVwjLS62WiRYZo9oD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"RIF6 Cube Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Though it could have better audiovisual performance and connectivity options, the RIF6 Cube offers decent performance and functionality at a budget-friendly price."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FFFA4cVwjLS62WiRYZo9oD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","mimeType":"","name":"19144fa09cb09d868e361eb0e17f9f58.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/19144fa09cb09d868e361eb0e17f9f58.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","id":"FFFA4cVwjLS62WiRYZo9oD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFFA4cVwjLS62WiRYZo9oD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"RIF6 Cube Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Though it could have better audiovisual performance and connectivity options, the RIF6 Cube offers decent performance and functionality at a budget-friendly price."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/rif6-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"tv","url":"/electronics/tv","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","name":"TV","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:14Z","id":"hetzCY2dg335aDLYkLr6cG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
