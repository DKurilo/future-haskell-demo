You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The TomTom Go Live 1535M takes car GPS navigation to the next level, by incorporating travel-based apps for extra convenience. TomTom uses the existing AT&amp;T network to power the built-in apps, allowing you to receive real-time updates and information while you drive. Apps such as Expedia, Yelp, TripAdvisor and Twitter are built-in and keep you connected to your surroundings. You get one year of Live services when you purchase this navigation GPS device.","The five-inch touchscreen is capacitive, allowing you to swipe and scroll through menus and pinch to zoom in and out of maps. The screen responds easily to your touch, similar to smartphone screens. The screen resolution of 480 x 272 pixels is common on many of the car GPS devices of this size, but the glass capacitive screen would look even better with a higher pixel resolution. Despite the standard resolution, the screen is still easy to see and the words and images look sharp.","This device comes with lifetime map updates. TomTom updates maps four times a year, and you will have access to the most current maps for the lifetime of your Go Live 1535M. While the Go Live 1535M doesn&#39;t have lifetime traffic updates, it does come with TomTom HD Traffic. HD Traffic is more advanced and accurate than TomTom&#39;s older network that the lifetime updates apply to. HD Traffic is particularly useful in rush hour traffic and construction zones.","You can use speech commands to control the Go Live 1535M, and the device will connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth so that you can go hands free when taking calls or you are looking for the nearest coffee shop. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has a battery life of about two hours, but the GPS device will charge continually while plugged in to your car. The Go Live 1535M has internal memory, but no expandable memory port, making it hard to save extra maps and other customizations.","The seven million points of interest (POIs) are quite complete (you can even create your own), but you can only add three waypoints along your route. Some of the best car GPS units can hold hundreds of waypoints. The Go Live 1535M is also incapable of saving routes that you&#39;ve created. However, as you&#39;re driving you will have active lane guidance and a speed limit indicator that will also warn you when you are speeding. This device has two modes: auto and pedestrian. You can use the pedestrian mode when you are taking off on foot. If you are environmentally conscious, then the eco route option will help cut down on your time driving and on your fuel consumption."]},"id":"cde3dd6a-555f-471d-b26e-55bcc6d7be56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9139352f-64d4-458d-a665-cd6704d456df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TomTom Go Live 1535M is an innovative way to incorporate smartphone apps into a GPS unit so that you can get the best of both worlds in a navigation system.
