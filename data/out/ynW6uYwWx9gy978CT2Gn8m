If you don’t have a price point or any specific features in mind, here are some of the most important features to keep in mind as you decide with drone to buy:","<strong>Controls</strong><br/>Most drones rely on either a remote controller or a companion mobile phone app to control it. With either controller type, you can program a flight path for your drone or guide it manually. By using the display on the remote controller or your phone, you can see a live view of what the drone’s camera can see and capture videos or still images. Some models can even log flight data. Though you can technically send your drone off into the distance, it is recommended that you always stay within sight of it for safety reasons. Depending on which country you live in, there may also be restrictions on how high you can fly a drone, despite how high the drone is capable of flying.","<strong>Camera Basics</strong><br/>Some drones have integrated cameras, and others have mounts for external cameras, like GoPros. The most important things to look for in a drone with a built-in camera is a large CMOS sensor and the capacity to take high-resolution photos and video. Most drones have sensors with a total pixel count of at least 12 megapixels, with some having up to 20 megapixels. The greater the resolution is, the sharper and more detailed the image can be. A high-definition image – one that has a resolution of at least 1080 x 1920 pixels – looks better to the human eye than a low-resolution image, which can look blurry and make it difficult to see details clearly. If producing high-quality photos and video is important to you, newer models like the Phantom 4 Pro allow for multiple image sizes, aspect ratios and photography or video recording modes and formats.","Most drones these days can record video in high-definition, 1280 x 720 pixels, though some are capable of recording in ultra high-definition, also known as 4K, which is 4096 x 2160 pixels. Additionally, the Phantom line of drones gives you multiple options for frame rates, with models able to provide anywhere from 25 frames per second (fps) all the way up to 60. The higher the number of frames per second (fps) is, the smoother the video looks. If you just want to see a general image from your drone, neither the resolution nor the frame rate matters, but if you’re wanting to shoot a video or a high-quality image, these factors should be amongst the first that you consider.  Faster bitrates allow you to transmit images more quickly along a digital network, which can impact the live view some drone remote controls offer.","There is also a variety of ranges available for a drone’s field of vision (FOV). Generally, you’ll see a field that’s anywhere from 85 to 110 degrees wide. On high-end drones, you’ll see more detailed information, indicating field of vision ranges for looking forward, backward and downward.","<strong>Gimbal</strong><br/>Though the term may be unfamiliar, the gimbal is an essential part of any camera drone worth its weight. Simply put, the gimbal allows for image stabilization, which is particularly useful if it’s windy outside or you don’t have a steady hand to guide the drone manually. The gimbal works on three axes – pitch, roll and yaw – to keep your image steady in all directions. Different drones might have different controllable ranges and angular speeds, so consider these ranges and how windy of an area you’ll be flying in before purchasing a drone.","<strong>Flight Time &amp; Battery Life</strong><br/>Flight time is an important feature to consider, depending on your specific needs. A longer flight time means, of course, longer flights, but there can be tradeoffs. Longer flight times generally mean the battery takes longer to charge, and longer times are often only available in more expensive units. However, DJI drones are compatible with exchangeable batteries, allowing you to swap out batteries in under a minute and send your drone back out. You’ll have to buy additional batteries separately.","<strong>Connectivity &amp; Streaming</strong><br/>Many drones offer a variety of connections for streaming. By connecting to mobile or GSM network, you then allow a camera drone to stream from almost anywhere, though there may be additional costs related to doing so. Wi-Fi generally costs less, but you must have connectivity for it to work. Some drones include a Wi-Fi repeater, which usually allows for connectivity up to about 350 feet from your phone.","DJI Phantom drones are automatically connected to either their remote controller or your mobile phone via the companion app. Amongst other features, this allows you to see a live view of whatever your drone can see, provided it has a built-in camera. This feature makes it easy to take photos or to preview photos or video before you upload and share them.","<strong>Accessories</strong><br/>DJI Phantom drones generally come with all the basics you’ll need to start flying right out of the box. Along with the drone, you’ll also receive a basic case for travel and storage, a remote controller, a battery, propellers, a microSD card and a myriad of cords. Of course, you can always order additional or better accessories, like a backup battery, a larger microSD card, a stronger carrying case or back-up propellers. Be cautious of buying third-party replacement components, as they may not be a good match and cause issues with or prevent flight.","<strong>Warranty &amp; Customer Support</strong><br/>Warranties for DJI Phantom drones vary depending on the model as well as the specific part of the drone in question, such as the motor, camera unit or battery. Typically, warranties for this line last between six and 12 months, though certain drone components – frames and propellers – generally aren’t covered by warranty. It is worth noting that drone warranties rarely if ever cover accidental damage, as is specified directly on the company’s website. For more information, you can contact DJI’s customer service directly, via live chat, email or phone, or you can peruse the FAQs section or community user forum on the company’s website."]},"id":"fb528b25-efc7-4b1f-ba97-d8608d845694","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Legal Considerations"},"id":"bb0d43cf-6e7f-4a1d-84ad-116e120c8867","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A word about regulation, for our U.S. readers: Drones occupy a unique space somewhere between traditional aircraft and remote-control toys. The Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) regulations currently do not apply to hobbyists. If you’re purchasing a drone for business purposes, check on local and federal regulations; these are changing as the FAA moves to create a space for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the National Airspace System. The FAA requires registration of many drones flown in the United States, whether for recreational fun or commercial use. Operators of certain drones, especially operators using drones for commercial purposes, may be required to have a license. The agency is also considering limiting flights to daylight hours, and other proposed legislation includes requiring the drone to hover below 400 feet and within sight of the personal controlling it. Be aware that changing regulations for drones are in the works, and check local and federal guidelines before flying your drone.","Drones are an exciting technology, especially with the increasing number of affordable units becoming available.
