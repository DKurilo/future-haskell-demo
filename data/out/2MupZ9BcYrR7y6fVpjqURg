As a video game console, it plugs into your television with an HDMI cable, but unlike other micro-consoles, it can play both physical and downloaded games. The most interesting aspect of this console is its ability to act as your family’s PS4 streaming device. Rather than buying a second PS4 or moving your console from TV to TV, the PlayStation TV can remotely access the PS4 within the same network and play games. However, you cannot access many video streaming services, and the PlayStation TV requires an expensive Sony-made Vita memory card. While the console has some great ideas, it fails to offer a remarkable experience.","The big double-edged sword of the PlayStation TV is its gaming capabilities. The micro-console is able to play many PlayStation Vita Cards and downloaded PSP and PS One Classic games. However, there are major compatibility issues, so you’ll have to look online to see if you can actually play the games you’re interested in. Also, the console can remotely access a PS4 through Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Naturally, an Ethernet connection is preferred, but if you don’t want to wire an Ethernet line through your house, you can connect wirelessly. When connecting through your wireless router, expect some lagging.","Perhaps the best gaming feature is its ability to access Sony’s PlayStation Now service, a game streaming service that allows you to buy a membership or rent games online. Sony promises to continue to grow and expand the Now service with more games across the entire PlayStation library. Again, the streaming capabilities are tied to your internet quality, but we didn’t notice any compatibility issues with the Now games we tried.","If this is your primary home console, you’ll be disappointed to know that you cannot access any video streaming apps at the time of this review. You won’t be able to watch movies on Netflix, stream shows on Hulu Plus or browse Amazon Prime’s new original programming. The only video app we saw was Sony’s free service, Crackle, which has some great original programs, but it’s disappointing that Sony launched a PlayStation-branded device that doesn’t have access to major streaming apps."]},"id":"e399437f-2908-41c0-9bee-c7a9f643d1aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d30e5729-ba5d-4f4d-b81b-7a19a3f50aad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony PlayStation TV is an interesting idea, allowing users to stream PS4 games, play PS Vita Cards and access PlayStation Now.
