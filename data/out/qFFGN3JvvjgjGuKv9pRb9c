This 8-inch <a href=\"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital photo frame</a> stood out in our digital photo frame reviews because it&#39;s truly a snap to set up and use. It doesn’t offer the extras you’d find in more expensive frames, but it does a wonderful job showing slideshows, family-movie clips and playing music.","<strong>Value</strong>","This frame sells for about $60, but we were also able to find it selling cheaper on Amazon at the time of our testing. Since the Aluratek doesn’t offer a ton of internal storage space, you might want to invest in a designated USB or SD card so you can play even more images.","<strong>User Experience</strong>","Our test photos looked quite nice on this digital photo frame&#39;s screen. We asked testers to look at an assortment of photos from a variety of sources, including one that was originally a slide, one that was scanned in as a paper print and one smartphone photo. Our reviewers noted Aluratek&#39;s colors were a little dimmer than those of other electronic picture frames, but comparable overall. If you prefer brighter photo colors, check out the <a href=\"/pix-star-review\">Pix-Star Foto Connect</a>.","There is very little reflection on the screen, and you can see the pictures from many different angles. The frame&#39;s ability to display video in addition to pictures is a nice benefit that lets you share videos of your kids or grandkids on a much larger screen than most smartphones.","<strong>Specifications</strong>","Although you cannot connect wirelessly to your photos on your social media accounts with this Aluratek frame, you can always save those photos on a storage device and then save them to the unit&#39;s internal storage. The 4GB of allotted space is pretty average. The size of your photos makes a huge difference in how much you can store, but 4GB gives you more than enough space, especially since this device allows you to access many more photos on portable storage devices like jump drives and SD cards.","<strong>Display</strong>","The eight-inch frame offers a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels, which is on the low side. A better resolution would be 1024 x 768 pixels. This frame also offers an aspect ratio of 4:3, which is the most common and works well for displaying videos. While the images showed up clearly enough, some of the colors were muted and didn’t show the photos to their best advantage. Still, this is something that you probably wouldn’t notice unless you were comparing two screens side-by-side.","<strong>Versatility</strong>","Adding music to a slideshow can evoke even more memories than photos alone, and this frame allows for that with its built-in speakers. You can either listen to music from the music menu or have your favorite songs play in the background of your slideshow. If you no longer wish to listen to the songs, you can turn the volume all the way down using the buttons on the back of the device or the included remote. There are also nice extras like a built-in clock and calendar.","We found this frame very easy to use. We had it out of the box and showing photos in seconds. The included remote responded quickly and allowed us to navigate the menus with ease. In the interest of energy savings, there is a timer that lets you set this frame so it&#39;s not projecting photos to an empty room in the dead of the night. You can also set up the motion sensor so it stops the frame from showing photos when no one is in the room.","There are 11 different photo transitions to choose from, and you can display each photo for as little as three seconds or as long as one hour. The ability to display the frame on the wall would make it even more versatile, but there is no pre-drilled hole for that. It would be best on a desktop or shelf.","Aluratek stands by this product with a one-year warranty and several options for customer service. You can ask questions by chat, telephone and email. The website answers a lot of questions too, with product descriptions and FAQs pages."]},"id":"a47d9e56-a746-4123-bc7f-f9ae14815e5b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70062","url":"/aluratek-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-02T19:33:17Z","datePublished":"2018-07-02T19:33:17Z","name":"Aluratek 8 inch ADMPF108F","synopsis":"The Aluratek ADMPF108F is a basic unit that offers decent photo quality and a super simple interface.
