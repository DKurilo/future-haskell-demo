ACM became part of the Swissquote Group after the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) denied ACM a license. FINMA then approved Swissquote Group to purchase ACM. ACM has headquarters in Geneva, with branches in Zurich and Dubai. This forex trading product is not available to U.S. citizens.","This foreign exchange broker offers 60 currency pairs to trade, plus gold and silver. You pay for your trades on the spread between the bid and ask prices. The bid price is the price that buyers are willing to pay. The ask price is the price at which sellers are willing to sell. Swissquote is a market maker broker and it is not an ECN broker. It supports leverages of up to 100:1 and fast trading strategies such as scalping. The spread offers vary based on your initial deposit and also by global news, market conditions, illiquid market conditions and transaction size. Margin rates range up to 4.50%, depending on the total open position amount.","If you are already used to MetaTrader 4, you can use that trading platform. It lets you program automatic trades and trade directly from the charts, and it has strong charting analysis. If MetaTrader 4 is a bit too advanced for your situation but you like the idea of trading from software on your PC, you can use Advanced Trader, which has an interface that you can customize. If you are not at your own PC, you can use Web Trader from any browser. ACM also has a smartphone application for any mobile phone with internet access. Called Mobile Trader, it lets you manage your account in real time and place forex orders directly on the market. It has a few reporting capabilities. There is a special version of Mobile Trader specifically for iPhones.","Support is available from this forex broker by chat, email and telephone. Swissquote also supports telephone order placements. For research and analysis, Swissquote publishes daily forex news, daily snapshots, market-analysis tools and basic education topics. Their website is available in eight languages including Spanish, Russian and Arabic."]},"id":"5d035b1d-800a-4b85-a100-8bd195de3662","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cf8cfd99-8a75-4c4b-ac3e-5f4c86baeeed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In the past, FINMA would not license Advanced Currency Markets as a forex broker.
