iBall wireless trailer hitch camera is a <a href=\"/best-backup-camera\">backup camera</a> with a specific purpose and an extremely simple setup. You attach the camera to the back of your vehicle to help you hitch to your trailer. Unfortunately, the iBall backup camera provided disappointing results in our tests, so if you’re looking for an easy-to-install backup camera, we recommend the <a href=\"/quickvu-backup-camera-review\">QuickVu</a> instead.","The iBall system comes with the camera, monitor and a USB charging cable. The camera has a rechargeable battery that takes about eight hours to charge and can last for three hours of continuous use. The iBall camera attaches to the back of your vehicle using a magnet. The 3.5-inch LCD monitor is attached to a posable arm that you plug into the 12V (cigarette lighter) outlet. The system pairs via Bluetooth automatically, so you get immediate video feed. One missing feature that would have been helpful is an on-screen distance scale.","Of all the backup cameras, the iBall is the easiest to start using. It isn’t meant for permanent installation, which is both good and bad. The good is that it’s extremely easy to set up whenever you want to use it. The bad is that it isn’t wired into your car for power, so you have to remember to charge it. The magnet on the camera is sturdy, though we aren’t convinced it would be strong enough to stay in place should you forget to take it off and then drive down a bumpy road. The camera is housed in a sturdy, water-resistant plastic body, and it has a 120-degree viewing angle.","The iBall uses a 5.8GHz wireless signal that reaches up to 25 feet. This frequency works with Bluetooth-enabled cars. Our tests showed visual distortion and static at much shorter distances. Plus, the camera’s night vision is only okay – its range is limited to what’s immediately illuminated by your reverse lights. Overall, the iBall’s actual performance was poor. For the price, you can find better products that are useful both for hitching and other backing-up situations."]},"id":"b752bd9b-fa0d-4bab-9a5b-60493c21188e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60121","url":"/iball-wireless-trailer-hitch-camera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-04T17:12:58Z","datePublished":"2014-08-04T17:12:58Z","name":"iBall 5.8 GHZ iBall Wireless Trailer Hitch Camera","synopsis":"The iBall wireless trailer hitch camera is a backup camera with a specific purpose and an extremely simple setup.
