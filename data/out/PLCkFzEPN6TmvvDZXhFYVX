It is simple to install and use, but it lacks many of the extra conveniences that most other car seats offer. It is compatible with a few Safety 1st strollers, and it is easy to get the carrier in and out of the car, thanks to the stay-in-car base. However, the seat has a low weight limit, the materials feel flimsy and the base only has two reclining levels.","In order to hit retail shelves, all car seats must pass federal safety tests. This infant car seat is rated to support a child as light as 4 pounds, the typical weight of a premature baby. Unfortunately, when your child reaches 22 pounds or 29 inches, you&#39;ll have to get a new car seat. A baby usually reaches this weight and height at a year, and since the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you keep your child in a rear-facing car seat until he is 2 years old, you&#39;ll have to buy another infant car seat or a convertible car seat.","At 9 pounds, the Comfy Carry Elite Plus is a light car seat, so you shouldn&#39;t have trouble transferring the car seat from its stay-in-car base to a stroller. It is compatible with a few Safety 1st strollers, including the Ease and the Saunter series. The canopy has a Velcro latch to keep the fabric from flapping when in its fully collapsed position. The adjustable carry handle is like most standard handles.","While all this does make the seat a convenient addition to your life, there are some aspects that are bothersome. The seat uses an adjustable base, but it only has two reclining positions. If neither works for you, you&#39;ll have to use pool noodles or a phone book to adjust the height. Also, the cushioning is very thin, so it does not provide your baby enough padding. And since the cushions aren&#39;t machine washable, you&#39;ll have to clean any messes by hand."]},"id":"44f075f6-a6c1-4b94-bc2e-54191cf5ea2e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8a2fdb48-d4b5-418e-b80a-ef61bc5e2dc5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Safety 1st Comfy Carry Elite Plus is a basic baby car seat with all of the safety features you need, but it lacks many of the extras that are standard in most other seats.
