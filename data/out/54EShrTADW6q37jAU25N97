This online business backup solution offers extreme security, a huge number of machines allowed per plan and other features that make it especially useful for growing businesses needing extra protection for their computers.","<strong>Online Business Backup Services: What to Look For</strong>","If you operate a company, online business data backup should be among your fundamental concerns, regardless of company size or the amount of information you house on your computers. The following are the most important things to look for when comparing business backup services.","<strong>Storage Capacity</strong><br/>Not everyone needs limitless cloud storage space, but not having to worry about exceeding the limits of your account has its benefits. Some business-cloud-storage providers imply endless storage space but in fact require you to pay significantly higher rates or even add additional licenses to your account before they grant you more storage.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>Keeping your data secure is a crucial feature of a good online backup service. Data should be encrypted prior to leaving your computer and should be safeguarded against attack once it reaches its destination. The best small business backup solutions also house your data in two separate locations for added security.","<strong>What is Geo-Redundant Storage?</strong> Online backup services store to physical servers, but those with geo-redundant storage store data on two server farms. Thus, if a natural disaster or other problem takes down one, your data is still safe. When looking at geo-redundant storage, ask the locations of the server farms; after all, it&#39;s hardly worth storing on two servers if they are across the street from each other.","<strong>Note on PCI/DSS encryption:</strong> While 128-bit bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is acceptable and 256-bit SSL better, these are outdated systems. The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, which sets the standard for transferring private data on the internet even beyond the credit card industry, is upgrading the standard to TLS 1.0 or greater.","<strong>Backup Features</strong><br/>Look for backup services that let you choose when data backups occur. If you have more than one computer in your business network, look for sharing features and the ability to connect more than one computer without having to purchase additional licenses. Find out how long after deleting a file you have to recover it, how many previous versions are retained and whether you can revert to older versions of updated files.","<strong>Remote Access</strong><br/>If you use your smartphone or tablet for business purposes, having remote access to your cloud-stored data is crucial. Look for a comprehensive mobile experience, such as remote access and editing from a mobile device. Some services even let you back up your smartphones as well.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>If you operate your business 24 hours a day, look for services that offer 24/7 support so you can minimize your downtime. Also pay attention to how thorough a service&#39;s online knowledgebase is, the presence of training videos or how-to documents and forums.","Business backup services are more than an insurance policy against disaster. In addition to safeguarding critical business data, many provide you with useful administration tools that help you manage workflow and make daily operations run more smoothly. Be sure to scrutinize all of the features a service offers before making your final decision.","<em>Contributing Reviewer</em>: Jill Bowers"]},"id":"a3a744f9-6512-45e1-bb22-132a150c5f00","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a67ad39d-7ff7-4b97-8985-4f5f8aa9b532","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/computer-equipment/remote-data-backup/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">OpenDrive</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-6723205-12821557\">CrashPlan</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/computer-equipment/remote-data-backup/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">Backblaze</a>","<a href=\"https://www.carbonite.com\">Carbonite for Business</a>","<a href=\"https://www.idrive.com/idrive/signup/el/bobs80\">IDrive</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/computer-equipment/remote-data-backup/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">Dropbox</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-6723205-10755519\">SugarSync</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-6723205-10570888?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acronis.com%2Fen-us%2Fbusiness%2Fbackup-advanced%2Fworkstation&cjsku=138558\">Acronis Backup</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/computer-equipment/remote-data-backup/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Microsoft Azure</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/computer-equipment/remote-data-backup/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788\">OneDrive for Business</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b7ad1e6e-b864-46af-8ea3-3cd225511f9e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1019","url":"/best-business-online-backup-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-27T21:41:56Z","datePublished":"2016-12-12T23:53:53Z","name":"Business Online Backup Services Review","synopsis":"Business online backup services do more than just protect your data.
