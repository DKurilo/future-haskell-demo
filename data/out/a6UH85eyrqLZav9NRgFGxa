These methods are on the cutting edge of our continuing technological revolution. Unfortunately, technological innovations have a way of leaving previous technologies awash in their wake. A prime example of this is VHS tapes and DVDs. There hasn&#39;t been a major VHS release since 2006, and DVD is also on its way out as a viable home media standard.","However, if you have a large library of old VHS tapes and DVDs, you don&#39;t want to give up all that media yet. You need a player that allows you to enjoy these media formats even amidst all the new entertainment technology. Some electronics manufacturers still produce DVD/VCR combo players. These units not only play, record and archive your old media, but they also alleviate the problem of having two separate players for DVDs and VHS cassettes. Combining the DVD player and VCR simplifies your entertainment center. Whatever your reasons for buying a DVD/VCR player, it&#39;s a great way to combine the future and the past into one package that&#39;s easy to use. "]},"id":"48c782ac-b877-44d3-a541-771b5205eaaa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"DVD/VCR Combo with the Best Connectivity"},"id":"91c4768e-d607-48cd-8712-87e5fe0a32bc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The familiar connectivity options on DVD/VCR combo units include tried-and-true methods such as coaxial and component connections.
