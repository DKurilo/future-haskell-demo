There are a few other ideas for reducing sound that we tried as well, and all of them helped, at least a little.","<strong>Use a dish towel</strong>","Placing your blender on a folded dish towel and wrapping it in another dish towel can lessen the total amount of sound. This is a pretty common tactic and it did reduce sound output when we tried it, although not by that much. In our testing, sitting blenders on a folded dish towel reduced sound output by an average of 1 decibel.","<strong>Choose a blender with less power</strong>","Sacrificing overall watts and blending power is generally a bad idea, but there is no denying that the less powerful blenders are quieter, and some of them still do a decent job of blending fully frozen fruit and other tough stuff. If sound is a very high priority, it may be worth considering a more mellow blender as you make your buying decision.","<strong>Position it farther from the wall</strong>"]},"id":"05833952-69e6-4f62-bb3d-af160782ff0f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Cf8NTfeq7h8LRVkuvE8vUb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"One minor change can make at least a small difference.

That might make it seem counterintuitive to blend your morning smoothie the night before. If you give it a good shake in the morning, you will still get basically the same effect but without waking up the neighbors. If you like the little frozen chunks of fruit that you get in a fresh smoothie, that might not work for you, though.","Even relatively quiet blenders generate quite a bit of sound. The quietest blender we tested still produced as much sound as a vacuum cleaner, and most of the units we tested were much louder than that. If you live in close quarters and want to keep neighbors and family members happy, it might be worth some effort to dampen the sound, or at least wait to blend until everyone is awake.
