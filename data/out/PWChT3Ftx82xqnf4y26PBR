We surf the internet, send emails, play games, socialize and send instant messages. Computers have become an integral part of our way of life. That is why it is crucial they are performing at their best and functioning at their fastest speeds. To keep your device at its peak, it is vital you perform regular maintenance on the computer. If you want to speed up your computer and optimize its performance, you should be using PC system utilities software. One tool offered on many of these <a href=\"/best-pc-system-utilities-software\">PC system utilities software</a> products and additional software programs is the ability to defrag your hard drive. Below is some essential information you should know about defragmentation and why it is so important to your PC s health.","<strong>What is Fragmentation?</strong>","When you save your data and files, your computer finds any available space on your hard drive and stores the information. If you don t have enough space on your hard drive for a file, the file is fragmented or split into pieces. Over time, these pieces of information are strewn around the hard drive, which eventually slows down the drive and the speed of your computer. When you defrag your hard drive, you are putting these pieces back together and clearing the scattered file clusters.  This process organizes and rearranges your hard drive and makes the bits of data easier for your computer to find.","<strong>Why Do I Need to Defrag My Computer?</strong>","As you add and delete files on your system, you might not realize you are creating a large mess on your hard drive. As you first begin to write files, they are stored in a single area of available space. But as those files are deleted, they leave holes of available space that will eventually fill with new files. As new files are created they fill in these holes and take up any additional space. Eventually, your computer has to search your entire hard drive to find complete files, thus slowing down the computer. When you defrag your computer you not only increase the speed of the computer but you also keep your hard drive healthy and extend its lifespan. The wear and tear of fragmentation will eventually shorten its life but with proper maintenance you keep it running smooth and steady.","<strong>Benefits of Defragmenting Your Hard Drive</strong>","Defragmenting your hard drive can be a time-consuming process, especially if the process has not been completed on a frequent basis. Although, there are several benefits of defragmenting your hard drive that make the process well worth the time. One of the biggest reasons for defragging your hard drive is you&#39;ll likely experience faster speeds and less loading time. When your files are not scattered but are stored in one place, they load faster and your whole system speeds up. Your computer can sort and locate files much easier. This process also clears up all unused space and gives you more available space for storing files. It&#39;s especially important to defrag your computer before you download and install any large files or applications onto your computer. This helps protect your hard drive and the newly installed piece of hardware."," "]},"id":"2e2e2d41-2b79-4311-8c5e-9dc49338ea98","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6055","url":"/defragmentation-keeping-your-hard-drive-happy","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"courtnie-packer","url":"/author/courtnie-packer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Courtnie Packer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"XeLDpnf8mohkN8LhxKwS3h","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-31T17:21:43Z","datePublished":"2011-05-31T17:21:43Z","name":"Defragmentation: Keeping Your Hard Drive Happy","synopsis":"Most of us use our home computers on a daily basis.
