Since this program doesn’t have a wizard, it might not be a good choice for anyone who feels daunted by computer programs. This software only offers basic transition effects and doesn’t include any clip art. The interface is clean and uncluttered so you’ll be able to find what you’re looking for quickly. Most importantly, we found the final image quality to be crisp and true to color. Thankfully, it is one of the few programs that is both Mac and PC compatible.","When using this software, we counted more than 50 transition effects, though many of them are repeats of the same effect just coming from a different angle. While there isn’t a lot of variety in the types of transitions available, they are still professional looking. You can control the length of time to display each slide and add video clips and text captions. We were able to record a narration track and play it, along with multiple music tracks and sound effects, throughout our slideshow, which made it more unique. When we exported our show, we found the picture quality to be one of the best we’d seen. The lines were crisp and the colors had maintained the integrity of the original images.","This slideshow creator does not offer clip art or illustrations, which most other programs do. People who want to make simple, unadorned slideshows will find this program very helpful, but if you want a program that provides more creative features, consider purchasing <a href=\"/proshow-review\">ProShow Gold</a>. If you make a mistake, you can easily undo your previous action. However, if you want an application that can guide you through the process of making slideshows, PicturesToExe lacks a step-by-step wizard, so it might not be the best choice.","You have the option to share your slideshows online immediately using YouTube, but there is no direct way to post to Facebook or Twitter. You can also create DVDs and interactive CDs, and you can watch the slideshows on certain mobile devices. When creating your DVD, the program helps you create a movie menu, complete with your choice of music and a background image or themed template.","If you have any questions or concerns while using this software, PicturesToExe is quick and detailed in its support. We sent two separate emails and received detailed replies within 24 hours. Support representatives are knowledgeable and respond quickly. However, the lack of telephone support is a drawback.","You can find answers yourself using several tutorials and articles available on the PicturesToExe website. There are also forums available online, and if you have any questions regarding tasks or features, a user guide is available with the software.","PicturesToExe lacks embellishments and clip art, but it&#39;s a feature-filled application with many audio tools you don&#39;t find in lower-ranked slideshow applications. There is a wide selection of input and output options. PicturesToExe can help you create high-quality slideshows to help share your memories."]},"id":"bd3f3769-1595-48bb-9fc8-38b971093e17","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5037d44-a0f2-4cd5-90fc-c6cbab3a82e9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["PicturesToExe lacks embellishments and clip art, but it&#39;s a feature-filled application with many audio tools you don&#39;t find in lower-ranked slideshow applications.
