Along the top, there are several silver buttons for quick access to frequently used apps and features. Five are programmable, while the fixed functions include media, mute, play/pause and volume control. There are also buttons for My Favorites and the onscreen calculator.","The tilt of the keyboard is adjustable to meet your specific preferences. There&#39;s a removable riser that elevates the front of the keyboard with the intention of reducing the angle of your wrists. If you prefer the rear to be raised, there are feet that fold down to do that. The keyboard lies nearly flat on your desk when neither the front nor back are raised. A padded wrist rest adds comfort to any orientation you choose.","The mouse features Microsoft-proprietary high-definition laser technology. It is exceptionally responsive and accurate. It also has a four-way scroll button for up, down, left and right navigation. All five buttons on the mouse are customizable using the software that is included in the package.

Our one complaint about this keyboard is with its space bar, which is tighter than necessary and occasionally seems slightly unresponsive. That is irritating in a keyboard that is designed to make typing easier.","The mouse&#39;s design is more radical. You control a typical mouse with your hand palm down on top of it. The mouse in this set is grasped from the side with your hand in roughly the orientation that you&#39;d use to shake hands. As such, your hand is supported by your desk and can move in a more natural fashion, reducing fatigue and discomfort.","The mouse&#39;s comfortable use is especially important because it&#39;s a hefty piece of hardware that&#39;s larger and heavier than most mice.
