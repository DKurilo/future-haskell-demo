Even 20 pounds can be heavy if you’re swinging it around near the ground for hours. Yard care veterans also know how important a big engine is – when it comes to string trimmers, engine size matters. The Poulan PRO PP033 Curved Trimmer brings the best of both worlds – a 33cc engine and a total weight of only 12.5 pounds. That’s the biggest engine of all the <a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">weed whackers</a> we reviewed although the machine weighs in at number five in terms of heaviness. This means pro-level torque from a weed whacker that&#39;s light enough to use all day. It’s a great basic model.","The Poulan PRO trimmer is also powerful enough for attachments such as blowers, hedge trimmers and edgers. In fact, the string trimmer can be fitted with attachments from its manufacturer or other manufacturers including Weedeater, Craftsman, Troy Bilt, John Deere and Homelite.","The Poulan PRO trimmer comes will the features you need, from a dual line exit to trigger control, a debris shield and bump feed system. However, it lacks the head rotation and customization features characteristic of the best string trimmers on the market, so it may be difficult to use for young or small operators.","The 51-inch curved shaft of the Poulan PRO grass trimmer is one of its best features because it helps compensate for the large engine in terms of balance. However, the curved shaft means that the machine may be too short to reach under porches, decks and playground equipment.","The grass trimmer’s 17-inch cutting swath is also a winning feature, especially for the price. Such a wide swath means that only one pass will be required for most weed trimming areas. Furthermore, the black-and-yellow machine can be used by both right-handed and left-handed operators.","The Poulan PRO features a SureFire engine designed with quick starting capabilities so you won’t eat up precious time by pulling the starter cord over and over again. However, you will be required to mix oil with gas for fuel because it has a two-cycle engine. You will also need to use tools to replace the spool of line and you won’t get the benefit of anti-vibration technology.","The best feature of the Poulan PRO trimmer might be its capacity to work with attachments from other string trimmer manufacturers. That means that almost any attachments you have from an older model will fit. You won’t lose your tool investment be switching to Poulan PRO. We found the following attachments that will work."]},"id":"c5c9abc5-e105-4168-beb0-e5205fc267c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["An edger for your sidewalks","A harness to help distribute the machine’s weight","A brush blade and weed blade, included with purchase","A hedge trimmer for your shrubbery","A cultivator for your garden","A pole saw for tree care","A blower to help clean up green waste"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6580c477-4699-46d3-b3ab-fa80612c4b91","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Unfortunately, your new Poulan PRO grass trimmer may eventually require repairs and maintenance.
