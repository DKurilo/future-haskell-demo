Its intelligent core delivers natural sound quality, designed for mild to moderate hearing loss with a range of zero to 65 decibels.","With its nearly invisible design, this discreet digital hearing aid sits deep in your ear canal delivering sound right to the source. It lets you choose the custom fit that works best for you. This hearing aid comes with six differently-sized domes, or end pieces, so you can get a comfortable fit. If none of them work for you, you&#39;ll find additional sizes and shapes available through the manufacturer. Its wax guard features prevents ear wax from getting into the aid and disrupting the sound. The wax guard does occasionally need replacement, and this hearing aid comes with several.","The Uno is designed to automatically adapt to the listening environment youâ€™re in to deliver crisp sound without having to touch a button. It has eight channels and features feedback management and noise control to filter out unwanted noise. The Uno has a memory program that you can customize to your specific hearing loss. This hearing aid is not water-resistant and should not come in contact with water, moisture or extreme temperatures.","When you buy the Audicus Uno hearing aid, it comes with everything you need, right out of the box. It includes a user manual, a hard protective clamshell case to store it when not in use, a variety pack of domes, size 10 Audicus batteries, a cleaning brush with a magnetic end to remove batteries, an ear wax guard wheel with multiple replacements and an insertion tool. It also comes with a 45-day money back guarantee and unlimited tune-ups as well as a one-year warranty against manufacturer defects. And, Audicus offers audiologist access and on-demand support to help you with your purchase or to answer any questions or concerns you may have.","This nearly invisible hearing aid delivers natural sound with a noise-control system to help filter unwanted noise. The Audicus Uno is not IP-rated for water, much like <a href=\"/simplicity-hi-fi-review\">Simplicity Hi Fi EP</a>, <a href=\"/pro-ears-review\">Pro Ears Pro Hear</a> and most hearing aids, use and offers little protection against dust and dirt particles. A basic hearing aid, it does not have advanced features such as wireless, Bluetooth or smartphone connectivity, nor does it have directional microphones or a telecoil option."]},"id":"bc285b48-55a4-4d28-818d-f760b695cebb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66644","url":"/audicus-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-21T20:46:00Z","datePublished":"2015-08-21T20:46:00Z","name":"Audicus Uno","synopsis":"The Uno is a completely-in-canal (CIC) hearing aid that provides a customized fit.
