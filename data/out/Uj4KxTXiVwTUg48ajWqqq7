If you prefer one that produces steam with the push of a button, consider the <a href=\"/bissell-powerfresh-review\">Bissell PowerFresh</a>.","The Light &#39;N&#39; Easy was average for cleaning, but when you consider the price, it’s pretty impressive. It out-cleaned four competitors in our tests, including one that costs more than double its tiny price.","Even if it took more passes to clean our stuck-on messes, it was great in other ways. Its average cleaning head temperature was the hottest of the mops we tested. The Light &#39;N&#39; Easy&#39;s extra hot temperatures mean it has a better chance at killing bacteria, and dust mites than most. Killing that stuff without the use of any chemicals is one of the best things about owning a steam mop.","This is certainly not the most user-friendly option. You have to physically pump the handle the whole time you are cleaning. This gets old really fast. Also, the tank isn’t removable, so you have to take it to the sink or refill with the included pitcher. And the head doesn&#39;t swivel, so it is harder to get around obstacles than with other mops.","It can clean for 19 minutes per tank, which is impressive, especially considering it has the smallest tank. It uses water perhaps a little too efficiently – a little more moisture might have cleaned the messes faster. But that also meant it left floors relatively dry compared to some others. Not having to wait for the floor to dry is nice in a busy household."]},"id":"e6ca300d-6083-40ab-9040-d0fd6d35acc8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2f2348bd-a6fe-4bb9-93b1-812ae4e60f56","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is a lot of value in that price, even if you do have to pump the handle to get it to produce steam.
