In addition, we review over 16 auto tech categories each year, ranging from car alarms and car stereos to baby car seats and car battery chargers. We spend hundreds of hours each year researching, testing and evaluating the best in-car technology.","I&#39;ve been reviewing car tech since 2013, covering audio, radar detectors, backup cameras, Bluetooth car kits and more. Throughout these years, I have logged thousands of miles on road trips. I have a deep understanding and interest in cultivating the best quality drive. For most people, like myself, this means you should upgrade components with aftermarket devices, like in-dash navigation systems, to get exactly what you want out of your ride.   ","With a category like in-dash navigation systems, I bring over two decades of experience using and evaluating audio equipment. These devices are car stereos as much as a they are GPS navigators, and it takes someone with experience to understand and evaluate the specifications that make or break the performance.","<strong>How Much Do In-Dash Navigation Systems Cost?</strong>","In-Dash navigation systems combine voice-guided directions and GPS maps with a full entertainment system for your vehicle. They have DVD players and video outputs for backseat monitors. They also act as the central stereo for music, radio and hands-free calling. As such, these in-dash navigation receivers typically cost between $200 and $550. Lower priced systems are often older models, and they tend to have lower quality displays and outdated maps. System with the most up-to-date maps are closer to $500.","<strong>What We Tested </strong>","Despite the narrow nomenclature, in-dash navigation systems don&#39;t just provide directions. They are entertainment systems, car stereos, hands-free calling devices and a display for rear-view camera. In other words, these devices are a centralized computer for your car. They even have CPUs and RAM. However, this means the installation process is complicated and time-consuming, which makes testing these products challenging.","Instead of comparative testing, we devoted our efforts to researching user reviews. We consulted with reviews on Amazon, Crutchfield, manufacturer websites and more. Admittedly, user reviews aren&#39;t the most reliable source, but by curating such reviews and looking for patterns in what people like and dislike, we can get a good picture of how most people feel about the product.","We also compiled and evaluated the available features and specifications. Most of these products have the same specifications and features, so we had to discover which minor differences were most significant to consumers. We placed significant weight on important features, like display, power output and the points of interests. It&#39;s not uncommon for a product to excel in one area while being average or poorer in another area. These variances helped determine our picks.","<strong>What to Consider When Choosing an In-Dash Navigation System</strong>","Navigation<br/>The GPS navigation that these systems use are a bit different from the GPS apps you have on your phone. Both will get you to your destination. They are maps that are programmed into the device with specific graphics and locations. Most of these systems only work in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Some come with points of interest to help you find parks, gas stations, restaurants, air ports and other important locations.","Some of the best in-dash navigation units come with a traffic receiver that can give you updates about the upcoming traffic on your route. Others, however, make you rely on your smartphone data to get that information.","Multimedia<br/>Before smartphones, in-dash navigation was typically just a device with programmed GPS maps that gave you step-by-step directions. But with smartphones becoming ubiquitous devices featuring GPS apps, these devices have had to adapt and offer more. So, it makes sense for this technology to marry with AV receivers – a device that plays music and video. In fact, many of the products we reviewed are arguably more AV receiver than in-dash navigation system.","We considered the built-in amplifier&#39;s power output and audio specifications, the number of channels that the systems have and the video outputs. With the best in-dash navigation system, you should be able to entertain your kids with a movie in the back while getting directions to grandma&#39;s house in the front.","We also looked into the smartphone integration. We valued systems that make you a safer, more aware driver. As such, the smartphone integration features need to take the phone out of your hands and put the controls on the steering wheel so that you keep your eyes on the road. Integration with voice assistant apps like Siri are essential, as is Bluetooth for hands-free calling.","Many of these in-dash units are compatible with add-on peripherals like headrest monitors and backup cameras. This allows you to centralize all your electronic devices into a single interface, optimizing your ability to adjust various settings and get the information you need while paying attention to the road. You can also opt to connect the device to your steering wheel to keep audio volume buttons on the wheel functional.","Interface &amp; Display<br/>Regardless of price point or feature set, the best devices have an intuitive interface. Because navigation GPS devices are primarily used while you’re driving, it’s critical for the interface to be designed with a touchscreen and easy to read controls that allow you to make changes and access features without taking your attention away from the road for long. One way to gauge this is to compare it to using a car stereo – it should be as easy to use as a car stereo.","Installation<br/>In-dash navigation systems can be single- or double-din, referring to the amount of dash space required. We reviewed only double-din systems because these offer a better display. A single-din unit is typically the size of your vehicle’s CD player or radio interface, and double-din takes up twice the space. However, not all devices have clean-cut sizes and not all devices fit into any car. So, it&#39;s important to make sure it&#39;s compatible with your car before you purchase. Even if it is compatible with your car, you may need to purchase a harness or brackets to make it fit properly.","It&#39;s worth noting that these aren&#39;t easy devices to install, unless your car already has a double-din car stereo or an in-dash navigation system that you&#39;re replacing. Removing your dashboard is not for the faint hearted. It likely requires special tools and wedges and some force. We recommend a professional installation, but if you feel confident enough, the manuals do include installation instructions though they won&#39;t be specific to your vehicle. ","Display<br/>Large display screens make it easy to see navigation and menu options, especially if you’re looking at a glance while driving. Most screens are roughly 6.2 inches, measured diagonally, though some are as large as 7 inches. Larger screens can also make it easier for your kids to watch a movie on the screen from the middle or rear row of the vehicle. Likewise, the screen resolution is an important factor to consider. Higher resolutions mean a crisper picture.","For long road trips, especially those where you’ll be driving through the night, consider a GPS unit that allows you to adjust the brightness of the display, or one that specifically offers a Night Mode function. This feature adjusts the brightness of the screen in comparison to that of the time of day, so your eyes aren’t constantly straining and adjusting as you look between the road and the screen.","Storage<br/>For data storage, such as music or map files, a few devices come with integrated memory, though many require you to provide your own SD card or USB drive for storage.
