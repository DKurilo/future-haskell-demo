The SKIL 5780-01, however, does not have this problem.","The saw has a spindle lock, which allows you to replace the blade quickly and with only one hex key, which is convenient. You can store the hex wrench on the tool itself, so you don&#39;t have to worry about losing it and having to track down another one. The saw also comes with a soft carrying bag that can protect the tool from direct weather and makes it easy to transport. Unfortunately, the tool does not come with a rip fence to help you make quick, consistent cuts over and over again. Also, the saw only has a 6-foot cord. This isn&#39;t a huge detraction, as you will want to use this tool with an extension cord anyway.
