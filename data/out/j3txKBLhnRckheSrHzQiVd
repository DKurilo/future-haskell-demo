It works a little differently than other online video game stores. You can pay more to receive higher priority in the system and play the games you want when you want.","A value package is available if you’re only interested in renting older titles for older consoles. You pay a low monthly fee to receive one game at a time. Boomerang won’t give you access to the newest releases, but you can rent games for the Wii, PSP, Xbox 360 and older titles from newer consoles. There are other membership plans that let you borrow up to four games at a time if you devour games quickly.","Boomerang offers thousands of titles in its game library, so you’re likely to find games you want to play. You can browse the titles by console and narrow your choices by category, genre or suggested age. Categories include recommendations from the rental service, most popular and newest releases. Boomerang breaks up the games by genres such as Action &amp; Adventure, Arcade &amp; Puzzles, Fighting, Flight, Kids &amp; Family and Racing. You can also choose to view titles that are suitable for ages 3 and up, 7 and up, 12 and up, 15, 16 and 18. Alternatively, you can search for a specific game title in the search bar at the top of the site.","Just like other online video game rental services, you receive the game in the mail, play the game and then send it back in the prepaid envelope that comes with your game. The difference with Boomerang, though, is that there’s really no telling which game you’ll receive. You choose the games you want to play and then list them in order of priority. If your top choice isn’t available to send to you, you’ll get the next on your list.","A unique feature of Boomerang is its Payback Points. You earn points when you rent or buy games. You can then use those points to get extra rentals, free months or money off of another game purchase. Additionally, if you have to wait to receive a game, the system awards you Payback Points for every additional day you have to wait.","All of the details of membership plans and perks that members receive are explained in Boomerang’s support section. There’s also a FAQs section with answers to the most common questions. You can also call or email the support team, or interact with them on social media.","Boomerang Rentals offers thousands of game titles for rent or purchase, and it has several unique membership plans that cater to the casual or hardcore gamers of the U.K."]},"id":"601696a8-1732-43ba-9110-71e209b001ea","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68654","url":"/boomerang-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-31T15:17:26Z","datePublished":"2016-10-31T15:17:26Z","name":"Boomerang","synopsis":"Boomerang Rentals is the biggest online video game rental service that caters to the United Kingdom.
