The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">Gas Grills</a> here.</em>","The Weber Spirit is a great mid-range gas grill that cooks meat evenly, locking in the juices and flavor. We really liked the flat grates that are spaced just right, so you won’t lose any hamburger patties through the grates, and it leaves a sear pattern that looks like it’s straight out of a Weber advertisement or a barbeque magazine.","Weber grills have gained a well-deserved reputation for reliability. The Weber grills we tested affirmed their quality and were some of our favorites. The Weber Spirit, however, got off to a rough start in testing. When we did our heat testing, we suspected a regulator problem because we couldn’t get it to pre-heat to much more than 400 degrees Fahrenheit. We were nonetheless impressed with how evenly it cooked the bread that we placed on the grill during our test.","The next day, however, we had an entirely different experience when we heated the grill for our meat test. It heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit in nearly half the time it took to get to 400 F the day before – 12 minutes as opposed to 20. Even with the improved time, it took longer to heat than the average grill, but the wait was well worth it. Once it was ready to grill, it performed much better than average. It cooked thoroughly and evenly across the grill. The porcelain-enameled cast iron grates nicely locked in the heat – much better than most of the stainless steel-grated grills we tested. The meat, with its attractive sear pattern, was tasty and moist.","This isn’t the most spacious grill we worked on, but we were still able to fit 20 burgers on the primary heating area. The warming tray was smaller than many of the other products in our gas grill reviews, only accommodating up to five buns. The grates cleaned up more easily than most other surfaces we worked with, even other porcelain-enameled cooking surfaces. This is a mid-range grill that is very affordable when compared with some of Weber’s higher-end units, and it’s well worth the money.","There is a fuel gauge inside the grill that tells you how much fuel is in the tank, so you should never have the inconvenience of running out. The side burner is a nice feature that consolidates your cooking area into one place, and you can sauté vegetables and cook side dishes. The grill also has some storage underneath. The tank sits in a hole in the bottom of the base. Since it sits on the ground, you will need to detach the tank and remove it from the base if you need to move the grill.","While this is a sturdy, well-constructed grill, some of the materials are not of the highest quality. The main burners and side burner are stainless steel, but the door and rear of the stand are painted steel and the base is made of plastic. The lid over the burners, like the grates, is porcelain-enameled and the handle is plastic, which has the benefit of not overheating.","While some of the materials may seem lower end, they are well made. As long as you keep it covered while it’s not in use, this grill should last many years without rusting. The stainless-steel burners are backed with a generous 10-year warranty, and the parts have an above average two-year warranty. The cooking grates have a five-year warranty.","The Weber website has an extensive FAQs page that features information about gas grills and charcoal grills. If you can&#39;t find the information you&#39;re looking for, the website&#39;s search feature can help you find information quickly. You can reach customer support via phone or email."]},"id":"27481e17-0db8-4885-82d9-94e20fa54ff0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bbaf7801-bf69-4143-91fe-35e900dc45b9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Weber Spirit gas grill effectively cooks all kinds of food and provides an overall great grilling experience.
