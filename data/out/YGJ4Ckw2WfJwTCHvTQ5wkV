While easily portable, this <a href=\"/best-space-heaters\">industrial space heater</a> only heats small work areas and buildings and requires an outlet to run, which makes it well suited for construction sites, commercial workshops and remodeling, rather than for daily use.","A quiet propane motor makes this industrial space heater suitable for running all day when a constant loud motor might become annoying. Because it is quiet, you can place it out of the way and play music over it if desired. The propane industrial space heater does not come with its own propane tank but does work with any 20-pound tank, allowing you to connect it to tanks you either rent or own. If you connect it to a non-portable propane tank, you do need a pressure gauge and valve for adjusting the pressure output. The motor runs for up to 12 hours on one 20-pound tank. However, this industrial heater only runs on propane rather than multiple types of fuel, which reduces its versatility.","An included 10-foot hose and regulator allow you to place the propane tank a safe distance from the heater to reduce the risk of an accident. You also have to plug the heater into a 120-volt power outlet. The factory-installed high-limit switches, thermoelectric safety valves and automatic overheating shutoff make this industrial space heater safe to use in most environments. Piezo ignition also reduces the risk of accidents or fume ignition.","A top handle makes this unit very easy to carry around a jobsite. The forced-air heater pushes hot air out of one end, allowing you to point it in the direction you want to heat. With a 38,000 BTU per hour capacity, the unit can generate a lot of heat, but with no fan, it only works in a maximum space of 800 square feet. The lack of a fan makes it suitable for use outdoors if heating very small areas.","The Mr. Heater MH38QFA offers highly portable forced-air heating suitable for a wide range of small areas and projects. However, with no ventilation and no fan, it is better suited for well-ventilated areas rather than enclosed areas such as basements."]},"id":"5b182951-c58c-4e95-8a96-e9d5303c21c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66823","url":"/mr-heater-mh-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-04T20:59:37Z","datePublished":"2015-09-04T20:59:37Z","name":"Mr. Heater MH38QFA","synopsis":"The Mr. Heater MH38WFA plugs into a 120-volt outlet and a 20-pound propane tank and heats up to 800 square feet for 12 hours.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Mr. Heater MH38WFA plugs into a 120-volt outlet and a 20-pound propane tank and heats up to 800 square feet for 12 hours.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-04T20:59:37Z","id":"YGJ4Ckw2WfJwTCHvTQ5wkV","meta":{"title":"Mr. Heater MH38QFA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Mr. Heater MH38QFA is a forced-air propane industrial space heater for areas of up to 800 square feet.
