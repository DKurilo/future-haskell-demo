Even though it’s a single band device operating within the 2.4GHz, it can support multitasking and transferring of large files. MIMO, or Multiple-Input/Multiple-Output is responsible for increased range and the virtual elimination of dead spots that could plague previous wireless products. The technology takes advantage of reflected radio signals and reuses them in a way that greatly improves performance.","Owing to the Wi-Fi Multimedia feature, WMM, the adapter allows for user-defined prioritization of various data streams. This allows the most important information to get through without being overridden by less important data.","Like other single band adapters, the Zonet doesn’t operate in the 5GHZ frequency band. There are a couple of disadvantages as a result. First, the 2.4GHz band is crowded with numerous wireless devices including those that use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as well as radio frequency remote controls. Additionally, household appliances like microwave ovens tend to encroach on this band. Devices operating in the 5GHz range have few competitors for bandwidth and tend to operate interference free. The higher band is also better able to transmit data that require high bandwidth like streaming video and voice applications."]},"id":"41adf9f4-2957-417d-aa0d-ba591ea05438","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Security"},"id":"b3edfaf6-279e-45c1-87df-eeb269ffbe23","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Every available step to prevent unauthorized network access and to protect sensitive information is in place with the Wi-Fi n standard.
