While it features an LCD monochrome screen more commonly associated with simple bicycle computers, the Rox has advanced bike GPS capabilities such as navigation and ANT+ sensor compatibility.","The navigation system on the Rox is often referred to as breadcrumb navigation. You should not confuse breadcrumb navigation with the turn-by-turn map-based navigation found on some high-end bicycle GPS units. Before your ride, you preload the Rox with a course that you want to travel. During your ride, you will see a line representing the path you should follow. The line displays for a mile out from your bike, and the Rox displays your distance away from your destination plus your directional heading. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"a6163373-40a4-47d6-bb5e-cd9fff88b5d0","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Rox has all the basic features of a cycle GPS, including speed, time, temperature and elevation measurements. The altimeter on the Rox is pressure based, which means it will be more accurate than a GPS-based altimeter. You can upload all this ride data from the Rox to online cycling networks such as Strava. This allows you to analyze your ride, compare with friends and view a map of where you rode.","The Rox features a backlight to illuminate its LCD display in low-light conditions. The Rox features IPX7 water resistance; it can resist submersion in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. This means you can ride in the rain without worrying about the water affecting the Rox. The 13-hour battery life is good enough for most rides, although if you plan to cycle long distances or competitively, you might wish for more. You can recharge the Rox with the included micro-USB cord.","One of the best things about Sigma Sport is its YouTube channel, which has dozens of support videos showing you how to get the most out of your Rox. The Rox also comes with a one-year warranty, to give you peace of mind about your investment."]},"id":"1816d24f-3810-4d7a-aa18-7430b64aef93","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7513658b-e716-4ae7-b053-371d3c3a8c46","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Rox&#39;s greatest strength lies in its high level of functionality when compared to its price.
