Some police and highway troopers use radar guns that include an &#34;Instant-On&#34; or &#34;Pulse&#34; feature. With Instant-On, the radar signal is in a standby mode and does not leave the gun until the officer releases it – usually at the moment your vehicle is within 200 to 300 feet. Because these radar guns do not transmit a constant radar signal, they can be more difficult to detect.","The Beltronics GX65 includes an Instant-On detection feature. It is important that you understand that the Instant-On feature will not protect you from getting a ticket if the officer has targeted your vehicle. If your car is in range and the Instant-On gun is aimed at you, your speed is already measured by the time your detector gives you an alert. However, if an Instant-On radar gun is being used on other cars in the area before you are in range, the GX65 will alert you so you can adjust your speed.","Some law enforcement agencies are using radar guns manufactured by MPH Industries that include POP mode. When a radar gun is in POP mode, it &#34;pops&#34; out a short radar burst and quickly measures the vehicle&#39;s speed in about one tenth of a second. The GX65 includes a POP detection feature that accurately alerts you when POP radar is in use. The product will only detect POP if you activate the feature.","We have seen statements from several manufacturers of radar detectors indicating that you should not worry about POP because law enforcement are to use POP only to get a speed estimate and not to issue tickets. However, we believe that you should take POP radar seriously because we are not sure how many police officers will volunteer the information if they used POP to track your speed.","The Beltronics GX65 radar detector includes a multiple threat display feature that displays information when signals from multiple radar bands are detected at the same time. For example, if it detects signals from the X, K and Ka bands at the same time, the display shows all three threats.","Because law enforcement rarely uses the X band these days, the Beltronics radar detector includes a feature that allows you to disable one or more bands. You can use this feature to disable the X band to reduce false alerts. In addition, the GX65 includes an AutoScan feature that automatically adjusts the detector&#39;s sensitivity to X and K bands based on your driving environment. If you are driving in more densely populated urban areas, the detector automatically reduces the sensitivity to X bands to eliminate false alerts.","To keep you from constantly looking at the radar detector’s display to interpret radar alerts, the detector includes Voice Alerts. A voice alert gives you all the information you need without the need to take your eyes off the road, or the need to memorize different alert tones. For example, if a Ka band emission is detected, the radar detector will tell you in plain English what type of band it is, which will help you arrive at your destination more safely."]},"id":"997a9dc8-8d83-4bf1-adbb-2eb79f79c7a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Controls"},"id":"f51c9791-46eb-41a1-bcc8-cda9a1e97baa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/GQPLVDkEcfkWG9wUX9rUd8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Some states are starting to place fixed traffic enforcement cameras, or speed cameras, along interstates and other highways. Many of these cameras are placed immediately after a posted reduced speed limit. If you think that you are safe if you just go with the traffic flow, you are not. The speed cameras take a picture of any car traveling 10 or more miles per hour above the speed limit, and then a speeding ticket is sent to your house. If these speed cameras use radar, the GX65 radar detector can easily identify them. However, pavement sensors trigger these cameras, instead of radar. The sensors measure the amount of time it takes a vehicle to travel from one sensor to another. If you are going too fast, a photo is taken and you are mailed a ticket. Radar detectors will not help you in this instance.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/50839-beltronics-gx-6514.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GQPLVDkEcfkWG9wUX9rUd8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"GQPLVDkEcfkWG9wUX9rUd8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GQPLVDkEcfkWG9wUX9rUd8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"048e9b0d-c835-4286-af8d-a2c5f86d3ffe","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Beltronics radar detectors use the Defender Database to track the location of speed and red light cameras.
