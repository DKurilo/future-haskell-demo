In addition to 3D printing, the ZEUS can also scan, and it has a built-in computer with Wi-Fi and installed slicing software. All three functions work together to make an all-encompassing creative workhorse.","During our tests, we found the ZEUS has decent print quality, even though it has such a small print capacity. Its test prints all printed quickly, with excellent surface quality and straight corners. We also found that when printing in PLA, which is the standard filament, the quality is better if you leave the door open. Better air circulation results in a better print. With the door closed, models had problems with layer shifting, warping and Pisa-style leaning.","This small printer only has a 5.9 x 8 x 6-inch print volume, and it’s technically even smaller since its circular bed offers less square footage than a traditional square print plate. It’s really more of a turntable, like you’d see in a microwave, which does make it easy to remove models. It&#39;s easier to remove this print plate than it is on the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/makerbot-replicator-plus,review-3979.html\">Makerbot Replicator+</a>. ","The AIO Robotics ZEUS prints mainly in PLA but not in ABS since the print plate isn’t heated like it is on the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lulzbot-mini-3d-printer,review-2744.html\">Lulzbot Mini</a>. However, the company does offer specialty filaments such as PETG, wood and coffee. We also found that AIO Robotic’s proprietary PLA is some of the cheapest printer filament you can purchase without sacrificing quality. You can shop around, though, as the ZEUS proudly accepts any universal filament cartridge, as long as it can fit in its handy side door compartment.","The onboard computer makes slicing and printing much easier than with many other 3D printers, which require more components. The large screen is almost tablet size and allows you to touch, zoom and move models and settings around like you would on any other device. The full-color screen and accompanying software let you modify the files you download or access through a flash drive, which makes the ZEUS truly wireless – you don’t even need to turn on your computer. We also found that this home 3D printer has a fast startup time, so you don’t have to sit around waiting for the first layer to print.","AIO Robotics offers online video tutorials, FAQs, a manual, free downloads, and phone and email support information on its website. A 12-month warranty and lifetime customer support are also included, which is more than most of the other printers we looked at come with."]},"id":"92cb02a8-c5af-47eb-8171-34921512a46a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7611510-4067-41cb-bf6b-907a9ea83c95","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AIO Robotics ZEUS is one of the best 3D printers, and it’s an efficient solution to having a separate scanner, slicing program and 3D printer.
