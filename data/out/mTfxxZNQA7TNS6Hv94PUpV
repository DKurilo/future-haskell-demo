This is because Blink is the only home surveillance camera in our review that uses visible white light to illuminate the scene at night. Not only can people see the light, but unlike the infrared LEDs found on systems like <a href=\"/foscam-review\">Foscam</a>, the light doesn&#39;t have even coverage of the area you are recording. That said, there was excellent video quality 20 feet from the camera. Within 10 feet and past 30 feet, the light isn&#39;t bright enough. The biggest issue with Blink&#39;s nighttime video recording is that any moving objects show up as indiscernible blobs of light, making identification of people almost impossible."]},"id":"5a5efdf8-f4c7-4da9-ac2a-12fafb88faac","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/EDXBXHReWdbsxwNi28Abz6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68979-blink4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EDXBXHReWdbsxwNi28Abz6.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"EDXBXHReWdbsxwNi28Abz6","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EDXBXHReWdbsxwNi28Abz6.jpg","alt":""},"id":"87520732-620c-4875-abd3-429100089d36","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Blink really stands out in usability. This is the only camera in our review that can connect to your wireless network using Wi-Fi alone, without an Ethernet cable, which speeds up the installation process to a couple minutes, whereas other systems take 10 minutes or more to set up. The battery-powered cameras are easy to connect to the sync module, and you can install them anywhere inside your home. While Blink has announced an outdoor version of the camera, it&#39;s not yet available. To control the cameras, you use the mobile app on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.","Blink only records video when it detects motion, and there is not a continuous recording feature. You can use the app to set the length of the video clips and download them to your device for offline viewing as well. The system comes with free cloud storage for up to 1GB of video; there aren&#39;t any paid plans available to upgrade this storage, though. If you need to get technical support from Blink, you can only contact the company via email. The system has a one-year warranty."]},"id":"1d1bb86d-52e8-48ed-8087-425ae3be0eda","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69013","url":"/blink-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-01-12T17:43:56Z","datePublished":"2017-01-12T17:43:56Z","name":"Blink Three Cameras + Sync Module","synopsis":"The Blink wireless home surveillance system is very easy to use.
