On both the GMRS and FRS frequencies that we tested, the clarity steadily declined as we increased the distance.","While this walkie talkie was over 90 percent accurate at a half mile and 1 mile, when the range increased to 1.5 miles, that accuracy dropped to 60 percent and was even lower when the range increased to 2 miles.
