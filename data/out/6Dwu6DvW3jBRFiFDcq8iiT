In addition, do you need the robotic vacuum to be a pet hair removal specialist? Or maybe you need a system that can run for a particularly long period of time due to the size of your home?","While many of today’s best robot vacuums feature similar core functionality, certain models do lean towards specific specialisms, so we advise you to make sure that you know exactly what you need from a robot vacuum upgrade before you pull the trigger.","In addition, you must absolutely evaluate the layout and structure of your home, both in terms of the suitability of a robotic vacuum cleaner and where it can be docked. Remember that each robot vacuum comes with its own docking station (which often needs clearance either side to ensure optimal operation) where the machine charges up between cleaning runs, so knowing exactly where that can be placed should also be an important consideration.","Lastly, and while it may seem obvious to you, it is worth considering the structural layout of your home, as if you have a tall, multi-floored dwelling with multiple staircases then maybe a robot vacuum cleaner wouldn’t be the best option.","After all, these machines can’t climb stairs and while they won’t plunge to their doom thanks to automatic drop detection tech, if you want to leave the robot running while you’re out, or on a schedule to come on while you are at work for example, without the ability to return to their base station, you’re going to come home to a battery dead robot every single time.","Naturally, if you have an apartment this won’t be an issue, and from our personal experience it is manageable as well with a simple upstairs-downstairs arrangement, too, as running the robot on the secondary floor can simply be achieved while you’re in the house and can manually deposit and then retrieve the robot yourself. But for anything more complex then we’d suggest at the very least a combination of robot vacuum cleaner and traditional manual cleaner."]},"id":"15bb7823-026d-47f0-bacd-d51c2a31ba71","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/TPAdFBSDeRPJPVwJxSk8YG.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/robot-vacuum/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9NL0MvODEwODA0L29yaWdpbmFsL1JvYm90LVZhY3V1bXMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDFCLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TPAdFBSDeRPJPVwJxSk8YG.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"TPAdFBSDeRPJPVwJxSk8YG","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TPAdFBSDeRPJPVwJxSk8YG.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f610476c-fb7f-4512-b855-0527c04d4a60","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Who are the best robotic vacuum cleaner makers?</strong>","Here at Top Ten Reviews we consider the following companies to make the best robot vacuum cleaners. These are makers with proper pedigree and heritage in terms of building top robotic vacuum cleaners and by selecting one of their models we feel you are far more likely to make a great match for the cleaning of your home. The best robot vacuum cleaner makers are: iRobot, Eufy, Neato, iLife, Ecovacs, Samsung and Dyson.","<strong>How much does a robot vacuum cost?</strong>","You can expect to pay about $450 for a good robot vacuum cleaner, judging by the average price of the five bestselling units on Amazon, Best Buy and Home Depot. We tested products ranging from $150 to $500. You generally get what you pay for in this category, though our top pick was only the fourth most expensive. The most expensive ones were noticeably better in a few ways, though, in terms of suction and self-sufficiency. Generally speaking, you end up having to babysit the cheaper ones, and they don&#39;t pick up quite as much.","<strong>How long will roomba clean?</strong>","The robot vacuum cleaners we tested – including Roombas and other brands – can run autonomously for over an hour, averaging one hour and 40 minutes. We found that the more expensive machines don&#39;t necessarily run the longest. In fact, the robot vacuum with the longest run time is one of the least expensive, and a model that tied for the shortest run time is the third most expensive. Information about machines we researched but didn&#39;t test seems to back up the theory that you don&#39;t necessarily get a longer run time for a larger investment.","However, there are lots of features that matter at least as much as how long your robot vac can vacuum before returning to its station. If you have a few larger spaces and are worried a robot vacuum won&#39;t be able to cover them, check the manufacturer&#39;s website – they all make that information pretty easy to find so you can know before you buy.","<strong>Are robot vacuums good value?</strong>","The answer is yes, depending on a few things. First, it depends on whether you have pets. If you do, a robot vacuum is definitely worth it. Pet owners know that vacuuming and dusting regularly can keep pet hair under control for the most part, but no one likes to vacuum more than once a day or to follow their pet around with a vacuum cleaner – the only way to keep your home pristine if you have heavy shedders. Even the fairly mediocre robot vacuums we tried did a good job of keeping pet hair at bay. ","Second, it depends on where you plan to use it. Even our favorite robot vacuum cleaners struggled on carpeting. However, they were amazing on hardwood flooring. If you have a lot of hardwood flooring, a robot vacuum is a great investment.","Third, it depends on how you plan to use it.

Hardwood flooring is their specialty and the brushes are not stiff enough to scratch. We tested them on flooring in a 103-year-old home and the floors looked great afterward – not a scratch on them. There was some chatter online about how early robot vacuums could scrape hardwood flooring with their front wheel, but we have never had a problem, even after testing for hundreds of hours over the years with multiple models from many manufacturers.<br/><strong><br/>What&#39;s the best robot vacuum for hardwood floors?</strong>","Almost all robot vacuums do well on hardwood floors, including our best overall pick, the iRobot Roomba 690. However, in our testing, the <a href=\"/ilife-v3s-pro-review\">iLife V3s Pro</a> was even a little better at cleaning hardwood flooring. Carpeting is where robot vacuums sometimes struggle, at least on higher-pile carpets. They do fine on low-pile carpeting – the kind you find in offices.","&#34;The hard floor performance is usually going to be as good as an upright. The carpet performance usually is not quite as good as you see in an upright,&#34; said vice president of marketing for Neato Robotics, Stephane Maes.","That was definitely our experience in testing. The wood floors looked great post-test. A few of the vacuums got stuck on carpeting and were not able to clean it at all. Others took a few swipes at the carpeting but didn&#39;t get all the messes, or they just seemed to collect carpet fuzz more than anything else.","<strong>Keeping robot vacuums out of problem areas</strong>","Robotic vacuum cleaners are meant to take one chore off of your list, but your home may not be prepared for a robot vacuum to operate smoothly. These machines can be tripped up by cords, clothing, flooring transitions and much more. Designers have tackled these problems in a number of different ways. Here are some options for keeping robot vacuums away from danger zones:<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"c443b316-daad-4b19-b440-cb6b4827f341","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Virtual wall: </strong>Some units come with a small device that shoots an infrared beam across a threshold to keep the robot vacuum away.

But what about mopping? Can robot vacuums also mop hard floors? The answer is &#34;sort of.&#34; A few models allow you to attach a cleaning rag to the robot vacuum itself or a separate unit, which allows it to mop as it vacuums. In our latest comparison, there are only a couple robot vacuums that mop, including the <a href=\"/bobsweep-bobi-pethair-plus-review\">bObsweep bObi PetHair Plus</a>, and the ones we tested didn&#39;t mop very well – they didn&#39;t even come close to cleaning as well as a person with a bucket and mop can.","Generally, the mopping feature consists of a microfiber cloth you attach to the machine so the floor gets wiped down after it is suctioned off. Roomba takes it one step further by including a separate mopping unit – <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Braava-380t-Robot-Mop/dp/B00DCCYD6U/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">the Braava</a> – on some models, which makes its own rounds after the robot vacuum is done cleaning. We have not tested the Braava, but if it is anything like the other robot vacuums that integrate mopping, we have low expectations. Braava online user reviews are mixed. ","<strong>Tips for allergy sufferers</strong>","Even with their smaller proportions, robot vacuums have the potential to create many of the same problems as full-sized machines. Any type of vacuum can kick up a lot of dust, which can affect those with allergies and asthma. If you have allergies or asthma, it is worth a little extra effort to make sure the cleaning process won&#39;t make you sick.","Buying the right machine in the first place is a good starting point. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has not certified any robot vacuum cleaners as asthma and allergy friendly yet. There are at least a few models that boast strong filters, though, which should help in containing dust and other allergens. Some robot vacuum filters even rise to the level of HEPA (high efficiency particulate air), which meet U.S. Department of Energy standards for containing very small particles.

Floors eventually wear down, though; experts say carpeting lasts five to 15 years.

The rotating brushes of a vacuum cleaner, including those on robot vacuums, can contribute to the breakdown of fibers over time.
