Take a sample of what you need to a local hardware store and they should be able to match the piece.","<em>Wrench</em>","<em>Tape Measure</em>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2fd6e019-abaa-4936-b51d-d002eab3cb6a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong> </strong>","<strong> Installation Steps:</strong>"," "]},"id":"fc27b007-4937-4c4a-b287-fc97cb723c6b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Attach</strong>   Attach the wall mount brackets to the back of the TV.

When you take into account that the mount will be holding up to 180 pounds of prime entertainment, you don t want to bet your luck that the mount won t pull out of the dry wall. We recommend securing the wall mount into at least two studs. Use a high quality stud finder, one that locates the center of the stud. To make drilling into the studs a little easier, mark where you re connecting the mount to the wall and drill starter holes. Then hold the mount to the wall while drilling the screws into place. Recruit help if needed.","<em>Concrete</em>   Attaching a TV wall mount to concrete is possible. You obviously won t need to find studs, but you ll need a drill with a masonry bit to get into the wall."],"type":"ol"},"id":"ac45aa2b-9bc5-4044-860f-ef4e908935f3","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The best TV wall mounts come with detailed, step-by-step installation guides, but for those that don t, we hope these steps will assist in properly securing your flat screen TV to a TV wall mount."]},"id":"e8e0b51c-9463-4324-9b71-5ec80d3b106f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6696","url":"/how-to-install-a-tv-wall-mount","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-rose-johnson","url":"/author/anna-rose-johnson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Rose Johnson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"K8X8mra9tUQ8dFrjVwmdAP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-10-05T03:02:33Z","datePublished":"2011-10-05T03:02:33Z","name":"How To Install a TV Wall Mount","synopsis":"Investing in a flat screen TV usually means investing in a TV wall mount as well.
