Brother <a href=\"/best-sewing-machines\">sewing machine</a> can get you through whatever project you’re working on quickly and easily. At up to 850 stitches per minute, it’s one of the fastest machines we tested so skilled sewers will be able to speed through anything. And this speed doesn’t equate to deafening noise. This machine only registered 67.7 decibels in our tests. That is only a bit louder than normal conversation and similar to the noise level of the typical dishwasher.","The CS6000i has 60 stitch patterns, which is mid-range among the machines in our comparison, some of which top 100 stitch patterns. Regardless, even with 60 you have a lot of patterns to choose from including seven buttonhole styles. All the stitches have automatic settings which are accessible on the sewing machine’s LCD screen. Rather than having to manually adjust stitch width and length, you simply enter the number corresponding to the stitch you want and you can start sewing right away. You do still have the option to manually change settings if you want.","The buttons on this sewing machine can simplify the sewing process a lot. An integrated speed control slider means you don’t have to focus on how hard you’re pressing the sewing pedal. Instead, you can set it to the speed you want and continually sew at the same speed no matter how hard you press the pedal. There is also a start/stop button on the front of the machine so you can ignore the pedal altogether if you want. The Needle Position Key will move the needle to its highest or lowest point. This makes threading easier when the needle is in the up position and gives you a precise pivot point for tight turns if you send the needle to the down position. This machine also comes with a lot of the basics like an automatic needle threader, LED light, extension table and sharp thread cutter.","The four reviewers who used the CS6000i said it took a while to figure out how to use this machine but found the accompanying instructions very helpful. One had a problem finding the lever to lower the foot and another kept getting error messages when she switched between stitch patterns too quickly. Because of this, the sewing machine earned a D- for ease of use. It received a C+ for accuracy because some reviewers felt the factory setting tension was off. The straight stitch wasn’t very straight on denim and several decorative stitches resulted in puckering on cotton and satin.","This sewing machine comes with a bunch of extra feet: a buttonhole foot, overcasting foot, monogramming foot, zipper foot and several others. Only two other machines we tested came with more feet, the <a href=\"/singer-confidence-review\">Singer Confidence 7640</a> and the <a href=\"/singer-stylist-review\">Singer Stylist 7258</a>. A walking foot of this quality alone can cost upwards of $10, so all these extras can save you a lot of money in the long run. It also comes with a cleaning brush, bobbins and seam ripper."]},"id":"9b51dc61-0b3d-40ba-9ed8-77d75dde1cfe","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57843","url":"/brother-cs-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-22T12:54:31Z","datePublished":"2013-10-22T12:54:31Z","name":"Brother CS6000i","synopsis":"This Brother sewing machine can get you through whatever project you’re working on quickly and easily.","review":{"rating":72,"verdict":"The Brother CS6000i wasn&#8217;t a favorite among our reviewers but has a lot of sewing speed and a plethora of stitch patterns to choose from.","pros":["Seven extra sewing feet are included."],"cons":["Our reviewers noted a rather steep learning curve to use this machine to full advantage."]},"strapline":"This Brother sewing machine can get you through whatever project you’re working on quickly and easily.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","id":"y5x9iYo5WteGGQLTeJtSgM","meta":{"title":"Brother CS6000i Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Brother CS6000i wasn&#8217;t a favorite among our reviewers but has a lot of sewing speed and a plethora of stitch patterns to choose from."},"products":[{"slug":"brother-cs6000i","url":"/product/brother-cs6000i","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","name":"Brother CS6000i","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","id":"qef25qE32HWFyLn6QJaYek","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dPpLTeeFMKZwA4xDeNDZNf.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","mimeType":"","name":"e72658b51499f50d4aafd176637a60a4.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/e72658b51499f50d4aafd176637a60a4.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","id":"dPpLTeeFMKZwA4xDeNDZNf","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPpLTeeFMKZwA4xDeNDZNf.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Brother CS6000i Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Brother CS6000i wasn&#8217;t a favorite among our reviewers but has a lot of sewing speed and a plethora of stitch patterns to choose from."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dPpLTeeFMKZwA4xDeNDZNf.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","mimeType":"","name":"e72658b51499f50d4aafd176637a60a4.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/e72658b51499f50d4aafd176637a60a4.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","id":"dPpLTeeFMKZwA4xDeNDZNf","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPpLTeeFMKZwA4xDeNDZNf.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Brother CS6000i Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Brother CS6000i wasn&#8217;t a favorite among our reviewers but has a lot of sewing speed and a plethora of stitch patterns to choose from."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/brother-cs-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"crafts","url":"/hobbies/crafts","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","name":"Crafts","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:41:05Z","id":"TEqWQPbJNty8BgQqF8w88Z","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
