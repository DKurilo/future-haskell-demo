Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Dell 1355cn is a multifunctional <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> that offers color prints, a small design and a few standout features. The Dell 1355cn is a basic laser printer that doesn’t have any bells and whistles to make it standout among other printing devices, but it does offer an adequate variety of features to ensure you get quality prints, scans, copies and faxes. The multifunctional tools available on this printer are its standout features that advance this laser printer’s overall performance.","The printing features available on the Dell 1355cn are basic features you will find on any laser printer. This device offers a maximum print resolution of 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch). The prints from this device are fairly crisp and clear, but they aren’t as sharp as they could be.","This device features a 30,000-page monthly duty cycle. This means that you can print up to 30,000 pages without causing the printer to overheat or causing any serious technical problems. One large drawback to this laser printer is its printing speeds. This device prints black-and-white prints at a speed of 15 pages per minute and color prints at a speed of 12 pages per minute. This is a slow pace for most laser printers, and we like to see a speed of at least 24 pages per minute for both black-and-white and color prints with the printers we review.","One of the standout features available on the Dell 1355cn is its multifunctional options. This laser printer not only prints, but it also has the ability to scan, copy and fax. This device has Wi-Fi and Ethernet capabilities, making it an ideal device for networking to several computers. There is also an USB 2.0 port located on the device that makes printing from your flash drive or a camera easy.","The paper tray located on the Dell 1355cn holds a maximum of 160 sheets of paper. This is a drawback to this device, particularly if it is used in a busy office, because you may find yourself restocking paper on a frequent basis. This device has 128MB of installed memory, and is covered by a one-year warranty. This device is ENERGY STAR qualified and consumes a measly 320 watts of energy during use.","The design of the Dell1355cn is an advantage to using this laser printer. This printer is compact and has small dimensions. It is 16.1 inches wide, 13.3 inches tall and 14.9 inches thick. It weighs only 37.4 pounds, making it small enough for both home and office use.","There is a small LCD display screen located on the Dell 1355cn, along with 34 buttons on its control pad. One of the only drawbacks we found to the design of this laser printer is that its large control pad makes this printer more difficult to use, and it is somewhat difficult to control all the settings and features available."]},"id":"bf20223e-f0e2-44cc-91aa-3fcb1ab40f30","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"feeae8b1-569a-4a4f-bcd7-28ddb1e0f285","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dell 1355cn is a small multifunctional laser printer.
