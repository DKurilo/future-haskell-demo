Elderly people have specific needs and concerns that an alarm system should be able to address. For example, health and physical safety are key concerns, and many traditional systems don t commonly offer features like medical alert systems to address falls or other health emergencies. Additional features that prove significantly beneficial to the elderly include home automation and remote control access, aspects that give the owners greater control over the state of their home."," ","<strong>Medical Alert Systems</strong><br/>Burglaries and robberies are a common concern driving the purchase of home security for the elderly, but health is also a key concern. With each passing year, health emergencies are more likely to occur than home invasions. It is therefore critical that when considering security systems you look for options that offer a medical alert system. Although you could purchase a separate medical alert system, its integration with home security measures ensures that the elderly owners can further extend their independence.","Through the convenience of a medical alert system, senior citizens are always within arm s reach of a single-press button to immediately summon medical assistance in the event of a fall. These systems are monitored just like a security system, and some are equipped with impact sensors to detect when the wearer may have fallen.","<strong>Home Automation</strong><br/>A solid home automation system can help alleviate some of the stress of daily routines. To avoid the issue of forgetting to arm an alarm each night, for example, or even to assist in making the management of a home easier, this type of system can prove quite beneficial. It also lets owners program specific settings to keep temperatures within a certain range or to turn lights on or off at specific times.","<strong>Remote Control Access</strong><br/>A common concern among elderly retirees is their ability to get away from the home for vacations and trips to visit family. Through the use of remote control apps, they can remotely monitor their home and easily control specific elements such as lights, temperature settings and locks.","In addition to these features, ensure the home security system you choose covers all of the basics, such as motion sensors, door and window sensors, smoke detectors and so forth. Every aspect of the house should be protected against the threat of invasion as well as other dangers like home fires or gas leaks, incidents during which it is critical to alert elderly residents, who may not be able to get out of the house quickly."]},"id":"9c110616-ad99-47c5-b571-464402db0a58","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9310","url":"/which-home-security-system-is-best-for-seniors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-goodrich","url":"/author/ryan-goodrich","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ryan Goodrich","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"JiyjX3p6rgLpyZFxn2y77n","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-08T18:32:47Z","datePublished":"2015-04-08T18:32:47Z","name":"Which Home Security System Is Best for Seniors?","synopsis":"The best home security for seniors isn’t always the same as what is best for younger people or families.
