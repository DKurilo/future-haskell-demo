a store that sells almost every home item you could ever need, from dog food to mascara, Walgreens doesn’t have a huge selection of <a href=\"/best-contact-lenses\">contact lens brands</a>. While some websites have upwards of 40 to pick from, Walgreens has 21. This is the second smallest brand selection of any website we evaluated.","That being said, this website lets you select numerous boxes of contacts and compare them side by side, ensuring you get the best deal for what you need. While it doesn’t have the widest selection of brands to pick from, Walgreens does carry all the common styles of lenses out there like multifocals, torics, disposables, colored contacts and vial lenses. It lacks RGP lenses, which aren’t commonly available on similar sites, as you surely know if your doctor prescribed you this specific type of lens.","One thing Walgreens does well is provide a comprehensive eye care shopping experience. Much like Walmart, it’s a one-stop shop where you can get contact solution, antihistamine and dry eye relief drops. You can even pick up a few pairs of reading glasses to replace the ones you keep losing. While you’re at it, you can schedule a live doctor consultation online, refill your other prescriptions and learn about which Medicare and Medicaid plans Walgreens accepts in your state.","Walgreens gives you free shipping on any contact lens order, no matter how little you spend. More than half of the websites we evaluated offer this, including <a href=\"/coastal-contacts-review\">Coastal</a> and <a href=\"/walmart-contacts-review\">Walmart</a>. Free standard shipping through Walgreens takes about one to three business days after your prescription is processed, making it one of the fastest services we found. Keep in mind this is in the contiguous United States and shipping can vary by location and time of year.","You can avoid running out of contacts by getting a year&#39;s supply, which will also save you money on many brands and lens types. You’ll most likely be able to find some coupon codes to make your Walgreens order even less expensive. At the time of our evaluation there was one on the website’s homepage for 20 percent off. Still, when we did a price comparison excluding any promotions or sales, Walgreens did get a D- in affordability and doesn’t offer a price match program like some other sites do. You can return your unexpired","purchase if you ordered the wrong thing, Walgreens sent you an incorrect order or the product is damaged. There is no time limit stipulated on the Walgreens website, making it one of the best return policies we found. <a href=\"/1800contacts-review\">1-800 Contacts</a> also doesn’t put a time limit on contact lens returns.","The Walgreens website is easy to use and includes a live chat option as well. While it might not necessarily be the best place to order contacts, it certainly isn’t a bad place for one-stop shopping."]},"id":"064603b7-69a8-4451-82f9-be96c9be83ae","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48825","url":"/walgreens-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-02-20T20:33:58Z","datePublished":"2010-02-20T20:33:58Z","name":"Walgreens","synopsis":"For a store that sells almost every home item you could ever need, from dog food to mascara, Walgreens doesn’t have a huge selection of contact lens brands.","review":{"rating":57,"verdict":"Walgreens has a lot of eye care accessories but is lacking in lens brands.","pros":["You can compare boxes of lenses against each other."],"cons":["There are only 21 brands of contacts to choose from."]},"strapline":"For a store that sells almost every home item you could ever need, from dog food to mascara, Walgreens doesn’t have a huge selection of contact lens brands.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-18T00:00:00Z","id":"7URbLFXinAJCvjYQw747zk","meta":{"title":"Walgreens Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Walgreens has a lot of eye care accessories but is lacking in lens brands."},"products":[{"slug":"walgreens","url":"/product/walgreens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","name":"Walgreens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","id":"GrB6pFc2HzdFvWcpgcimJP","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BGJ6RRwRSogM56wTMBxn68.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"94a74f5f04473b7427a6e302f718451d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/94a74f5f04473b7427a6e302f718451d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","id":"BGJ6RRwRSogM56wTMBxn68","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGJ6RRwRSogM56wTMBxn68.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Walgreens Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Walgreens has a lot of eye care accessories but is lacking in lens brands."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BGJ6RRwRSogM56wTMBxn68.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"94a74f5f04473b7427a6e302f718451d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/94a74f5f04473b7427a6e302f718451d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","id":"BGJ6RRwRSogM56wTMBxn68","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGJ6RRwRSogM56wTMBxn68.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Walgreens Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Walgreens has a lot of eye care accessories but is lacking in lens brands."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/walgreens-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"personal-care","url":"/health-and-beauty/personal-care","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","name":"Personal Care","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:20:21Z","id":"N6Vr7FEXykAcbcKQHGXUJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
