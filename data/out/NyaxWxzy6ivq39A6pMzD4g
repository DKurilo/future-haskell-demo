You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The 1byone VP-0037 video doorbell makes it easy to use a touchscreen monitor to see expected and unexpected visitors to your business or home. The intercom function on the device’s touchscreen monitor makes it easy for you to communicate with visitors, unlock the door for them and even adjust sound options. Basic weatherproofing makes it ideal for mild temperatures and the small durable design is modern and compatible with most home décor styles.","This <a href=\"/best-video-doorbells\">video intercom doorbell</a> comes with a thin and stylish indoor monitor, which you can keep sitting on a surface or mount to a wall. The 7-inch color LCD display has a built-in speaker and will let you adjust the brightness, ringtone and volume. The touchscreen display gives you options that will let you view your video feed and communicate with guests without opening your door.","If you are busy when a visitor arrives, you can press a button right on the monitor to automatically unlock your door (if you have 12-volt electrical locks installed) so you don’t have to move. The night mode can capture night-time visitors on camera up to 13 feet away with the help of six LED lights around the lens. The camera also features a 90-degree viewing angle which will help you see all of your visitors and anything else on your porch directly on your monitor.","The video doorbell is only resistant to mild weather. A plastic rain-proof cover shields the lens lightly from water or extreme glare. If you are in an area with intense weather, this doorbell may not be the best option for your business or home, compared to others like the Skybell 2.0. The device is constructed from durable aluminum alloy, and has a special coating to help it resist oxidation.","The doorbell will replace your existing doorbell sound. It comes with 14 built-in melodic ringtones, so you can find one that fits you. You will also have full control over the volume of both the doorbell itself and the video intercom system talk volume.","You can install the system by yourself, if you choose to, as the system comes with all necessary components for easy installation, including a mounting bracket for the monitor, an adapter, screws and a 16.4-foot cable.","The 1byone VP-0037 video doorbell gives you control not only over viewing guests, but also over volume and doorbell ringtones. You can choose to chat with visitors through the intercom system, if you’d like to. If you have 12-volt electric locks installed, you can even remotely unlock your door for a guest, without actually going to the door, letting you have control over your safety."]},"id":"ee151b79-2f48-4bb8-b8e9-b6c6510b6ae8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64458","url":"/1byone-vp-0037-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-27T21:58:08Z","datePublished":"2015-04-27T21:58:08Z","name":"1byone VP-0037","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-27T21:58:08Z","id":"NyaxWxzy6ivq39A6pMzD4g","meta":{"title":"1byone VP-0037 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The 1byone VP-0037 video doorbell features a touchscreen monitor that lets you see and communicate with visitors and control sound and audio.
