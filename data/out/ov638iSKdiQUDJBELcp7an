This infant car seat keeps your child in a rear-facing position until he is up to 30 pounds or 32 inches and offers side-impact protection with its energy-absorbent foam. Unfortunately, in order to use a B-Series stroller, you&#39;ll have to buy an extra Click &amp; Go adapter. Also, the straps are harder to adjust than many other car seats we tested. The B-Safe has all of the features you need in a car seat, although we have seen better seats from Britax.","The B-Safe&#39;s energy-absorbent foam and side-impact protection keep your child secured in an accident. This infant car seat meets all federal crash safety requirements, utilizes simple LATCH connectors and works on an airplane. The car seat has an infant cushion insert for children as light as 4 pounds. Also, it will support a child up to 30 pounds or 32 inches, which is fairly standard for a rear-facing car seat. The average boy will outgrow this seat around his first year, while the average girl will stay in the seat until she is 15 months old.","The car seat has limited compatibility with strollers, but you can buy an extra Click &amp; Go adapter to make it work with several styles and brands of strollers. It has a simple stay-in-car base that allows for LATCH or seat belt installation. You can even secure the seat without its base. The carry handle is not the most comfortable handle that we reviewed, and the harness is difficult to use. The straps are difficult to tighten and loosen and sometimes get tangled. Also, the cushions are not machine washable.","Britax supports the B-Safe with a one-year warranty. If you lose your user manual, you can download a new one from the product page on the Britax website. Also, you can use the website to find a local retailer or contact customer service by email and phone. We were able to get a response to all of our questions quickly."]},"id":"158570c0-c710-4c98-aa70-a6af019bd7a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"41bd0d30-3268-413c-ae96-9e8d8e7b87fa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Britax B-Safe is an easy baby car seat with all of the standard features you need.
