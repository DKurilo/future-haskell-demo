Traditional document imaging methods use templates and algorithms in a two-dimensional environment to recognize objects and patterns. OCR methods today recognize a spectrum of colors, and they can distinguish between the background and the forefront in documents. They de-skew, de-speckle and use 3-D image correction in order to work with lower resolution images taken from mediums such as faxes, the internet and cell phone cameras.","OCR software uses two different kinds of optical character recognition: feature extraction and matrix matching.  Feature extraction recognizes shapes using statistical and mathematical techniques to detect edges, corners and ridges in a text font to identify the letters in a word, sentence and paragraph. OCR software achieves the best results when the image has the following conditions:"]},"id":"211eeabe-44fb-404b-9e61-9015b5938c9b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Is a clean, straight image","Uses a very distinguishable font such as Arial or Helvetica","Uses black letters on a white background","Has at least 300 dpi resolution"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4d015d57-09d7-406d-a89d-6c5ec51d2833","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["However, these conditions are not always possible.

It is included in software used by organizations such as law enforcement to recognize images in video feed. It combines feature extraction with similarity measuring. Similarity measuring compares images relative to others within the same image or document using complex algorithms and statistical formulas. It is able to recognize images within a spectrum of colors in a 3D environment. Using this technology, OCR software can recognize when images are crooked, have too much background interference or otherwise need to be altered in order to be read correctly. It is also able to better recognize images at a lower resolution.","Many OCR software packages today include features such as de-skew, de-speckle and the ability to change the direction of the page. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/omnipage-standard/\">OmniPage Standard</a>, rated number one by TopTenREVIEWS, includes a technology it calls 3D correction, which straightens images that were captured at an angle.","Traditionally, OCR was linked with scanning software. The software gathers clues from the scanning process to provide more accurate OCR results. But not all images are available to you in hard copy, and you may not always have a scanner. Some of the text you want to extract is only available in a PDF or other graphic file that you downloaded from the internet. Most PDF files you make today automatically include searchable qualities. Adobe Acrobat Reader, the free PDF reader you can download today, includes a cursor mouse pointer that allows you to copy a document&#39;s text onto your clipboard. Older PDFs don&#39;t let you do that. More advanced PDF software such as Adobe Acrobat Pro allows you to protect the text of your document. To extract the text, OCR software programs will need your password.","The best OCR software packages on the market today include an imaging technology called matrix matching, a form of artificial intelligence which combines feature extraction and similarity measuring. This technology brings new tools to optimal character resolution, including de-skewing, de-speckling and 3-D correction.","<em>Sources used in this article include &#34;OCR Primer&#34; on CVISION&#39;s website and a scientific paper on partial shape recognition published in the journal </em>Pattern Recognition."]},"id":"d5813553-5f41-40eb-897d-5cdff2ceba85","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5066","url":"/new-optical-character-recognition-technologies-improve-ocr-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"emily-sanderson","url":"/author/emily-sanderson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Emily Sanderson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"52DW2cAhVZe3fNYARpGZFN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-20T18:15:55Z","datePublished":"2010-10-20T18:15:55Z","name":"New Optical Character Recognition Technologies Improve OCR Software","synopsis":"OCR software has been around as long as computers have to connect the printed world with the electronic one.","review":{},"strapline":"OCR software has been around as long as computers have to connect the printed world with the electronic one.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-07T16:08:00Z","id":"gdfUhmZW86bsqtSpx9YV5W","meta":{"title":"New Optical Character Recognition Technologies Improve OCR Software","description":"New technologies in optical character recognition help OCR software read low-res images from faxes, the internet and cell phone cameras."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:54:53Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/uNpT4mn3yFbUx4AsnWafWD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:54:53Z","mimeType":"","name":"5066-new-optical-character-recognition-technologies-improve-ocr-software.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5066-new-optical-character-recognition-technologies-improve-ocr-software.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:54:53Z","id":"uNpT4mn3yFbUx4AsnWafWD","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNpT4mn3yFbUx4AsnWafWD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"New Optical Character Recognition Technologies Improve OCR Software","description":"New technologies in optical character recognition help OCR software read low-res images from faxes, the internet and cell phone cameras."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/uNpT4mn3yFbUx4AsnWafWD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:54:53Z","mimeType":"","name":"5066-new-optical-character-recognition-technologies-improve-ocr-software.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5066-new-optical-character-recognition-technologies-improve-ocr-software.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:54:53Z","id":"uNpT4mn3yFbUx4AsnWafWD","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNpT4mn3yFbUx4AsnWafWD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"New Optical Character Recognition Technologies Improve OCR Software","description":"New technologies in optical character recognition help OCR software read low-res images from faxes, the internet and cell phone cameras."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/new-optical-character-recognition-technologies-improve-ocr-software","label":"","tags":[]}
