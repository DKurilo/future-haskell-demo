One of our favorites is the Braun 760. This hair shaver has several built-in features that work to prevent ingrown hairs, like OptiFoil and ActiveLift technology. OptiFoil is a special type of foil on the blade that has different sized holes to compensate for hairs growing in abnormal directions – let’s face it, not all hairs grow with the grain! The ActiveLift option is actually a middle trimmer in the electric razor that lifts potential ingrown hairs that lay flat against the skin."]},"id":"cc86ac9a-2871-4580-8985-6d55a499ad71","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/zugHkJM9QV6XxLbqMDmPMJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"One of the problems when shaving your head is ensuring you get a close shave despite bumps and uneven surfaces.
