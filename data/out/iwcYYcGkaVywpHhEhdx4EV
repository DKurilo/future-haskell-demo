The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-treadmills\">Treadmill Reviews</a> here.</em>","The Life Fitness F3 Go is a folding treadmill with a strong focus on comfort. The F3 Go comes with an array of features to make your workout easy and enjoyable. This treadmill comes with few extras to stimulate you during your workout, though you can add some of them with an optional console upgrade. The warranty is more than enough to protect your investment, and the support options from the manufacturer are adequate.","The maximum speed of this treadmill for running is 10 mph, slower than the 12 mph average of the best treadmills. The incline follows a similar pattern, with a maximum grade of 12 percent instead of other treadmills&#39; 15 percent. There is no decline on this treadmill, though it has a reasonably powerful 3.0 CHP motor.","The running surface of this treadmill is 55 inches long and 20 inches wide, which makes it the shortest in our treadmill comparison. This shouldn&#39;t be a problem unless you are particularly tall. The maximum user weight for this motorized treadmill is 350 pounds, which is standard.","The F3 Go offers a variety of workout programs. In addition to the usual programs that come with treadmills, a random mode gives you an endless number of program variations for your routine. The FlexDeck shock-absorption system provides you with a comfortable, low-impact run. The heart rate workout programs let you use either the handgrips or the included wireless chest strap to monitor your heart rate.","Some of the features that other treadmills offer to enhance your workout are only available for the F3 Go if you pay for the upgrade. It costs extra to integrate speakers with an audio port for your treadmill so you can listen to music while you exercise, and to access interactive video workouts.","This treadmill easily folds up when not in use. It does not have any built-in cooling fans for comfort, but its simple interface makes adjusting settings easy. It also has an energy-saver feature that turns the machine off after five minutes of inactivity, and it wakes back up with the press of a button.","The warranties of the Life Fitness F3 Go help give you peace of mind. The frame is protected by a lifetime warranty, and the motor is covered for 10 years. Parts and electronics are each covered for five years, and all labor carries a one-year guarantee.","The technical support from Life Fitness, available via email and telephone, is enough to get you through any problems you may have. You can access a PDF user manual and a FAQs section on the company&#39;s website. The machine weighs 264 pounds and measures 78.5 x 34.5 x 58.5 inches."]},"id":"6f26c222-1d5e-43a3-8951-47446782b0c4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0f3802d1-8610-43b8-b2d2-30645afba204","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Life Fitness F3 Go treadmill is customizable and easy to use.
