The Wetterlings line of axes is an excellent investment, because with good care, they can be handed down with pride to the next generation of camping enthusiasts. Here, we highlight the Wilderness Hatchet.","This camping hatchet is 13 inches long and weighs a scant 1.2 pounds, making it a good choice for hiking and boating as well as keeping in the family cabin. Handcrafted in Sweden, it features a solid hickory wood handle. The head is made from recycled Swedish-carbon steel. It sports a hardness rating of 57, which is above average for most hand axes and within the hardness recommended for survival knives. This gives the axe its excellent chopping power.","Our testers at Active Junky was not able to test this particular model, but the things that impressed them most – design, attention to detail, and cutting ability – are common to all the Wetterlings axes. The Wilderness Hatchet is very similar in size and design to the Exhibition Hatchet, which our testers tested in the Appalachians. The curve of the handle has an elegance as well as a balance that stood out from other models in our lineup.","Our testers found that the balance and blade strength were terrific for chopping firewood; the hickory handle performed especially well in reducing vibration that can result in sore hands and muscle fatigue. Synthetic handles sometimes outperformed wood-handled axes in this regard, however. In addition to cutting power, these blades had the finesse for carving as well.","While these axes have heirloom-worthy qualifications, they also need care. The blades can be prone to rust and oxidization, so keep them safe. It also takes some skill to sharpen. The blade may need an initial sharpening when you first purchase it. The blade comes with a sheath that is reminiscent of a muzzle and covers the blade only. You may want to consider investing in a separate sheath that covers the entire head.","A good camping axe is important for any trip and survival kit, but with the quality of Wetterlings camping axes, it&#39;s also a tool that can become a family heirloom. These axes need some care, but are well crafted and stand the test of time."]},"id":"f34c6713-2268-44bd-be2a-00eb90fc019d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68366","url":"/wetterlings-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T19:08:06Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T19:08:06Z","name":"Wetterlings Wilderness Hatchet","synopsis":"Unlike appliances that seem designed for obsolescence, there's no reason a good camping axe can't last years or even generations.
