You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The name says it all – the Gyro Hercules Unbreakable remote control helicopter. Almost makes you want to crash it a few times, doesn’t it? Well it’s okay if you do, because Gyro advertises this as the world’s “first and only unbreakable RC helicopter.” The super polymer frame on the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">remote controlled helicopter</a> is designed to take up to 200 pounds of force. The tree in the front yard, the neighbor&#39;s dog or the 2-year-old – none will be a match for the strength and durability of this helicopter. However, the RC helicopter is still missing some features such as spotlights and alerts to let you know before you crash. Also, there is no camera on this model.","This remote control helicopter comes with one of the biggest advancements in remote control helicopters: a gyro. This helps stabilize the helicopter and makes it easier to fly. The Gyro Hercules Unbreakable helicopter is perfect for all skill levels, beginner to advanced, and comes with great features, such as the rear rotor for increased stability and precise movement whether you are flying or just hovering. When it comes to controlling, this unit can go in all directions: forward, backward, up, down, left, right, and of course, hover. If you want an easy-to-fly remote control helicopter that is stylish, this is an attractive option.","Coming in at 15 inches long, this RC helicopter is large enough to deliver on its durability promises. Children and adults will love being able to fly without having the upset of breaking their brand-new helicopter. It&#39;s generally appropriate for any age and skill level, but will be the most beneficial to children and younger pilots who aren’t the most skilled because even a few bumps or crashes will not end the flight – remember, it can take up to 200 pounds of force.","However, the construction is missing some of the advanced features that other units offer, such as cameras and spotlights. The basic construction is solid, but far from advanced.","This radio-controlled helicopter is built for basic flying. It’s simple to balance with the added gyro, but it lacks some of the advanced flying options. Performing tricks and even hovering in place can be a little more difficult with this remote control helicopter than with others. For basic and simple flying, it is a good option. Just don’t plan on performing in any air shows with it."]},"id":"1ff7f3f1-c066-4911-b92b-2518d429f1f3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8609d32a-3aca-4a02-8320-94da6fc07cda","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Gyro Hercules Unbreakable remote control helicopter is durable and simple to fly.
