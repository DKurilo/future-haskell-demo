You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The LG 55LM8600 <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TV</a> offers great picture and a thin, modern look.  While the main focus is on strong picture quality, the LG 55LM8600 also has some added perks that will impress you. However, be advised that while the picture quality and design are great, the sound quality and viewing angles leave something to be desired.","At 55 inches, the LG 55LM8600 will impress your friends while you&#39;re watching the big game or playing video games. The television itself is incredibly thin, measuring only 1.3 inches thick, and this slim design makes the entire unit light enough to hang on your wall. The television comes with a 13-inch stand, which will help keep your new LED TV from falling over if someone bumps it. The LG 55LM8600 also uses very little power while operating, so your power bill will not skyrocket by using this TV.","Unfortunately, the thin and light design sacrifices sound quality in its built-in speakers. These two 10-watt speakers produce weak sound and have trouble hitting all of the frequencies. If you don&#39;t already own some kind of sound system, we suggest buying a sound bar with this television to give you a little more muscle in the audio department.","The full 1080p screen features deep levels of black, and the Picture Wizard makes screen calibration a breeze. Unfortunately, this large LED TV has a disturbingly narrow range of viewing angles at only 65 degrees, both horizontally and vertically. The narrow angles lend themselves to front-end – rather than periphery – viewing. If you watch the TV very far from center, the images will get distorted. Like with many LED TVs, we did notice lighting from the edges. During dark scenes, this creates a grey frame around the edge of the screen.","We really like the Magic Wand Remote. It features  voice recognition commands as well as an instant 2D to 3D conversion button. The ability for point-and-click web browsing and keyboard typing make for easy navigation. On the downside, it lacks an input selection button. Also, its shape tends to let it roll if it&#39;s not on a flat surface. However, the remote&#39;s strengths easily outshine its few weaknesses. Gamers will love the Dual Play system. Using the Cinema 3D system, two players can escape into separate virtual worlds, with their individual polarized glasses, as two games are projected onto the screen simultaneously. The TV works especially well for 3D gaming, but it is also effective for other forms of 3D entertainment, like movies.","The LG 55LM8600 features four HDMI ports as well as composite, AF, AV, component video-in ports. There&#39;s also a PC input and three USB ports. If you would like to hop onto Netflix from your television, an Ethernet port on the back, as well as Wi-Fi capability, allows for high-speed communication with your internet router.","The 55LM8600 is covered by a one-year warranty. LG&#39;s website provides email support, FAQs, downloadable manuals and live chat. When we used the chat service, the representatives spent several minutes looking up the answers to our questions. If live chat is not your favorite way to talk to a support rep, telephone support offers you a chance to speak to a human being."]},"id":"22c35dac-17bf-4859-83bf-da0a87a8bd9c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"99476187-6b04-42ba-ac84-224e311fba58","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG 55LM8600 is a great unit if you&#39;re looking to upgrade into LED TVs, especially if you&#39;ve already set up your home theater and can supplement the TV&#39;s less-than- stellar sound system.
