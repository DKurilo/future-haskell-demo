You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Dell Studio XPS 8100 series of <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">home computers</a> offers an advanced set of features that is often reserved for higher end machines. They offer some of the most advanced processors available today and audio performance that is rarely seen except as a pricey option. They also feature faster RAM as standard equipment that is often seen only as an option and video performance that is more than expected in the base configuration.","In short, they offer performance at the entry level that most manufacturers reserve for higher end devices. That makes for a computer that is likely to meet the needs of everyone in the household. Still, there is a wide array of options that makes the computers customizable to more specialized requirements. Starting prices are quite reasonable and options are often available in money saving packages to help meet individual needs without breaking the bank."]},"id":"d79da02d-e2a0-4a09-83e2-b4df609b9850","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"abf9e331-1637-47e7-9209-14fccda8710e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We were pretty impressed right off the bat to note that even from the entry level, Dell Studio XPS 8100 computers are equipped with advanced Intel CPUs. The base processor is the Intel Core i5-650 which runs at a clock speed of 3.20GHz. It also has a pretty respectable 4MB cache which helps speed things along.","These days, however, one can’t just look at clock speed to determine which processor is faster than another. That’s because of multiple core technology which started with the Core 2 Duo processors which placed two cores on a single chip. We think that a brief primer on all of this new processor technology is appropriate at this point. For readers who already understand all of this, we beg your indulgence. It will just take a moment for the rest of us to catch up.","There are a couple of terms that are important to know in order to understand multiple core processors. The first is, not surprisingly, core. A core is essentially processor or CPU. A dual core processor puts two cores on a single chip <a href=\"http://www.tomsitpro.com/tags/quad-core/\">and a quad core processor</a> places four cores on a chip. It’s just like giving a computer two or four processors instead of one like we always had before multiple core technology came along. The other critical term is thread. Threads are like channels for data to pass along. They can be likened to lanes of traffic with each lane, or thread, handling its own traffic.","The terms core and thread work together to determine how much data can be transported at the speed stated for the processor.  The Intel Core i5-650 which is offered as the basic processor for the Dell Studio XPS 8100 has two cores and 4 threads so, thinking again about our automobile traffic analogy, that’s like eight lanes of traffic speeding along at 3.20GHz, and admittedly, that’s an awful lot by past standards. If we choose to jump up to the first optional processor, the Core i5 750, we get four cores and four threads. So that’s the equivalent of 16 lanes of traffic traveling at 2.66GHz. Yes the clock speed is a little slower but with twice the lanes of traffic, a whole lot more data is being transported.","The speed differences get much more dramatic with the two Intel Core i7 processors that are offered as the top options because they each have four cores and eight threads, so analogously 32 lanes of traffic. The Core i7-860 has a clock speed of 2.80GHz while the Core i7-870 clocks at 2.93GHz. All of the optional processors also have an 8MB cache, twice that of the base model. Cache is very fast memory that the processor can access for data that is being used frequently. The more cache, the faster things move.","Memory, or RAM, is the next feature that dictates computer performance. The XPS 8100 comes standard with 3GB of RAM. And by the way, all memory offered on this computer runs at 1333MHz speed which is considerably faster than the more frequently seen 1066MHz on most computers. There are options for upgrading RAM to 4GB, 6GB, 8GB, 12GB or a huge 16GB on this computer as well. More RAM equates to more speed but the option can get pretty pricey, especially after 8GB.","Hard drives for the 8100 start with a generous 500GB. There are four optional drives topping out with a huge 1.5TB HDD. There are also a number of options for optical drives. Standard is a 16x DVD±RW drive. There are also options that add reading Blu-ray discs and further options that even burn Blue-rays. Second optical drives with essentially the same capabilities are available.","The 8100 comes with the NVIDIA GeForce G310 video card standard. It offers 512MB of video RAM. For faster and higher quality rendering of graphics, there are two options from each of the two leading manufacturers of video cards, ATI and NVIDIA. All of the optional cards have 1GB of video RAM. The top performing upgrades are the NVIDIA GeForce GTS240 and ultimately the ATI Radeon HD 5770.","All XPS 8100s feature THX TruStudio PC sound. They don’t, however, come standard with speakers to take advantage of it. Speakers are available, however, at rather attractive package prices and range from a simple pair of stereo speakers through some pretty cool sets of 5.1 surround sound speakers from such noted makers as Bose and Logitech. A monitor isn’t included in the base price either but there are options available that range in size from 20-inches to 24-inches with package pricing. A Dell Studio Consumer Multimedia keyboard and three different mouse options are included in the base price. Optional mice and keyboards are also available.","The computers come with one year of Dell’s basic service plan which includes 24/7 phone based tech support. It’s expandable to two or three years.  Optional Advanced and Premium service plans are also available."]},"id":"b1a05ac2-d8a2-43ee-a266-5a943486330a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5a5290ea-ad21-4f0a-bb23-7b49559654ee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All in all, we’re pretty impressed with the Dell Studio XPS 8100 computer systems.
