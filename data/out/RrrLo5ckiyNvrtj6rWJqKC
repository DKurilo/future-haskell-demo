It is one of the most compact wall AC units we reviewed, so finding a spot to install it should be easy. The KSTAT10-2C is also one of the most energy efficient air conditioners we evaluated, with an Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of 10.6. In addition, its annual energy costs are lower than those of most wall air conditioners. It can remove up to 2.3 pints of moisture from the air per hour, which is respectable for a unit of this size.","This affordable through-the-wall air conditioner requires a 230-volt electrical outlet – it doesn’t work with the standard household 115-volt outlets. Its on-unit controls are intuitive and make it easy to adjust settings and change the temperature with the touch of a button, though they look somewhat dated. The air conditioner also includes a remote control with a sensor that alerts you if the temperature needs to be adjusted, and it has all the buttons you need to make any necessary changes from across the room.","This wall-mounted AC has some nice convenience features. For example, after a power outage, the unit automatically restarts with its previous settings. It also has a sleep mode, which saves energy by gradually increasing the temperature by a few degrees during the night. This unit doesn’t have an auto mode, which automatically adjusts the temperature and the fan speed based on the room’s current temperature. However, there is an energy-saver mode, which runs the compressor and fan only as needed to keep the room cool.","The Midea website has limited product information – it only shows the most recent products, so you won’t find information about the Keystone KSTAT10-2C there. As such, you also won’t find FAQs for this product on the website. You can contact representatives via a toll-free number or email if you have questions.","This unit comes with an above-average four-year warranty on its compressor and other refrigeration components – it doesn’t quite match the five-year compressor warranty offered on the <a href=\"/frigidaire-review\">Frigidaire FFTA1233Q1</a>, but it is still good. The appliance warranty, which covers the unit itself, only lasts a year, which is standard.","The Keystone KSTAT10-2C is a compact air conditioner that can cool a space of about 450 square feet. It includes features like a remote control, a fan-only mode, auto restart and an energy-saver mode, all of which help make it one of the most energy efficient units we reviewed. You can contact customer support, but there isn’t any information about the KSTAT10-2C on the manufacturer’s website. Overall, it is an affordable air conditioner that does a good job of cooling the right size space."]},"id":"74475e21-1dea-4322-abb4-b832a14fbb8a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65018","url":"/keystone-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-21T18:01:55Z","datePublished":"2015-05-21T18:01:55Z","name":"Keystone KSTAT10-2C","synopsis":"The Keystone KSTAT10-2C is an Energy Star certified wall air conditioner that can cool a room of about 450 square feet.
