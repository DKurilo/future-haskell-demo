During our testing process, we conducted a survey in which participants graded the optical quality of each pair of <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-binoculars\">binoculars</a>. All of our participants found that the Nikon Action EX Extreme produced some of the best images out of all the binoculars we reviewed. Before every other consideration in how to choose binoculars, optical quality is key, and the Nikon Action EX Extreme does not disappoint.","This set of binoculars has a relatively low power at 7x magnification and the highest field of view at 163 meters. This low power and high field of view means that the binoculars are ideal for situations in which you want to track fast-paced movement with them. This can include birdwatching and viewing sporting events from the stadium. Because they have low power, images appear more stable with them than with other binoculars we reviewed, because higher-powered binoculars translate small hand movements into shaky images. Unfortunately, the minimum focusing distance is nearly 5 meters away, which is the furthest distance out of all the optics we reviewed.","The binoculars have 35-millimeter objective lenses, which isn&#39;t as large as those of many other binoculars we reviewed. This means the binoculars don&#39;t catch as much light, so using them in low light settings is somewhat difficult. If you plan on using your binoculars primarily in low light settings, don&#39;t purchase this set. However, this objective lens size works perfectly well in brightly lit areas, such as the stadium or trail, and for birdwatching.","The Nikon Action EX Extreme uses BAK-4 prisms, which contribute to the overall excellent optical quality with side-to-side sharpness. This pair of binoculars has multicoated lenses as well, which reduces how much light reflects off of the glass away from your eyes. With multicoated lenses, images appear sharper and brighter. The Nikon also uses Porro prisms, meaning phase correction coatings are not required to produce accurate images.","In our evaluation process, our survey participants found these binoculars were easy to adjust and get in focus. This is particularly important for watching fast-paced action, when you can expect to constantly adjust the focus to keep everything in view. The binoculars weigh 28.2 ounces, which is slightly heavier than the average 26 ounces, but not in any noticeable way. If you don&#39;t want to carry or hold the binoculars, you can set them up on a tripod with an adapter, which you purchase separately.","This pair of binoculars is waterproof and fogproof, so you don&#39;t have to worry about permanently damaging them because you want to use them in the rain or out on the water. The binoculars use twist-up eyecups, making them incredibly easy for eyeglass wearers to use. Additionally, the eye relief is 17.3 millimeters, so you can use the binoculars with your glasses on.","Like every other binoculars manufacturer we reviewed, Nikon offers a limited lifetime warranty that protects you from defects in material and workmanship for as long as you own the binoculars. If you need to contact the company for any reason, you can send it an email after creating a free online account, or you can call. You can also search the company&#39;s knowledgebase to find answers to some of your questions. If you want live chat support, you can change your country setting to the United Kingdom to ask direct questions. The United States Nikon support page does not offer live chat support."]},"id":"a0bfce3e-02f8-442a-90f7-14a3ec6268a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e6ebbae8-b0c0-4525-bf0c-e84e831de9d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nikon Action EX Extreme is a solid set of binoculars that&#39;s ideal for birdwatching, the stadium or the trail.
