Its grates are continuous, which makes it safe and easy to move heavy, hot pot and pans. You can lift the grates off the Stainless LCG3611ST to clean the surface below, and the burners are sealed to keep spills from falling beneath the cooktop.","The primary burner reaches 17,000 Btu, which is high enough to quickly boil water and sear. That’s a respectable heat output, but it&#39;s lower than the maximums on the other cooktops we reviewed. There is also a 5,000 Btu burner for simmering and melting delicate sauces, chocolate and butter without scorching them. In addition, this LG cooktop has a burner that reaches 12,000 Btu and two that reach 9,100 Btu for general cooking.","The simple control panel has knobs for each burner, and since it is parallel with the countertop, kids can&#39;t easily reach it. If you prefer a different arrangement, consider the <a href=\"/kitchenaid-review\">KitchenAid KCGS556ESS Pro</a> – its knobs sit in a straight row along the front of the appliance. The knobs are dishwasher-safe, but because they are made of aluminum rather than stainless steel, they feel somewhat insubstantial. This LG model doesn’t include the extra features you find on the best gas cooktops such as a hot surface indicator light, backlit knobs and automatic reignition.","LG includes a liquid propane conversion kit with the LCG3611ST. The manufacturer also provides an industry-standard, one-year warranty."]},"id":"c8c768d2-fb20-4aaf-b5eb-448a82fc095c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66134","url":"/lg-stainless-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-10T17:07:12Z","datePublished":"2015-07-10T17:07:12Z","name":"LG Stainless LCG3611ST","synopsis":"The LG Stainless LCG3611ST 36-inch gas cooktop has a clean design with a seamless stainless steel surface, five burners and cast iron grates that have an interesting horizontal pattern.
