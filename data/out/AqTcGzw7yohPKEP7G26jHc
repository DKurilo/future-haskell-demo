It has fun, snappy handling and proved to be quite durable throughout our tests. Its small size means it can have some issues in the wind and is a little better suited for indoor use.","When used indoors, however, we found the Predator to be one of the most enjoyable <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">RC helicopters</a> out there, and probably the most entertaining indoor option we tested. Although there was some stiff competition, the Predator&#39;s quick controls made it very engaging and lots of fun to experiment with.","For such a small helicopter, it carries a relatively large battery that gives it a couple minutes more flying time than other small indoor models. On average, the smaller RC quadcopters in our review have a battery capacity of about 200 mAh, whereas the Predator boasts 350 mAh. The average flight time for these models is 5.5 minutes, two minutes shorter than the Predator. As with many other models in our review, you can also purchase extra batteries to extend your flight time.","Thanks to an internal gyroscope, this remote control helicopter is very stable in flight and easy to fly. There are also LEDs on its undercarriage that help you discern which direction it&#39;s facing. Unfortunately, there is only one speed level for this model, however, so the learning curve might be a little steeper than with some other models.","The transmitter is solid and much more simplistic than many of the other 2.4GHz transmitters we tested. This is actually a good thing as we found many of the other transmitters to be a little big and complicated for younger users. It&#39;s smaller, but with simple trim control, there&#39;s enough there to keep enthusiasts happy.","Although we like its overall construction and its rotor-guards work well, it seems less durable than some of its competitors, mostly thanks to its thin plastic rotor arms. Admittedly, with a quadcopter this light, that&#39;s only likely to be an issue in extreme circumstances."]},"id":"6c9f2058-6aff-4619-85d2-daf2423a803b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d63b28fb-53b2-4df1-8acc-04d450406948","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Holy Stone HS170 Predator is one of the best indoor RC helicopters we tested.
