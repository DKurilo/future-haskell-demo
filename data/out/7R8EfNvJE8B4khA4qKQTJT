You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The JVC GZ-VX815 is an <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD camcorder</a> with Wi-Fi and a compact design. It is small enough to fit in pockets and purses, and its narrow design is sleeker than any other camcorder we reviewed. The camcorder&#39;s online connectivity makes it a great option for livestreaming footage, but it lacks onboard storage. This camcorder has some great positives, but it has some downsides as well.","Although the JVC GZ-VX815 fits our basic resolution requirements, its images do not look as crisp as many other HD camcorders&#39;. Especially in motion, this camera tends to blur and display inaccurate colors. If you use a tripod or some other stable base, the camcorder is capable of better images, but colors are never quite right. Another problem with this camcorder is its handling of close-up images, which are more blurry than they are with other video cameras.","The VX815 is one of many HD camcorders with Wi-Fi, but unlike many of its competitors, this camcorder&#39;s wireless connectivity is consistently strong. If you&#39;re looking for an internet-ready or livestreaming video camera, the JVC GZ-VX815 is a good choice because it requires little setup, and you can get your videos online with ease.","In addition to the internet capability, the JVC GZ-VX815 also has image stabilization and an intelligent auto mode. However, these don&#39;t do much to improve the image quality. The camcorder also has facial detection, but this feature works best when the camcorder is on a tripod. There are some video effects, but most of them are just gimmicks.","The VX815 has a unique and sleek design. At only 1.5 inches wide, it fits in pockets and bags. You can have your camcorder on hand at any time, thanks to its small size. Unfortunately, the standard battery only lasts an hour and a half, so if you&#39;re going on vacation, you might want to pack some backup batteries. You&#39;ll also need to bring some memory cards, since the camcorder does not have any integrated storage."]},"id":"4f4a0417-7d19-4c6e-a402-767111b72ce6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"51b7c956-0212-4fbf-91b1-991f127ef845","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The JVC GZ-VX815 is a small HD camcorder with Wi-Fi connectivity, but its video quality is not as good as that of some of the other cameras in our lineup.
