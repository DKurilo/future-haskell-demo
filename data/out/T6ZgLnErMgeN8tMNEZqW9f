The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-drones,review-2412.html\">RC Drones</a> here.</em>","If you’ve always yearned to fly a sleek, aircraft-style drone that sweeps the skies in imposing fashion, the Spy Hawk Glider may be the plane for you. Although its wings are an impressive 34 inches from tip to tip, they are detachable, which allows the unmanned plane to fit easily into most vehicles. Made from a lightweight and crash-proof foam material, this large drone RC plane weighs just under six ounces – making it especially easy to carry out onto open ground at the park or playing field. While it is considered a ready-to-fly model, plan on spending at least 15 minutes to assemble the detachable wings and tail rudder pieces that allow it to be so portable.","The large size and style of the Spy Hawk make it easy to see from the ground, but do limit it to outdoor-only flying. It runs for nine or ten minutes before the battery is out of power and you need to bring it in to land. Unlike some other drones, this one does not automatically return to you when the battery starts getting low. The H301F model is offered with a 5MP camera that streams real-time aerial photography to the transmitter and saves it to the included 2GB Micro SD card as 1280p, high-definition video. You can use the card in your computer for later playback or uploading to social media sites.","You can fly this impressive-looking plane in first person view (FPV) from the transmitter screen. Your Spy Hawk streams real-time, color video to the 3.5-inch screen on the transmitter, and you control the plane using integrated mini joysticks. Three-axis stabilization holds the plane steady and makes learning to pilot far easier for those new to flying.","The features on the Spy Hawk H301F make it easy to operate with very little instruction. Excellent information and support are offered through stateside vendors and purchase points, although the plane is made overseas and the manufacturer’s site contains minimal support.","One of the best values in the drone RC plane arena, the Spy Hawk H301F Glider is easy to fly and contains many of the features of far more expensive drone models. This is a great FPV drone. It has graceful lines, a big visual impact and it can also record HD video."]},"id":"04ebcbbd-f55b-4a01-b0cb-2389bc26ba9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f8b5b48d-055c-4536-a23f-a6f34990d24d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of the best values in the drone RC plane arena, the Spy Hawk H301F Glider is easy to fly and contains many of the features of far more expensive drone models.
