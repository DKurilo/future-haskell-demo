This hand held gaming console comes in your choice of three colors: maroon, black and blue. The Nintendo DSi XL also has both a small stylus and a full-size, pen-shaped stylus. It is great to have the larger stylus because many of the games are easier to navigate with the full-size stylus.","Now that many hand held games are incorporating the use of cameras into video games, the Nintendo DSi XL offers two cameras. There is one located on the back of this hand held game device and one on the front. As an added bonus, this hand held game consul is equipped with a built-in microphone that you can use to record and edit sounds.","While this is the largest hand held gaming device we reviewed, weighing in at 11.03 ounces, we were impressed with the size of the screens. The games are much easier to see on the larger screens, which increased our playing performance.","We found that the battery life varies depending on how much you use it, as it does with any handheld gaming units. However, when the battery runs low on this handheld gaming unit, it is simple to charge. This hand held game player comes with a cord that will plug into an outlet, and in no time you will be back to gaming."]},"id":"ada4011c-dad9-4e62-b717-303366180b65","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Physical Features"},"id":"2e736a84-2d0c-453f-ac1e-d227591be7aa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Nintendo offers an online store called DSiWare for its handheld gaming devices.
