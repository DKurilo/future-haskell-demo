You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Energy efficiency and large capacity are two phrases that don’t seem like they should work together. How can you save energy while expecting a higher than normal capacity? Well GE has created a <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> that makes energy efficiency and large capacity go hand-in-hand. Their dishwasher, the GE GDWT160RSS can fit up to 16, 5-piece dish sets in its tall tub, while still maintaining an Energy Star qualification. It also boasts several top-of-the-line features like a self-cleaning water filtration system, fully integrated controls and a towerless wash system. Unfortunately, the GE GDWT160RSS missed the top spot in our dishwasher ratings simply because it is lacking a concealed heating element. This tiny flaw caused the Samsung DMT800RHS, which has all of the same features, to swoop ahead. However, it was rated above Bosch’s SHE6AP05UC due to Bosch’s non-integrated controls and a few other differing features."]},"id":"8c87f851-1a66-47d4-be77-40f0c9f1fa9e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Efficiency"},"id":"fc26ba9a-8d38-4fcc-b50e-4ed8bef04feb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE GWDT160RSS is a dishwashing powerhouse. Not only can you potentially wash 80 dishes plus silverware at one time, but you have five different wash cycles with four different options to choose from. These cycles range from normal to light to pots and pans. There is even a special SaniWash cycle that is NSF certified to kill up to 99.999% of harmful germs and bacteria. A special hard food disposer is the outlet for any caked on food or dirty run-off. This dishwasher has its own self-cleaning water filtration system, so you don’t have to worry about cleaning the filter.","While the dishwasher is blasting away at all of that food and grime, its sound level ranks at 52dB, approximately equivalent to a normal conversation. Quiet dishwasher seems like an oxymoron, but the GE GWDT160RSS definitely breaks the stereotype of a noisy dishwasher. Some users even comment that after a few months of ownership, they are still “amazed” at how quiet it is. You’ll also be impressed that the yearly cost to operate this dishwasher is a mere $35."]},"id":"4cf6d812-11c5-41b6-aff0-aa647812d190","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Cleaning Options"},"id":"94d739f9-c423-482e-858e-5e9ebc0e8eb9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Functionality is mostly the same across the board on dishwasher reviews, what sets them apart from each other are the included features. While the GE GWDT160RSS dishwasher is missing a hidden heating element, it does have several features that differ from the others we’ve reviewed. Our favorite feature is the towerless wash system. Instead of having a plastic tower in the center of the top rack, GE has designed this dishwasher with three wash arms. This redesign allows for more energy efficiency as well as a larger capacity. With no tower in the way, you are free to wash large items in the top basket. They’ve also included a delay start timer which allows you to select a wash cycle now but have the dishwasher start in 2, 4 or 8 hours. During the wash cycle, you can track the cleaning stages with the cycle progress indicators and an audible beep will signify the end of the cycle.","The dishwasher’s interior is stainless steel to prevent staining, but also to better conduct heat inside the tall tub. More heat contained means less reheating and less energy waste. The optimum wash sensor also prevents waste by determining when the dishes are clean and adjusting the cycle time accordingly –saving time, money and energy."]},"id":"9949e7ae-5248-4672-9e4b-5d3a4c935018","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Load Flexibility"},"id":"b3094f0b-3436-4288-9775-0d4ebf08a796","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Stainless steel appliances are all the rage right now. The GE GDWT160RSS dishwasher fits right in with the sleek, modern dishwashers available on the market. Its stainless steel finish is not only beautiful, but it also resists corrosion and stains. A slightly curved handle adds a swoop of grace across the façade and the controls are carefully hidden away at the top of the door. This design allows for a clean look as well as child lock functionality. Inside, the dishwasher’s racks are high-quality nylon which gives the baskets a heavy, expensive feel. Dimension-wise, this dishwasher is standard, meaning it could replace your current under-the-counter dishwasher without any adjustments to your cabinets."]},"id":"05dc2fd5-742d-4065-9301-d445dcdf4f0a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1b5c16d6-17de-4d0d-8bc3-8e0530c081d6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you look at the dishwasher side-by-side rankings, you’ll see that the only box the GE GDWT160RSS dishwasher didn’t fill was the concealed heating element.

This dishwasher is both Energy Star qualified as well as NSF certified, guaranteeing you for a lower energy bill and cleaner dishes. However, we think the concealed heating element is one of the most innovative design features a dishwasher today could have. For that reason, we had to rank this dishwasher accordingly. If you are a careful consumer, who always puts their plastic dishes and utensils in the top rack, or avoids putting them in the dishwasher altogether, then we wouldn’t hesitate in recommending the GE GDWT160RSS dishwasher 100 percent. However, if you’re like the average consumer and find melted plastic items after every wash, we’d suggest you check out our other dishwasher reviews."]},"id":"c0f6ca5d-538d-4f12-ac38-7af7cdc4a2ec","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51048","url":"/ge-dishwasher-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-11T14:14:08Z","datePublished":"2010-10-11T14:14:08Z","name":"GE GDWT160RSS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":98,"verdict":"The GE GDWT160RSS has the highest capacity with one of the lowest sound ratings, 52dB, of any dishwasher.","pros":["It has the capacity to hold 16, 5-piece dish sets."],"cons":["This dishwasher doesn&#8217;t have a concealed heating element."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-10-11T14:14:08Z","id":"qQpFii4TDjkhqsLFG6UvP5","meta":{"title":"GE GDWT160RSS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The GE GDWT160RSS is a high capacity washer that can fit up to 80 dishes plus silverware, and it has one of the lowest sound ratings, 52dB, of any dishwasher."},"products":[{"slug":"ge-gdwt160rss","url":"/product/ge-gdwt160rss","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","name":"GE GDWT160RSS","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","id":"Q6ziBJHPbqpLG4WEjK6TwX","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mkQMRwdjMZq89piXcXKABc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","mimeType":"","name":"51020-ge-gdwt160rss-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/51020-ge-gdwt160rss-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","id":"mkQMRwdjMZq89piXcXKABc","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mkQMRwdjMZq89piXcXKABc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"GE GDWT160RSS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The GE GDWT160RSS is a high capacity washer that can fit up to 80 dishes plus silverware, and it has one of the lowest sound ratings, 52dB, of any dishwasher."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mkQMRwdjMZq89piXcXKABc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","mimeType":"","name":"51020-ge-gdwt160rss-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/51020-ge-gdwt160rss-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","id":"mkQMRwdjMZq89piXcXKABc","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mkQMRwdjMZq89piXcXKABc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"GE GDWT160RSS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The GE GDWT160RSS is a high capacity washer that can fit up to 80 dishes plus silverware, and it has one of the lowest sound ratings, 52dB, of any dishwasher."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/ge-dishwasher-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"large-appliances","url":"/kitchen/large-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","name":"Large Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:29Z","id":"yvFeBy7UFkUJPFU92wJqXS","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
