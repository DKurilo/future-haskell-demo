Perhaps people were expecting exquisite views based on the name brand here. No one has gotten them. We fell into that thinking too, assuming anything by Meade would compare well, even something at a lower price point. Not exactly so. However, we give Meade some credit. If any <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">kids&#39; microscope</a> in our lineup has the right to perform like a toy it is this one. It is price is quite low after all.","The list of accessories for this kids&#39; microscope is decent. There are seven blank glass slides, five prepared glass slides, 12 cover glasses, 12 blank labels, seven glass slide covers, seven slide covers, seven slide labels, two collecting vials, a stirring rod, tweezers, a Petri dish, eosin, sea salt, brine shrimp eggs, gum media in a bottle, a shrimp hatchery, specimen slicer, scalpel, needle, tweezers, spare bulb and graduated cylinder.","The brine shrimp and hatchery are such a great thing to include in a kids microscope set. That is a big plus for this kit. Your child will be able to observe the shrimp throughout their different stages, including the eggs themselves, hatching eggs, larval stages and adult.","The kit includes five prepared slides to get the discoveries going, and that is always motivating. The trick here may be to see all of the prepared slides before the bulb burns out. Some online reviewers complained of burning through included bulbs way too fast. There is always the mirror and natural lighting option, though. It might be best to not waste all of the time and energy to add a new bulb to a product that is really more toy than serious science anyway. A sunny window and the included mirror are a safe bet.","This set comes packed in a carrying case that will keep things organized and portable and we like that. The instruction manual is a little lackluster but serves its purpose just fine. It will not compare well to the full color, glossy numbers that come with some kits, but general microscope information on the internet can fill in some of the blanks.","Meade offers solid customer service. People on the other end of the phone line are helpful and know their product. Buying an instrument like this from a company that makes high-end telescopes and other optics is always a good feeling. They back up their products with a solid warranty and guarantee."]},"id":"f3049507-86ec-4331-a044-91684a9c9eae","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"498c2995-7af2-4244-aece-6a9c2c0324a8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Itâ€™s possible we expected too much from this product based on its manufacturer.
