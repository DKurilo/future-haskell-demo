The Troy-Bilt TB6044 XP, our Top Ten Reviews Bronze Award winner, is no exception to this standard of excellence. In fact, this Troy-Bilt trimmer is the most powerful machine in our lineup with a 32 cc, four-cycle engine.

The Troy-Bilt TB6044 XP has both of these qualities. This gas trimmer is easy to use, though it is heavier than other trimmers in our review due to its massive 32 cc, four-cycle engine. The engine doesn&#39;t require the gas and oil mix that most two-cycle engines do. The result is a cleaner and quieter engine with plenty of oomph to get through the toughest weeds in your yard.","This gas weed whacker is easy to start, and is also compatible with optional JumpStart starter tools in case you&#39;re not a fan of the pull cord. The fuel tank holds 12 ounces of gasoline, which is enough for about an hour of work at full power. If you plan to work that long, you may need to take a break to rest your muscles; this Troy-Bilt trimmer lacks an anti-vibration feature, which prevents muscle fatigue.","This straight-shaft yard trimmer uses nylon line to whip stubborn weeds away from fences, trees and landscaping boulders using a dual-line trimming head. The weed trimmer head comes equipped with a debris shield and bump-type feed. The bump feed allows you to dispense new line from an enclosed spool by tapping the ground as you work. This weed whacker has a generous 18-inch cutting width, which helps you cover ground more quickly."]},"id":"5f9b6728-2ee6-4cf0-a78d-6b5fd8bc32e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"d18ca086-8d5a-4878-bbaf-a08da47e4181","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/oScVS7BzQnM9ULkYc6whUS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/59479-troy-bilt-trimmer14.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oScVS7BzQnM9ULkYc6whUS.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"oScVS7BzQnM9ULkYc6whUS","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oScVS7BzQnM9ULkYc6whUS.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e983787a-d986-4710-95d9-4dfe502b252c","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Weeds aren&#39;t the only thing in your yard that need grooming.
