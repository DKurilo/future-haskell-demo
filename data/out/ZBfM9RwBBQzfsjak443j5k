Then, there’s the Lexibook DVDP5SP, a travel DVD player featuring a Spider-Man design. There’s very little to get excited about with this player. In fact, even though this is a DVD player meant for kids, it does not come with a manufacturer warranty. Having tested this DVD player, we recommend that you find something else for your kids.","First, we tested the video quality. We started with the maximum viewing angle and were impressed that it was able to offer 45 degrees from center. This means that at least two kids can watch a movie without picture distortion. The screen itself was more disappointing, though. There were noticeable horizontal lines across the screen, and the picture was too dark on its default settings.","We tested the built-in speakers’ loudness and were impressed that they could reach 92 dB, a strong volume considering the player’s compact size. Our test DVD sounded fine through the speakers. Next, we plugged in our test headphones and found them to be a little quieter than many other car DVD players. Also, we picked up a flipping sound as we watched. When we skipped chapters, we realized that the headphones were somehow picking up the disc’s spinning. It will be very hard for your kids to ignore this constant sound.","Lexibook claims that this device&#39;s battery will last two hours, and our testing showed that it lasts two and a quarter hours. The player comes with anti-skipping and parental controls, and your kids can control their movies with the Spider-Man-themed remote control.","Unfortunately, Lexibook does not support the player with a warranty. If you’re concerned that your kids will break their new DVD player, you should look into a retailer warranty, which will cost extra. The company offers email and phone support. We had a little trouble reaching support by email, but when we did get a response, we had all of our questions answered in full."]},"id":"7bbfe2fd-0650-4bf7-97f7-daca2a83a1bd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2cf1dc37-c12e-48b5-934e-cca3aa5db4ee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lexibook DVDP5SP is a portable DVD player that stands out, but its Spider-Man theme does nothing to improve the overall quality.
