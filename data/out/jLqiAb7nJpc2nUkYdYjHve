When we review encryption software, we consult with experts in the computer security industry as well as businesses that use encryption software daily, including those in healthcare, education and government industries. Their expert knowledge and experiences, as well as our own in-house tests, help us understand the many uses of encryption software, security levels and requirements, and the tools to look for when choosing a program.","One expert we spoke with is Marjorie Smith, a medical service software administrator for a Virginia-based company that assists doctors, hospitals and clinics with medical billing. Because personal medical information is communicated, both in-office and electronically, Smith and her team are bound by the Health Portability and Accountability Act, or <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html\">HIPAA</a>, laws and regulations.","Smith explained that HIPAA requires any information that is sent electronically regarding a patient must first be encrypted. Smith also explained that since IT personnel can connect to her computer remotely, files and documents stored on her computer must be encrypted.","One important feature Smith says is essential is a password recovery feature. Because HIPAA requires workers to change their passwords for programs used for storing or sending patient information several times a year, including encryption software, it’s easy to forget passwords. If you don’t have a good IT department at your disposal, which isn’t included with encryption software, a password reset feature is essential.","<br/><strong>How We Tested? </strong>","We tested each program by encrypting 63 files – a total of 128MB of data saved on Windows computers or 134.5MB on Mac machines. We chose programs that encrypted quickly and integrated well with our computers’ operating systems. And while some programs offer a less secure, free program, we tested the premium versions to get a feel for all the security features available.","Encrypting such a small batch of files only took seconds in most cases. However, some programs took minutes to finish the job. In each case we took our results and used them to determine the average time it would take each program to encrypt 1GB of information. Speed isn’t a big deal when you’re locking up a few megabytes of data, but if you’re encrypting gigabytes, a slow program could leave you waiting for hours.","We clocked decryption speed and found that most programs let you access your files quickly. However, in the case of SensiGuard, we had to wait more than six minutes for both encryption and decryption.","Some of our testing included evaluating the security features of each program, particularly those involving passwords. We ranked products based on if they only require a single master password, or let you assign a unique password to each encrypted file. We also looked for password generators and strength meters. A useful feature that most programs don’t include is a password recovery option that helps you still access your files even if you forget your password. We gave extra credit to encryption programs that include this unique, but important function.","<strong>How Much Does Encryption Software Cost?</strong>","Most encryption software costs about $40 and can be used on multiple devices. If it only comes with one user license, look to see if it includes self-extracting files. This allows you to send encrypted files to another user or to yourself through email and open it on another device that doesn’t have the same program installed on it. Usually this is done by providing the receiver with a password that unlocks and decrypts the file.","<strong>Can I Encrypt an External Hard Drive?</strong>","You can encrypt an external drive, or thumb drive, using encryption software. The process is the same as if you’re encrypting files and documents on your computer. You have to select the data you want to encrypt and send it through your encryption software. You will be asked to set a password or keycode in order to unlock and decrypt the information in the future.","It is important to note that your external drives, including flash drives, must be encrypted separately from your computer. Just because you’ve encrypted your computer doesn’t mean connected external drives are encrypted as well. As with computer encryption, if you plan to share your encrypted files with a third party that doesn’t have the same encryption program installed as you do, make sure to choose encryption software that includes the option of use self-extracting files. This allows others to unlock secured files with a provided password without requiring an encryption program to be installed on their end first.","<strong>Key Features of Encryption Software </strong>","Version Compatibility<br/>If your computer runs an older version of Windows, such as Vista or XP, make sure the encryption program supports your operating system. On the flip side, you need to make sure you choose software that has changed with the times and supports the latest versions of Windows, including 8 and 10.","While all the programs we tested are compatible with every version of Windows, we feel that <a href=\"/sensiguard-review\">SensiGuard</a> is a good choice for older computers because it only has the most essential tools and won’t bog down your old PC. Plus, it is easy to move to a new computer if you choose to upgrade. However, it takes a while to encrypt and decrypt files.","<br/>If you have a Mac computer, you need a program that is designed specifically for that operating system – none of the programs we tested are compatible with both Windows and Mac machines. We believe Concealer is the best option for Macs, but <a href=\"/espionage-review\">Espionage 3</a> is also a good choice.","Mac encryption software doesn’t have as many extra security features as Windows programs. They typically lack virtual keyboards, self-extracting file creators and password recovery tools. Mac programs also take a lot more time to secure files compared to Windows software.","Security<br/>Encryption software uses different types of ciphers to scramble your data, and each has its own benefits. Advanced Encryption Standard, or 256-bit key AES, is used by the U.S. government, including the National Security Agency (NSA), and is one of the strongest ciphers available. It scrambles each bit of information. Blowfish and its newer version, Twofish, are encryption algorithms that use block ciphers – they scramble blocks of text or several bits of information at once rather than one bit at a time.","The main differences between these algorithms are performance and speed, and the average user won’t notice the difference. Blowfish and Twofish can’t encrypt large files, so if you need to secure gigabytes of data, use AES encryption. Blowfish and Twofish algorithms are considered practically unbreakable, though given enough time and computing power, both could theoretically be broken.","AES has long been recognized as the superior algorithm and is required for financial institutions, schools, government agencies and healthcare facilities that deal with sensitive personal information. Because of this we preferred programs that use it and ensured these were included in our final choice of the best encryption software.","When Is a Free Program Enough?<br/>Many free file encryption programs exist, and they might be strong enough for your needs. We tested VeraCrypt and Windows’ built-in encryption solution BitLock. These are bare-bones programs that allow you to protect your files and nothing else – they don’t have a file shredder, password generator or password strength meter. Also, these applications are less intuitive than their for-pay counterparts. The paid versions walk you through every step and have easy-to-read help files and tutorials.","So, if you’re comfortable and familiar working with certificates and keys to encrypt files, BitLocker may work well for you. VeraCrypt’s system encrypts in volumes and allows you to create a hidden, encrypted volume within another encrypted file.","All-In-One Security &amp; Norton Security Premium<br/>Just like there is a place for free encryption software, there is a time when an all-in-one security program is the best solution for you. <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Security Premium</a> is the best computer protection program available, and we’ve physically tested it with live internet threats to make sure it works as it claims. Norton Security blocks malware, including ransomware, rootkits and viruses, from infecting your computer.
