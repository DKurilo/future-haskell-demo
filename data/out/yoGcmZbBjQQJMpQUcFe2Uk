It also gives you get the benefit of having and energy-efficient dishwasher that may put less stress on your wallet than your current dishwasher does.","This built-in dishwasher gives you six wash cycles, and you get two additional wash options, which is fewer compared to other units in our lineup. However, the wash cycles it does offer gives you a good variety for many situations. The wash cycles are heavy wash, auto wash, normal wash, delicate wash, express wash and half load.

Additionally, the upper rack is adjustable, while both racks include flip tines, which allow you to fit certain items in more conveniently.","This Bosch Ascenta Series dishwasher has an estimated yearly energy consumption rate of 279 kilowatt-hours, which is close to the lowest on our dishwasher comparison. Additionally, it is estimated that it will cost you an annual $30, which is fairly comparable to the most energy-efficient units in our comparison.","This Bosch dishwasher has warranty coverage that compares to the best dishwashers in the industry.
