At less than 10 pounds, you can easily lift and use the hand vacuum, and its handle pivot makes it easy to turn and use. It also has some extra features through its USB connectivity, including the ability to check the battery, calculate your energy savings and even see how many calories you burned while cleaning. However, the smart features are secondary, so you must judge this vacuum for its cleaning power.","The Gtech AirRam works on all floors, so you can transition from hardwood or tile to carpet without adjusting any settings. The vacuum does a great job picking up finer particles and dust. However, when we vacuumed our carpet, it had trouble picking up larger objects like lint balls and string. Also, the stick vacuum is as loud as a traditional vacuum.","The best features come from the handle. At the base, a pivot allows you to turn left and right with ease. Just above the pivot is an LED battery indicator with four lights to tell you how full your battery is. The battery takes four hours to charge and will run the vacuum for up to 40 minutes. Finally, the rubber hand grip is extremely comfortable, so you can vacuum your whole house without placing your hand and wrist in an awkward position.","To charge the battery, you have to disconnect it from the cordless vacuum and plug it into the wall charge. The battery also has a USB connector, which allows you to monitor your activity on your computer. Right now, this feature is mostly a gimmick. Future applications could turn vacuuming into a game or give you the opportunity to map your cleaning patterns. None of these features exist on the AirRam, but the hypothetical advancements of smart stick vacuums is exciting enough for us to forgive the AirRam&#39;s gimmicky usage of its USB connectivity.","Lastly, the vacuum has a lifetime filter. It&#39;s easy to dump dirt and wash the filters. When you put the dust bin back into the vacuum, it does not feel like a tight fit, but we didn&#39;t have any issues with poor seals when we ran it a second time.","The Gtech AirRam has some excellent features, and its competitive pricing makes it a great choice for people looking for a cordless vacuum. You might get frustrated at its weaker suction power, but at less than 10 pounds, it&#39;s a lightweight and maneuverable hand vacuum."]},"id":"e37b266a-76c7-4539-b6a1-52aa81f873ff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59522","url":"/gtech-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-14T20:16:44Z","datePublished":"2014-05-14T20:16:44Z","name":"Gtech AirRam","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
