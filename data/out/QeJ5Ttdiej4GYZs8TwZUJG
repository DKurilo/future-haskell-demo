While their namesake cases are what they’re known for, they’ve attempted to delve into screen protectors as well, offering a full range of accessories for your iPhone.","While we’re big fans of Case-Mate’s custom iPhone accessories, they lag behind the competition significantly when it comes to iPhone screen protectors. They aren’t nearly as durable as other products, they’re a bit more difficult to apply cleanly, they only come in a single variety and their support is painfully lacking in this area.","The only design available through Case-Mate is the transparent skin, allowing you to protect your iPhone’s screen without marring the sleek design that Apple is known for. They don’t provide a privacy filter or a glare-reducing variety, and the clear protectors are notorious for attracting dust and fingerprints. A few more options in this area, especially oil-resistant or glare-reducing coatings, would greatly improve Case-Mate’s performance.","When it comes to durability, Case-Mate is rightfully near the bottom of our comparison. The protector feels like thick plastic wrap, and it stands up about as well as plastic wrap in durability tests. It both peeled up around the edges and showed scratch marks and slight tears after we put it through its paces. We were not impressed with this protector’s durability.","Case-Mate’s iPhone screen protector went on smoothly enough, but it trapped a striking amount of air bubbles that were very difficult to smooth out. The dry-apply adhesive stuck to the iPhone’s screen immediately, and it was very difficult to move and reposition. The usability of Case-Mate’s screen protectors could certainly be improved.","One of Case-Mate’s standout features is its customer support; you can contact a representative via phone or email if you don’t find an answer to your question in their healthy FAQs section."]},"id":"4cc2079b-e406-4338-afcf-b0d5af97e7a5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3861a943-5c50-413b-9a06-d7f5a69fedf9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We love Case-Mate’s smartphone covers, but iPhone screen protectors are not their forte.
