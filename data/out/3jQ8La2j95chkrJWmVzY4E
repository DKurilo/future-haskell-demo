For this reason, they&#39;ve become a great alternative for most individuals and families.","The Lenovo IdeaCentre B540 has a fast processor that can tackle any task you throw its way. And its beautiful display, with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, makes watching movies and videos an enjoyable experience.","You can get all your work done on this home PC, from work projects and internet browsing to photo editing and more. The best part is that this PC is reasonably priced, so you wonâ€™t be breaking the bank.","Lenovo comes with a few standard apps such as IE 9.0, Google Search and more. However, to better personalize your experience with Windows 8. you can download free games and programs.","If Lenovo&#39;s speedy and comprehensive system suffers from any problems, they are all native to Windows 8. As a new operating system, there are still many bugs to deal with, such as unexpected crashes with no explanation. Also, to use programs like iTunes or Firefox, you&#39;ll have to first enter a safety screen that looks more like the Windows 7 screen and work in that area. None of these are problems with the Lenovo IdeaCentre B540, but if you&#39;re looking into buying a new computer, you&#39;ll want to make sure you know what you&#39;re getting into first.","Aside from the single power cord, there are several other connections and features native to the B540. With six USB inputs and an HDMI in and out, you&#39;ll have plenty of connection options for your other devices. Unfortunately, some of the most useful features are optional and will cost extra, like a Blu-ray reader/writer or a TV tuner. These additions would make the Lenovo IdeaCentre B540 not only an all-in-one PC but a home entertainment and office hub. However, the optional features will take this computer into a much higher price bracket.","Lenovo offers a one-year warranty for the IdeaCentre B540, although up to three years are available as a side purchase. You can contact customer service representatives through telephone, email or live chat, and from the support site, you can access FAQs and drivers or user manuals."]},"id":"78db5fe9-aae0-4f17-9136-d4bfed251a85","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dc86b8f6-e6ad-448d-9263-cae5ee7bc733","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lenovo IdeaCentre B540 offers enough power to handle work and entertainment for everyone in the family.
