This includes thousands of newspapers, obituaries as far back as 1977, historical texts from as far back as 1749, death records and the Social Security Death Index. While this is a lot of information to dig through, GenealogyBank lacks a family tree builder and other websites like <a href=\"/familysearch-review\">FamilySearch,</a> for example, have even more resources you can search.","This website gives you records primarily from the United States, so it’s not ideal for trying to figure out the lives of your foreign ancestors. While this doesn’t build a tree for you, it’s a nice supplement if you’re doing in depth research. You have access to old newspaper articles, the social security death index, historical books and various government publications. We were even able to find an old newspaper section that had a record of who had been admitted to and released from the hospital, which we found interesting.","A subscription is required access all of GenealogyBank’s data. You do get a 30-day trial if you sign up though, and the price per month is relatively low compared to some of the other websites we evaluated, like <a href=\"/ancestry-com-review\">Ancestry.com.</a> GenealogyBank is also one of the few websites that displayed coupon codes regularly: we got a popup for 20 percent off an annual membership several times. Still, this is nothing compared to the free access you get at FamilySearch.","Using this website is straightforward but there’s a guide with popup windows too in case you get stuck. The little windows appear next to different parts of the page and explain how you can search for articles by date, keyword and even save your searches. Because GenealogyBank lacks a family tree function it isn’t one of our highly-ranked genealogy websites, but it could be useful if you’re specifically interested in obituaries and historical documents to flesh out the family tree you’re building elsewhere."]},"id":"bd0560d8-9635-424a-883e-9c075a9dead8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54337","url":"/genealogybank-com-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-01-26T16:18:36Z","datePublished":"2012-01-26T16:18:36Z","name":"GenealogyBank","synopsis":"This genealogy website gives you access to roughly 2 billion records, a number that is growing all the time.
