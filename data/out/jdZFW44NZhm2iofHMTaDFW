This sealer handles bags that are 15 inches wide, much larger than what fits in other household vacuum sealers and a good size for handling big game and fish.","The sealer looks and feels intimidating at first because of its sheer size, bulk and industrial looking buttons and knobs. However, we found it’s just as easy to use as other sealers we tested, like the <a href=\"/best-vacuum-food-sealerssousvide-review/\">SousVide VS3000</a> that also has a few extra buttons and knobs.","The lid doesn’t lock on this sealer but, because of the weight, the lid easily holds your bags in place during the vacuum and sealing processes without you needing to touch it. Its lid is also clear so you can see the bags and position them without lifting the lid.","During the vacuum process, the Weston Pro 2300 did a nice job of pulling out air and ensuring each bag formed tightly around the food. When we sealed chicken breasts and hamburger patties, the bags sealed in between the pieces of meat really well, so there was no sign of air bubbles. And even after several days in the freezer, the meat was still a healthy color and there were no ice crystals.","When we sealed bread, the Weston drew air out without stretching the bread pieces like other sealers did. This surprised us since the power of this machine had us assuming it would be too strong to seal delicate foods. We saved pineapple rings, too, and the seal was just as close and strong. The vacuum also didn’t draw any juice out of the bag as is drew out the air.","The seal itself is really thick, nearly 7 centimeters compared to most home vacuum sealers that seal a strip between 2 and 3 centimeters. In this way, the Weston Pro seals large game and fish in a way that supports the weight of the meat.","This food sealer doesn’t come with bags, so we used a roll of generic vacuum sealer plastic and made our own. The Weston Pro performed well with each bag, regardless of the shape or size, but this does add to the already steep cost of purchasing the machine. The Weston Pro 2300 retails for just under $500 and comes with a two-year warranty, which is double the industry standard.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>The Weston Pro 2300 is a great vacuum sealer for a range of foods including large chunks of meat, delicate breads and juicy foods. Because its a commercial grade machine, it is really heavy and also costly, coming in just under $500. It also doesn’t come with bags or other extra tools, but it does have a two-year warranty."]},"id":"ac45d4ca-4c60-4006-ac30-2e53e6217d49","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61769","url":"/weston-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-22T16:56:41Z","datePublished":"2014-12-22T16:56:41Z","name":"Weston Pro 2300","synopsis":"The Weston Pro 2300 is a heavy vacuum food sealer at 22 pounds, but that’s because it is a commercial grade machine that is also good for home use.","review":{"rating":64,"verdict":"The Weston Pro 2300 creates a secure, thick seal and draws a lot of air out of the bags to ensure there is minimal air left inside.
