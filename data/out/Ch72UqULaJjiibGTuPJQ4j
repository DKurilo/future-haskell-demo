Individual hot plates like the BergHOFF Studio induction stove are also appealing to the environmentally conscious because they use far less energy than traditional electric hot plates.","The sleek, glass-plated BergHOFF Studio induction burner is every bit as modern and scientific as it looks. The induction hot plate’s good looks play into its efficacy, too. Its flat surface is easy to keep clean, and the induction heating method never actually heats the unit – only the pot or pan that you use does, which must be stainless steel or cast iron.","This unit offers a wide range of temperatures and power settings, and it controls heat better than most of the hot plates on our lineup. It also includes helpful features, such as 10 power settings and a digital control panel where you can set the temperature or a timer."]},"id":"e48ccdd5-1c00-4318-918a-62fdeeb0b31d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Pricing &amp; Warranty"},"id":"8a7170fa-c621-464c-ab74-e507f8eb03ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/QWc8yB822r5mVT7KD65fyk.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"We put BergHOFF’s hot plate through its paces in our tests and it came out close on top overall. It only took seconds before we saw tiny bubbles form on the bottom of a pot full of room-temperature water set over high heat. It didn’t come to a rolling boil as quickly as other units, but it pulled ahead of most of its competitors. At its lowest setting, BergHOFF did exceptionally well at maintaining an even heat level, melting chocolate slowly and delicately. Even better was how well the appliance did at heating food uniformly when we browned foods at a medium temperature.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/59909-berghoff-studio-induction-stove1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QWc8yB822r5mVT7KD65fyk.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"QWc8yB822r5mVT7KD65fyk","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QWc8yB822r5mVT7KD65fyk.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7f87d4b9-d9b2-4144-abbf-6c151a0d5b49","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Cooking food in stainless steel or cast iron pots and pans on top of BergHOFF’s induction hot plate is going to take some getting used to, but once you’re comfortable with its idiosyncrasies, you can see you have a lot of power.

In fact, it doesn’t start heating anything until you place a proper piece of ferromagnetic cookware on the surface and then press the power button.
