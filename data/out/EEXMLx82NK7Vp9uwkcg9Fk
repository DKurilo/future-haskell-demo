Famous characters such as King Kong, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Gumby brought acclaim and became classics in their own right. However, in recent years, 3D animation has dominated film and television, seeming to push stop motion out of the picture.","But stop motion has never been forgotten. Often viewed as a medium for making kids shows or as a hobby for computer nerds, stop motion has enjoyed a resurgence of interest and has benefitted from the technological advancements made over the past few decades.","While <a href=\"/best-2d-animation-software\">stop motion animations</a> can be easy to make, they are very time consuming. As film cameras evolved into digital, it became possible for anyone to take thousands of pictures without incurring the cost of developing the film.","Films such as  The Nightmare Before Christmas,   Coraline  and  Frankenweenie  used high-quality models, but you don&#39;t have to use plasticine and wire frames to create your own characters. Many people today are using their action figures, Lego Minifigures and everyday household objects to tell their stories. In addition, with the development of stop motion software, editing and arranging your pictures into a film can become a reality for the everyday consumer.","Using Lego building blocks or models doesn&#39;t mean stop motion software is just for kids; it&#39;s for anyone who wants to bring the stories in their imaginations to life for everyone to see. So get the preconceived stereotypes out of your head and start thinking up a short story you want to tell, gather your characters and begin snapping pictures.","Stop motion animation takes dedication, patience and above all, time. Don&#39;t worry about being perfect as you learn how to work with this amazing medium, focus on having fun and use the features of stop motion software to your advantage.","Once you have all the shots you need, you can import them into 2D animation software such as Toon Boom Studio, Anime Studio Debut or Stopmotion Studio. These specialized animation applications allow you to place your photos on a timeline and add effects and sounds to complete your movie. Some of these programs are more flexible than others, and they often have advanced features such as Chroma key and onion skinning to help you create a professional-looking animation.","Some stop motion software even lets you see through your camera on the computer monitor if you connect it to your computer. This feature combined with onion skinning  can help you create smoother animations; you can see the last position of your models and adjust them in a more natural way.","What are you waiting for? Begin your adventure in stop motion animation today and bring your imagination to life with your Lego Minifigures, action figures or household objects. Maybe you will make the next great stop motion film with just your camera and stop motion software. The possibilities are as endless as your imagination."]},"id":"4ac9eb95-f2f9-49fc-a2cc-2373b39c3aaa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8258","url":"/stop-motion-software-its-not-just-for-kids","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-23T15:59:54Z","datePublished":"2014-01-23T15:59:54Z","name":"Stop Motion Software: It's Not Just for Kids!","synopsis":"Stop motion animation has been around since the early 1900s, and has brought fantastic creatures and characters to life.","review":{},"strapline":"Stop motion animation has been around since the early 1900s, and has brought fantastic creatures and characters to life.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-05T17:53:18Z","id":"EEXMLx82NK7Vp9uwkcg9Fk","meta":{"title":"Stop Motion Software: It's Not Just for Kids!","description":"It&#039;s not just for kids!
