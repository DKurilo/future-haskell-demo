You&#39;ll find you have to purchase individual maps for certain countries, but it&#39;s well worth buying a map of India or China if you plan to navigate the roads there.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>The GPS device you choose should guide you wherever your travels take you. If you plan to venture outside of North America and Europe, you&#39;re better off going with a TomTom or a Garmin. Just make sure the manufacturer you choose has a map for the areas you plan to visit. If you visit a lot of out-of-the-way locations, a Garmin product might work best because their maps cover more countries than TomTom and Garmin devices work with third-party map software.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "," "]},"id":"0cf58905-6092-46e6-80a8-9734e954f61f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7354","url":"/international-travel-which-gps-device-is-best","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeff-clark","url":"/author/jeff-clark","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeff Clark","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"RvcaaSm8UxVMJgMAhRJ2Gj","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-31T21:04:02Z","datePublished":"2012-05-31T21:04:02Z","name":"International Travel: Which GPS Device Is Best?","synopsis":"Most GPS devices in the U.S. have good maps of North America, but world travelers need reliable roadmaps that go well outside U.S. borders.","review":{},"strapline":"Most GPS devices in the U.S. have good maps of North America, but world travelers need reliable roadmaps that go well outside U.S. borders.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-19T21:01:54Z","id":"XWbnd5Zntu5RoVZSeqwW57","meta":{"title":"International Travel: Which GPS Device Is Best?","description":"Traveling by car in a foreign country is much simpler with a trusty navigation GPS device in hand.
