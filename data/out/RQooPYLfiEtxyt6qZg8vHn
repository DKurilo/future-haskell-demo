You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Firmly ensconced in the middle ground of our review of the best <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray players</a> is the Toshiba BDX5200. Toshiba has been in the home entertainment game for decades now, so it knows what it&#39;s doing. This latest Blu-ray player model shows just how good the company is at playing that game. This device encapsulates Toshiba&#39;s ability to produce superior sound and picture, and then marries that gift to internet-streaming functionality and 3D playback for a remarkable home cinema experience.","Even though Blu-ray Discs are a relatively new invention in the home entertainment world, all the major electronics manufacturers have this tech pretty much nailed down. There isn&#39;t a single 3D Blu-ray player on our side-by-side comparison chart that scored a subpar rating when it comes to reproducing the rich, deep video and audio contained in Blu-ray Discs.","Standard though it may be, we are always impressed with any device&#39;s ability to play high-definition content. We also look for backwards compatibility as well. Let&#39;s face it, the majority of the discs people use today are still standard-definition DVDs that they&#39;ve had for years. Most people don&#39;t see a need to throw away their DVDs in favor of purchasing new, more-expensive Blu-ray Discs.","This is not bad; it&#39;s just common sense because players like the Toshiba BDX5200 have the ability to play DVDs and even upscale their standard-definition content to an HD resolution. Scaling standard-definition images to the size of an HD screen can cause some distortion or visual artifacts. Toshiba wisely included software that minimizes the loss of quality caused by upscaling a video or image.","We also were pleased to find that this 3D Blu-ray player comes with native Wi-Fi and internet streaming functionality. Additionally, this device provides access to some of the most popular content-streaming services such as Netflix, VUDU and Pandora. Accesses to these services allow you to stream movies and music without ever having to buy or insert a disc into the optical drive."]},"id":"a0d8bc34-a590-444f-a1a4-7edab5deb7bd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c9a8a21d-0599-433e-bf48-c749e5acc494","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, we found that there is little to complain about with the Toshiba BDX5200.
