You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Verilux HappyLight Deluxe Energy Sunlight Lamp radiates powerful levels of wide-spectrum light, so you can use it for most types of light therapy. Due to its large size and wall-mounting equipment, this lamp is best used as a permanent fixture in a home or office. Its wide surface provides a large therapy area so you have some freedom to move around during your sessions.","This <a href=\"/best-light-therapy-lamps\">sun lamp</a> generates 10,000 lux. The bulb rests behind a diffusing cover that protects against overexposure. This means you can sit anywhere between 5 and 24 inches from the unit. The manual suggests sitting closer to the lamp when you feel tired and moving farther away when you feel overstimulated. There are no other adjustable light-intensity levels.","This lamp gives you more than one setup option. You can use the included stand to set it up on a desk. This lamp doesn&#39;t need to take up any extra space if you don&#39;t want it to. It also includes wall-mounting options, which let you hang the light therapy lamp on cubicle dividers or solid walls.","While most light therapy programs recommend an hour of light exposure each day, this lamp does not come with any timing functions. You cannot adjust settings to automatically switch the unit off once you reach a set time, nor can you control the lamp with a remote. Instead, you turn the sun lamp on and off with an onboard switch. If you&#39;d prefer a light that offers more than one brightness setting, you might be interested in <a href=\"/day-light-sky-review\">Day-Light Sky</a>.","The HappyLight measures a little more than 13 inches in length, so you can move around the lamp quite freely without losing exposure. This sunlamp is flicker-free and runs silently so it won&#39;t annoy you during sessions. It also comes with a one-year warranty.","Portable light therapy lamps address jetlag as well as seasonal affective disorder. The HappyLight comes with a handle, which makes it easier to carry the lamp. However, its larger size limits where you can put it. It weighs almost 7 pounds and would take up a good deal of room in any carry-on bag."]},"id":"8491cc7b-c013-42fb-862a-7c4e5163ed1a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64163","url":"/happylight-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-14T21:06:01Z","datePublished":"2015-04-14T21:06:01Z","name":"Verilux HappyLight Deluxe","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":59,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-11T00:00:00Z","id":"wXHGUQMt24SZeGLVVkk3ad","meta":{"title":"Verilux HappyLight Deluxe Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Verilux HappyLight Deluxe can be mounted on a wall for therapy sessions.
