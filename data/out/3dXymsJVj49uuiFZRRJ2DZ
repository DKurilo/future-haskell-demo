Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits into our top ten lineup. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This interesting new product is being touted by VTech as a security asset that is almost like having caller ID at your door. The VTech IS line of <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phones</a> provides much of standard telephone functionality that you would expect of cordless phones, but also gives you a photograph of the person ringing your doorbell on the handsets.","If you choose, you can switch to live audio and video streaming of the individual standing there.","The VTech IS7121-2 is one model in this line. It comes with three handsets, but if you choose, you can add as many as nine more to the base station. In addition, there is a specially equipped doorbell device to capture the images and facilitate the audio-video aspects of the phone.","With this, you get seven hours of talk time, which is a relatively small amount. However, you get seven days of battery life and 14 minutes of recorded messages. Handset speakerphones are also included.","This device will even take pictures of people who come to your door when you are not home and will store as many as 100 digital photographs, so you know who has approached your house.","You can see the color pictures and video on a 1.8-inch LCD screen. This cordless phone system is even equipped with night vision so you can see who is at your door after hours.","You do not get a number of features traditionally included with good cordless phones with the VTech L models. Not included are such things as conferencing, an alarm or a headset jack.","The phonebook is rather small, holding only 50 items, which is the same number held by caller ID. However, the caller ID is quite useful in that it audibly announces who is calling, so you can choose to ignore or answer the ringing phone.","The redial memory holds five items. You can silence any handset if you want it to be quiet for a time.","This home phone comes with a one-year warranty. If troubles come up, you can get help through the company&#39;s email and phone support, or you can check the user manual or the firm&#39;s online frequently asked questions section."]},"id":"31f76448-0a3b-433e-8134-cc0a2b830b29","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"feaf8ecb-b847-490a-a137-527499298d89","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it seems like a novelty, this cordless phone&#39;s capability to provide still photos and audio/video live streaming of any visitor could be genuinely helpful for many consumers who are wary of someone undesirable or even dangerous coming to the door.
