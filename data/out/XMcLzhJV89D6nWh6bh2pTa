The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printers</a>Â here.</em>","The Dell color laser printer series is full of impressive machines with a lot to offer, though they fall short in some important features that are found on the best laser printers. The Dell 2150cdn prints with the most basic resolution of 600dpi. This is good enough for printing payroll or basic documents, but it will leave images looking a bit blurry.","The Dell color laser printers are compact, so they will fit nicely into any nook you need to place them. The 2150cdn is pretty heavy, though, weighing almost 45 pounds. This is because it includes an automatic duplexer for printing on both sides of the media. It also uses a lot of power, 520 watts, when printing. This is almost double the power the best laser printer uses when operating.","The Dell 2150cdn has two toner options available. The smaller cartridges with a 1,200-page yield comes with this machine. However, Dell makes a 2,500-yield toner cartridge that is compatible with this color laser printer. The Dell is built tough, with a 40,000 monthly duty cycle.","The 2150cdn color laser printer holds 250 sheets of paper in its input tray. It comes with a multipurpose tray, too, but can only hold one sheet at a time. This is okay if you need to manually feed specialty-sized media such as envelopes and postcards, since this tray will help you keep the paper straight as it prints. You can purchase an additional paper tray that holds 250 more sheets.","The Dell 2150cdn color laser printer comes with 256MB of memory, though this can be expanded to 512MB. Expansion requires the purchase of a memory card that is easy to install on your own into your printer. Since the memory is so large, this printer can support multiple users networked to it. Depending on the machine you chose, the Dell color laser printer can accept wireless networking.","Dell&#39;s customer service is hard to beat. The live chat feature connects you with friendly, knowledgeable support personnel and the wait time is very short. You can connect 24/7, so you can get help as soon as you get stuck. You can also contact Dell through telephone and email for the same friendly, professional help. If you want to try troubleshooting on your own, you can read through the user guide or the FAQs on the Dell website."]},"id":"c926e10f-62bd-40ff-9a46-3824edbff208","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"33e5e730-95ac-4650-addc-501f3d034f13","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Dell color is not the best laser printer that we reviewed, it still has enough basic features to tackle your office printing needs.
