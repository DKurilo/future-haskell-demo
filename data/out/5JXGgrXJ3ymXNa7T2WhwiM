Our most recent in-house navigation GPS evaluations took over 40 hours in Purch Labs and out on the roads. We considered each device’s overall design, navigational features, interface options and ease of use, all while examining how effective each would be for users of unique experience levels. We also investigated each company’s technical support departments and various informational resources made available from the manufacture, along with the accompanying warranty.","We found that, when it comes to car GPS units, price is not always an indicator of quality. Be sure to select a device with the features you want. The most useful features a navigation GPS device can have are preloaded maps, route and lane assistance, lifetime map updates, a large capacitive touchscreen, custom points of interest and voice-activated navigation. Although some of these are premium features, together they all make for the most powerful and useful car GPS.","<strong>How Much Do GPS Navigation Systems Cost?  </strong>","It&#39;s possible to find car GPS devices under $80, but these are cheaply made and lack many features, such as touchscreens. We reviewed GPS navigation systems that range between $90 and $350. Conversely, you can buy an in-dash navigation system, which doubles as an entertainment system, for between $150 and over $500, depending on the specifications.","Of course, it&#39;s also worth noting GPS navigation apps, like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze and others, are often free and can be just as effective at providing step-by-step navigation instructions. All you need is a $5 phone holder to put on your dash.   ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","The two most important things we evaluated throughout our testing were accuracy and overall ease of use. For the applied portion of our testing, we drove around on a variety of roads – from small rural roads to busy city streets to the highway during rush hour with construction. We drove in familiar locales as well as areas we hadn’t been to, noting whether the routes provided by the devices were accurate and efficient. We also verified if 2D and 3D landmarks – for the applicable devices – were accurately represented on the screen.","We looked for devices that gave clear directions with plenty of notice before a turn. We also looked for clear on-screen visuals, updated traffic alerts and a variety of points of interest such as gas stations, hotels, restaurants and stores. We also noted how easy it was to navigate the device interface along with how easy it was to input an address and start navigating. Overall, the best devices were easy to set up and use, provided helpful instructions, and allowed for extensive smartphone compatibility for enhanced one-touch navigation and entertainment.","<strong>Smartphones vs. Dedicated GPS Units</strong>","With increasingly powerful and capable smartphones saturating the market, you may be wondering why not just use the navigation ability built in to your smartphone rather than buy a standalone GPS device. We recommend doing whatever’s best for your particular situation and budget, but it may be helpful to see the pros and cons for each before making a decision.","Navigating with a GPS device. By far, the biggest perk to using a dedicated GPS device is just that – it is dedicated to the task of providing navigational assistance. You won’t have to worry about a phone call cutting in and blocking your directions, or your cell battery dying. Higher-end models offer additional functionality, including 3D map rendering, speed limit notifications, speed trap alerts and free regular map updates. Beware budget GPS units, though, as they have resistive-touch screens, muddy interfaces and smaller screens, which taken all together may diminish your experience.","The best devices allow for voice-activated navigation so you can keep your eyes on the road, and they give you the option to pair your smartphone with it so you can take a call without having to fumble for your phone in rush hour traffic. Most dedicated GPS units also rely on multiple data sources, including satellites, so you’ll most likely have navigation even when you’re in areas with sparse or no cell signal. You can also save offline versions of your map for these scenarios.","Navigating with a smartphone. If you already own a smartphone and don’t have the budget to spring for a dedicated GPS, you can still survive your next road trip with just your phone. Smartphone GPS apps – like Google Maps and Apple Maps – offer comparable functionality to dedicated GPS units: They can show on-screen maps, tell you what lane to be in and provide step-by-step navigation. Smartphone GPS apps also allow you to download maps for offline use. However, there are downsides to using your phone as your GPS. Map apps burn through battery power, and they won’t work when there isn’t any cell signal.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a Navigation GPS Unit</strong>","Essential Features<br/>Every GPS system in our comparison has preloaded maps of the United States, ready for you to start using when you first use the device. Additionally, most have built-in microSD card slots that let you insert compatible cards containing other maps, or they’ll give you the option to download other maps for regions like Mexico, Puerto Rico or Canada. Having preloaded maps ready to go means you have reliable navigation even when you’re in an area with little or no signal.","Also, look for a car GPS with free lifetime map updates. While any device is up to date and useful when you’re first using it, roads and landscapes can change, and outdated maps can potentially lead you down the wrong road. Depending on the manufacturer, map updates can either be an automatic background process or one that requires you to manually download updated maps so that you’re always using the most current data available.","A speed limit indicator is another critical feature. This means that the GPS can tell you the speed you’re currently travelling at, along with the speed limit of the road you’re driving on. Some devices can also notify you if you’re speeding. Altogether, these features help you avoid getting a speeding ticket, even on an unfamiliar road.","Depending on your car, you may also want to consider a GPS with a hefty battery capacity, which keeps it working even when it’s unplugged. This is great if you need to use your car’s DC outlet to charge your phone, or if your car doesn’t have such an outlet. Most units in our comparison can run unplugged for up to two hours, though some can run for up to six hours.","Premium Features<br/>Along with all the essential features, the best navigational GPS units have a myriad of features that, while not necessary to guide you from point A to point B, make your journey smoother and more enjoyable. One of the most key features is voice-activated navigation. It’s one of the largest advantages smartphones have had over dedicated GPS devices historically, as it’s a faster method than typing in a destination manually. You can dictate while already driving, instead of having to type everything in before you leave. Several models we reviewed have this feature.","In addition, if you frequently drive in large cities or traveling in unfamiliar areas, 3D maps are incredibly helpful. This feature recreates landmark objects, like bridges and buildings, and models them three-dimensionally, making them easier to recognize than on traditional two-dimensional maps. Most models already have this option.","Also consider devices that have traffic receivers built into them. This feature can automatically check surrounding traffic conditions without using your smartphone (or its battery or data).","Navigation<br/>From the must-haves to the fancy add-ons, ease of use is by far the most important feature any navigation GPS can have. If it isn’t intuitive, doesn’t provide thorough step-by-step directions or makes it difficult to input an address, it isn’t worth the cost. The best car GPS devices use crystal-clear icons and labels that make it easy to choose an action or input an address.","The next most important feature is voice dictation. Poking around on a GPS device is no less dangerous than texting while driving, so a unit with voice-activated navigation is a wise choice.","A good GPS should also audibly announce which lane you’ll need to be in when making a turn or exiting the freeway, as well as showing a lane assist image on the screen at all times so you have plenty of time to get into the appropriate lane. Some units also track and display the speed limit of the road you’re driving on, which is extra useful when you’re driving in an unfamiliar area.","Destination<br/>The average screen size for GPS devices is between 3 and 7 inches, which is measured diagonally across the screen just like a TV. While smaller devices can be easily stored in your glovebox or a bag, devices with larger screens make it easier to see navigation and other on-screen options at a glance, especially while you’re driving. Additionally, while driving on the freeway, as soon as the appropriate exit nears, a visual alert appears on the screen. Because this takes up roughly one-third of the screen on these devices, a larger screen lets you easily view such alerts and still be able to view other information.","The best GPS screens have a resolution of at least 480 x 272 pixels, although GPS devices with higher resolutions – such as those above 800 x 480 pixels – give you a crisper picture that is easier to view at a glance.","If possible, you should opt for a capacitive touchscreen over a resistive one. Capacitive screens are great because they are highly accurate and sensitive, and they enable you to make pinch-to-zoom gestures, just as you can on a smartphone – an ability you simply don’t get with resistive touchscreens. Because capacitive displays respond to the electrical conductivity of your skin rather than blunt pressure, you won’t have to press the screen hard to get a response. However, resistive screens allow you to use any object to touch the screen, such as a stylus or a gloved finger. These screens typically also have slower reaction times, along with considerably lower resolutions and a smaller capacity for brightness.","Consider your car and personal needs and weigh them against the expected battery life of each GPS device. While all of the units we tested come with DC adapters, which let you power them by plugging them into your car, not all cars are compatible with this feature. Additionally, not all GPS units come with a USB cable that allows you to charge them. So, consider what you have to work with and whether a device is compatible before purchasing. If your car won’t work with a DC adapter, you may want to consider a device with a lengthy battery life."]},"id":"a4cc6950-34eb-4e29-8e58-ac8d814df594","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_261","url":"/best-navigation-gps","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-16T20:47:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-16T20:47:00Z","name":"Best Navigation GPS Units of 2019","synopsis":"We tested GPS devices by driving on rural and city streets as well as the freeway, planning multiple stops along the way.
