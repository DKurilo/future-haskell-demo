With its light weight and simple controls, the Quick Silver could have been the ultimate starter detector. Unfortunately, its poor treasure-finding performance, particularly when compared with the best metal detectors, has earned it a black mark among enthusiasts."]},"id":"dad816a9-6d38-4a0e-9679-0740a1111979","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/yMyhqVUQp8XByYN9kH5J2k.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"In terms of comfort, the Quick Silver excels. At just 2.8 pounds, it&#39;s light enough to carry for several hours at a time.

The padding on its grip and armrest are soft, strong and ready to withstand a lot of wear and tear, while the adjustable shaft locks securely into place and can be waved back and forth with barely a wobble.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/54392-bounty-hunter-quick-silver2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yMyhqVUQp8XByYN9kH5J2k.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"yMyhqVUQp8XByYN9kH5J2k","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yMyhqVUQp8XByYN9kH5J2k.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5822dc3f-2e53-497e-95fc-7264c78e19b5","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With only a few buttons on it, the detector&#39;s control box is far from complex. Its on and off buttons are inexplicably separated, but they work fine. A notching button on the lower-left of the control pad lets you progressively silence three of the detector&#39;s four target ID categories. Finally, a depth select button in the lower-right corner serves as a sort of basic sensitivity toggle, telling the detector whether to look for coins and small items close to the surface, or large buried objects several feet down.","Unsurprisingly, the Quick Silver&#39;s functionality is as simple as its controls. It sports a three-tone audio ID and a graphic target ID that classifies metal into four categories: iron, aluminum and zinc, aluminum and 5-cent pieces, and coins. An on-screen depth readout identifies targets as shallow, medium or deep, but in practice, translating the readout to usable information is tough, and finding coins that are deeper than 4 inches from the surface is a rarity. This is due, in large part, to the detector&#39;s lack of ground balancing or sensitivity settings; ghost signals are far more common than with other metal and gold detectors, and the device can randomly chirp and twitter."]},"id":"bb621492-bcc9-404d-bb94-b00a8e188f18","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5e54aba7-8ac2-4f21-bffc-b7da7b5ed0be","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This detector does have a number of basic features, including a low battery indicator, a quarter-inch headphone jack and a solid five-year parts and labor warranty.
