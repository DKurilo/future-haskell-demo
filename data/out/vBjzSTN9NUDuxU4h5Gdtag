The garage door opener system anticipates potential dangers by detecting motion and reversing the motion of the door if anything or anyone interrupts that beam. The door also automatically reverses if it makes contact with anything or anyone while closing, whether the beam is broken or not. This opener supports two 100-watt bulbs so you can have plenty of light when you get out of your car.","The integrated manual release handle ensures that you are never left without garage access, even in an emergency. This Chamberlain garage door opener also reduces the chance of criminal activity by sending different codes from your remote to your opener each time so no one can steal your code and gain access to your home.","This garage door opener also comes with two remotes, which you would not necessarily expect in a garage door opener at this price point. The extra remote will come in handy if you have two cars or as a backup if you have one car. This garage door opener also includes a keyless entry pad as part of the package.","Chamberlain provides good customer support and service. You can contact the company by email and phone, and the support representatives are responsive and friendly.
