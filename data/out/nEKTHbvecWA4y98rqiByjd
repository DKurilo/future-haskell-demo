It boasts a standard 600dpi resolution that’s fine for text-heavy documents but not ideal for images.","This laser printer compromises resolution for speed. It won’t print ultra-sharp images, but it does print pages at an impressive rate. This Dell laser printer pumps out black-and-white pages at 40ppm, a feat for any printer. The manufacturer states that it takes roughly 15.5 seconds for the first page to print, but in our experience the first page was printing in closer to 10 seconds. This printer isn’t the fastest one out of the gate, but it hits its stride once the printing begins.","There are many different ways that the Dell B2375dfw allows you to print. Wireless and mobile printing are available, including Apple AirPrint and Google Cloud Print. Google Cloud Print allows you to connect your printer to the internet, allowing you to print to your printer from virtually anywhere. You can also download the Dell Mobile Print App and print wirelessly from your mobile device to your printer as long as the mobile device is connected to the network.","Setting up the printer is easy. For quick printing, you can plug your computer or laptop straight into the printer via USB and start printing. There are no confusing configurations, menus or lists to go through if you need to start printing right out of the box. Simply turn on the printer, plug it in and print.","This multifunction laser printer holds 250 sheets of paper with the standard paper tray, and the multipurpose tray holds 50 sheets of paper. A second tray can be added that holds 520 sheets and brings the total paper capacity up to 820.","The Dell B2375dfw was designed to handle a high workload. Its monthly duty cycle is 100,000 pages per month. Though it is not recommended to print that much, your Dell laser printer should be able to handle up to that much before any wear on the printer occurs.","This laser printer can help drastically reduce the printing and energy costs. The standard toner yield for this laser printer is 3,000 pages, but it can be replaced with a toner that has a much higher yield of 10,000. It also can operate on low power, reducing your energy costs. If you experience any problems with your laser printer, it is covered by a one-year warranty."]},"id":"2a0d70a8-5613-45a9-aa9a-64874ed9c853","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ca4bc432-e599-46fd-89b4-2612c33ae5ba","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dell B2375dfw can be the ultimate workhorse for your small business.
