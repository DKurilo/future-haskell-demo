You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sony ICD-SX1000 is Sony&#39;s best digital voice recorder. It features two three-element microphones for 16- or 24-bit linear PCM recordings. The simple and intuitive design makes it easy for anyone to operate right out of the box. The recording features, like a zoom microphone and pre-record feature, make it ideal for recording lectures, dictations and meetings. The 16GB of internal storage is the most of any portable recorder we reviewed. However, it only records to one track, and the microphone fails to match the quality that you&#39;d find with the best <a href=\"/best-digital-voice-recorders\">digital voice recorders</a>.","Like all Sony voice recorders, the SX1000 converts the linear PCM recordings to four formats – WAV, MP3, AAC and WMA. The WAV format is the lossless form of the audio recorded at either 16-bit or 24-bit rates. Since it&#39;s lossless, the files can be very large. For example, a 37-minute lecture can result in a 1GB WAV file. As such, you can convert the recorded audio to the three other compressed formats, which are a fraction of the size. For example, approximately 5.5 hours of an MP3 can equal 1GB of data. The AAC format is primarily used in iTunes, while the WMA format is primarily used in Windows. Both are similar in quality to an MP3.","One of the best features is the pre-record mode. When activated, it maintains a five-second recorded buffer of sound. When you hit record, the audio file includes the audio buffer. This is a critical feature when you don&#39;t hit the record button on time. When you&#39;re recording an interview or a lecture, you usually don&#39;t control when the person begins talking. The pre-record mode gives you those first few words that you may have missed.","Another great feature is the 16GB storage capacity. The average portable recorder only has 2GB of storage, which forces you to purchase an external storage card if you need more storage. With eight times as much storage, you have enough storage for approximately 715 recordable hours before you would need an external storage card. An SDHC slot allows you to add up to 32GB of storage.","The battery life lasts up to 19 hours, which is about average. However, it&#39;s one of the few handheld recorders with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. This means that you don&#39;t have to replace batteries all the time like you would with most digital recorders. It charges by plugging into your computer via a USB port that slides out from the bottom. This also makes transferring audio files to your computer easier, because you never have to worry about losing a cord.","The drawback of the Sony ICD-SX1000 is the lack of multitrack recording. The two microphones record to two channels – a left and right mono channel. These channels combine to one stereo track. You can&#39;t layer audio or record with multiple external microphones and instruments. The best digital voice recorders are like portable recording studios that provide excellent recording in every situation, whether you&#39;re a journalist recording an interview or a musician working on a song. The SX1000 disappoints in recording situations beyond the usual – dictations, lectures and meetings."]},"id":"ab01da81-f476-44fb-8e46-7b07e7e92537","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"906d0964-694a-428b-974d-4694626da75f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony ICD-SX1000 has the most storage of the digital voice recorders we reviewed with 16GB.
