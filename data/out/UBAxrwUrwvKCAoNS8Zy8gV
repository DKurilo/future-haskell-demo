You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The Uniden GMR6000-2CKHS is a long-range <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">walkie talkie</a> with a maximum range of 50 miles. It includes several emergency and survival features that will keep you out of danger while you are in the woods. However, it is heavier than many other two-way radios and lacks the option for disposable batteries. Also, it has one of the oddest warranties we&#39;ve seen. The GMR6000 has some excellent features that make it a great option for campers and hikers, but you should be aware of some of its flaws before you buy it.","When Uniden promises a range of 50 miles, you should note that very specific conditions must be met before you&#39;ll get this kind of coverage. Radio waves travel further over calm waters, and GMRS frequencies allow for slightly more coverage. If you are using the free FRS frequencies in the woods, you can get up to five miles of coverage. This is more than most walkie talkies, and it will allow your group a little more area to explore. If you&#39;re concerned about the local weather while you are wandering the wilderness, the radio will access NOAA signals and even alert you to an emergency. If you are stuck and need help, you can program the walkie talkie to strobe SOS on the built-in LED light","This Uniden has most of the extra features that we look for, including a headset jack, silent mode and privacy codes. If you&#39;re using a headset, you can turn on the hands-free function, which will broadcast a message as you speak. Unfortunately, the GMR6000 lacks a keystroke alert, so if you accidentally press buttons while hiking, you cannot count on the radio to beep or vibrate. Also, it lacks an auto-squelch or noise cancelling, so if you are in a noisy area, it may be harder for your group to hear you.","At 3 pounds, this is among the heaviest walkie talkies we reviewed. Fortunately, it is a waterproof two-way radio, and if you drop it in the water, it will float. The screen is backlit, and it comes with both a rechargeable battery and docking station. Unfortunately, it does not accept disposable batteries, so once the battery dies, you have to find a way to charge it, a potential problem for hikers and campers.","Uniden offers several help options from its website. You can browse the FAQs or download a new manual for do-it-yourself support. If you need a representative, they are available by phone or email. The oddest part of the support is the warranty. A brand new walkie talkie comes with a three-year warranty, but if it has any signs of wear and tear, the warranty plummets to 90 days. For a device meant to be used outdoors, this warranty leaves much to be desired."]},"id":"8f479adf-140a-43d1-8d38-bfafbc25f2f9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"95e8fb4b-31d9-415f-8dbe-005dc9aa43e7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Uniden GMR6000-2CKHS is a long-range walkie talkie with great survival and emergency features.
