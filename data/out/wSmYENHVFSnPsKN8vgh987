It only holds about 22 cubic feet. Since cubic feet generally translate into bags of groceries, that is still a lot of room – enough for 22 bags – unless you have a pretty large household. This also is not our very favorite layout when we compare it to other French door refrigerators. Part of the top shelf is usurped by an ice maker, which means you really only get two full-width shelves. Since the full-width shelf is one of the nicest things about the French door units, that is kind of a bummer. There is a full-width drawer, though, and that is nice for platters and pizzas. The Frigidaire Gallery does have a retractable shelf that is great for accommodating tall items. You also have the option of a second ice machine that can be incorporated into the freezer drawer.

We have used various versions of that to help us rank French door refrigerators and make recommendations every year since, adding and subtracting features as customer interest in them increases or decreases. ","Capacity and price are among the important things we evaluate. Getting the most food storage possible is important, especially if you have a large family and need to stay within a certain budget. The best appliances in our comparison offer lots of storage options. You should be able to rearrange shelves and bins to accommodate extra-large containers of all different types. We also gave higher scores to the units with features like spillproof shelves and humidity-controlled bins that can help food stay fresher longer.","We reached out to manufacturers of brands like Maytag and Whirlpool and repair professionals asking questions about key features – and to find ways to get the best use out of your fridge for as long as possible. We also read dozens of customer reviews, scoured blogs and conducted other online research to find information like repair tips, the best time to buy refrigerators and how to find the best deals so we could pass that information on to you. We were in touch with Elise Barsch, the Social Media Manager for <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/store?gclid=CjwKCAiAgrfhBRA3EiwAnfF4tm1AD9tr8iHCUxDOqn130xSyqyrJSOLML96SUdbZevFPZrMW6BPCBRoC0wQQAvD_BwE\">iFixit</a>. She provided valuable information about current refrigerator trends with links to timely articles, blogs and forums. This gave us a better understanding of what is happening in the industry. Look for quotes from Barsch and other experts in the sections below. ","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We&#39;ve looked at professional and amateur reviews for information about how these units fit into a household. We&#39;ve spoken with appliance experts and watched YouTube videos. We&#39;ve scoured user manuals to understand how the important features work. We have contacted manufacturers to see how quickly and politely they respond to customers.","<strong>How Much Does a French Door Refrigerator Cost?</strong><strong></strong>","French door refrigerators are not cheap. The models in our lineup range between about $1,500 and $3,000. This is typical of the majority of the models on the market. Our best overall pick, the LG LFX28968ST is right in the middle of the pack in terms of pricing. So you can get a quality refrigerator at a mid-range price. You can also buy a quality refrigerator with a solid feature package, including a full-length pantry draw and exterior ice and water dispenser, at a low-end price.","A refrigerator can cost more than $10,000 if you have it <a href=\"/best-kitchen-design-software\">customized for your kitchen</a>, or less than $100 for a <a href=\"/best-mini-fridges\">small dorm-appropriate model</a>, but we kept our focus on fridges that have at least 20 cubic feet of storage and don&#39;t cost more than about $3,000. Within those parameters in mind, we looked for models with the best storage options, energy efficiency and customer support. ","<strong>Standout Features on GE French Door Refrigerators</strong>","GE has recently released models with standout features. We feature one such model in our side-by-side comparison. The <a href=\"/ge-review\">GE PYE22PMKES</a> is a reasonably priced refrigerator with a coffee maker in the door next to the water dispenser. GE partnered with Keurig to offer this innovative feature which will brew coffee, cocoa or hot water. It can take up to six minutes to heat the water, so you have to be patient, but it does the work for you. Inside the fridge, the capacity is not huge at 22.3 cubic feet, but it makes good use of space with three tiers of shelves for all types of groceries. The crisper drawers let you set the temperature at different temperatures for fruits or vegetables. The bottom drawer lets you customize the temperature to 32 degrees for meat, 34 degrees for beverages or 36 degrees for deli meats.","If you’re interested in a larger capacity GE model, the GE GFE26JEMDS is a good option. For a French door fridge in this price range, its 25.6 cubic feet of interior space is quite generous. The top shelf in the refrigerator easily slides in allowing for extra space to store a pitcher or bottles on the shelf below it. The freezer section occupies 8.1 cubic feet of the total space. It’s nicely sectioned off into four compartments and two levels, allowing you to organize the food in a way that suits your family. The overall feature package is somewhat more basic than the GE PYE22PMKES, but its capacity makes it a good economic choice for big families. ","<strong>Finding the Best Refrigerator Style for You</strong>","French door refrigerators have a functional layout that suits most people, and they tend to work well for big families. They fit in most kitchens and give you a lot of refrigerator space that you can organize to suit your family. French door refrigerators have more door space than any other style of fridge, giving you easy access to snacks, drinks and other frequently accessed foods. The main compartment of the fridge along with the door and drawer space all reside at eye level. You don’t have to bend over or, in extreme situations, get down on your hands and knees to find something in the deep recesses of your fridge. For this reason, French door refrigerators are less inclined to harbor expired fugitives that smell up your fridge and even taint the taste of fresher food if they go undetected too long.","For many people the open, out-of-the-way freezer space French door refrigerators provide works because you only have to access the freezer from time to time, and there is plenty of space for frozen food when you need it. But if you are someone who stockpiles frozen food items and needs well organized freezer space, a <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a> might be a better choice for you. Side-by-side refrigerators have a lot of door and drawer storage space, both in the fridge and freezer. The fridge often includes crisper drawers to keep fruits and vegetables fresh, but the space is not quite as easy to reach. Many models of side-by-side and French door refrigerators have in-door ice and water dispensers, which is a convenient feature, especially when you have thirsty kids around – a water dispenser may encourage them to drink more water and less soda.","The other, more traditional, design includes a small freezer box above or below the refrigerator space. The one advantage (or for some people disadvantage) of this design compared to a side-by-side or French door refrigerator is you get more refrigerator space and less freezer space. If you tend to keep more fresh food on hand and have less of a need for large amounts of frozen food, this style may be a valid option for you.","<strong>Which Refrigerator Brand Is Most Reliable?<br/></strong>","The answer is all of them and none of them. In other words, no brand is necessarily more reliable than another. However, specific models and refrigerator types are more reliable. Some people swear by specific refrigerator lines like the GE Profile or Kenmore Elite.","Simplicity can also be an indicator of reliability. Special features like water and ice dispensers are a nice convenience, but they also mean extra parts that can wear out. A fridge with simple functionality is often the best choice.","Elise Barsch of iFixit said, “All modern refrigerators generally function the same way and have similar levels of energy efficiency. Reliability – aka repairability – depends on the number of extra features: ice makers, water dispensers, smart panels. So those premium, and especially smart, models from any brand are going to be the least reliable.”","Barsch said with ice maker replacement costs ranging between about $60 and $200, it is up to the individual whether it is worth replacing. If the issue is a <a href=\"https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/family-says-smart-refrigerator-cant-be-repaired-yet-because-its-too-high-tech/77-621418679\">software problem</a> you may not be able to fix it at all, she said.","<strong>When is the Best Time to Buy a Refrigerator?</strong>","Since new refrigerator models come out in the summer, it is one of the best times to buy a brand new model or to find good deals on last year’s models. Many stores may even be willing to negotiate a price below clearance if they’re anxious to move old stock. Holidays are also good times to buy all kinds of products, including fridges. Black Friday is the most obvious example of good holiday deals, but it’s certainly not the only one.","Vaughn Johnson, brand manager at Maytag, confirmed that manufacturers sometimes lower the prices of older models when they introduce new refrigerators to the market. And annual holidays like Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Veterans Day are typically the best times to find good deals on fridges, he said. Vaughn also pointed out that May is Maytag Month, so if you’re specifically interested in a Maytag model, that’s a good time to buy.","However, you can’t always wait for the perfect time. If your old fridge dies, you need to replace it. In that case, you can check local eCommerce sites, such as Shopify, for good deals on gently used models. You may be surprised by what you can find. Newspaper circulars and retailers’ marketing emails are also good places to look.","<strong>Why Are French Door Refrigerators Popular?</strong>","French door refrigerators look stylish and have easy-to-organize layouts and large capacities, which makes them perfect for families. They also have all the door space of a side-by-side refrigerator, but since the doors are smaller, French door fridges are handy for tight spots. Pizza boxes and other large, odd-shape items fit easily inside, since shelves stretch the full width of the refrigerator. Newer models come with in-door water and ice dispensers – a great feature for families that can encourage kids to drink more water. ","Vaughn Johnson, brand manager at Maytag, feels French door refrigerators are popular in part because they make it easy to organize food. Also, since the freezer is out of the way, popular food is within easy reach. “French door refrigerators are sleek and stylish and boast wide and deep shelving. They have an industrial look that’s been well received by homeowners since their introduction into the market,” he said. ","In addition, the freezer layout allows you to store a lot of frozen food in a small space. Many models have tiers in their freezers, which let you organize the food better than you can in other types of fridges. However, the food in the freezer section of a French door refrigerator is not as easy to access as it is in a side-by-side refrigerator. Still, since you don’t access frozen food as often as fresh food, this is usually not a deal breaker.","French door refrigerators are energy efficient. To access many items, you only have to open one side of the refrigerator, letting out less cold air and thus conserving energy. They cost more to run than some other types of fridges, but given their large capacities, they are at least as efficient as most other styles.","<strong>How Long Should a Refrigerator Last?</strong>","There is no general agreement on the lifespan of a refrigerator. <a href=\"https://www.nachi.org/life-expectancy.htm\">Nachi.org</a> lists the lifespan of refrigerators between nine and 13 years. There is no differentiation between different types of fridges, like French door or side-by-side. They should all have comparable lifespans, and some sources estimate the lifespan at up to 15 years.","Elise Barsch, Social Media Manager for iFixit, said a study done in Europe, and published on <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652614000419\">ScienceDirect</a>, suggests that the lifespan of refrigerators has decreased over the past couple decades, down from an average lifespan of about 20 years in 2000 to about 14 years for the refrigerators sold now. While they don’t last as long, they are more energy efficient than they used to be, Barsch said. “Fortunately, legislators in Europe are working to make sure refrigerators are not only more energy efficient while in use, but also more repairable over the course of their entire lifespan,” Barsch said. She was referring to a set of <a href=\"https://ifixit.org/blog/12497/eu-ecodesign-vote/\">legislative proposals</a> European member states voted on that were designed to make refrigerators more repairable and therefore less impactful on the environment. Future legislation will focus on washing machines and other products.","<a href=\"https://www.jdpower.com/business/ratings/study/Kitchen-Appliance-Satisfaction-Study-Refrigerator/4414ENG/French-Door/1286\">J. D. Power</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149&amp;catid=&amp;Itemid=214&amp;i=Household+Appliances\">American Customer Satisfaction Index</a> have conducted studies to show which brands have the best customer satisfaction. But that is not necessarily a reflection of longevity. J. D. Power’s study breaks down brand satisfaction for different categories like ease of use, features and warranty, and ACSI provides a general percentage score for different brands. Brands tend to be less consistent than specific models when it comes to customer satisfaction. Often fridges with simple functionality have the most longevity. Once you decide on the fridge that is best for you, it is a good idea to consider buying an extended warranty, which is discussed more in our Warranty section below.","<strong>What Regular Maintenance Does Your Refrigerator Need?</strong>","You don’t have to be a professional repair person to keep your refrigerator running well for many years. Elise Barsch of iFixit pointed us to few things you can do regularly to keep your refrigerator running smoothly and prevent serious repair issues:"]},"id":"c0ad7765-7720-4df3-b4ea-0af61a389c01","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["If you notice ice or frost build-up inside your refrigerator, make sure your evaporator coils are clean. The evaporator can be accessed behind a panel inside your fridge.","Routinely clean dust and dirt from the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/86495/Why+are+my+fridge+and+freezer+not+cooling#answer86526\">condenser</a>, which is usually located underneath your fridge.","Don’t overstuff your fridge or block any cooling vents so air can circulate properly, as detailed in on the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/take-care-of-your-fridge-and-it-might-last-longer/2018/08/20/e8381364-9f42-11e8-8e87-c869fe70a721_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.698a317af524\">Home &amp; Garden</a> website."],"type":"ul"},"id":"619c52b4-0fa5-462f-bb92-480914afb81a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Barsch also recommends accessing <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/Device/Refrigerator\">forums</a> that will help you troubleshoot specific problems.","<strong>Counter-Depth Refrigerators</strong>","If you have limited kitchen space or are concerned about aesthetics, you should consider a cabinet depth French door refrigerator. Counter depth refrigerators are typically 25 inches deep and stand flush against your cabinets. They have the advantage of giving a uniform look to your kitchen and eliminating the problem of the refrigerator door swinging open too wide and potentially interfering with other appliances. One problem is this type of fridge tends to have less interior space. Most of the French door fridges in our comparison are deeper than the average counter depth refrigerator. The <a href=\"/samsung-review\">Samsung RF23HCEDBSR</a> is one exception.","The average top freezer refrigerator offers between 18 and 21 cubic feet of space, including the freezer. These single door refrigerators are more commonly flush with cabinet space. In contrast, French door refrigerators range from about 22 to 30 cubic feet of space. One cubic foot of space would roughly fit about one bag of groceries, so a few cubic feet can make a lot of difference. French door refrigerators do offer uniquely arranged space that is well suited for families, so if you are in the market for a cabinet depth French door refrigerator, there are plenty out there to choose from. ","<strong>Storage</strong>","The best refrigerators are designed to let you use every square inch of interior real estate to store food in a logical and convenient way. For example, families commonly need plenty of door space for gallon bottles, since this frees up room in the main compartments for food.","Also, the more organized the drawer space, the better. Temperature-controlled crisper drawers not only give you designated space for fruits and vegetables, but they also preserve produce for longer. Fridges with adjustable shelves and bins let you customize the space so it fits the foods you keep on hand. Some of the fridges we reviewed have shelves you can retract to fit tall items like pitchers, and most French door refrigerators have removable shelves, which make it easy to customize the space to fit bulky items like coolers and blenders. Since French door refrigerators have a more open freezer space than other types of fridges, it’s nice when it has two or three tiers of compartments to keep it organized. ","Vaughn Johnson, brand manager at Maytag, said there are many innovations underway focused on improving food storage. He said a couple new features on the Maytag MFT2772HEZ model are the Store-N-Door ice dispenser and a durable, full-length, metal slide-out shelf. The ice dispenser frees up space in the fridge for food storage, and the slide-out shelf gives you quick access to your favorite foods.","<strong>Energy Efficiency<br/></strong>","Even if you are not especially concerned with the environmental impact of your appliance, you are likely to welcome a lower energy bill. While French door refrigerators don’t have a reputation for superb energy efficiency, some are better than others.","French door refrigerators cost more to run than other types, with the exception of side-by-side refrigerators, which cost even more. This is partly because French door refrigerators tend to have a larger capacity than other types. However, all types of fridges are much more energy efficient than they used to be, as estimated by this <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=refrig.calculator\">Energy Star calculator</a>. Prior to 1980 a 24.5-cubic-foot French door refrigerator cost close to $450 per year to run. Today a French door refrigerator of that capacity costs around $80 a year to run.","The information about energy use is easy to find on most of these units, whether you’re looking online or in a store. Look for the label that lists the estimated cost to run the refrigerator annually. The LG LFXS28968S, the top refrigerator in our side-by-side comparison, has a capacity of nearly 28 cubic feet and it only costs $88 a year to run, making it one of the most energy efficient models in our lineup. ","<strong>Warranties</strong>","Most French door refrigerators come with a few different layers of warranty – an overall warranty, which is usually only a year, and different coverage for the compressor, water filter and other elements of the unit. Since refrigerators represent a major purchase for most people, it is worth searching out a company that offers good warranty coverage and other forms of customer support.","While extended warranties are not always the best idea for many products and services, refrigerator extended warranties with the right company can work in your favor. Most issues you encounter with refrigerators tend to happen in the first few years, so an extended warranty can get you through that stretch. Stores like Home Depot and Lowes offer useful extended warranties. For example, a three-year extended warranty at Lowe’s costs $120 and a five-year extended warranty is $210. If you don’t use the extended warranty at all, you get a 30 percent reimbursement. You also get up to $300 food spoilage reimbursement for food that goes bad while the fridge is being repaired. You get up to 50 percent reimbursement on replacement filters during the extended warranty period. Home Depot’s warranty offers similar coverage. ","<strong>More Refrigerator and Freezer Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"62df9b8b-6db9-41e5-98ec-2ae3ef4cc0b8","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-refrigerators-review\">The Best Refrigerators Overall</a>","<a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">The Best Side-by-Side Refrigerators</a>","<a href=\"/best-mini-fridges\">The Best Mini Refrigerators</a>","<a href=\"/best-freezers\">The Best Freezers Overall</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e2d09b6a-adb5-4710-944a-5cbaa8236469","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"1512877c-906f-4321-ac05-f0222264e76c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/lg-review\">LG LFXS28968S</a>","<a href=\"/maytag-mfi2570fez-review\">Maytag MFI2570FEZ</a>","<a href=\"/ge-review\">GE PYE22PMKES </a>","<a href=\"/whirlpool-review\">Whirlpool WRX735SDHZ</a>","<a href=\"/samsung-review\">Samsung RF23HCEDBSR/AA </a>","<a href=\"/frigidaire-fghd2368tf-review\">Frigidaire FGHD2368TF</a>","<a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore Elite 74033</a>","<a href=\"/amana-review\">Amana AF12539ERM</a>","<a href=\"/kitchenaid-review\">KitchenAid KRFF707ESS</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"9b2a2bde-01e3-469d-afb2-c5188a23b573","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_74","url":"/best-french-door-refrigerators","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-02-25T12:01:00Z","datePublished":"2019-02-25T12:01:00Z","name":"Best French Door Refrigerators of 2019","synopsis":"This one is tucked out of the way and you have access to all of the top shelf.
