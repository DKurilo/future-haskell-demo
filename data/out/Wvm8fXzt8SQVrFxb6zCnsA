Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-compact-microwaves\">Compact Microwaves here</a>.</em>","The GE JES0736SPSS is very similar to the other GE compact microwave we reviewed, although this model has a more sophisticated arrangement on its control panel. Unfortunately, this microwave oven does not have as many preset programs as some of the other products we reviewed.","This microwave comes with only six presets, although they are the most common preset programs available in countertop microwaves. In addition, in many households, these are the preset programs that people use the most. They include: popcorn, pizza, beverage, potato, fresh vegetable and reheat.","What this compact microwave offers is quite practical in everyday life, especially in a small apartment kitchen, dorm room or the snack area in a den. The most useful preset is Reheat, which is great for warming up leftovers from the day before. You can use the Reheat function to heat an entire plate – even pasta, which can be tricky at times.","This compact microwave includes a child lock function, as does other models we reviewed. However, the child lock isn&#39;t labeled anywhere on the control panel. To lock the countertop microwave, press and hold 0. &#34;Lock&#34; will appear on the display, which means you won&#39;t be able to see the time until the microwave is unlocked. To unlock it, hold down 0 again. This will protect children from trying to &#34;cook&#34; and potentially getting burned. It also will prevent anyone from slipping up and running the compact microwave oven when it is empty, which can damage the appliance.","The multi-cook option available on this model includes four stages if you include an auto-defrost stage. Setting the multi-cook function involves entering the time and power levels for each stage and then pressing Enter. The timer will beep when each stage is complete.","One of the reasons this compact microwave ranks higher than the other GE microwave is because of its design. The sleek, stainless steel exterior and the button layout just look classier than the black or white options of the other GE model we reviewed. The square buttons fit the text better, and everything is just easier to read.","The manual provided with this product is quite comprehensive. For example, it includes a lot of good information on cooking vegetables using the Time Cook setting instead of the Vegetable preset. This table includes suggestions on making sure that the vegetables you cook in the microwave end up soft in texture, but not mushy. The manual has information about caring for and cleaning the appliance, and it also features a table that addresses a few troubleshooting issues. The manual gives a few terms and definitions, which are useful when reading the rest of the manual to make sure you understand what the instructions mean.","You get useful help and support from the GE website. On it, you will find an email form, phone number and live chat function if you have any questions. The website also provides a FAQs section that addresses microwave ovens in general, has a troubleshooting section and offers written information about how to use different types of microwave ovens."]},"id":"f136c7bc-d28c-47e8-a5fb-b4a02985aa48","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e9c49d52-2445-4dab-a711-bfadc6f14b1b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE JES0736SPSS is one of the best looking stainless steel compact microwave ovens among the products we reviewed.
