This water oven&#39;s all-in-one design offers some benefits over immersion circulators, and its simple interface makes sous vide cooking easy. Unfortunately, this is one of the more expensive devices we tested.","During testing, we discovered that this device produced a beautiful level of flavor and texture in both our steak and chicken testing. The interface was super easy to use and made the cooking process easier. However, we found this device difficult to empty afterwards. Since it doesn&#39;t provide a hose or draining system you will need to dump it into a sink and try not to spill water all over the place in the process.","The SousVide Supreme is a large water oven with a cooking capacity of 2.5 gallons, which gives it more capacity than the 2-gallon average of other water ovens. This is large enough to fit about 12 bags of food, each holding a small 4-ounce cut of steak. Although this is large for a water oven, this capacity is much smaller than sous vide circulators, which can heat an average of 5 gallons, with the highest capacity being 10 gallons. Consider purchasing a circulator, like <a href=\"/sansaire-review\">Sansaire</a>, if you plan to cook large quantities of food.","This machine runs silent, unlike the <a href=\"/vonshef-review\">VonShef</a> water oven. Most immersion circulators heat the water with motors that can be as loud as a clogged fish tank filter, varying from a dull hum to a loud whirring. You may get used to the sound of most immersion motors after a while, but it can get annoying during long cooks (think 48 hours). We found this machine to be quiet so it will have zero audio presence in your kitchen.","The all-in-one design is another benefit of this unit. While circulators require an external container of water, such as a cooler or pot, the Supreme’s container is integrated in the device. Sous vide cooking with this machine is as simple as pouring water in it and turning it on. Water ovens do tend to be more expensive than immersion circulators, and the same goes for this one. The manufacturer sells it for roughly $380, which is more than double the price of the <a href=\"/anova-review\">Anova</a>, our number one pick.","The integrated design is coupled with a simple interface. Everything you need to know about what’s happening with the cooking is on the interface, from the temperature to the time. Each button is clearly labeled with icons alongside a brightly-lit LED display. The simple and integrated design of this unit allows you to try sous vide recipes with ease.","The silence and ease of the SousVide Supreme&#39;s design makes it one of the best sous vide machines on the market. While most water ovens can’t match the capacity of some immersion devices, this is a relatively large, all-in-one water oven. The biggest downside to this device is the high price tag."]},"id":"703cae0b-a277-443f-abf2-6bed8ea70efc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68499","url":"/sousvide-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-30T16:01:51Z","datePublished":"2016-09-30T16:01:51Z","name":"Sousvide Supreme 10L","synopsis":"SousVide Supreme is a quiet and user-friendly sous vide machine.
