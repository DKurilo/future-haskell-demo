You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","TSM Products (The Sausage Maker, Inc.) has introduced the D-10 Stainless Steel <a href=\"/best-dehydrators\">10 shelf Food Dehydrator</a>. This dehydrator is the large, family-sized food dehydrator in the product line.","Ideally, TSM’s products are the ultimate resource for hunters, gardeners or anyone looking to preserve their fruits, vegetable and meats. The company&#39;s original Sausage Maker designs are incorporated into every TSM product.","The D-10 Food Dehydrator’s food grade stainless steel will never rust no matter how much you use it. It offers 16 square feet of drying space and is equipped with 10 stainless steel shelves, each containing quarter inch holes and measuring at 16 and a fourth by 14 and a half inches.","The adjustable rack design allows for thorough interior cleaning of the unit. The removable back panel houses motor and electrical components. The rear-mounted fan and louvered door control air circulation and help maximize moisture removal in the dehydrator. The 800 watts of heating and drying power create a horizontal airflow that helps maintain a consistent temperature and allows food to dry evenly. Temperatures range from 90 degrees to 155 degrees Fahrenheit.","The unique features on this particular food dehydrator are the temperature control and timer. The D-10 Food Dehydrator’s temperature control and timer allow food to be dried for up to 27 hours. This means you don’t have to be constantly watching over your food and checking its progress during the drying process. Just set the timer and come back when the food is dried and ready to be stored. All of the great features come at a cost, though. If you need something more budget-friendly, consider the <a href=\"/presto-review?status=InProgress\">Presto Dehydro</a>.","You can also purchase accessories to go along with the TSM D-10. Dehydrator trays, shelves, racks and drying screens are all sold separately. Jerky supplies, seasonings and kits are also available for purchase. If you are new to dehydrating food or just want to try out something different, TSM offers a recipe page as well for those new to dehydrator. The 10 trays and quick drying help make the D-10 food dehydrator a valid option."]},"id":"5270cfe6-9224-445e-a407-af9071909983","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61119","url":"/tsm-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-11T19:22:12Z","datePublished":"2014-11-11T19:22:12Z","name":"TSM D-10 Stainless Steel 10 shelf Food Dehydrator","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-11T19:22:12Z","id":"gNPKajqfQPpwyhBKzymdda","meta":{"title":"TSM D-10 Stainless Steel 10 shelf Food Dehydrator Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TSM Products food dehydrator includes 10 shelves, more than many other dehydrators.
