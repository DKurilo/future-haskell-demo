You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are looking for a traditional <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">medical alert bracelet</a> similar to the <a href=\"/lifetag-review\">LIFETAG</a> or <a href=\"/lynx-roman-review\">Lynx Roman</a> bracelets, where you only need to share a limited amount of information, the Hera Stretch Medical Alert Bracelet from N-Style ID may be a good choice. This women&#39;s bracelet is made from stainless steel and features a classic herringbone style and simply slips on and off over the wrist.","Made from stainless steel, this medical ID bracelet is suitable for daily wear and tends to pair well with almost any clothing. It comes in two parts: an ID tag, referred to as the Contempo ID Tag, and a strap. What makes this product unique is that it stretches over the hand, so you won&#39;t need to finagle with a clasp to wear it. With its classic herringbone design, this piece looks more like regular jewelry than a medical bracelet.","The ID tag is available in various colors including solid (no color), red, purple, pink, gold, black and blue. Regardless of the color you choose, the ID tag features the Rod of Asclepius symbol, a universal symbol that represents healing and medicine. Any first responder or medical professional that sees this bracelet will immediately know that it is a medical alert bracelet and check for your medical information.","The ID tag that comes with this ID bracelet can include up to three lines of laser engraved text, up to 18 characters per line. If you need an extra line, you can purchase the Max Contempo Medical ID tag that is a little larger. Regardless of which tag you choose, it can be easily removed from the Hera bracelet and attached to any other bracelet from N-Style ID. To make this medical ID bracelet look a little more like regular jewelry, you can purchase charms to attach to the tag. Some of the charms available include a heart, ankh, yin yang, cross, elephant, awareness ribbon, peace sign, butterfly and Star of David. Personalized charms are also available.","The bracelet itself is available in various sizes that range from 6 3/4 to 8 3/4 inches, so you&#39;ll have the option to choose the size that fits you. If you feel you need something larger than 8 3/4 inches, N-Style ID takes custom orders on some designs.","The Hera Stretch Medical Alert Bracelet is a good choice if you want a traditional jewelry-like look. However, it can only hold four short lines of text at most, which may not be enough if you need to include a lot of medical information. Because everything is engraved on the bracelet itself, there are also no security options and no option to provide your practitioner with digital health records."]},"id":"b5f6358a-5325-4471-8b43-31857f44fff9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63675","url":"/hera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:16:14Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:16:14Z","name":"Hera Stretch","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-24T19:16:14Z","id":"NAr7D7ofHSTavUrCGnvhUh","meta":{"title":"Hera Stretch Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Hera Stretch Medical Alert Bracelet is ideal for those who only need to share a little medical information.
