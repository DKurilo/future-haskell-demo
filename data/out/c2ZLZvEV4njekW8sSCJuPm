The top 2 inches of Avena foam give the mattress breathability, while 2 inches of memory foam below that add contouring, softness and pressure-point relief. The 6-inch base layer of foam provides overall support, and the whole thing is covered by a great-looking gray mattress cover with four white stripes across the bottom-third of the mattress. The simple but quality look of the mattress is indicative of the overall quality of the bed.","<strong>Leesa:  My Sleep Experience</strong>","Before I get into my own sleep experience with the Leesa <a href=\"/best-mattress\">mattress</a>, let me first describe myself. I am a 5’9”, 160-pound male who is both a stomach and back sleeper, but I end up mostly on my stomach. I am generally a light sleeper and have a heightened awareness of where I sleep at night – basically, if the bed isn’t comfortable, I can’t sleep at all.","I slept on the Leesa memory foam mattress for one week. During the first two nights, I used the old box spring from my current mattress for support – that was not a good idea. Generally, stomach sleepers need more support, especially lower-back support. The box spring wasn’t sturdy, flat or rigid enough to offer me full support. Mattresses such as Leesa and <a href=\"/health-and-beauty\">Casper</a> should not be placed on box springs. The first night, I didn’t sleep well at all and got out of bed with a fair amount of back pain in the morning. The second night I fell asleep rather quickly, but still woke up with a fair amount of lower back pain.","I purchased a piece of plywood to put over the top of the box spring, so I wouldn’t have to sleep on the floor. That made all the difference in the world. After that, I slept well and my lower back pain dissipated until gone.","The feel of the mattress is medium, but ever-so slightly on the soft side of medium. I experienced a bit of the hugging and sinking-in feeling that is associated with memory foam mattresses, but I didn’t feel like it was completely sucking me in. I felt ample support when I did lie on my side.","The bed is much softer and far less springy than my current spring mattress, and it has a softer feel than many of the other mattresses we tested. The sinkage of the mattress takes getting used to. When I sat on the side edges, I experienced 2.5 inches of sinkage. I experienced even more – 3.5 inches – sitting on the foot of the bed. It slightly feels as though the mattress is attempting to roll you off the bed as opposed to propelling you upwards and on to your feet. However, when I lay on the edge, as opposed to sitting, I never felt as though I would roll off; there was just as much support at the edges as in the center.","My co-worker, who is much taller and weighs much more than I do, also sat and lay on the bed, and, surprisingly, the support wasn’t much different. While sitting on the edges, the mattress only sank about half an inch lower than it did for me, and the end support didn’t change. Even if you are heavier (300-plus pounds), the mattress isn’t going to cave in on you or roll you out of bed.","I prefer sleeping in a cool environment. I have slept on memory foam mattresses and tossed and turned all night because I felt like I was burning up. However, I never felt too hot sleeping on the Leesa mattress. Since the 2 inches of memory foam is placed below the 2 inches of Avena foam, it kept me cool while I slept.","People often wonder how long the smell lasts after the mattress is unboxed. When you remove the mattress from all of the plastic, there is a fairly strong smell of plastic and glue. This is true for most foam mattresses, and smell often goes away after 12 to 24 hours. After a week, the smell was still present in the Leesa mattress. The smell isn’t off-putting in anyway, it’s just prominent.","<strong>Leesa: Unboxing &amp; Delivery</strong>","We ordered a queen-sized Leesa mattress online and it arrived at our Purch Lab six days later. It comes in a 15 x 15 x 45 box that weighs 76 pounds. There are handles on the box, making it easy to maneuver. One person can move the box around, but two will make it much simpler.","The unboxing process is an experience. Like most mattresses you order online, The Leesa is tightly rolled in multiple layers of plastic inside of the box. After you pull it out and unroll the first layer of plastic, you begin to hear the mattress expand (it sounds like air leaking out of a tire). The mattress unrolls vertically and then unfolds perpendicularly. By the time you cut and remove the final layer of plastic, the mattress is already sleep ready. The whole process doesn’t take any more than two or three minutes.","<strong>Leesa: Returns</strong>","If the mattress doesn’t fit your needs, you can return it within the 100-day trial period. To return the mattress, there can’t be any physical damage to the bed. The mattress cover can’t be ripped, cut or stained. If you call the company to start the return process, expect a few questions about the reason for the return.","The Leesa company will send an email asking for information such as your name, address, phone and an arranged time for pickup. Depending on where you live, pickup for the mattress return isn’t always an option. We had to take the mattress to a donation center – an arranged pickup wasn’t possible in our area. After donation was complete we emailed the receipt to the Leesa online mattress company and they returned our money in full a few business days later.","If your mattress is defective, the Leesa mattress is covered by a 10-year warranty, which is a standard length for mattress companies. We were impressed with the return process. For the most part, the company was easy to work with and the process was overall hassle free. Perhaps most importantly, there weren’t any hidden fees for returning the mattress, which is always a plus. <em><br/></em>","<strong>Summary</strong>","For me, the Leesa offered a comfortable night’s sleep. The mattress has a soft, pillowy hug that contours to your body, but doesn’t make you feel like you are stuck. And it kept me cool. It is one of the most popular mattresses among consumers, and after sleeping on it for a week, I can understand why."]},"id":"a9d00e1a-eee4-4224-a451-81677fe5b38a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69418","url":"/leesa-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-06-01T12:58:09Z","datePublished":"2017-06-01T12:58:09Z","name":"Leesa Mattress","synopsis":"The Leesa Mattress is composed of three layers of foam.
