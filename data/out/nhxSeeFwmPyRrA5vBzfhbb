You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The West Bend Stainless Steel toaster is a slight step up from a <a href=\"/best-toasters\">basic toaster</a>, and it comes in both two- and four-slice varieties. The four-slice model does have dual controls. This means you can toast two separate breads simultaneously with different settings. It doesn&#39;t include a high-lift function to raise bread out of the toasting slots for easier retrieval. You will have to be careful retrieving smaller pieces of bread to avoid burning yourself.","There are standard controls included with the West Bend Stainless Steel. It includes a bagel function that toasts only the cut side of a bagel and leaves the heel side softer, a defrost control that allows you to toast breads straight from the freezer and a cancel button that will end any toasting cycle. The reheat control is a nice addition to this toaster. This control allows you to reheat your bread or pastry after it has completed a toasting cycle without it browning any further. With this control, you will have always have the option to eat warm toast.","Stainless steel appliance designs have been a staple for the modern kitchens in past years. The West Bend Stainless Steel&#39;s design fits this fashion trend. The rounded curves and black accents emulate classic stainless steel toasters. However, from an aesthetic perspective, there is nothing particularly special about this toaster’s design. It wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a model we’d swoon over or want to permanently display on a kitchen counter. This toaster does include a hide-away cord design that is perfect for storing it in a cupboard snuggly.","The West Bend Stainless Steel does not have cool-touch sides. This isn&#39;t too different from most basic electric toasters. You will need to be careful operating the toaster to avoid burning yourself, and you should be mindful children operating the toaster. The toaster does come with a removable crumb tray that aids in quick and easy cleaning.","The West Bend Stainless Steel includes a standard one-year limited warranty that covers any manufacturer defects. The user manual is online should you ever lose your hard copy, and there is an email form on West Bend&#39;s website so you can submit any more specific questions you may have."]},"id":"fa1e8c4d-c644-4dfc-be63-7de9f56d8203","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5af0830-fe42-4d49-9509-658b97e23ca4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The West Bend Stainless Steel is a step above a basic toaster.
