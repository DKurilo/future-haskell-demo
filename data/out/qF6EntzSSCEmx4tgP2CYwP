The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-dehumidifiers\">Dehumidifiers</a> here.</em>","The EdgeStar DEP501EW dehumidifier works well at removing moisture from large living areas, and this unit is especially well-suited to function as a basement dehumidifier. The unit can dehumidify a wide area despite the fact that the amount of moisture it extracts from the air, 50 pints in a 24-hour period, is lower than some of the top-ranked dehumidifiers, which, by comparison, can remove up 70 pints.","This dehumidifier removes moisture from areas reaching up to 3,000 square feet in size. The collection reservoir holds 15.9 pints of water, which reduces how often you have to empty the water bucket.","The EdgeStar also has a couple of unique features that lend it well to dehumidifying basements. It is designed to function in weather as low as 41 degrees Fahrenheit, plus the defrost feature prevents the water and moisture on the machine from freezing in cool temperatures.","The unit has several features that make it a self-maintaining machine. It features a humidistat with a range of 35 to 80 percent relative humidity. It also has a digital control panel that holds the auto restart, shut-off, defrost and timer buttons. The restart feature turns the unit back on automatically in the event of a power outage, while automatic shut-off turns the machine off when your desired humidity levels are reached or the water bucket is full.","Like most dehumidifiers, the EdgeStar has a removable air filter and two-speed fan, though it is not a quiet dehumidifier on either fan setting. It also has a full-bucket alert, as well as small window so you can see how much water has accumulated in the bucket.","If you do not want to employ the bucket, you can connect a hose to the built-in adaptor to drain to the dehumidifier. While it does not have a drain pump, if the device is near a drain, you can still use the continuous draining feature.","Even though the dehumidifier is designed to operate in large spaces, it uses a minimal amount of energy. This dehumidifier only consumes 520 watts when in use. It has an Energy Star certification that further indicates it will have a small impact on your energy bills and the environment. This dehumidifier is backed with a one-year warranty.","This is a portable, 50-pint dehumidifier, which adds to its handiness for removing excess moisture from various rooms in your house. It only weighs 36 pounds, which is significantly less than other dehumidifiers of its power and size. You can place it discreetly in your home, and it has four caster wheels to improve mobility."]},"id":"d9ff6409-5416-4cf2-8fb9-c6d443c6660f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c3061089-fa5c-4b08-b479-8ddabbd953c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The EdgeStar DEP501EW is an energy-efficient dehumidifier that effectively removes moisture from large living areas.
