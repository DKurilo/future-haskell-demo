Set up your shot with a tripod, or for something more portable and equally effective, put your camera on a beanbag for stabilization.","Your camera can t be too still when capturing pets. Try adding an image stabilization lens. You ll have the added benefit of sharp pictures even in low light.","Natural light is most flattering to animals, especially late day sunlight. If you can t take your pet outdoors, head for a sunny window or open door.","Get as close as you can. Skittish? Use a zoom lens and fill the frame with your pet.","Shoot your pet with a suitable background, one with high contrast. If your pet is black, choose a light background; if your pet is white, choose a dark one.","A better pet photo can be achieved by getting a better angle, and that s up to you. Take the photo at your pet s eye level, which may mean down on your hands and knees.","Set your camera s focus on your pet s eyes or other defining detail like whiskers or ears.","Use a fast shutter speed, say 250, if you can  manually adjust your camera, or use the preset sports or action mode on an automatic digital camera.","Try setting the ISO as high as it will go to capture the most detail. Yes, you may get some noise, but you may be pleased with the result, and it will mean much less fussing with exposure settings.","Click, click, click. And then click some more. That s the beauty of a digital camera or professional DSLR camera, no film to worry about. Professional photographers often take hundreds of photos to get one good shot. Be patient and keep clicking."],"type":"ol"},"id":"3d3584dc-6c9d-4a88-884b-2e9a3d064687","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_3250","url":"/topten-tips-taking-better-pet-photos","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"leslie-meredith","url":"/author/leslie-meredith","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Leslie Meredith","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"b79egg7hd4yc5v8h4Kiw96","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-04-04T13:11:00Z","datePublished":"2008-04-04T13:11:00Z","name":"TopTen Tips: Taking Better Pet Photos","synopsis":"Just like babies, pets are notoriously difficult to photograph.
