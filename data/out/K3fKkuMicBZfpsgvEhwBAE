Mac users can make exact 1:1 copies of their favorite DVD movies with little to no difficulty.","In addition to its simplicity, DVD Cloner for Mac offers a wealth of options for DVD copying. Naturally, you can make exact copies of everything on a disc with this Mac DVD copy application. It also allows you to select what content from the original disc makes it onto the recordable DVD. So if you want to only copy the movie on a DVD and leave off the bonus features, subtitles and other non-movie content, DVD Cloner for Mac lets you do just that.","Additionally, the application removes copy protections found on most commercial DVDs, which allows you to back up movies you own without having to install a third-party decrypter.
