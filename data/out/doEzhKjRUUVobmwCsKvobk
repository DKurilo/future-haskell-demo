You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Polk Audio has a number of impressive audio products in their lineup. Even though the<strong> </strong>Polk Audio RM8 is the lowest-rated unit in our <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1286-best-center-speakers.html\">center channel speaker</a> ranking, it is still one of the best center speaker options available. The frequency response and sensitivity are only average, but it is the lightest and most compact center speaker we reviewed. If you decide to purchase the RM8, you won&#39;t be disappointed.","This is a 2-way center speaker, which means that the audio signals are divided between two different routes: the tweeter and the woofers. Tweeters handle the high frequencies, while the woofers are in charge of the low frequencies. The 0.75-inch tweeter is small, but it is still capable of producing high volumes. The two 2.5-inch midrange drivers are made with durable composite materials. They are created using Polk Audio&#39;s Dynamic Balance technology, which uses an in-depth analysis of the mechanical system and design materials to create more efficient drivers.","At 3.8 inches high, 9.4 inches wide and 3.75 inches deep, this is the smallest center speaker we found in our review. The RM8 also is a super lightweight 3.7 pounds. That makes it so this center speaker can be easily moved or transported. It can also fit on top of most flat-screen LCD TVs. You can also hang the RM8 on the wall, if needed. It comes with a wall mount bracket and a cradle.","The Polk Audio RM8 has a frequency response of 95Hz to approximately 24kHz. The average human ear can hear frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz. This product can play some of the supersonic tones beyond our range of audible hearing. It doesn&#39;t play as high as the Yamaha NS-C310 or the Definitive Technology ProCenter 1000, but around 25Hz seems to be the standard for Polk Audio center speakers. Most subwoofers will play frequencies under 80Hz, so the lower tones aren&#39;t as important on a center channel speaker, but there may be some cutoff since the RM8 only goes to 95Hz.","Polk Audio has a wide variety of help and support options on their website. They have the standard email support, telephone support and FAQs page on their site. In addition to this, they also offer live chat with a customer support agent. However, the live chat option is not found on the support page. To use the live chat feature, you have to click on the red &#34;Chat&#34; button in the top right corner of the website. This button is only available during certain hours of the day. This center speaker is covered by a 5-year warranty on parts and labor."]},"id":"14d7ed21-16b0-4253-aa7f-6d86ebd8cba8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"58773400-23a0-4b6c-baf6-3dcf8894b8cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite the low ranking in our review, the Polk Audio RM8 is still one of the top ten center speakers available today.
