The First Alert SA320CN is equipped with dual-sensor capabilities, which means it includes a photoelectric sensor and an ionization sensor. Photoelectric sensors are best at detecting smoke from slow-burning, smoldering fires before they have had a chance to ignite. Ionization sensors are more adept at sensing fast-burning, flaming fires. When combined, these two technologies offer the best possible coverage for any type of fire.","This smoke detector does not include a carbon monoxide (CO) detector, but considering CO detectors are not needed in every home or every room, this shouldn’t be taken as a big drawback. CO detectors are only required in homes that are at risk. This includes homes with fuel-burning appliances, homes with frequently used fireplaces and homes that are exposed to carbon monoxide from attached garages. If your home falls under this category, consider installing one CO detector at every level of your home for efficient coverage."]},"id":"e68faf4b-ee3c-4ace-ba07-54d138626321","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"292de48c-9117-43cf-992c-23769855d06d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/6jJN7F2DepnEs7DXTroMeK.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60788-first-alert-sa320cn8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jJN7F2DepnEs7DXTroMeK.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6jJN7F2DepnEs7DXTroMeK","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jJN7F2DepnEs7DXTroMeK.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4056ef9a-db21-4da4-9f5f-1ad0c1af8706","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Interconnected smoke detectors are more effective at notifying you of a fire in your home by virtue of the fact that they all go off if any one of them is tripped. If you live in a home with multiple levels, this can be a potentially lifesaving feature to have. Most hardwired smoke detectors enjoy this functionality, but few battery operated types do. The battery-operated First Alert SA320CN falls into the latter category because it cannot wirelessly interconnect with other First Alert devices. This means that if an alarm goes off in your basement in the middle of the night, you may not hear it immediately. To determine if the SA320CN is right for you, take stock of the layout of your home. You may decide to choose another device that is capable of interconnecting with other smoke alarms.","Since the SA320CN runs fully on battery power, you can install units anywhere they’re needed throughout your home. Older homes that haven’t been brought up to modern code with respect to electrical rewiring may not have the ability to accommodate hardwired smoke detectors. For this reason, opting for a wireless smoke detector could save you from that additional expense."]},"id":"0c4d2f1e-8cbe-4fd3-993c-758890b5566f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"6c37e0c4-e0c0-428d-afb3-2564b1528ac5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/uSqdDoDgBDVZp3VygHPC5Z.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60788-first-alert-sa320cn5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSqdDoDgBDVZp3VygHPC5Z.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"uSqdDoDgBDVZp3VygHPC5Z","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSqdDoDgBDVZp3VygHPC5Z.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8262c282-0a1d-4af6-b8a2-2ac1e9df9f53","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The First Alert SA320CN is utilitarian in design and offers many of the standard features present in most wireless smoke detectors.
