The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-mac-antivirus-software\">Mac Antivirus Software</a> here.</em>","If you concentrate on the three most important characteristics of the best Mac antivirus products – malware detection, impact on system performance, and help and support – then G Data Antivirus for Mac shines brightly. However it lacks some extra features that are becoming standard among its competitors, features that may or may not be important to you – parental software for example. But first, let’s consider how well G Data Antivirus for Mac lives up to the “antivirus” in its name.","Although G Data was not present for the July 2014 AV-Comparatives Mac antivirus tests, it did compete with 17 others at the Mac security software tests conducted by AV-Test in September 2014. The detection test had two parts: one to test the normal on-demand scanning activity (117 malware samples), and another to test the background threat detection ability as the lab copied 84 infected files between folders. G Data was one of three best software packages to detect every threat sample it encountered.","More evidence that G Data publishes one of the best virus protection products for Mac is how little performance loss it inflicts on its host computer. In order to test performance loss, AV-Test first timed how long it took to copy 7.3GB of data on a Mac running Apple OS X 10.9.4 without any Mac virus protection. This took 17.2 seconds. With G Data installed and active, the same exercise of copying 7.3GB of data took only 19.1 seconds: less than two seconds slower. There was so little effect on system performance that the average person would not be able to tell whether this application was installed simply by considering performance. Some competing Mac security software did not do as well. In fact one of them slowed its host Mac by more than seven minutes yet still failed to detect malware with the same level of accuracy as G Data.","Similar to most Mac antivirus software products, G Data Antivirus for Mac guards you against phishing, which is almost more of a threat to Mac users than malware. And in case any Windows malware tries to sail through your Mac on its way to PC users downstream from you, G Data detects it. Unlike some of its competitors, this software does not include a proprietary firewall, but then the Mac OS has its own formidable firewall, which works fine with G Data. If you have children and want parental software bundled with your antivirus software for Mac, then this application is not going to be right for you.","Help and support are available 24/7 via email and telephone, a very good thing. It is surprising that some security software publishers do not maintain 24/7 access to support, given the stakes involved."]},"id":"ef04b8fe-152b-4145-bdb8-ee4a179e2a69","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ad45b089-5e20-46a0-ab6d-b70098a36d86","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["G Data Antivirus for Mac has proven it can run with the big dogs when it comes to malware detection with negligible effect on host system performance.
