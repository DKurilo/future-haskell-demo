You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Lifeline was the first <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-systems\">medical alert system</a> in the United States. Now owned by Philips, Lifeline offers medical monitoring pendants that detect falls and alert the monitoring center within moments for the fastest possible response. The company&#39;s medical monitoring center can accommodate more than 200 languages. Philips Lifeline is a great solution if you need assistance with installing the system. The company can send a skilled technician to your home to ensure that everything is installed properly and that the system is securely connected to the monitoring center. This optional installation help does cost a one-time fee, however. You can also have the equipment mailed to you so you can set it up yourself.","As with most medical alert systems, Philips Lifeline’s HomeSafe system costs about $30 a month. Unfortunately, the account also comes with a $50 activation fee, which is something most medical alert services don’t have. In addition, the service doesn’t have a yearly or quarterly payment option available to lower the monthly cost. The premium GoSafe costs about $55 a month, which is higher than most services at this level of premium service.","Philips Lifeline&#39;s GoSafe premium package includes its AutoAlert with Fall Detection option – a pendant that detects falls. This pendant automatically alerts the monitoring center whenever it senses a fall. The technology can tell the difference between a drop and a fall, reducing the risk of alerting the monitoring center if you drop your pendant on accident. If you or your loved one falls and can&#39;t press the button, you can still count on getting help.","You can add a voice extension console and a lockbox to your service for an additional one-time fee. When you place the voice extension console in a different area of your home from the main console, it increases the two-way speakerphone voice communication to a larger area. You can keep a spare home key in the lockbox in case you are locked out of your home. In the case of an accident, minor or major, Lifeline can also give the combination of the lockbox to whomever you designate to enter your home to assist you, whether that&#39;s family, neighbors or emergency services.","For seniors who have a hard time remembering when to take their medication and how much to take, Philips Lifeline&#39;s medication dispensing service can help prevent dangerous medication errors. This service includes a dispenser button for the medication and an audio reminder when it&#39;s time to take each dose.","Philips Lifeline offers a standard base with 30 hours of backup battery power in case of an emergency. The range for this medical alert system varies according to the layout and materials of your home, but the optimal range is 500 feet, which is on the low midrange for comparable systems. In our outdoor tests, however, it reached 1,080 feet - more than twice its specified range. In addition, the indoor tests were good, reaching 350 feet. By comparison, a similar system by <a href=\"/lifestation-review\">LifeStation</a> only reached 325 indoors and 831 outdoors. That said, <a href=\"/medical-guardian-review\">Medical Guardian</a>, our best pick, reached 2,000 feet outdoors and 450 feet indoors.","You can get support or more information from the system by calling the company number, sending an email or using the convenient live chat option on the company website. The Lifeline monitoring system is a monthly service, so you can cancel at any time without early termination fees. The company includes FAQs, resource videos and helpful downloads on its site."]},"id":"2b1a944a-67aa-4dce-8869-93fd5c7d19d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d4ec312b-77c7-4887-a40a-03391427daee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Philips Lifeline offers medical monitoring from a company that&#39;s been in the business the longest, backed by a well-known name in consumer electronics.
