It keeps drinks hot for 12 hours or cold for 24 hours. In fact, during our tests the Thermos Sipp retained 91 percent of its heat after two hours and cooled down only 38 degrees after 24 hours, the best heat retention of all the <a href=\"/best-thermoses\">thermoses</a> we tested.","The Thermos Sipp is a great choice when you’re on the go. It fits nicely in car cup holders and, though snug, fits alright in standard sized stroller cup holders, too. Its lid is leak-proof, even after we spent a good amount of time dipping, tipping, shaking, tossing and bouncing this thermos around. The mouth of this tumbler fits over your nose, or you can press the flip-top lid open with one hand for a quick, spill-proof swig. There is a bar lock that slips over the top’s button so it isn’t accidentally pushed open during travel.","The stainless steel walls are insulated, which helps retain the heat of the liquid inside but also keeps the outside walls cool to the touch. It also comes with a small handle that can be looped through your belt, so it can be brought along on a hike or walk. The body of this thermos is slightly contoured, so it fits easily and naturally in your hand. One drawback is we couldn’t find anywhere on the Thermos website or in its product materials that claim this thermos is BPA free. The <a href=\"/isosteel-review\">Isosteel</a> thermos is, if it’s important for you to have a BPA-free product.","The best part of this thermos is it’s completely dishwasher safe, one of only three we tested. The top is a little awkward in shape when it is open, so it may take a moment to figure out the best way to secure it in your dishwasher, but this a very convenient feature."]},"id":"41975ea9-f084-48b2-8240-618a5b4b8434","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5b8a0770-75d5-478e-ba44-2cc28178107a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We are impressed with the Thermos Sipp. It’s a good option for a thermos on the go as it fits in both car and stroller cup holders and has a convenient pop top that can be opened with one hand.
