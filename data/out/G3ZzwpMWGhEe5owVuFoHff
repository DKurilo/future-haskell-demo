This <a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\">meat grinder</a> is equipped to handle harder items, but it has a small hopper that largely constrains its ability to handle large quantities or chunks of meat without occasional jams. Despite this efficiency problem, the grinder can still handle occasional pieces of bone and other hard textures, saving you some time from needing to cut meat into very small pieces prior to grinding.","Using a 575-watt motor, the Maverick is capable of cutting through most standard types of tender meat, provided it is kept cool enough. As meat warms up, the fat smears on the inside of the food grinder, causing it to clog the device and slow down the rate of cutting from the standard of around a pound of meat per minute. While such congestion should not cause frequent jams, the manufacturer recommends frequently cleaning out this device when grinding more than 5 pounds of meat.","The quality of the device’s cutting blade allows it to chop up harder foods. For example, if you plan to grind chicken, the electric meat grinder can handle the occasional bone without jamming or dulling the blades. While this doesn&#39;t guarantee larger bones, or meat with the skin still attached, won&#39;t become jammed sometimes, the blades and motor should be adequate for most households. However, if it does break, the device only comes with a 90-day warranty, one of the shortest warranty periods we’ve seen for this type of product. If you&#39;re looking for a meat grinder with a much longer warranty, take a look at the five-year coverage offered with the <a href=\"/waring-pro-review\">Waring Pro MG855</a>.","The Maverick comes with the standard stainless steel meat grinder accessories, such as a cutting blade, three cutting plates and a sausage cone. In addition, the device comes with a kibbe maker that allows you to make your favorite meatball recipes. The most unique of these attachments is a cookie maker die, extending the use of the device beyond simple meat grinding. However, the limited size of the meat feeding tray does limit the quantity of foods you’re able to put into the grinder at a time."]},"id":"6dfd2b72-fb11-4de5-be6d-bcf2ab140d33","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"38255155-99c8-4428-9a17-661f22da5fdb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" The Maverick MM-5501 comes equipped with a powerful motor that promises consistent grinding quality.
