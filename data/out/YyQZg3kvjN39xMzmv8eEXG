Roku joined forces with TCL to create one of the simplest LED TVs to navigate and use. This 4K TV doesn&#39;t have the color saturation or vivid picture that others atop our lineup boast, but the TV&#39;s interface is simple enough for technological novices to use.","We played a handful of high-definition shows on this TV, including an Ultra HD versions of &#34;The Martian,&#34; &#34;Skyfall&#34; and 4K content from our Sony 4K media player. The first thing that was evident was the lack of color saturation. This LED TV isn&#39;t nearly as vibrant as its competitors. During &#34;Skyfall&#34; there was an unnatural orange hue in the characters&#39; skin tone and the overall picture.","Our Calman software testing backed up our visual observations. Using the test pattern generator, sensor and software, the test results displayed that not only does the TCL struggle with color accuracy, but also with contrast ratio. The full array LED TV doesn&#39;t allow the TV to get to full black. In fact, it doesn&#39;t get anywhere near full black. Since the contrast isn&#39;t very dynamic, the picture doesn&#39;t pop off the screen as with other 4K TVs. This LED TV doesn&#39;t have HDR capabilities either to help boost the dynamic contrast.","When we streamed an Ultra HD 4K musical performance from Emi Meyer on our Sony 4K media player, the TCL would jitter a bit, as if the TV couldn&#39;t refresh fast enough for the ultra-smooth content. Her red dress was also duller than on other TV sets we tested. Since this is not an HDR LED TV set, it struggled with higher-resolution content.","This doesn&#39;t mean the picture is awful – that is certainly not the case. If this TV is the only one in the room, the picture looks good; only in our side-by-side comparison do the shortcomings become noticeable.","The Roku&#39;s bread and butter lies within the TV&#39;s interface. The Roku interface is extremely easy to use. Pressing the home button brings up easy-to-navigate streaming options, TV menus and input options. It&#39;s nicely laid out, but unfortunately it doesn’t have a web browser.","Although the interface is easy to use, it actually strips away some parameters that other TVs boast. For instance, to adjust the brightness of this TCL TV, there are only a few options: brighter, bright, dark, darker. There aren&#39;t deep menus where you can specifically adjust all the color and brightness parameters within the 4K LED TV. The interface is indeed simple, but limited.","The TCL Roku remote is one of the most comfortable to use. It is small, there aren&#39;t many buttons on it and you can easily control it with one hand. There is a nice little notch on the bottom of the remote for your finger to rest on. It also has one-touch button access to streaming services such as HBO Go and Netflix. One nice addition to the remote is a headphone jack that allows you to listen to your TV through headphones by plugging in the included 1/8-inch ear buds into the side of the remote. Be aware though that this quickly drains the battery life of the remote."]},"id":"c39cf308-7baf-40ed-bbb2-0315bf0f3b6c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0c105ac8-b42d-4773-8221-a0a2731b659b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TCL 50UP130 Roku TV doesn’t have nearly the best picture in our lineup, but it does have an easy interface that even the least tech-knowledgeable person can navigate.
