This year we spent 40 hours comparing 10 programs, paying particular attention to editing abilities, creative features, audio options, ease of use, and sharing and formatting compatibilities.","Our testers were provided photos and videos to use as they assembled their own slideshows complete with audio and animated transitions. Programs that gave us more features and that allowed us more flexibility during assembly and export scored higher. We spoke with Carina Zhdanova, PR manager for Movavi, and Katherine Paz, Marketing Coordinator for Photodex, to get a better understanding of each company’s software and slideshow software in general. We also contacted a local professional photographer to see how she used these programs and to learn what tips she could give from her 10 years of experience for anyone new to the software.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We downloaded all 10 programs and created slideshows complete with music and voice recordings to see how well each one worked. We determined our ease-of-use score by evaluating the cleanliness and intuitiveness of the interface and our experiences using the software. Programs with helpful learning features like import or slideshow wizards scored higher.","Since flexibility and creative options are such important parts of this software, we gave higher scores to programs that offered more features and gave us more control. Some of the most important features include the number of transition effects, backgrounds and themes offered, as well as the number of audio tracks you can use. Since some programs limit the number of photos you can use, we gave higher scores to programs that had no limits. Programs that have more audio and photo editing tools also scored higher.","We determined slideshow quality by evaluating how well each program rendered our pictures and incorporated transitions. The speed and quality of the animation effects were also factors. Part of what makes a slideshow satisfactory is whether it can be exported in the file type or manner of your choosing. Programs that offered more export options as well as the ability to burn projects to DVD and Blu-ray received higher scores.","Sharing and help capabilities are also important. When programs make it easier to share your final creations via social media sites, as well as email and mobile formatting, we scored them higher. Companies that offer more customer support options also scored favorably. We especially appreciate user forums and video tutorials since these can often be the fastest and best ways to learn from others. Companies that offered phone and email support scored higher than companies that did not.","You can use the editing tools in your software to fix any dark or off-color photos before sharing your slideshow with others.","<strong>How Much Does Slideshow Software Cost?</strong>","Depending on how many features, design elements and options you want, the best slideshow software can cost anywhere from $40 to $70. Typically, the more you spend, the more filters, themes, backgrounds and transitions you&#39;ll get. You&#39;ll also tend to have more audio, and video options as well as more control over your slideshows if you are willing to pay a little more.","<strong>Choosing a Slideshow Creator</strong>","A picture slideshow program should be simple to use and offer a variety of features to help you personalize your slideshows. We contacted representatives from both Movavi and ProShow Gold to ask what were the most important aspects of their slideshow programs. Both representatives told us that ease of use was what their companies strived to create. For Movavi, this meant having a Slideshow Wizard that allows you to create finished projects in as little as 10 minutes without having to master the software. ProShow Gold pointed out that the ideal program offers the flexibility to manually take control and bring your creative ideas to life. This includes having a range of backgrounds, themes, transitional effects and audio options.","We also asked Briana, a local professional photographer, for slideshow tips. “People have short attention spans,” she told us. “If you aren’t using the slideshow to completely fill up a time slot, keep it under three minutes – a minute and a half is good. Make sure the combination of music and visuals adds to the other.” This advice is especially helpful in a professional setting, but it also applies if you plan on posting your slideshows to social media for wider audiences to watch. As Brianna said, the average person has a short attention span. Of course, if you’re showing photos at a wedding or family reunion, the reel can be as long as you want.","<strong>What Features Should I Look For?</strong>","The best photo slideshow software doesn&#39;t limit the number of photos you use, and it allows you to control the length and type of transitions you use in your projects. It is nice to be able to use more than one audio file so that you can play meaningful music and also include voice narration. Some slideshow programs allow you to import video clips and even help you edit photos. These editing tools should at least include red-eye removal, cropping and the ability to add text. Advanced editing tools that allow you to adjust brightness, contrast, color and clarity can really help make your slideshows special.","One of the best and easiest ways to enhance your photos and videos is to pair them with complementary music. Most slideshow programs give you the ability to add music and voice recordings to your projects, and sometimes these programs come with a library of songs and sound effects. But the best programs don’t just allow you to add music; they also allow you to record yourself and edit what you’ve recorded to make it fit your slides perfectly.","It&#39;s important the program you choose has the file types and sharing abilities you plan on using. The most common file types include MP4, MP3, AVI and Windows Media. Programs that allow you to directly share to social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube add a measure of convenience.","Help and support options are valuable with nearly any type of software. Look for companies that make it easy for you to contact them and have FAQs pages and video tutorials to help you learn and understand the program better.","<strong>Tips For Making a Good Slideshow</strong>","Here are some pointers for making slideshows for weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, funerals or other events:"]},"id":"1f8aa9ef-7b70-49cd-afec-d7cf2be31e62","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["According to <a href=\"https://www.memoriesrenewed.com/2012/03/picking-the-right-number-of-pictures-and-songs/\">Memories Renewed</a>, when it comes to slideshows 10 to 12 images are typically displayed within a minute. This means that a 100-image slideshow will likely last 10 to 12 minutes. Take this into account when creating your slideshows.","For an elegant slideshow, don’t use distracting transitions. Stick with a simple fade between images.","Choose music and images that are appropriate for the event. You don’t want to play raucous music or have disrespectful photos at a funeral, for example.","Know how the slideshow will be used. If it’s going to play in the background it can go on forever. However, if you’re going to draw everyone’s attention to it as a special presentation, keep it short and simple – three to five minutes.

To prevent unwanted shadows, take advantage of cloudy days, shade and the &#34;golden hours&#34; - the perfect lighting period just after sunrise and before sunset when the lighting isn’t as harsh.","If you can’t avoid shooting on a sunny day, counteract the harsh shadows with light boxes, reflective and diffuser panels, and shade.","Take time to understand and internalize shutter speeds. For instance, if you want to capture fast-moving subjects, like birds in flight, you’ll need a shutter speed of 1/500 second or faster.","Landscapes can be striking if done correctly.

Too many effects will make your photos look unskilled, or even tacky. Sometimes, it’s hard to know if you’ve gone too far; we suggest taking a 10-minute break from your editing before finalizing the changes.","Always keep the original copies of your photos, which you’ll appreciate if you ever make accidental changes to your work.","Learn as much as you can.
