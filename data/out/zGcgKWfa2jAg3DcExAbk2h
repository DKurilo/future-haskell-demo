You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If design is important to you when you&#39;re deciding among all-in-one computers, then the IdeaCentre A720 by Lenovo is a great choice. Unlike most other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one desktops</a> on the market, this PC has stored most of its components on the base rather than in the monitor. This allows it to look slim and sleek from practically every angle.","This home PC has a 27-inch screen and a display resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, making it ok for watching movies, but not stellar. It works, but for its class and the size of its screen, Lenovo could have opted for a higher resolution.","The screen is versatile and can tilt to 90 degrees, laying flat on a surface. This flexibility allows you to adjust the screen to the perfect angle for your position.  It also has 10-point touch capability, which means you can use both hands to gesture and navigate on the screen.","With the Blu-ray drive you can watch movies without needing to connect to an external device that may be bulky and take up space. There is also an HDMI-in connection if you want to work on two monitors or watch TV.","If you want to connect a multitude of extra devices, you might find this PC limited. It only has 2 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0 ports. It also doesn&#39;t offer the option for a Thunderbolt port.","Another downside of this PC is the 3rd Generation Intel Core i7-3610QM, 2.30GHz processor. It&#39;s not as fast as others in its class, so you might experience a bit of a slow down if you have too many tabs open and programs running.","On the plus side, this all-in-one desktop has 1TB of hard drive space where you can store a variety of your collections, from movies and music to personal projects and work.","To add to the clean design, the PC offers a wireless keyboard and mouse, so you can easily incorporate it into any room without making it feel cluttered. One thing to keep in mind is that the PC weighs roughly 25 pounds, so lifting it might require a bit of muscle."]},"id":"af36aeed-cdfa-4511-98fd-2cf61ed10362","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7e0d7496-7949-484b-a8b6-711ca261dd9c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The IdeaCentre A720 is aesthetically pleasing.
