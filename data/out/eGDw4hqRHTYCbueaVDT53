You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The name Palm was virtually synonymous with PDAs not too many years ago. But when PDAs gave way to the more versatile smartphones, Palm was left behind by the likes of BlackBerry and the Apple iPhone. While they continued to make some pretty good devices, the legacy Palm OS didn’t get much attention so their entry level Centro phones quickly became outdated. Palm chose to use Windows Mobile as the operating system for their higher end, business oriented Treo smartphones but that eliminated the uniqueness that they had enjoyed by making both the software as well as the hardware and the Treo became just another WinMo phone. For a side-by-side comparison and objective reviews visit the <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> page.","The Palm Pre has been widely hyped as the device that will put Palm back on top and, from what we’ve seen so far, that may be just what happens. The Pre uses Palms new WebOS which not only puts the manufacturer back in control of the device and its software but also melds the phones internal capabilities and data with information that’s available on the mobile internet. The Pre is just the first of several anticipated smartphones that will be based on the Palm webOS. "]},"id":"8320c68b-f62b-4c00-9479-79574dbc642c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"b7639418-4029-4038-a97f-df2c716692e5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Palm Pre is an attractive package that is dominated by its 3.1-inch, diagonal measure, touch screen. Yes, that’s a bit smaller than that of the trend setting Apple iPhone 3GS but its 320x480 HVGA resolution provides a superior image. The screen features multitouch technology so you can pinch and pull images to zoom in or out. Applications, in the form of cards, can be easily scrolled or flicked out of the way to close them and email can be deleted simply by swiping it from left to right.","Unlike many touch screens, a virtual keyboard isn’t an option so the phone slides open giving access to a physical keyboard. In general we’re in favor of such keyboards for typing but this one is something of a disappointment, particularly because it’s too cramped."]},"id":"cefa3b4a-a493-4d99-8cb9-612e3bf5d2f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"f3e725eb-5f8f-4003-a10f-501eb0957d6b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Our favorite aspect of the Palm Pre is the webOS and the way it allows for integrating applications with the web and in particular, a system called Synergy. This Palm exclusive allows for the sharing of information between such applications as MS Outlook, Facebook, Google and Google Talk, AIM, Yahoo! Mail and LinkedIn. Contact information in one application is shared so that all your data can be available in one consolidated place – though there is an option to keep it separate if you prefer. This makes searching for information quick and thorough independent of the application in which it may be stored. It also allows for switching a conversation from application to another seamlessly. For example, a conversation can be started using AIM and then changed to text messaging in a single, continuous display.","The other top feature is the Pre’s ability to multitask. Open applications display as a Deck of Cards that you can scroll through to interact with the one you want and simply tap it. There’s no need to close one application to use another one as is required with the iPhone and many others. When you are ready to close an application, just flick the card and it’s gone. It’s not the only multitasking smartphone – BlackBerries do it nicely – but the user interface is makes it particularly practical.","The Palm Pre has a pretty basic 3.0-megapixel camera which includes a flash. It fnally has video capture capabilities which is simple to use. You simply tap the video icon located in the camera app and you are ready to capture life&#39;s moments. ","The battery life is rather disappointing. It also lacks a memory expansion capability. Though it has a pretty substantial 4GB of onboard memory that can be eaten up quickly when taking advantage of the multitasking capabilities and it doesn’t leave much storage for tunes.","The Palm Pre has a built-in GPS receiver, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless connectivity including stereo. It also has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and a very good media player. The interface isn’t up to the standards set by the iPhone’s built-in iPod but by other standards it stands up well."]},"id":"22b302ad-e3be-4caa-b9d4-f9016a9cc3d2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Internal Specs"},"id":"cc8e3e13-5b8d-4723-ad07-ff68c1843dd3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Reviewers are pleased and enthusiastic about the Palm Pre. The user interface and multitasking capabilities garner the lion’s share of praise. Criticism is also pretty consistently focused around rather slow loading of applications and some general sluggishness.

Overall, however, the Pre is seen as a very welcome return of Palm as one of the best smartphones available and a device that should be just the first of several excellent smartphones based on Palm webOS.
