You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Samsung DW7933 <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> is a very basic unit that has the bare minimum in wash cycles and overall functionality. However, Samsung doesn’t skimp on the warranty coverage it offers with this unit.","This Samsung dishwasher has a 14-place-setting capacity, not including its silverware basket on the bottom rack, which can hold quite a bit. Additionally, it has four wash cycles and two additional wash options.","The wash cycles on this unit are normal, heavy, quick plus and smart auto. These four are quite standard for wash cycles. However, don&#39;t let these lackluster options deter you from buying this dishwasher, because they will get the job done if basic functionality is all you need. The two additional wash options include a sanitize option that is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation, and a child lock option.","This Samsung dishwasher makes up for its basic wash cycles in other ways, such as the ability to customize the racks and tines. The top rack has 2 inches of adjustability to accommodate taller items. The tines on the upper and lower racks are also adjustable, which is ideal for fitting larger dishes such as pots, water pitchers and more.","Another impressive feature is its hard food disposer, which eliminates the need to prewash and rinse your dishes. Additionally, this Samsung unit is Energy Star qualified for energy efficiency.","The estimated yearly energy consumption for this built-in dishwasher is 279 kilowatt-hours, which is lower than many other models. Its estimated yearly operating cost is $30, which is fairly average. The sound level is around 50 decibels, which is higher than many of the unit’s on our comparison, but still runs a fairly quiet.","Samsung provides a nice warranty with this built-in dishwasher. Labor and parts have a warranty of one year. Racks and electronics have five years of coverage, which is comparable to our top-rated dishwashers, and the tub and door liner have lifetime warranty coverage. This much coverage is comparable to the top-rated dishwashers on our comparison.","Samsung provides a handful of options for help and support including a user manual that you can download directly from the product page, live chat, email and support by phone. There is a product-specific FAQs section and tutorials for this dishwashing machine as well."]},"id":"f99e7653-5826-4dd3-8106-9ea305cd72a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8e17e8b8-de77-404f-a99b-cae2fbc006e2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although we are disappointed that the Samsung DW7933 dishwasher has only four wash cycles, it is a capable dishwasher from a good manufacturer.
