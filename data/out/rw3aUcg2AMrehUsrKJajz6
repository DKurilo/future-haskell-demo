You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Finding an affordable all-in-one computer can be a challenge. Lenovo&#39;s C560 Touch is well powered and should be able to help you complete small computing tasks without breaking the bank. This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one PC</a> has an attractive 23-inch high-resolution display that doubles as a touchscreen. It comes with a glossy wired keyboard and mouse.","With its slim bezel and sleek metal stand, the computer is incredibly stylish and looks attractive with any office setup. Although this all-in-one desktop computer is aesthetically pleasing, it&#39;s still an entry-level machine. It&#39;s powered by the not-so-speedy Intel Pentium G3240T processor and only has 4GB of RAM. Most all-in-ones come standard with 8GB. While this won&#39;t pose a problem for casual web browsing or using the computer for small tasks like writing documents or creating presentations, there are other, better computers available for processor-heavy tasks like editing videos. It does, however, have a large hard drive. You get 1TB of storage, which gives you plenty of room for all your photos, music, videos, programs and games. The only downside to the hard drive is that it&#39;s a little loud: You can hear an audible hum when it&#39;s transferring files.","This all-in-one&#39;s  touchscreen display offers 1920 x 1080p resolution. It is bright, clear and offers you plenty of space for web browsing, displaying or editing images and watching videos. It handles rich, dark colors well and has good color balance. Since this is a touchscreen all-in-one PC, you are able to pinch and zoom or use gestures like swiping to manipulate the display. However, this all-in-one only supports 5-finger touch. Other capacitive touchscreens support up to 10 fingers, meaning you can use both hands or another person can interact with the display simultaneously with you, like when you&#39;re both playing a game. Speaking of games, don&#39;t expect to use this computer for graphic-intense games. It&#39;s only outfitted with the Intel HD Graphics 4600 card, which is fine when you&#39;re watching high-definition videos, but this card has very little gaming power.","Directly below the screen you&#39;ll find the computers speakers. According to an audio test done by our sister site, Tom&#39;s Guide, the speakers were impressive, registering 88 decibels from 23 inches away. The sound isn&#39;t distorted and is actually crisp thanks to its Dolby Advanced Audio v2 system.","Most of the C560&#39;s ports are located on the monitor&#39;s backside, including a power input, Ethernet jack, HDMI-out. The computer has four USB 3.0 ports and a card reader. On its side, you&#39;ll even find two more USB 2.0 ports and a DVD drive.","Lenovo includes a one-year warranty. You have the option to extend the warranty an additional four years for an extra price. While your computer is under warranty, you can reach the manufacturer by telephone, email and live chat. Lenovo even provides online forums and a page for downloading drivers on its website."]},"id":"d786d0ca-a4b7-4d3e-9e8a-5c961b4bacc7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dee7155d-a109-4c28-9a93-e81bafefc62f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All in all, the Lenovo C560 Touch All-in-One computer is a decent computer for its inexpensive price.
