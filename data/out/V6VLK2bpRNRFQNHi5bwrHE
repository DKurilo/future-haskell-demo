Inkjet printers tend to create higher-quality color documents and photos, because they can create more nuanced color gradients than a laser printer, which prints one color at a time. For example, professional photographers exclusively use high-resolution inkjets, and print on specialty paper that resists bleeding.","However, as the printer industry evolves, inkjet printers are getting better at printing text and laser printers are getting better at printing color. Because quality has become less of a differentiator between the two types of printers, cost and speed have become the most important factors to consider.","Laser printers are significantly faster than their inkjet counterparts. In our all-in-one printer review, we found that the best laser printers produce close to 30 pages per minute, while the best inkjet printers produce well below 20 pages per minute."]},"id":"db26d3bf-a5e0-4363-868d-cad1a4da3177","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/UQDmbQisnBGGYj65SJCQFd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Laser printers are also cheaper to operate than inkjet printers, costing roughly half as much per page in ink costs.

There are a multitude of inkjets on the market, and some offer high-yield ink cartridges at a discount that somewhat offsets the high operating costs. However, if you engage in high-volume printing, initial cost is not as important as low operating costs and high print speeds.","As laser technology evolves, color laser printers will become more affordable for the average consumer. As that happens, inkjets will become specialized for photographers, who need the gradient detail that only inkjet photo printers can provide.
