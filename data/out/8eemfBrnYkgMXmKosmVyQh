Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Levenhuk 50L NG is not a name that rolls off the tongue, but it is a name worth remembering. This <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">kids microscope</a> has a lot to offer. It is an educational  toy for kids that makes learning fun. We reviewed children’s microscopes that have more accessories, but we like the sturdiness and overall design of Levenhuk 50L NG.","Kids will appreciate the small details of this microscope, such as its multiple color options. The Levenhuk 50L NG microscope we tested was orange, but you can get this scope in purple, green, pink and blue, too. Far more important than that is the microscope&#39;s all-metal construction. When you buy microscopes for a child, it is important that they last, especially in this price range. This one is built to stand up to a lot of abuse; even its case is extra sturdy. The combination of the case and the cord-free capability makes it possible for your child to go exploring in the backyard or anywhere else. You also have the option to save the battery and plug it into the wall when you want to.","This microscope comes with brine shrimp and a hatchery. This is one of the best experiments for young children to enjoy with their first microscope. They can grow the shrimp and then examine them with their microscope. They also get a flask of yeast to observe, five ready-to-use slides, tools  for making new specimens and more. In our testing, we noted how easy it is to zoom in on objects, which is a necessary attribute for microscopes for students.","Levenhuk customer support  is quite impressive. A live chat option would make it even better, but we got fast and friendly responses via email. This company also offers a lifetime warranty on this microscope itself, and a six-month warranty on accessories. That may come in handy; we received a light for the dissecting part of the microscope that was not functioning when we opened the case, which was one of the only concerns we encountered when assembling the microscope and handling the accessories."]},"id":"7befdd31-f208-4868-9e77-5510f26397d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bb2f4e50-8213-4097-836f-c44c032fac01","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The fact that we received a broken light shook our confidence in this product a bit. It also made it impossible to test the dissecting views of this instrument. When we looked at slides lit from below, though, we had exquisite views. Aside from the great optics, we like the portability, the solid metal construction and the vast accessory set you receive with the Levenhuk 50L NG. This is a kid’s microscope kit that will offer high-quality learning experiences."]},"id":"b98f81aa-735f-4cf3-8842-dfeca16600be","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58327","url":"/levenhuk-50l-ng-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-05T17:25:25Z","datePublished":"2013-12-05T17:25:25Z","name":"Levenhuk 50L NG","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"verdict":"This is a good choice if you value portability for your child&#039;s first laboratory.","pros":["Both the microscope and carrying case are built to be sturdy."],"cons":["There is no option for customer service via live chat."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-12-05T17:25:25Z","id":"8eemfBrnYkgMXmKosmVyQh","meta":{"title":"Levenhuk 50L NG Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Levenhuk 50L NG is a sturdy kids microscope that can feed your child&#039;s interest in science.
