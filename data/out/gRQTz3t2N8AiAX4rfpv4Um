This desktop scanner’s internal specifications are comparable to other midrange models’ – it has a listed scan speed of 25 pages per minute and a maximum automatic document feeder capacity of 30 pages. These numbers put the DR-C225W a slight step behind the best desktop scanners, like the <a href=\"/brother-imagecenter-review\">Brother ImageCenter</a>. Generally, top models have document feeder capacities of 50 pages or more and scan at rates of around 30 pages per minute.","The document scanner also sports relatively compact dimensions of 6.1 x 11.8 x 8.7 inches and a weight of 5.9 lbs. Standard support for duplex scanning and optical text recognition comes with the C225W.","While the desktop scanner’s performance ceiling is modest, it benefits from a relatively robust suite of connectivity options. Out of the box, this Canon model has export support for cloud storage services like Dropbox and OneDrive, as well as email services. Through the company’s mobile app, you can also use the C225W with Android and iOS devices.","This imageFORMULA model doesn’t support physical connectivity options like USB and SD storage devices, but it notably has wireless connectivity. When a document scanner is used in environments like a busy department or front-of-office receptionist desk, wireless support helps cut down on clutter, and it has added benefits for larger businesses. Considering its relatively low price, the C225W’s features give it surprisingly strong value. ","Canon includes a one-year base warranty on the DR-C225W. If you have questions or concerns, you can get help several different ways, including from phone agents, email support, and an online support section that hosts tools like downloads and manuals."]},"id":"181e0ce9-4169-4beb-9aa9-031dc196f9d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1e453c88-f19f-435f-a1ec-d9466f480ca6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon imageFORMULA DR-C225W’s biggest strengths come from its value and versatility.
