This water filtration system can reduce up to 16 contaminants from your drinking water. It is NSF certified and offers a one-year warranty. A faucet is included for your kitchen sink, and the filter itself can be easily installed underneath your counter. However, even though this water filter has much to offer, it does have a few drawbacks, particularly when compared to the best under-the-counter water filter systems.","This GE system can reduce up to 16 contaminants from your drinking water. These contaminants include arsenic, chlorine, cysts, lead and nickel. It is also NSF certified, which means it has been tested and approved by NSF International to provide clean, high-quality drinking water. However, other systems remove more contaminants from the water. Many similar products, like the <a href=\"/kenmore-reverse-osmosis-system-review\">Kenmore Reverse Osmosis System</a>, can remove 25 contaminants or more.","This drinking water system uses reverse osmosis to filter the water. This means the water is filtered three times to ensure the impurities are effectually removed. It has a water pressure range of 40 to 125 psi, which is works well because ideal water pressure for your home is around 55 to 65 psi. This systemâ€™s water pressure covers that range and gives you some flexibility in adding more or less pressure if you desire. Its water temperature range is 40 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and its pH limits range from 4 to 10, which are all similar to what you will find on most under-the-counter water filter systems.","This under-the-counter filtration system is fairly large and will take up some space under your kitchen sink. It measures 15 inches tall, 14 inches wide and 5.5 inches deep. It weighs approximately 21 pounds. A faucet is included with this system, but there are no design options you can choose from. However, it does provide a notification system that will tell you when the filters need to be replaced.","The GE Reverse Osmosis Filtration System is covered under a one-year warranty. Of course, a longer warranty would be better, but this is the average amount of time most filtration systems are covered. If you&#39;re looking for customer support for this filtration system, email and telephone options are available. However, we were disappointed in the email support we received from GE. We never received any response to the multiple inquiries that we sent the company. There is also no live chat option available."]},"id":"c4b71669-b7b1-40c4-a92a-c324c45346c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7b5f08bb-7fd1-4031-9f01-dd41eb49a001","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE Reverse Osmosis Filtration System will filter your water three times to ensure up to 16 contaminants are removed.
