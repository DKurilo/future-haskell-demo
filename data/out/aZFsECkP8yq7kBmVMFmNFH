The sheer size and reach of the company has many advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are good car speakers that are affordable. The disadvantage is that the company&#39;s priorities and resources are clearly focused elsewhere. For Sony, car speakers are only one small branch to an otherwise massive oak tree. As a result, the speakers are affordable but the quality suffers, which is most notable with the durability of these auto speakers.","The rear deck speakers only have a continuous power handling rating of 50 watts. The peak power handling is decent at 420 watts, but the continuous power handling is where speaker durability lives. Exceeding 50 watts on a continuous basis will cause distortions to the audio and eventual damage to the speakers. The car door speakers aren&#39;t any better with a continuous power handling rating of 40 watts. These are the lowest ratings available in our car speaker reviews. Both speakers have a 91dB sensitivity rating, which is average among speakers we reviewed.","The best feature of the XS series is the three-way speakers. Most speaker series have a 6 x 9 three-way speaker but not many series also have a 6.5 three-way speaker. This means you can get the same balanced bass, mids and highs that the three-way speakers provide with your door speakers in addition to the rear deck speakers. The sound quality is good, so long as you don&#39;t push the speakers too hard. You will experience distortion with speakers sooner than other speakers if you turn the volume up too loud.","The speakers are also among the shallowest. At 2.88 inches, the rear deck speaker is almost an inch shallower than the deepest speaker available in our review. This makes it an exceptionally easy speaker to install because you&#39;re likely have a lot of clearance no matter what car you own. The door speakers have a mounting depth of 1.69 inches. The only obstacle you might encounter is finding a speaker in the XS series that will fit your speaker mounts, as the series doesn&#39;t have a wide selection of speaker sizes."]},"id":"7fcf363b-da4c-437b-8c1a-1b52d5ba0210","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"895d2067-b3d2-4e66-b101-f34216b22077","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony XS series of car speakers provides high-quality car speakers at an affordable price.
