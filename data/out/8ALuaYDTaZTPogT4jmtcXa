A box of old photos and slides that you never at look because pulling out the slide projector is so cumbersome. Plus, that box is taking up valuable space, and you&#39;re not quite sure what to do with it. A <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">slide to digital image converter</a> can bring those piles of old slides and negatives back to life. Once you convert them to digital images, you can bore your friends and embarrass your family by showing those old vacation photos via your TV, computer screen or hand- held device."]},"id":"5aa3a03a-b84f-439e-b4a7-7af579c0bdad","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Unlike scanners, digital image converters use a high-resolution digital camera to capture images. LED lights shine through film and slides as each frame is shot. Whereas scanners have a slow bar moving back and forth to record color, digital converters convert slides to digital images in just seconds.","Most digital image converters are stand-alone units similar to digital cameras, and they generally work independently of computers and software. Just like a digital camera, you will need to use a memory card to save images and a USB cable to transfer them to your hard drive for storage or viewing. If you do not want to use a computer to view your images, most converters come with at TV-out jack so that you can see them directly on your television.","Be aware that most digital image converters lack that integrated memory. In most cases, you will need to purchase a separate memory card to use with the converter. Very few units allow you to save images directly to your PC from the slide converter itself.","With the best slide to digital image converters, important factors to consider include the image resolution and the conversion times, maximizing quality and speed. A higher megapixel device will produce images with a higher resolution. Also, pay attention to whether or not the device you purchase converts photos. Some do only slides and film.","There are, of course, options for hiring someone to convert your memories, they can be expensive and come with some risks. Online services are convenient but you risk losing your memories in the mail and take the chance that your images may be farmed overseas for processing. Professional services can easily run into the hundreds and thousands of dollars. Simple to use, this product is a good fit if you have stacks of images you need to digitize. Slide to digital image converters are a good choice to save you hassle and money, letting you take on a DIY conversion project with confidence.","Be aware that these devices are designed for simplicity, and you will not magically transform your family photos into perfect, professional-looking images. Keep your expectations in check. Damaged film and slides are recorded as is. A converter is not going to transform a fuzzy photo into a clear one. Some slide converters do have editing and color correction features built into their hardware, including adjustments for color and brightness. While these tools are adequate for simple touch ups, you won&#39;t be able to do the kind of photo editing you would do with professional editing software. Furthermore, most display screens on these units are small and hard to view. Trying to make detailed edits on a photo on 2-inch display screen is futile. The smart option is to upload the photos to a PC and use a photo-editing software application to touch up your favorite shots.","Ultimately, if the goal is to stop further deterioration of your slides, photos and film   and bring the out of the box and into the light of day to be shared with family and friends once more    slide to digital image converters are an affordable way to preserving images. They are faster and easier than using a flatbed scanner and your computer. While you won&#39;t get suddenly perfect photos, you will get a good digitized image for the price."]},"id":"bd7ddf2f-98fc-41c3-b532-d27c43808125","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7883","url":"/what-to-do-with-those-old-slides-digitize-them","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"leah-stone","url":"/author/leah-stone","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"Leah Stone","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"LSCnXVFEk3MkJutB5Jiugm","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-13T18:36:32Z","datePublished":"2013-05-13T18:36:32Z","name":"What to Do With Those Old Slides?
