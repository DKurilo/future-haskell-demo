However, this budget vacuum has weak suction, it struggles picking up pet hair, and the dust cup is difficult to clean. For something with stronger suction, consider the <a href=\"/shark-navigator-review\">Shark Navigator</a>.","This inexpensive vacuum has rotating bristles in the vacuum head that are meant to dislodge dirt from carpets and rugs, but in separate tests where we spread flour and kitty litter over low-pile and medium-pile carpet, a lot of debris was left behind. We had to pass over the same area of carpet several times before it was sufficiently clean. We don&#39;t recommend this budget vacuum if you own a dog or cat that sheds, because in our tests it struggled picking up pet hair.","The best thing about this Kenmore is its portability. It takes up very little space in your closet and is light for a 2-liter-capacity canister vac. The large wheels on the base move well with you. The canister is bagless, meaning you won&#39;t spend extra money on bags, but the dust cup is hard to clean. The cup clips off so you can empty it, but debris tends to stick to the walls and deep inside the cup.","Another concern we had with this model is the short power cord. The cord is only 16 feet, which is about 10 feet less than the best budget vacuums in our lineup. At 89 decibels, it&#39;s loud, though not as loud as more powerful vacuums.","Kenmore offers a standard one-year warranty on parts and maintenance, which is below average among the ones we compared. In the event your vacuum needs service, you can take it to the local Sears store in your area."]},"id":"d5c68812-c605-4441-9efb-671196ec8bb1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54140e4b-efc0-4e81-a933-bef25175d11d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 10701 is a lightweight, maneuverable vacuum that works well for cleaning carpets, rugs and floors as long as the mess isn&#39;t too big.
