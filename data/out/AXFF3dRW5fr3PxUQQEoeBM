The speakers within the sound system bring you a cohesive-sounding audio experience that immerses you in your movies&#39; soundtracks.","The 5.1 home theater speakers come with a subwoofer that will leave bass fanatics underwhelmed. The subwoofer provided in the TL1600 system is underpowered and only achieves a low frequency of 45Hz. Many 8-inch subwoofers provided by other speaker systems achieve much deeper bass tones and provide stronger onboard amplifiers.","The center speaker helps make up for the subwoofer&#39;s shortcomings. Since the center speaker handles the majority of the dialogue with movies and music, it is the link that ties the whole system together. The center speaker has a wider frequency range than the satellite speakers and dips down to 90Hz to help blend the audio between the subwoofer and satellite speakers. Initially, the 2.5-inch drivers in the center speaker seem undersized for the job, but the dynamic balance cones and silk-polymer tweeter produce crisp, clear sound.","The TL1600 surround sound system includes four satellite speakers with 2.5-inch drivers and .5-inch tweeters. The satellite speakers achieve a frequency response of 120Hz to 22kHz. The silk-polymer blend that makes up the tweeter is responsible for the impressive high frequency response. Silk is a high-quality material that provides an airy quality to the audio, while the polymer composite is more rugged, providing durability to the driver and helping project sound.","In addition to the speakers engineering great sound, the manufacturers also found a way to make the Blackstone TL1600 a beautiful home theater speaker system. It&#39;s small, it&#39;s stylish, and you can mount it anywhere in a room without it being a distracting eyesore.","This home theater speaker system comes with an average five-year warranty on all loudspeakers, passive crossover components and enclosures. If your speakers have a problem from shipping or from everyday use, you can send them back for replacement, but be sure to keep the original packaging and proof of purchase."]},"id":"ac112ced-47bd-45d0-906a-a2b8b2a46d9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c656aa3e-e475-413f-88f6-a4cdcc52f21b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Polk Audio Blackstone TL1600 is a good home theater speaker set that provides decent audio quality and a stylish design.
