The company has developed an innovative pendant that allows the wearer to communicate with an emergency operator directly through the jewelry. Other products require you to be near a base station or to have voice extenders installed in order to communicate with an operator in the case of an emergency. The ability to communicate with operators from the pendant, more than any other feature, is what makes MediPendant stand out in the medical alert industry.","Because you speak directly into the pendant, MediPendant offers greater mobility and peace of mind. You don&#39;t have to worry about operators not being able to hear you because you&#39;re too far away from the base station. Furthermore, you don&#39;t have to install additional equipment such as voice extenders. Further still, the pendant is water resistant. You can wear it in the shower or bath, so you won&#39;t have to install wall buttons in your bathroom.","If you have more than one person in a single household who needs medical monitoring, MediPendant has you covered. MediPendant&#39;s base station has the ability to communicate with up to four pendants simultaneously. The pendants&#39; battery life is also impressive, with six hours of talk time and nearly a year of standby time. Other benefits of MediPendant include the fact that the company guarantees its pricing for life and offers a lifetime warranty on its technology.","The range of MediPendant&#39;s technology is advertised as 600 feet from the base station. This is, of course, subject to various factors, including line of sight and building materials. We&#39;ve found that you can get a clear signal up to 800 feet away from the base station if there is nothing between you and it to interfere with the signal.","When you press the Help button on the MediPendant, there is an audible click sound effect so that you know you&#39;ve connected to the operator. The pendant also features voice prompts that tell you your call is being connected. The voice prompts are available in a number of languages, including English, Spanish, Chinese and Danish. If you need a language programmed, MediPendant will work with you to get the language you need.","MediPendant&#39;s call centers are staffed 24 hours a day by EMT-certified professionals. This means that as a prequalification for employment, operators must undergo EMT training at their own expense. Furthermore, many employees are actual paramedics for local fire departments or operate as first responders in some fashion while working for MediPendant. This draws a very stark contrast between MediPendant and other services that hire unskilled call center employees to staff their phone lines.","Additionally, you can request a check-in service from MediPendant. This means that periodically, MediPendant will call you to make sure you&#39;re healthy. This provides peace of mind not only for you, but also for your loved ones who may not be able to regularly check in."]},"id":"fa06e4ac-afcd-4a2f-aade-759c64963e72","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"65b15c70-2326-4702-881e-e9a333079eac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, MediPendant is a perfectly capable medical alarm system.
