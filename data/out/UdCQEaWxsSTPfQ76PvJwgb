These Michelin tires are poised as one of the best budget tires on the market, delivering on everything consumers expect of Michelin-brand products. This tire claims an innovative tread design for higher levels of grip and traction in all weather conditions.","Budget does not mean this high-performance general tire skimps on features or material makeup. It follows the expected design of performance tires by utilizing an asymmetrical design to put more rubber on the outboard zone. This portion of the tread is made up of incredibly-sturdy blocks to improve lateral grip and to reduce wear.","One element of design that is unique to Michelin-brand performance tires is the use of the Variable Contact Patch 2.0, a feature derived from racing tires. With this feature, the tire blocks are put at a slight angle to adjust pressure and temperatures when under high G-forces. If you enjoy driving through tight corners and extreme braking or acceleration, this design facilitates increased levels of performance and reduces wear and tear created by high temperatures.","The Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3 is among the best of performance tires available through tire stores for budget-conscious consumers. It doesn’t skimp on the features and delivers a product that can withstand prolonged punishment from adrenaline junkies who enjoy testing out the performance of their car. Through the asymmetrical design of the treads and the balancing of pressures, this tire surpasses all expectations."]},"id":"ca66020d-2db2-4e5c-8396-c877fc99c32b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58026","url":"/michelin-pilot-sport-a-s-3-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T15:02:55Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T15:02:55Z","name":"Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
