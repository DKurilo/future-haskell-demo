You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The Samsung SP-H03 <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">mini projector</a> isn&#39;t anything new, but it is reliable and good at what it does. Though the brightness is only about average, the lamp life is very good. We were also pleased to see a variety of connection options, and we especially loved that there is a cover to keep the ports protected during travel. This pocket projector does what it needs to with simplicity and ease.","The picture quality of this mini projector is fairly standard. One advantage this product has is a 16:9 aspect ratio; not all products offer that. The resolution is 854 x 480 and the image size is 9 to 80 inches – not the best we&#39;ve seen, but not the worst. We were pleased to see that the contrast ratio is 1000:1 which is better than average but not as good as it could be. The brightness is the big kicker here at only 30 ANSI lumens. This means you need to have the lights fairly low if you want to be able to see the picture from any distance.","The highlight of this mini projector is the ports. We really appreciate the fact that it comes with a cover so that you don&#39;t have to worry about the ports becoming damaged during transit. The ports include a PC In, composite A/V, USB and audio output. There is also a micro SD slot that will take a high capacity card up to 32GB. The USB and the SD slot are great to use if you don&#39;t want to have to worry about hooking up the mini projector to another device. Just use these ports and play your presentation directly without the hassle of cables.","This mini projector has the features we&#39;ve come to expect on this type of product. It has a long lamp life of 30,000 hours. We were also impressed with the 1W built-in speaker. This is valuable when you don&#39;t want to worry about carting around extra equipment when you travel. This is truly a micro projector when you take into account that it is only 2.8 x 1.1 x 2.8 inches and weighs half a pound. To put that in perspective, this device is lighter than some of the leading smart phones on the market.","This mini projector is a great little product that keeps things simple and straightforward. All of the buttons are clearly visible on the top of the unit, and we were pleased to see that they are well spaced so you don&#39;t have to worry about accidentally hitting the wrong button. We would have liked a remote with this product, but that isn&#39;t a large concern, it just means you have to stay nearby if you want to make any adjustments. The other aspect we were pleased with was the LED indicators on the top of the unit. These lights are a great way to determine how the mini projector is doing at a glance."]},"id":"8c8351b4-4642-4d5d-8ac7-f21e1bee3603","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"135eec8c-69ea-469c-9637-89f869e0300e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Samsung SP-H03<strong> </strong>mini projector is an average product that will work well.
