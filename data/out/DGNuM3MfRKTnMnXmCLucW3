Most devices are expandable, letting you add several hundred profiles, with select models offering an unlimited amount of expansions. That can be beneficial if you have several hundred or even thousands of employees.","<strong>Scan Time</strong><br/>The scan time is an important feature that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked. Ideally, the scan time of the facial recognition software should be a few seconds or less. More sophisticated models can scan a person&#39;s face and grant or deny access in less than a second.","<strong>Hardware vs. Software</strong><br/>Facial analyzers come in either hardware or software versions. Hardware versions are physical devices that you install, while facial recognition software is installed within a device of your choosing. The hardware is sold as a total package. Other products, such as surveillance cameras, offer optional software that integrates with the device to increase its capability. If you&#39;re just looking to add the facial recognition software to an existing device, there&#39;s no need to purchase hardware.","<strong>Connection</strong><br/>Facial analyzers connect through various methods, including USB or Ethernet. USB face detection devices are the easiest to install, simply plugging directly into your PC. They upload and download information seamlessly without the need for any specialized equipment. The Ethernet version connects to your LAN network, creating a communications system that lets you access the information from any computer on your network.","When you&#39;re shopping for a facial analyzer for your business, it&#39;s a good idea to compare various models before making a decision.
