You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you or a loved one has a severe medical condition, such as a heart condition, diabetes or life-threatening allergies, you may want to consider purchasing a <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">medical ID bracelet</a>. While there are many different styles and designs to choose from, the TapBand is one of the easiest to use. Because everything is stored on the NFC chip, you don&#39;t have to worry about filling out paperwork. You just download the app and type in up to five lines of information.","The TapBand medic alert bracelet has a wristband made from silicone that is both durable and waterproof. The band itself contains the NFC chip, which can store more information than most traditional medical ID bracelets. Because the TapBand is made from one piece and can withstand some punishment, it is a good choice if you play sports or enjoy an active lifestyle. It is also ideal for children as it&#39;s bright and colorful.","Setting up the TapBand is quick and easy and can be done with any NFC capable phone or tablet. You can include as much or as little information as you like, up to a maximum of five lines. Because the information is stored on the TapBand itself and not on the internet, you can rest assured that your information is secure.","In the event of an emergency, first responders only have to tap an NFC-capable device to your TapBand to access the information you have stored. They don&#39;t need to download any software, access the internet or have any particular device. These bracelets currently work with most Microsoft, Blackberry and Android smartphones. The only drawback is that they do not work with Apple products.","TapBands are available in three different sizes that range from 6 to 8 inches and various colors including white, pink, red, green, blue and black. The silicone bracelet features the Rod of Asclepius symbol that represents medicine and healing and is recognized around the world. The band also features the initials NFC, letting emergency personnel know that the band contains an NFC chip with more information.","The TapBand by TempiMed is a good midrange medical alert bracelet with plenty of features for the price. Because everything is contained within the band itself, this is an ideal choice for children, independent seniors and people with active lifestyles. However, five lines of information may not be enough if you have multiple illnesses, injuries and allergies that medical staff need to know about.","The TapBand by TempiMed keeps personal and medical information on its near field communication (NFC) chip. This information can be accessed by any NFC-capable phone or tablet with a simple tap."]},"id":"14247d99-2567-4e6b-ae7c-8bf2a6b38078","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63673","url":"/tapband-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:14:17Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:14:17Z","name":"TapBand","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-24T19:14:17Z","id":"Q2sFmgY8BWY6uoFKv5h8cS","meta":{"title":"TapBand Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Tempimed&#039;s Tapband ensures your medical information is readily accessible at all times.
