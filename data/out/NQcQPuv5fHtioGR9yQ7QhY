The only difference in the updated weBoost version is the color of the aluminum casing from blue to black. It still features the long-range antenna, 50 dB amplifier, and 3G and 2G dual-band coverage.","It has an extremely long range provided by the 12-inch high-gain outside antenna, which has a 60 percent further reach than the 4-inch antenna that the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-4g-m-review\">Drive 4G-M</a> and most other weBoost cell signal boosters use. With a forward gain of 5.62 dBi, it has a much longer reception range than most <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-boosters\">cell phone signal amplifiers</a>. This makes it ideal for rural areas where you&#39;re far from cell towers.","The antenna attaches to the roof of your car with a 3.5-inch magnetic base. This makes it easy to remove, allowing you to transfer it to other cars. It also comes with a 5-inch, low-profile inside antenna that you install on the side of your seat or middle console with Velcro.","The signal amplifier has a maximum gain of 50 dB, which makes it the most powerful amplifier allowed by law for a vehicle cell phone amplifier. All of the best car cell phone boosters peak at 50 dB. This much amplification allows it to support multiple callers in all types of vehicles without interfering with cell phone towers or other callers on the road.","The biggest flaw with the Drive 3G-X is the lack of 4G compatibility, which can be found in comparable products like the <a href=\"/surecall-triflex2go-review\">SureCall TriFlex2Go</a>. The dual-band booster only supports 3G and 2G. With 2G becoming obsolete in 2016, it&#39;s only a matter of time before 3G follows suit as cellular providers increase 4G coverage areas and cellular technology progresses. As it stands now, though, you&#39;re more likely to find 3G and 2G frequencies in rural areas where 4G has yet to reach, which is where the Drive 3G-X excels."]},"id":"73c88c0b-61b4-4334-9156-02a4f2b05fd2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c582113c-a3ee-4c5a-b1f1-c0f81427cf7b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The weBoost Drive 3G-X Extreme is the highest-rated cell phone booster in our review that has only 3G and 2G coverage.
