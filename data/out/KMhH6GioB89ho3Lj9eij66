In our tests it retained 92 percent of the heat from hot liquids after two hours, and only cooled down 17 degrees after 24 hours. This makes the YETI a good choice for carrying coffee, and since it holds 26 ounces, you will have enough to last you all day, or to share with a friend during your outing.","As part of our tests we looked at how much cold water warmed after 24 hours, the length of time YETI claims it keeps liquids cold. The water warmed up by 22 degrees. The water was still cool and refreshing, but it was much warmer than with other thermoses, including the <a href=\"/stanley-review\">Stanley Classic</a>,  whose inside temperature warmed by only 15 degrees during our cold-water tests.","The stainless steel body kept the heat inside, so we didn’t burn our hands on the outside while carrying it. There is a coating on the outside walls that offers additional insulation, but also helps you grip the thermos without fear of it slipping out of your hands. It is a bit heavy, weighing over 30 ounces (approx. 2 pounds) when empty. Adding 26 ounces of liquid nearly doubles the weight. This can be tiring to hold on a long journey, especially if you’re hiking. There is a handle on the top, touted as a three-finger grip to help open the thermos, but we feel it isn’t secure enough to loop through a belt, especially when the thermos is full.","This thermos’ top doesn’t include a cap that could double as a cup, but its wide mouth fits over your nose as you drink. It has several threads on both the inside of the thermos and around the lid. We didn’t have any problems lining everything up to seal it properly. Once we closed it, we bounced and jostled this thermos around and noticed it didn’t leak or spill at all. One perk of this product is the YETI is one of three thermoses we reviewed that are completely dishwasher safe."]},"id":"2bc70920-5cd2-4a27-8d91-219801f988a8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"13df7041-7a2a-424c-9cc3-51f63e6d0a28","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The YETI Rambler is a good choice for packing hot coffer for a day hike or fishing trip.
