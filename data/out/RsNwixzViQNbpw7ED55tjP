Unfortunately, it doesn’t have the ability to burn a new DVD disc. That is why, though useful, it scores near the bottom on our side-by-side comparison chart of the best Mac DVD copy software.","The thing that stands out most about this application is its extensive conversion options. When you load your disc into your computer and launch the application, you’re greeted with a wealth of options. You can rip your DVD movie for playback on nearly any device that you own. Naturally, this software focuses on devices created by Apple. So, if you want to watch a DVD movie on your iPhone, iPod, iPad, AppleTV or Macintosh computer, MacX DVD Ripper Pro is an ideal choice for that job. If you don’t live exclusively in the Apple ecosystem, this software also converts DVD movies into formats that are playable on Android devices, the Amazon Kindle and Microsoft Surface as well as all the most popular video gaming systems.","Each rip is tailored to specific device specifications. Therefore, playback of the copied content is excellent. Don’t expect an exact 1:1 copy of your movies on most of the devices. Rather, you should expect an optimized experience depending on the device you want to watch your movies on. You’ll be hard-pressed to find flaws in the playback. MacX DVD Ripper does a truly excellent job at making this experience seamless.","For the average or casual user, MacX DVD Ripper Pro is a beast of an application to get to know and utilize to its full potential. Having said that, once you familiarize yourself with the user interface, you shouldn’t have too many problems ripping DVDs and converting the movies for playback on your mobile devices."]},"id":"05be05e2-0e3c-4563-a5d1-eb30cea1274b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"64ff38f9-f041-4905-a043-54935fce04b0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you’re technically minded and don’t want to burn new DVD discs, MacX DVD Ripper Pro is excellent DVD copy software for Mac.
