You can also search for flights under different price caps based on your budget. This price cap search is a great feature for international flights, which typically cost over $1,000.","OneTravel has average prices compared to other <a href=\"/best-online-travel-sites\">travel websites</a>, but it adds a per-person processing fee, which may tip the total price into a range that is more than what some travelers can afford. If your plans fall through, you may find a hefty cancellation fee on your bill, which is even higher for canceled international flights. However, OneTravel will waive these fees and others (when permitted by airlines or other suppliers) for active military members, senior citizens, disabled and bereaved travelers. If you&#39;re booking a vacation package for your family, we recommend you book with <a href=\"/travelocity-review\">Travelocity</a> because it makes booking packages easier than other sites.Â ","One of the features of OneTravel&#39;s hotel search is its theme filter. With it, you can search for hotels under a wide variety of themes, such as family, pet-friendly and romantic, golf or and spa vacations. Pictures and descriptions can be deceiving; OneTravel posts TripAdvisor user reviews so you can read a range of guest experiences and opinions.","If you plan to travel internationally but you&#39;re not sure what you&#39;ll need, the visa and passport assistance feature is a great tool. This handy feature lets you select your country and state of departure, plus your destination and reason for traveling, like business, pleasure, transit or journalism. Results tell you whether a visa or passport is required to enter your destination country and how to obtain these documents before you leave.","OneTravel has several ways you can reach its customer support department. The FAQs section is massive, so if you have a simple query, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll find it there. This section covers flights, cars, hotels, billing and payment, and general questions, to name a few. You can&#39;t email questions to OneTravel, but it&#39;s one of the few online travel services with a live chat feature.","OneTravel offers some of the lowest base prices, but you want to be absolutely sure of your travel plans before booking to avoid the hefty cancellation and itinerary change fees. These types of fees are standard for any online travel site that collaborates with airlines and other travel service providers, but the costs add up quickly. This online travel agency offers plenty of promos and coupons to knock down the service fees and lower the prices even more. If you&#39;re looking to redeem travel points for your vacation, we recommend you book using <a href=\"/expedia-com-review\">Expedia</a> because you can redeem hotel and airline points and also get points through Expedia&#39;s own point system."]},"id":"86cb27ed-0993-47be-ad67-70c458fd41a4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2113","url":"/onetravel-com-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-05-24T19:02:57Z","name":"OneTravel","synopsis":"OneTravel lets you book flights, hotels, rental cars, cruises and vacation packages.
