However, in June of 2015, Amazon Webstore closed its doors, for good. That being said, we will examine some of the reasons that Shopify is a better eCommerce solution.","Shopify offers an easy setup and friendly administrator interface, making it one of the most popular eCommerce platforms on the market. This program also provides several professionally designed templates for you to use, free of charge. This is one area where you were very limited with Amazon Webstore.","While the administrative options for Shopify are listed in English, you can create your storefront in any language that you wish. Additionally, this eCommerce platform allows you to choose which payment gateway you use. It also accepts funds in several different currencies. While Amazon Webstore gave you the ability to accept different currencies, you were restricted to its chosen list of currencies.","Another popular function of Shopify is its  eCommerce University,  which provides access to numerous articles, how-to guides and other training resources. As of summer 2015, more than 96,000 businesses use Shopify, showing a strong growth rate. Furthermore, Shopify s 24/7 in- house support team is second to none.","Shopify definitely offers better pricing options than Amazon Webstore offered to its customers. The current fee for <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/shopify-ecommerce-platforms-shopping-cart-software/\">Shopify</a> is $29, for the basic place. However, you can also choose the professional plan, which is $79 per year. Lastly, for those who plan to have a plethora of transactions, you can choose the unlimited plan. This one will cost you $179 per year with an additional 2% transaction fee.","Keeping your customers happy is one of the most important things you can do when operating an eCommerce business. Shopify will help you to provide the best tools to your customers in hopes of them choosing to purchase through your store. Some of these features include the ability for your customers to zoom in to get a better look of your products and the ability to show other customer reviews.","<strong>Side-by-Side Comparison</strong>"]},"id":"4f20262f-364e-4b62-baf8-88d4546884df","type":"text"},{"data":{"rows":[[{"data":{"text":"<em> Amazon</em>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<em>Shopify</em>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}],[{"data":{"text":"<ul><li> Hosted, secure platform</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Hosted, secure platform </li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}],[{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>In-house customer service, but poor reviews and high turnover</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>In-house customer service with highly rated support team</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}],[{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Free marketing and integration with Amazon network</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Limited in-house marketing capabilities; user must market own products</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}],[{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>$79 monthly fee + 2 percent transaction fee</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Basic plan: fee $29; Professional plan: fee $79; or Unlimited plan: fee $179 + 2 percent transaction fee</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}],[{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Limited selection of themes</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Broad selection of themes, both free and costly</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}],[{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Limited training on how to operate your eCommerce business</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Free training resources and mentor support through eCommerce University</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}],[{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Best for small, medium or large businesses</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"},{"data":{"text":"<ul><li>Best for small or medium businesses</li></ul>","attributes":{}},"type":"celldata"}]]},"id":"c4eb123f-6a02-4c56-b29a-9960747fe939","type":"table"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" <br/>Shopify is an overall better eCommerce solution.
