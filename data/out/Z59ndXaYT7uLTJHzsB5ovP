You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With RentZero you can rent, buy and trade video games  for six major gaming consoles. The services ranked higher in our <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/988-best-gaming-services.html\">online video game rental</a> category have games for more consoles, and their websites have more features to enhance the gaming experience. But with more than 5000 games, an easy-to-use search function and six payment options, this service will undoubtedly have something to offer any gamer.","Although RentZero offers a comprehensive list of titles, they do not offer games for handheld devices like Nintendo DS, PSP or Gameboy Advance. They also don&#39;t have movies for the PSP.","Membership with this service includes free two-way shipping, no late fees and no due dates. In addition to renting games, you can purchase used rentals or trade your gently used games to RentZero in exchange for free months of service.","One of the best features of RentZero is when you are browsing for games, the website clearly lists if the game is currently available, has a short wait or is coming soon.","Most games include a summary and a list of control instructions, but they do not have reviews, screenshots, videos or any place for user comments. The other sites we reviewed provide most of that information about each game, so we were a little underwhelmed by their individual game pages.","RentZero has more than 5000 games available for rent on six major gaming consoles including the newest platforms like Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360. However, due to their small size, they don&#39;t rent games for handheld devices like PSP, DS or GameBoy Advance.","You can search for games based on platform or genre, or you can find specific games with the search box. RentZero sorts games into 13 genres including adventure, children’s, shooter and more. Additionally, you can search for new releases or most popular.","The only distribution center is located in Houston, Texas. Rentals usually take one to five business days to arrive depending how far away you live from Houston. Additionally, if you live in a rural area, it may take up to seven days for your games to arrive.","RentZero offers six membership options. You can choose a monthly membership or an annual membership.","The monthly plans are cheaper than most services:"]},"id":"caa8e75d-a1c9-4821-a24c-1568a030cb5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["$13.95 for one game","$19.95 for two games","$27.95 for three games"],"type":"ul"},"id":"402a4b90-f4f3-49f1-9439-9bc5cfdc1822","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The annual plans give you more bang for your buck:"]},"id":"bf0a69a2-5480-4aff-94a1-94697b0d62b0","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["$119.40 ($9.95/month) for one game","$191.40 ($15.95/month) for two games","$263.40 ($21.95/month) for three games"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7c9d3d5e-a74b-4fe9-b0dd-5a45d6f3b2d4","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["RentZero also offers a free 14-day trial membership that allows you to rent one game.
