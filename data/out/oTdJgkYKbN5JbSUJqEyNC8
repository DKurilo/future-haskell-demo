While subscribers across the country use the same <a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">internet service provider</a>, Cable One&#39;s capabilities vary widely even within the same state.","This ISP offers three high-speed internet plans: Streaming, Premier and Ultra. The Streaming subscription comes with up to 50 Mbps of download speed and up to 3 Mbps of upload speed. The Premier offers download speeds of up to 60 Mbps and up to 5 Mbps upload speeds. The Ultra subscription can provide up to an impressive 100 Mbps of download speed and up to 10 Mbps upload speeds, among the fastest speeds available. Even the lowest plan is capable of streaming videos on multiple devices. Each internet plan comes with 20 email accounts, each with an impressive 15GB of online email storage.","Cable One offers services in 19 states, most of which are in the South, Northwest and Midwest regions of the country. The company does not offer services for any of the eight random test addresses we used to evaluate. However, after testing more addresses, we found that many of the areas Cable One covers are non-metropolitan areas such as Easter, Oregon; Roswell, New Mexico; Vidalia, Louisiana; and Fargo, North Dakota.","For customer service, you can contact Cable One by email or telephone. When we emailed the company, we received a response within a day but did not actually get all of our questions answered until about a week later. Online you can find a variety of help topics including email help, modem support and data plan FAQs. In addition, the website has a speed tester, and the company has a YouTube channel with tutorial videos."]},"id":"1271502a-9e96-41aa-b13e-0d41db9d75cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cf1eff33-3c7a-469b-be1a-97c3f69f7dcb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you live in the South, Northwest and Midwest regions, carefully consider Cable One.
