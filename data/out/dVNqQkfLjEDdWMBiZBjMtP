Internally, the <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray player</a> supports the usual array of premium picture settings, including deep color and 24p playback. This works alongside support for audio standards like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. While the player lacks premium options like 4K upscaling, its base features are a strong fit for home users and those just looking for the basics.","In our hands-on testing, 3D playback of the movie &#34;Gravity&#34; was smooth, and the player functioned without any issues. Its minimalist software was a strength during our boot test, in which we timed how long it took the player to reach its home screen on stock settings. The Samsung&#39;s mark of 6.8 seconds was in line with comparable mainstream 3D Blu-ray players.","The J5900&#39;s software also proves to be a strength in other areas. Samsung&#39;s operating system is cleanly designed and easy to navigate. For instance, its settings menus are divided up into two main onscreen tabs. Compared to competing Blu-Ray players – which often feature a series of nested menus and sub-menus – the design is very user friendly.","This Blu-ray player also features a standard suite of streaming apps for services like Netflix. The Samsung&#39;s software library is supplemented with an app store from third-party provider Opera Software, but most users can find plenty to work with in the player&#39;s stock options.","Externally, the Samsung covers the expected bases. With dimensions of 14.2 x 7.7 x 1.6 inches and a weight of 1.1 pounds, the J5900 can fit into a home theater system with relative ease. The textured black exterior gives the player a distinctive appearance. The rest of the player includes Ethernet and Wi-Fi support, along with a single USB and coaxial audio port.","By default, Samsung offers a one-year warranty on the J5900. The manufacturer also provides support through several methods, including phone agents, web chat and an online troubleshooting hub."]},"id":"678206ea-fd0b-44fe-a4ef-ee1a73490862","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a9669d2f-b98b-42f8-803f-cce3d4886de0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As an entry-level Blu-ray player, there&#39;s a lot to like about the Samsung BD-J5900.
