If we compare toothbrush models to cars, the <a href=\"/oral-b-deep-sweep-review\">Pro 1000</a> is Oral-B’s standard trim, the <a href=\"/oral-b-genius-pro-8000-review\">Genius Pro 8000</a> is its luxury model, and the Pro 5000 fits well in between.","Two-thirds of our brushing panel picked this model as their favorite Oral-B, but it was not as well-liked by the others. It brushes more gently than the Genius Pro 8000, but its motor sounds distinctly harsher. The testers also found it quite tricky to navigate between modes and described the grip as a bit clumsy. That’s why we chose the Oral-B Pro 1000 as our best value. The more economical toothbrush feels easier and more comfortable to use.","The Oral-B Pro 5000 cleans with the same rotating, oscillating and pulsating movements behind the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2017-archive/september/its-electric-oral-b-powered-toothbrushes-earn-ada-seal\">ADA Seal of Acceptance</a>. Its cleaning modes are Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening and Deep Clean. If you’d like also like a Tongue Cleaning mode, you can upgrade to the Genius Pro 8000 or try the tongue cleaners that come with the <a href=\"/pursonic-review\">Pursonic S520</a>. Whichever cleaning mode you choose, dental professionals recommend brushing for a full two-minute cycle twice daily.","Like every toothbrush we tested, the Oral-B 5000 has a timer built in to its handle. The timer pulses every 30 seconds to help you know when to switch between zones in your mouth. The toothbrush also has a pressure sensor with dual alerts. When you brush too hard, the sensor in the brush handle lights up. You’ll also get a notice on Oral-B’s app, which can store up to six months of data.","The Oral-B app can help you set brushing goals, and it motivates you with tips and rewards. “It’s very user-friendly, with lots of images and tutorials to show you exactly what’s going on,” our lab manager said. “It also provides reminders to floss your teeth, clean your tongue and even rinse. They’re clearly leaving nothing to chance here.”","Although we like the Sonicare app a bit better, the Oral-B app has some great tools. Its Focused Care feature helps you customize your brushing plan based on advice from your dentist, and its Dental Care Journey gives you five preprogrammed routines to help you reach your oral health goals. You can even check the news and the weather.","The Oral-B Pro 5000 comes with its handle, one Floss Action brush head, a charging station with a storage compartment for refill heads and a travel case. If you’d like to experiment with brush heads, all of Oral-B’s are compatible.","The toothbrush’s battery takes 10 hours to charge fully, which gives you up to 10 days of brushing between charges. Oral-B recommends depleting the battery fully before recharging, and a battery life display on the handle tells you when it’s time.","Oral-B backs its Pro-series toothbrushes with a two-year limited warranty. If you need help with an Oral-B toothbrush, you can reach customer service by phone, email and chat."]},"id":"9f9b9c3d-7601-4595-a8f5-2c380658f6ec","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59546","url":"/oral-b-smartseries-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-16T14:59:31Z","datePublished":"2014-05-16T14:59:31Z","name":"Oral-B Pro 5000","synopsis":"Priced at less than $130, the Oral-B Pro 5000 is the most affordable of the four “connected” toothbrushes we tested.","review":{"rating":79,"verdict":"The Oral-B Pro 5000 has many desirable features, including Bluetooth connectivity and an app that provides real-time brushing feedback.
