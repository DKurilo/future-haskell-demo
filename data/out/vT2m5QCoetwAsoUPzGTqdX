We set the fryer to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and in about 15 minutes, it should have reached the correct temperature. However, we found that the oil&#39;s temperature fluctuated around 5 degrees below that target temperature. This might seem trifling to non-cooks, but our taste testers noticed a distinct difference in the taste, moisture and crispness of the French fries cooked in the T-Fal and those cooked in other fryers that reached the correct temperature.","We had better luck cooking breaded chicken in this deep fryer, and we were pleased to see we could fully submerge the chicken strips in the oil. Also, it didn’t take too long for the oil to heat back up after we added the chicken. Each piece came out golden brown, glistening and almost perfect. The chicken scored well with our taste testers, but when we calculated the overall average, the French fries brought the total score down somewhat. If you foresee this model’s temperature inconsistencies being an issue for you, take a look at the <a href=\"/breville-review\">Breville Smart Fryer</a> – in addition to heating to the correct temperature, it recovered its initial temperature quickly after we added each batch of food.","The T-Fal Ultimate EZ Clean FR800050 includes accessories and features that make deep frying easy. Its vented lid keeps hot oil from splattering all over, and the window on top lets you monitor the progress of the items you&#39;re frying.","After we finished frying, we had to clean up. It wasn&#39;t as much of a chore as it was with other fryers we reviewed. In many ways, this T-Fal model is almost self-cleaning. We pushed the lever on the front and watched as the used oil drained into the storage container at the bottom. The amazing part here is the oil automatically filters through mesh, leaving the fried bits of breading in the vat and not in the used oil. As such, you don&#39;t have to pour the oil out, filter it yourself or find another container to store it in. It saves you time, money and effort.","We also liked that the heating element is immersed in the oil, so the fryer’s exterior doesn&#39;t get too hot, which is a great safety feature. In fact, the outside temperature only reached 115 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn&#39;t hot enough to burn your hand. This T-Fal unit has a one-year warranty."]},"id":"20285eda-0685-46b9-ade4-447bf838a277","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59013","url":"/t-fal-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-06T14:41:00Z","datePublished":"2014-03-06T14:41:00Z","name":"T-Fal EZ Clean FR8000","synopsis":"The T-Fal Ultimate EZ Clean FR800050 deep fryer makes cleanup easy, but we got mixed results when cooking homemade, fresh French fries and breaded chicken strips.
