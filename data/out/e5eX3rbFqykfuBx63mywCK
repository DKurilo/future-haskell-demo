The homepage has a clean and simple design with a large free text search bar and searchable categories across the top. Ticket prices are large and easy to see, and you can sort results by event date and home or away games. In addition, the interactive seating map displays point-of-view photos from the seats so you know exactly what your game day experience will be like. Even though the website is lacking in search result filters and doesn’t have a value score system, it&#39;s still incredibly easy to use.","This website also offers an amazing low price guarantee on qualifying secondary market tickets. If you find your ticket at a lower price, TicketIQ will beat the difference by 200 percent. Because this is a secondary market website, some tickets may be marked up from face value, but there&#39;s always a chance they&#39;ll be lower if a seller is particularly motivated to unload them. The TicketIQ return policy is similar to most sites’. You get your money back if the event is canceled but not if it’s rescheduled.","We looked for the least expensive tickets we could find for the same three games across all websites we tested. We then compared these base ticket prices and assigned corresponding letter grades. TicketIQ didn’t fare well because it had some of the highest ticket prices for two of the three games we researched. Also, unlike every other site we tested, it didn&#39;t even have tickets to the third test game we looked for. As such, TicketIQ earned a D+. That being said, the site didn’t charge any fees on a $25 ticket. In fact, it was the only website we tested not to, so despite having more expensive tickets, it all evens out to be a relatively affordable option.","TicketIQ isn’t the place to go if you need to sell tickets because it doesn’t offer a resale service. If you have tickets you no longer need, check out <a href=\"/vivid-seats-review\">Vivid Seats</a> or <a href=\"/stubhub-review\">StubHub</a> – both only charge a 10 percent commission. When you purchase tickets, they’re guaranteed to be valid and the transaction is guaranteed secure, as with most ticket purchasing websites.","You can also download the TicketIQ app to buy tickets on the go. It looks similar to the website, so there’s almost no learning curve when using it. If you’re unsure about which game you’d like to go to, you can also set up alerts in the app to get notifications when particular tickets go up for sale. You can also receive notifications when prices change. However, we couldn’t find a way to set up these alerts on the desktop version of the website during our tests.","It’s missing some of the extras other sports ticket sites have, but TicketIQ’s price match program makes it really stand out. At the very least, it’s worth checking out to compare the price of a ticket you’ve purchased on another website."]},"id":"11717495-c485-41c8-9adf-6a6e64eab938","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69536","url":"/ticketiq-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-18T16:40:20Z","datePublished":"2017-07-18T16:40:20Z","name":"TicketIQ","synopsis":"TicketIQ, formerly known as TigIQ, makes it easy to look for tickets to games happening everywhere.
