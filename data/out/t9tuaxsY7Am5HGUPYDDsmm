Debt management plans are available in all 50 states. Money Management International offers in-person counseling in 33 states.","As part of our evaluation process, we examined the calculators and tools provided by each credit counseling agency. Itâ€™s a good idea to use the tools these services provide to learn what you can do about your financial situation before you place your call. Money Management International does not offer two of the most important and useful tools: a debt-to-income ratio calculator or a payoff estimation calculator.","Money Management International stands out in the quality of the educational resources it provides. The articles and blog on its website cover the widest variety of financial topics. These topics include family finances, small business finances, bankruptcy and even money management for kids.","In addition to articles and blogs, Money Management International also offers downloadable eBooks, about managing debt and saving money, and podcasts that highlight success stories and teach you how to successfully manage your money.","As part of our evaluation process, our reviewers spoke with a credit counselor and learned about the counseling process. You need to provide the counselor with information about your income and expenses. He or she then works with you to establish a budget and work on solutions to your debt problems.","Money Management International suggests a debt management program but no alternative solutions. A debt management program is relatively risk free, but we prefer counseling agencies that suggest multiple options for dealing with debt.","Debt management programs include a setup fee and a monthly maintenance fee. Money Management International&#39;s fees vary depend on the state you live in. Additionally, waivers are available if you earn up to 150 percent of the poverty line.","Money Management is accredited by both the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA) and the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC). This consumer credit counseling agency meets the licensing requirements of both agencies, which involves counselors passing certification exams and the organization itself disclosing information about its earnings, tax filings and services it provides."]},"id":"73594dd8-efcd-452b-af0b-73872db68a25","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2fa312df-ef64-4e56-9d8f-9b9313ff5125","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Money Management International offers debt management programs and counseling for bankruptcy and housing in addition to consumer credit counseling.
