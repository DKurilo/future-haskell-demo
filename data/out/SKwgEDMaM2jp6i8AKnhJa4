Fortunately, all kinds of <a href=\"/best-billing-and-invoice-software\">accounting software</a> are available to help simplify the process, but it is good to have a basic understanding of terms such as owner s equity, assets and liabilities.","<strong>Basic Definition of Owner s Equity<br/></strong>Owner s equity is the amount of ownership or business assets (i.e., equity) you own in the business. The basic owner s equity formula is assets minus liabilities. An asset is an economic resource or item of financial value, particularly one that easily converts to money. A liability is a future transaction that you are obliged to make that results in the transfer of your assets (i.e., a debt). For example, if your business assets total $4 million and your liabilities total $1.5 million, then your owner s equity is $2.5 million.","<strong>A Closer Look at Owner s Equity<br/></strong>Based upon your type of business, you may refer to owner s equity in different ways. If you own a sole proprietorship business or co-own a partnership, then owner s equity is your capital account. In a corporation, you call owner s equity  retained earnings.  Owner s equity increases in only two ways:"]},"id":"31ea0d1e-1cf2-41f2-abbf-0c457d188612","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Investing more cash in your business","Improving profits through more sales and lower expenses"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1b92cd2c-94bc-4a55-ba3e-d0837987753b","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["These two methods directly increase your assets without negatively affecting your liabilities. Thus, if &#34;owner s equity = assets   liabilities,&#34; your owner s equity increases as assets increase. If you withdraw money from your owner s equity, then this is a capital gain, and you must pay a capital gains tax on that amount.","<strong>Computing Owner s Equity on a Spreadsheet<br/></strong>You can list your owner&#39;s equity information on a spreadsheet to make more sense of it. On the left side of your business balance sheet, list all assets. To the right, list liabilities. Add up the sum of each column at the bottom. Next, use the owner s equity equation. If you are using an Excel sheet with assets in Column A and liabilities in Column B, with the totals of each column listed in row 15, you can use a formula in cell C15. Type  =A15-B15  in cell C15. This will give you owner s equity.","The spreadsheet is more helpful if it includes a separate page listing the monthly totals organized by date. For example, in cell A1 you would list total assets from January 2015 with total liabilities in cell B1. For February 2015, you would list total assets in cell A2 and liabilities in cell B2. Then, in Column C, you d use the owner s equity equation in every cell to help you keep track of owner s equity over the long-term.","Alternatively, you can use accounting software to make the process simpler. Programs, such as FreshBooks or QuickBooks, do all computations for you. Plus, they can produce reports that give you a quick snapshot of your financial state with details provided throughout. If you are unfamiliar with specific terms or confused about anything, the programs have built-in tools to answer your questions."]},"id":"ecf92cfb-51a9-429d-9f6b-ddeb8977cc73","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9609","url":"/what-is-owners-equity","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-04T16:47:14Z","datePublished":"2015-06-04T16:47:14Z","name":"What is Owner’s Equity and How Do You Calculate It?","synopsis":"Starting and managing a business can be quite complex, especially if you are not familiar with all of the financial and accounting terms.","review":{},"strapline":"Starting and managing a business can be quite complex, especially if you are not familiar with all of the financial and accounting terms.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-01-13T19:24:55Z","id":"SKwgEDMaM2jp6i8AKnhJa4","meta":{"title":"What is Owner’s Equity and How Do You Calculate It?","description":"Owner&#039;s equity is important to calculate when you own a business.
