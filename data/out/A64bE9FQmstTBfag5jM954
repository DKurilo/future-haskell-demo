You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frigidaire FFRA0622S1 is a decent choice for cooling a room in your home that is unpleasantly warm in the summer. This <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioner</a> uses up to 6,000 British thermal units (Btu), which makes it appropriate for a room of approximately 250 square feet.","While anything over 10 is generally considered good, this unit doesn&#39;t quite compete with the top-ranking products on our comparison for its energy efficiency ratio (EER). This window AC unit has an EER of 11.1, which means it falls second to last in our lineup for efficiency. It does not have an Energy Star designation either. That does not mean that its efficiency claims are false, but we prefer the units that have been through the process to get that extra stamp of approval from as many outside organizations as possible. It does have the certification from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, another respected and independent organization, so that inspires confidence.","The maximum airflow on this window AC is only 101 cubic feet per minute, which is the lowest among the ones we compared, especially compared to the 250 CFM of the <a href=\"/lg-lw8015er-review\">LG LW8015ER</a>, which has the highest airflow in our review. Moving the air can impact how quickly a room feels cooler. It&#39;s not overly impressive for moisture removal either. It reduces the amount of water in the air by 1.3 pints per hour; there are four units in our window air conditioner reviews that remove more than that. Also, there is no specific dehumidify mode with this model.  It has most operating modes that we were looking for, though, including fan-only and energy saver.","In terms of design, this Frigidaire AC unit stands out in good ways. It has the third lowest sound output, making it a very quiet window air conditioner. That can make a big difference, especially if you plan to use it in a nursery, or really any bedroom. It is also relatively lightweight at 44 pounds, which will make it easier to install.","It also is comparatively good in terms of its warranty, which is five years, at least for the compressor. Many competitors just offer one year. Frigidaire takes good care of customers with an information-packed website and lots of ways to get customer service."]},"id":"ea239b7e-5c43-4eec-bb49-496c4ab43ae4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"73ec31e2-3190-4763-a37d-22ddd14286e1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With only moderate moisture removal and no dehumidify mode, this is not going to be the best choice for a humid climate but is a reasonable option if you live anywhere else.
