The <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-portable-solar-power-systems\">solar power kit</a> is the largest offered by Zamp Solar at 11.43 amps of charging power. It comes with a mounted solar charge controller and 16 feet of wire that plugs directly into a battery terminal. There is also a convenient nylon carrying case included with the solar panels.","The portable solar power system is easy to set up. It&#39;s in a carrying case that’s 27 inches wide and 40 inches long, which you can haul around with a sturdy handle. While it is definitely portable, these aren’t small panels. The entire unit weighs more than 30 pounds. That means you can move it from your car to the cabin, but you don’t want to take it on a long hike or try to carry it around for charging your cellphone. The panels unfold when opened and, completely set up, are 54 inches wide. They work best on a roof or in front of an RV in the sun.","The portable solar power system has a controller that regulates the amount of stored power and lets you know how close the charging kit is to getting full. There is no need to buy a separate storage device. The power can then plug in to a car or RV battery to keep a full charge.","If you need the device for other power options such as powering a laptop or cellphone, your best option is plugging it into the vehicle. If you’re using the panels elsewhere, like at a campsite or cabin, you need to buy extra attachments that will adapt the alligator clips into USB ports.","If you need solar energy in case of a natural disaster, this solar power kit works best set up in a wide area and charging an external battery. This isn’t the best solar generator for emergency power though. For an emergency home kit, you need to have extra batteries around.","The best thing about this charging system is the amount of power it produces. At 200 watts, it can power a wide range of devices and keep your RV functional for long periods of time. While it is bulky, it’s also easy to set up and power can start collecting right away. This is a good mid-level solar power option between smaller kits and full-size solar panels."]},"id":"d94a9db6-a5e6-4b91-b3af-f8dfb29028de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61713","url":"/zamp-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:30:12Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:30:12Z","name":"Zamp Solar 200-Watt Charging Kit ZS-200-P","synopsis":"The Zamp Solar 200-Watt Charging Kit is a great addition to RVs, campers and cabins.
