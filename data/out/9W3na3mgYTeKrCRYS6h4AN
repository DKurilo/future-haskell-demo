Note tools allow you to jot down distracting ideas that pop in your head, and an outline view helps you keep track of characters and scenes. For example, you can use a filter to isolate a character to remind yourself what they were doing five scenes ago. When you’ve been writing a long time, details get cloudy. Movie Magic Screenwriter can also color-code scenes, characters and actions. You can filter by a color and look at characters from a certain family or group.","Movie Magic screenwriting software comes with plenty of templates with a variety of formats for screenplays, television scripts and even novels, to ensure that your spec script for a sitcom will be formatted correctly.","Read our full review: <a href=\"/movie-magic-screenwriter-review\">Movie Magic Screenwriter</a>","<strong>Pros:</strong>"]},"id":"69df3650-a665-4423-9d9f-d400d29e19f9","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Pro: This screenwriting software is officially endorsed by the WGA and has some great collaborative tools."],"type":"ul"},"id":"6035e793-de26-4a67-b133-c90180c34106","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Cons:</strong>"]},"id":"d1f25b49-12ca-4d07-b5df-ffc8b3d48a2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Con: Its NaviDoc feature can become a bit overwhelming as the number of scenes grows."],"type":"ul"},"id":"ab4077ca-355f-4ae2-be56-3aac21e65ab1","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In addition to researching and using each screenwriting program we reviewed, we also reached out to professionals who use screenwriting software everyday.","Richard Dutcher is an independent film director who has produced eight feature films and written dozens of screenplays. We asked him which screenwriting software he uses and why.","“I use both <a href=\"/final-draft-review\">Final Draft</a> and <a href=\"/movie-magic-screenwriter-review\">Movie Magic Screenwriter</a>, depends on which job I’m doing and if they have a preference. If it’s my own choice, I use Movie Magic Screenwriter,” Dutcher said. He explained that he started screenwriting in the late &#39;90s and learned on the program Script Thing, which was later acquired by Movie Magic. “I just stuck to it because it was what I was used to,” Dutcher said.","We asked him about <a href=\"/celtx-plus-review\">Celtx</a>, <a href=\"/fade-in-review\">Fade-in</a> and <a href=\"/slugline-review\">Slugline</a> as alternatives to the industry standard applications like Final Draft and Movie Magic. “I found I had to do too much tailoring in them. I couldn’t do what I wanted to do easily, and I don’t like to think about the formatting. I just like to sit down and write,” Dutcher said. “I found it to be too much distraction and time consuming to make the format to be what I consider professional formats. Otherwise, somebody has to convert it, and it never converts perfectly.”","Dutcher said, “To me, if you are a professional screenwriter or want to be a professional screenwriter, you definitely have to be using professional software. Even if you’re just at home pounding something out for a screenplay competition or you hope maybe to get in a producer, it shouts ‘amateur screenwriter’ if you&#39;re not using a professional software program.”","<strong>The Importance of Outlining Your Script</strong>","Outlines are vital for all writers, whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned professional. Trying to write a full-length screenplay without an outline is like trying to navigate a ship without a map and compass. If you know where your story is going, your ability to reach that destination is much smoother.","The best screenwriter software understands the value of outlines. The notecards should be intuitive and easy to find. Before you begin writing the first line of dialogue, you should outline every scene from start to finish with a logline, the motivation of the characters in the scene and why the scene is useful for moving the plot. Color coding and scene breakdowns are valuable for production as well. A good program will isolate specific locations so that the cinematographer and director can shoot multiple scenes that aren’t necessarily in chronological order. ","<strong>Other Valuable Features of Screenwriting Software</strong>","For more advanced production, there are many other tools that improve the process of bringing your words to life. Script breakdown tools allow you to highlight specific items on the page. Props, for example, could be highlighted in one color so a prop supervisor can easily find them. In-depth reports let crew members know about location changes and scheduling conflicts.","Another great resource is an active online community. As you write, questions will come up. How do you write a montage? What if two people are talking at the same time? How do you set up the page if you&#39;re constantly jumping in and out of two scenes? A vibrant community online can answer all these questions, whether it’s on the manufacturer&#39;s website or a third-party forum. The more you feel like part of a group, the better chance you have of finishing your script."]},"id":"24f346f2-677a-4b88-91d4-0eef5a8421a8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"035559f4-eafc-4be6-ba3a-1bcae4f35acd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.linkconnector.com/ta.php?lc=017408000010004693&lc_pid=Promo-14558&url=https://www.writersstore.com/final-draft-screenwriting-software/&atid=screenwritingsoftware&lcpf=3&lcpi=14558\">Final Draft</a>","<a href=\"http://www.linkconnector.com/ta.php?lc=017408000010004693&lc_pid=Promo-14558&url=https://www.writersstore.com/movie-magic-screenwriter-screenwriting-software/?gclid=CIGn3fLs6c8CFYF7fgodH64Ifwatid=screenwritingsoftware&lcpf=3&lcpi=14558\">Movie Magic Screenwriter</a>","<a href=\"https://www.celtx.com/pricing.html\">Celtx Plus</a>","<a href=\"http://www.fadeinpro.com/page.pl?content=purchase\">Fade In</a>","<a href=\"http://www.linkconnector.com/ta.php?lc=017408000010004693&lc_pid=Promo-14558&url= https://www.writersstore.com/storyist-3?gclid=CMvpgf3w6c8CFYqifgodikYJ7g&atid=screenwritingsoftware&lcpf=3&lcpi=14558\">Storyist</a>","<a href=\"http://www.linkconnector.com/ta.php?lc=017408000010004693&lc_pid=Promo-14558&url= https://www.writersstore.com/scrivener?gclid=CL3ir5r66c8CFU9cfgodysMB8g&atid=screenwritingsoftware&lcpf=3&lcpi=14558\">Scrivener</a>","<a href=\"http://marinersoftware.com/products/montage/?ap_id=Purch\">Montage</a>","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slugline/id553754186?mt=12&uo=4&at=1l3v52U\">Slugline</a>","<a href=\"https://writerduet.com/#pricing\">WriterDuet</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"eccc1f98-4d54-48ba-a804-8985d762ced4","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_685","url":"/best-screenwriting-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
