It is UL-certified as fire-resistant and can hold its own for an hour in temperatures up to 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit. The internal temperature stays below 350 degrees Fahrenheit, so you can secure legal documents and other items you need to remain intact during a fire.","A benefit of the First Alert 2087F-BD being fire-resistant is it’s also waterproof when closed, even when the safe is completely submerged. Also, if you don’t bolt it down, the safe can float to make it easy to recover in a flooded area.","This First Alert safe weighs 83 pounds, and most of its heft comes from its fire-resistant resin. Because of its weight, you will likely need help installing it, especially if you need to carry it up or down stairs. Four steel bolts lock the door, and hidden hinges make the safe’s door resistant to being pried open. However, the 2087F-BD isn’t UL-certified as burglary-resistant. You can securely bolt the safe down, and it will still be fire-resistant and waterproof.","The First Alert 2087F-BD measures 16.5 x 14.5 x 19 inches on the outside and has 0.94 cubic feet of space inside, which makes it much larger than some models we looked at, including the <a href=\"/barska-review\">Barska AX11620</a>. The safe’s well-designed interior has an adjustable storage shelf, a key rack with three sets of rings and a door pocket where you can tuck items you need to access quickly. However, it doesn&#39;t have a place to store hanging files. Also note that the First Alert 2087F-BD is not rated as safe for gun storage, so you shouldn’t keep any type of firearm in it.","You unlock this safe using the dial combination lock, which is easy to use and doesn&#39;t require any batteries. If you lose the combination or are in a hurry, you can use one of the two override keys included with the safe. First Alert backs the 2087F-BD with a five-year warranty, which is exceptional for a home safe, as many only have one-year warranties."]},"id":"5e0c36cd-d198-41af-b93b-6e6ec02980d3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61963","url":"/first-alert-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T00:26:44Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T00:26:44Z","name":"First Alert 2087F-BD","synopsis":"The First Alert 2087F-BD home safe is a smart choice if you want to protect your valuables from fire damage.
