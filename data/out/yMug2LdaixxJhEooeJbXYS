With its helpful time-saving features this durable <a href=\"/best-dryers\">dryer</a> can help you get the clothes back onto hangers quickly. The first convenient factor you’ll notice is its size. This Kenmore dryer offers 8.8 cubic feet of interior space. You can dry whole baskets of laundry at a time in it, as well as bulky items like bedding. For a good accompanying washer, take a look at the <a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore 28132</a>. This top-load washer gives you 10 cycles, four soil levels, five wash and rinse temperatures, a deep wash that uses more water for extra-dirty clothing, and a presoak mode.","The 68132 tied for the second most energy efficient among the ones we compared. It has an Energy Star and scored highly for its Combined Energy Factor (CEF) – one of the metrics used by the EPA to gauge efficiency.","This electric dryer has SmartDry Ultra Technology that automatically adjusts drying times and temperatures. The technology includes built-in moisture sensors and a temperature monitor that gauges how dry a load of laundry is during a drying cycle. These features substantially cut the risk of over-drying laundry or ending up with a load that is still damp. The <a href=\"/kenmore-elite-review\">Kenmore Elite 31633</a> is a dryer with similar functionality but an even bigger capacity of 9.2 cubic feet.","This dryer’s Express Dry cycle can get a small load completely dry in under a half-hour. You can also get your clothing freshened and ready to wear with the Steam Refresh cycle. If you’re in the midst of a project at home or have left the house and cannot pull that freshly dried clothing out of the dryer, fear not. The Wrinkle Guard option intermittently tumbles the load for up to 150 minutes after the drying cycle has ended so you can avoid set-in wrinkles.","The Kenmore 68132’s sanitizing cycle can kill 99.9 percent of bacteria with its powerful heat. This is a good option for the blankets used by someone sick with the flu, stuffed animals, or decorative pillows that have become germ-infected.","Even with all of those option available, there were dryers with more selection, including specific options for active wear and specific eco-friendly cycles. You also don&#39;t get a custom cycle feature or steam options with this machine. Other machines offer smartphone connectivity that you won’t find on the 68132. It is worth noting that 68132 is available with a steam cycle, too, though, for a higher price.","This dryer’s quad baffles – the four paddle-like devices inside the drum that help tumble the clothes – are designed to cut down on laundry tangling, so you likely will not have to unravel a twisted, tangled-up sheet. You also get a light inside the drum so you can see what is inside – that way a sock won’t be left behind while its companion finds its way into a dresser.","In case you have limited or awkward space in your laundry area, you can detach this dryer’s door from one side and reattach it to the other so it opens the other direction. This option lets you position the dryer in the most helpful and convenient spot. This dryer has a weak warranty with just one year of coverage.","The Kenmore 68132 has a large capacity but still offers good energy efficiency. While it lacks a few options that we like, including some cycle types and smartphone control, it offers competitive value when you consider all of its features."]},"id":"c443f14e-5d64-41fa-9bf5-a9589ec257fc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51215","url":"/kenmore-dryer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-27T16:50:57Z","datePublished":"2010-10-27T16:50:57Z","name":"Kenmore 68132","synopsis":"The Kenmore 68132 is large and relatively inexpensive.
