You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Balaenoptera Musculus is not only the scientific name for the blue whale, but it&#39;s also the name of a <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">remote control boat</a> made by the Syma toy company. Believe it or not, this RC boat reaches speeds as fast as the 200-ton mammal – around 18 miles per hour. It may not cover as much ground as the blue whale since its included transmitter only has a wireless range of 300 feet; however, this RC boat should be a great starter boat for many.","This remote control boat comes in two colors – blue or yellow. It has an impressive run time of 20 minutes whereas most other boats have a battery life of just half that. It works well in pools or larger bodies of water, just make sure to seal the hatch with tape or water quickly seeps in. The Balaenoptera Musculus has a light plastic body that should handle most collisions with other boats. However, during our durability test, the boat got a large scratch after crashing into the side of the pool, so be careful.","We found that the Balaenoptera Musculus was one of the easiest boats to set up and control. It can be a great boat for young children. Syma has incorporated a safety feature that prevents the motors and propellers from activating if the boat isn&#39;t in water.","It may not be as fast as other RC boats, but it still is a lot of fun to drive. It has dual propellers, and it makes smooth turns. It handles both quick and wide turns gracefully. It&#39;s entertaining to watch the boat go in circles and quickly zip back and forth. This boat doesn’t have a self-righting feature, so if it flips over, you’ll have to retrieve it or hope the wind or waves bring it back.","It comes with extra propellers, a boat battery, charger and a stand to display the boat when it&#39;s not in use. The included transmitter slightly resembles an old video game controller. Rather than using the more common pistol-grip design often featured for remote control boats and cars, Syma took a different approach and uses a two-button controller. Unfortunately, the transmitter doesn&#39;t include batteries, so you&#39;ll have to purchase 8 AA batteries separately, but the boat responds well to the transmitter, and it has a good wireless range.","You get a 30-day warranty with this RC boat. The box has an instruction manual with set up instructions. One minor downfall is that Syma doesn’t sell replacement parts, and the only way to reach the company is through email. You can find YouTube videos of the boat in action if you want to compare it to other remote control boats."]},"id":"8e652536-e16b-431f-9535-e4a3a8221caa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9728bbb6-bde3-4c36-bb05-a46c47d7b601","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Balaenoptera Musculus radio-controlled boat is an affordable option that appeals to beginner boaters.
