In addition, State Farm is one of the most financially stable insurance providers with over $160 billion in total assets. You can trust this insurance provider has the funds to pay out on big claims.     <br />\n    <br />\nReceiving an accurate quote for your homeowners insurance is complicated because there are so many considerations. But State Farm's quote tool is the most comprehensive I’ve seen, asking about 123 questions. By comparison, most quoting tools asked only about 50 questions. It takes significantly longer to complete than others, but I felt more confident about the quote I received as a result. Furthermore, the process is the easiest to use. The questions are defined well, so you know exactly how to answer and how each one applies to the quote. The tool even uses pictures with some questions to help you identify your home’s style and construction material.     <br />\n    <br />\nAnother great aspect of State Farm is the agent finder tool. While you can't read reviews of local agents or see how engaged they are in your local community, the agent finder tool provides personalized bios, availability and languages spoken. You don't need an agent to purchase your policy, as with many insurance providers, but it's definitely worth considering.

The cost was so much more than other insurance providers, I didn't feel confident with it. In addition, since the quote process asked so few questions about my home, I wasn’t confident in the reconstruction value it quoted me.

This comes out to about $97.75 per month. However, premiums vary widely based on the above variables – and more. Insurance providers can consider relatively mundane details, such as how close your home is to the nearest fire hydrant, in determining costs.","The same report notes how homeowners insurance costs can differ based on location and risk factors. For example, the report cites Florida as having the highest premiums, with an average of $1,993 per year, due to its common risk of hurricane damage. Conversely, Oregon has the lowest average premium, at $643 per year, in part because of its relatively low proximity to risk and generally lower property values, which affects the reconstruction costs.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To determine our rankings, we followed a process much like we’d suggest you do as you shop for insurance. Your home is a major investment, and how you protect it deserves careful consideration. The most important juncture in your purchasing decision is the quote process. Set aside half a day to get as many quotes as possible. Then compare the premiums, deductibles, coverage and additional options, such as earthquake or flood protection. Once you&#39;ve compared quotes, narrow the list down to the best quotes and use the <a href=\"http://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/jd-power-2017-us-home-insurance-study\">2017 J.D. Power customer satisfaction study</a> to break any quotes that are too close. If you&#39;re still not convinced, find an insurance agent in your area to consult with - I can&#39;t understate the value of talking with an agent if you&#39;re not sure. They are experts in both insurance and how to best apply it to your area.","Quote Process<br/>Throughout each provider&#39;s quote tool, I noted every detail – the number of questions, the types of questions, the tools to help you answer the questions and the efficiency of the process. The best quoting tools ask a lot of questions. This means they take longer, but you are more likely to get a more accurate quote you can have confidence in. With quote tools that asked only a few questions, I had very little confidence the quoted coverage was the best option for the home, particularly with concern to the reconstruction value, which was always nearly half the value quoted by the insurance providers with more comprehensive quoting tools. ","The 2017 J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction Study<br/>J.D. Power performs comprehensive customer satisfaction studies every year. This well-known market research organization, famous for its customer satisfaction awards, interviews almost 16,000 people with homeowners insurance. The study asks them to rate their satisfaction with the insurance provider&#39;s pricing, claims process, policy offerings, interaction and billing. I closely considered the results of the 2017 J.D. Power study in my comparison. If you’re having trouble choosing between two providers with similar quotes, this study is the best tiebreaker because it&#39;s a good indication of the customer experience you can expect.  ","Agent Finder Tool<br/>In most states and with most companies, you don&#39;t need to go through an agent to purchase homeowners insurance. Some states, however, require it by law. That said, consulting with an agent is a great idea. Throughout my research, I consulted with several agents to help me better understand homeowners insurance and I found it wasn&#39;t the up-selling trap I assumed it would be. Every single agent I contacted was extremely helpful. I never had to worry about aggressive up-selling or pressure to make a purchase.","I even asked an agent from State Farm, whose office in Orem, Utah, has been around for decades, why agents were still relevant to the insurance industry considering how easy it&#39;s become to purchase policies online. First, he explained how agents in today&#39;s market succeed through policy renewals, not one-off sales. It&#39;s a simple business philosophy – long-term clients are more profitable than striking for bigger, but short-lived, profit. And when the aim is for long-term clients through policy renewals, agents are interested in building a relationship with you to make sure &#34;your insurance experience is enjoyable&#34; while continually building trust. One reason to use an agent, he points out, is that insurance agents are experts on both the ins and outs of insurance, the local area and how to best apply insurance coverage to these local issues. In other words, they know better than anyone how to best insure property in your area, what risks you should plan for or ignore, how much the reconstruction values are, etc. ","Financial Stability<br/>For insurance companies to succeed, they need to have a great deal of equity to prop them up. If your home is destroyed in a tornado, you need to know the company is financially stable enough to pay out the reconstruction value on your claim. Fortunately, every major insurance provider releases an annual financial report. Most companies have equity in the hundreds of billions, but this not always the case. While this isn&#39;t the most critical consideration, it&#39;s worth checking before you commit to a policy.","<strong>What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?</strong>","Every insurance providers&#39; policies vary a little in how they cover various hazards, risks and more. But according to the <a href=\"https://www.naic.org/documents/consumer_guide_home.pdf\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a>, most homeowners insurance policies cover the following:","Dwelling<br/>Protects your home and structures attached to your home, such as the garage, decks and patios, from damage from a wide variety of hazards like fire and smoke, wind, hail, explosions, theft, vandalism, falling objects, water damage and more.","Other Structures<br/>Similar to the dwelling protection, other structures on your property are protected as well. This includes fences, separate garages, car ports, pools and more.","Reconstruction Value<br/>Every policy has a valuation of the reconstruction costs of your home. If your house burns down, this is the cost of the payout to build another home. Most quoting tools spend the most time calculating this value. The quoted value isn&#39;t equal to what you paid when you purchased the house; instead it’s based on the current local construction and property costs – the cost of replacement. Some providers may even require a specialist to come to your home for an appraisal.  ","Personal Property<br/>The policy reimburses you for the loss of personal property, up to the value set in your policy. You can usually raise or lower this coverage to fit your estimated cost to replace items, but this affects the premium. Also, you should read what isn&#39;t protected in this policy. Don’t assume everything you own is covered. Some providers, for example, don&#39;t include art or musical instruments in this policy but require you to add such coverage separately.","Loss of Use<br/>If your home becomes unlivable, the policy pays for you to live elsewhere while the home is being repaired.","Personal Liability<br/>If someone gets hurt on your property, this pays for the legal fees if you are sued for damages and found responsible.","Medical Payments<br/>If someone is hurt on your property or hurt by a pet, this coverage pays for their medical bills.","<strong>What Does Homeowners Insurance Not Cover?</strong>","Standard policies protect your home from damage caused by natural hazards, like fire, wind, lightning and falling options like trees and hail, but you can&#39;t assume it covers damage from everything.","Flood Insurance<br/>If you live in an area with a flood risk greater than 1 percent, your mortgage lender is federally required to have the property insured. In other words, your bank requires you to buy flood insurance, either from the National Flood Insurance Program or through your insurance provider. If the risk is less than 1 percent, but there is still a probability of flooding, coverage isn&#39;t required, but it is strongly recommended, and some lenders still require it.","Earthquake Insurance<br/>Earthquake coverage is usually purchased as an endorsement to your homeowners insurance. This means you don&#39;t purchase it separately as you do with flood insurance, but it&#39;s added to your existing policy. Adding this coverage is completely optional, though your mortgage lender may require it if you live in a high-risk area. That said, the NAIC estimates 90 percent of the population lives in an area where earthquakes pose some risk, though some areas like California are at a much higher risk.","Business Usage<br/>If you use your home for business purposes, even if you just use one room for an office, a standard policy doesn&#39;t protect any items related to your business usage – laptops, computers, monitors and other business-related items. You’ll need to purchase additional coverage for business usage. In addition, if you run a daycare in your home, you&#39;re required to purchase more liability coverage in addition to business insurance coverage.","<strong>Are You Required to Have Homeowners Insurance?</strong>","Generally speaking, if you take out a mortgage to buy your home, you are required to buy homeowners insurance. From the vantage point of a lender, it’s a risk to lend you such a large chunk of money. This insurance, simply put, is the lender’s way to safeguard its financial investment.","Homeowners insurance is most commonly lumped together with your mortgage payment and other fees, such as property taxes, though in certain cases it may be separate. Even if your lender doesn’t outright mention requiring insurance, it doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. If you plan on buying a house, call up a few local insurance agencies to get estimates. It’s best to get this done as soon as possible.","Also, keep in mind that if your policy lapses or you end up without coverage for any reason,  your lender may issue a force-placed policy on you. This can even happen if your lender decides the insurance you purchased is not enough. Force-placed policies, also called lender-placed insurance, are much more expensive since you are seen as high risk to the the lender."]},"id":"77b7bd0d-bb50-462d-a1ac-c47d75740dff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_358","url":"/best-homeowners-insurance","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-29T22:05:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-29T22:05:00Z","name":"Best Homeowners Insurance of 2019","synopsis":"Homeowners insurance offers protection for your home, personal property and personal liability.
