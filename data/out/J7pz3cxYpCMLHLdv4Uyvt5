The self-clean feature in the GE Cafe CGS990SETSS <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">slide-in range</a> cleans the cavity without the need for scrubbing by using scorching temperatures to char leftover foodstuffs and spills. The outstanding features of this GE Cafe model also includes two powerful ovens, built-in griddle grate, self-cleaning options, powerful burners and convection features.","The double oven fits 6.7 cubic feet of total capacity to fit more in the oven at once, making it perfect for big meals, home catering or fast family meals. The upper oven is a traditional convection model while the lower oven is dual element bake with infinite heat settings. Both ovens feature convection bake and roast features and automatic recipe conversion for convection settings. The gas convection circulates heat with a powerful fan. The circulating air eliminates cold spots to heat your food more evenly.","The smooth stainless steel surface with its deep recessed basin that collects messes under the grates and the sealed burners prevent mess from interfering with the flame quality makes it easy to keep your cooktop clean. Continuous cast iron grates make sliding heavy cookware across the cooktop to avoid spills a simple task.","The GE Cafe CGS990SETSS features five burners with a range of power from the simmer burner to the power boil burner. The powerful tri-ring burner delivers 20,000 BTUs for a fast boil and even searing or frying. The cooktop also reaches gentle temperatures of 150 degrees for simmering and melting delicate foods. You can use the included non-stick griddle on the middle burner for pancakes, bacon or grilled cheese.","Such a powerful appliance requires equally powerful controls. The digital temperature controls are supplemented with heavy weighted stainless steel knobs. The touch controls work with the larger lower oven while the knob directly to the right controls the upper oven. Convection, warm, bake, locking, timers and meat temperature probe features are also housed on this section of the range&#39;s dashboard.","Though the GE Cafe CGS990SETSS uses natural gas fuel, an LP conversion kit is included in case you would rather use liquid propane and do not have a gas hookup in your kitchen. This slide-in gas range is ADA compliant if you or any of your family has disabilities. Owners may install this range themselves, but professional installation is recommended because of the potentially harmful nature of natural gas.","The one-year warranty covers parts and labor for this powerful slide-in gas range. The GE Cafe CGS990SETSS has a huge capacity for a range of foods from pastries, meats to stir-fry and griddle foods. The gas powered burners range from gentle simmering to hot frying. The more you cook, the easier this model is to clean with its deep recessed surface and self-cleaning feature."]},"id":"72642de8-f15d-4d4b-9ce6-8d4f8688b771","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58006","url":"/ge-cafe-slide-in-range-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T12:57:02Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T12:57:02Z","name":"GE Cafe CGS990SETSS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
