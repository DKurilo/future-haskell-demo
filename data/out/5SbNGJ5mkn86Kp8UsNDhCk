You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Bissell ProHeat Deep Cleaning is one of those <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaners</a> that come with just enough bells and whistles to make your cleaning job easier without complicating it by adding features you’ll never use. It offers 12-amps of power and a 27-foot power cord that will allow you to clean most rooms in your house in a matter of minutes. It also has a water heater and multiple-speed brush to keep your carpets and upholstery feeling fresh and clean.","The Bissell ProHeat Deep Cleaning is one of the carpet cleaners we reviewed that offers a great balance between important features and an easy to use design. One of the things that makes this carpet shampooer simple to use is it offers a ready to use hose. This means that when cleaning upholstery or stairs you will not have to stop the machine to plug in the hose. Simply flip the switch on the machine to the tools setting and you are on your way to cleaning upholstery.","When reviewing carpet cleaners, we also felt that having a water heater was an important feature. This Bissell ProHeat Deep Cleaning machine will heat your tap water an additional 25 degrees to help kill those germs that may be lurking in your carpet. However, it also has a safety feature that will not allow the water temperature to reach anything above 190 degrees. This will keep you and your family safe from a possible hot water burn.","Each one of the carpet cleaners we reviewed requires some type of assembly, including the Bissell ProHeat Deep Cleaning. However, while a few of these carpet cleaners require extensive assembly this one does not. You can put this unit together in a few steps and the only tool you will need is a Philips head screwdriver. The user manual explains the assembly procedure of this unit in easy to follow steps.","The power rating of this rug cleaner is 12 amps, which will help you keep your carpets cleaner than ever before. This carpet cleaning machine also comes with automatic height adjustment. This allows the machine to adjust to different flooring types without having to manually adjust the height of the machine. This will also save time if you are moving from cleaning a Berber carpet to a plush carpet, for example.","The Bissell ProHeat Deep Cleaning is one of the carpet cleaners that come with a one year warranty. On the Bissell website, you will easily find a nice list of FAQs that will answer most of your questions. However if you need to speak to someone they offer a telephone number and email address for their customer service department."]},"id":"931b0413-18c3-4d7d-8e0a-05abccbf23f2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7a02edad-f376-4edf-b4d9-016f1e6e2054","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bissell ProHeat Deep Cleaning deserves to be on our list of great carpet cleaners because it offers several features that are useful, but not too many features to leave you feeling frustrated.
