Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The ASUS ET2410IUTS All-in-One PC is a premium contemporary example of the type of consolidated desktop goodness introduced by the iMac in the late 1990s. Yes, there were all-in-one PCs of earlier vintage before this svelte new wave. Adam Osborne’s Osborne PC, Alan Kays’ Kaypro II, the suitcase sized first Compaq or Steve Job’s very first Macintosh all provided glimpses of a potential that the ASUS All-in-One PC delivers. These precursors were handicapped, among other things, by their rather bulky cathode ray tube monitors. In terms of how we interacted with them, the Osborne and the Kaypro had keyboards and crude graphics by today’s standards. The first Macintosh brought higher resolution graphics. And the first Macintosh brought the mouse to the masses as a more intuitive data entry device to augment its QWERTY keyboard. The ASUS 2410 stands on the shoulders of these pioneers and is beholding to them as forebears.","With an impressive lineup of features and physical hardware, the ASUS ET2410IUTS All-in-One PC is among the best of current crop of all-in-one desktop computers. The huge 23.6-inch multi-touch monitor and CPU are all built in a single space-saving chassis with glossy black finish. It rests on an aluminum pedestal that is stable and allows you to easily manage cables. It has the first-class ingredients you expect in the best all-in-one computers: large touchscreen monitor, powerful processor options and graphics card, 8x DVD burner and plenty of connectivity options. It easily devours business chores, but where the ASUS All-in-One PC stands out is in the realm of home entertainment. From the extra-large full HD LCD monitor to the Blu-ray reader and optional TV tuner, it’s clear that the ASUS ET2410IUTS is geared for home entertainment. But more than just a fancy monitor for Blu-ray, online movies and video games, the ASUS All-in-One PC is a versatile machine with all the power of a high-end desktop and the performance of a gaming rig.","It ships in packaging made from 80 percent recycled materials and it is 100 percent recyclable. Many vendors these days use packaging that can be recycled, but ASUS uses mostly recycled materials to begin with.","CPU choices are the second generation of Intel Core i5 and i3 processors. These Intel Core 2011 processors, code named Sandy Bridge, use 32-nanometer microarchitecture and they are the first microprocessors to combine graphics, memory controller and processor on the same die. Therefore they are smaller than previous-generation processors and they better integrate graphics processing with the CPU core. Another benefit is that the second generation of Intel Core processors use less power.","With choices from 4GB to 8GB of RAM and hard drives as large as 2TB, you won’t have any problem with serious multitasking or file storage. The installed operating system is Windows 7 Home Premium, a great operating system appropriate to the ASUS All-in-One target market, but it lacks some of the features in Windows 7 Professional and Ultimate.","The bottom right of the unit contains the power button, LED for the hard disk activity, setting controls for the display, controls for the audio and the display mode button. Internet connectivity is flexible, with the ASUS all-in-one computer sporting Gigabit LAN (Ethernet) and wireless.","One real advantage of the ASUS ET2410UTS All-in-One PC is the Blu-ray/DVD combo drive. The tray-loading drive is located on the right side of the all-in-one and is both a Blu-ray reader and DVD burner in one. The graphics card is the NVIDIA GT450M with 1GB of VRAM.","The 23.6-inch multitouch screen has a 1920 x 1080-pixel resolution and uses optical technology, which is considered an improvement over multitouch screens that use resistive and capacitive technology. The optical touchscreens supplied by NextWindow allow a light touch, thin borders and a low profile. The screen is 6cm thin. The monitor responds as if it were a giant tablet screen, except that it does not flex or discolor when you touch it. You can scroll through webpages, rotate images and pinch to zoom just as if you were on an iPhone or Android device. You can mount the monitor on the wall if you prefer. Touch-optimized software called ASUS Cinema is included to speed browsing through pictures, music and video.","It has an integrated microphone and webcam as well as speakers and a built-in, hybrid, digital/analog TV tuner. The audio system uses SonicMaster technology as well as DTS Surround Sensation/Ultra PC technology to create immersive virtual surround sound. The sound is rich and can reproduce distinct vocals on a wide frequency range. The speaker panel runs along the bottom of the screen. ASUS has an external subwoofer option with a 580cc resonance chamber if you want more base punch.","You can connect another display because it has an HDMI-out port. It also has an HDMI-in port so you can use this beautiful monitor as the passive display for notebooks, video game consoles or cable boxes. A VGA-in port also lets you display external devices. On the side it has two USB 2.0 ports. In the back, it has three USB 3.0 ports, which are 10 times faster than the previous USB standard. There is also a three-in-one memory card reader. A Kensington lock slot lets you anchor it against filching. The mouse and Chiclet-style keyboard are wireless and ship with batteries. The exhaust fan vents out of the upper part of the backside of the monitor.","The ASUS All-in-One PC ET2410IUTS has a one-year warranty, and you can find helpful resources online to get you started or to help you resolve issues. The online service center is your gateway to drivers, forums, FAQs and troubleshooting guides. You can also get in touch with a support rep via phone, email or live chat.
