You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LawnBot LB300EL <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">robotic lawn mower</a> is suitable for home or commercial use. One of the features that stands out for those with a commercial or large property is the multizone capability, allowing the machine to mow up to four zones individually. It can mow up to two acres with one charge. This may not be the best option for a smaller yard, as there are smaller options available at lower prices for properties with a smaller acreage or without the need for multiple zones.","This automatic lawn mower detects grass height, then focusses cutting on areas that need attention. The cutting blade is 14 inches wide and can cut between 0.75 inches and three inches.","For lawns that are not completely level, this particular model is monitored using a compass module that utilizes three sensors to get the robot lawn mower where it needs to go, including up and down hills. These sensors include a magnetometer, an accelerometer and a gyroscope that measure things like the incline level of a slope or hill. The LB300EL can manage a hill or slope of up to 25 degrees.","You can program this robotic lawn mower with your iOS or Android device via Bluetooth or directly through the charging unit&#39;s built-in touchpad. Software updates are available wirelessly, eliminating the need to bring the mower indoors.","This LawnBott model uses a brushless motor, the main advantage of which is a potentially eight times longer life when compared to a conventional motor with brushes. Other advantages of a brushless motor include that it uses less power, it is slightly quieter than a traditional motor, it&#39;s more sensitive to bumps and it is better able to manage hills.","Two lithium-ion batteries power the 43-pound LB300EL robot mower. It takes approximately six hours to achieve a full charge it and has a run time of up to 10 hours. This battery should last four to five years, according to the manufacturer.","The LawnBott LB300EL is a high-end model with a number of features that make it stand out, such as the ability to mow up to two acres at a time and control it with your smartphone. Although it does offer a lot, with robotic lawn mower prices being partially based on the size of the area they can cover, a smaller model may be better for lawns that are less than an acre."]},"id":"a11bfc2d-ff94-4736-b11d-61f05baac0f5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63706","url":"/lawnbott-lb300el-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:10:24Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:10:24Z","name":"LawnBott LB300EL","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:10:24Z","id":"Gs6ubXiwbaf7hQeR6d9N5R","meta":{"title":"LawnBott LB300EL Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The LawnBot LB300EL robotic lawn mower is a high-end model with the ability to mow up to two acres at a time and control it with your smartphone."},"products":[{"slug":"lawnbott-lb300el","url":"/product/lawnbott-lb300el","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","name":"LawnBott LB300EL","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","id":"neLH9RPa9YwFUVj9K5a3Rg","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/3gB88bLc2VxzG7rxmCCBiV.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","mimeType":"","name":"63678-lawnbott-lb300el-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63678-lawnbott-lb300el-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","id":"3gB88bLc2VxzG7rxmCCBiV","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3gB88bLc2VxzG7rxmCCBiV.jpg","alt":""},"title":"LawnBott LB300EL Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The LawnBot LB300EL robotic lawn mower is a high-end model with the ability to mow up to two acres at a time and control it with your smartphone."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/3gB88bLc2VxzG7rxmCCBiV.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","mimeType":"","name":"63678-lawnbott-lb300el-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63678-lawnbott-lb300el-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","id":"3gB88bLc2VxzG7rxmCCBiV","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3gB88bLc2VxzG7rxmCCBiV.jpg","alt":""},"title":"LawnBott LB300EL Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The LawnBot LB300EL robotic lawn mower is a high-end model with the ability to mow up to two acres at a time and control it with your smartphone."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/lawnbott-lb300el-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:14Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
