The most notable feature of this company is its JetPak system, which allows you to choose and swap out the seat back jet in most models. This modular system, in addition to letting you customize your hot tub, also uses less plumbing and is more efficient than other spa models.","<strong>Pricing</strong>","Bullfrog Spas separates its pricing structure into three ranges: mid-tier, high-tier and luxury. Like other hot tub manufacturers, Bullfrog doesn’t list spa prices on its website, but it does break down which spa lines fall into each of its tiers. The X Series falls into the brand’s mid-tier range of $5,000 to $8,0000. The R Series fits into the High Tier, which ranges from $9,000 to $12,000. The Luxury Tier houses the A and STIL spas, which cost $13,000 to more than $18,000. ","<strong>Models</strong>","Bullfrog has 25 spa models across four product lines and fully-custom design options. Bullfrog’s naming convention for its models is easily decipherable. Take the A8L, for example. The first letter refers to the A Series. The 8 refers to the size of the tub, though this numberdoes not reference the number of seats in each tub. Models with the same second number have the same dimensions across model lines. The final letter refers to the type of available seating. Some models don’t have a letter, which means they have traditional seating. The L means the A8L has a lounge seat. ","The X Series is the company’s most economical option. It has seven models with fixed-configuration jets and does not use the JetPak system. Even so, the line offers a good variety of tubs from a small 3-seater to the Model X8, which seats up to eight adults. The R and A lines are fairly similar, though the A line tubs offer more JetPaks per tub, three more cabinet color options, better features and longer warranties. The R Series has seven models, and the A Series has nine, including the massive A9L, which seats eight and comes with seven JetPaks.  The STIL line has two models designed with a modern aesthetic. These hot tubs have clean lines, seat four to six people and include three JetPaks.","<strong>Features</strong>","Most Bullfrog spas are compatible with the JetPak system, which uses modular seat backs. There are 18 types of JetPak modules for A and R Series hot tubs and six options for the STIL line. Each module focuses on a certain problem area or type of massage, from the RainShower JetPak that has 42 gentle jets for an all-over massage to the high-intensity NeckMasseuse JetPak, which has 9 jets. Beyond the system’s unparalleled customization, the JetPaks also require less tubing than other types of hot tub jets, so there are fewer opportunities for leaks or malfunctions.","Bullfrog spas have all the standard and upgradeable features available with the best hot tub manufacturers, including audio systems, LED lighting, multiple shell and cabinet color options, waterfalls and sanitation system upgrades. Unlike <a href=\"/calspas-review\">Cal Spas</a>, Bullfrog Spas don’t have UV-C or salt water sanitation systems. Instead, the company uses the dual-filter Wellspring system that cycles through 100 percent of the water in your hot tub every filtration cycle. You can upgrade to a higher efficiency and quieter water pump, ozone sanitation or in-line sanitation systems. ","Certain Bullfrog models are compatible with the Cloud Control 2 app, which lets you integrate your hot tub into your smart home network. You can control your hot tub through your smartphone using the iOS or Android app. It also supports Google Home and Alexa integration."]},"id":"b6c50c85-8294-4f2b-bbfc-a0ee894aa63a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b0056100-6e17-4122-a2d6-7770ea346a43","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, Bullfrog is a great spa manufacturer for tailor-made spas without splurging on a fully-custom design.
