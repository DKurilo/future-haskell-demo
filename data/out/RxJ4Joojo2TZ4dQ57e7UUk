You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kenmore Elite 51072 has the space you need to store the food you love to eat. Kenmore utilizes all 26.5 cubic feet to provide you with a <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a> that will not only look great in your kitchen, but will be easy to clean and maintain for years to come.","If you have an older fridge, you may be all too familiar with frosted glass door bins or plastic bins. It is very easy for leftovers and half-used ingredients to be shoved to the back of the fridge, eventually causing odors. The right side of this refrigerator has an open concept, complete with clear shelves, crispers and door bins. Now you will never reach to the back of your fridge only to be surprised moldy casserole again.","The freezer has a total of 10.2 cubic feet and the refrigerator has 16.3 cubic feet, giving the unit an overall capacity of 26.5 cubic feet. The measurements of the Kenmore side by side are comparable to the majority of other side-by-side refrigerators on the market, so if you are replacing an existing side by side, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.","The freezer is the mother of all storage. The traditional side-by-side refrigerator has maybe three or four shelves in the freezer section. The Kenmore Elite 51072, however, has six. Six! Because there is so much wire shelving, however, you may find it difficult to store tall items. You can remedy this issue by carefully removing the wire racks from their positions. Once you are done storing the tall item, you can easily replace the shelf. The refrigerator section does not have six shelves, but instead has three shelves, four door bins, one deli snack drawer and two crisper bins.","You will find three icons on the control panel, one that will, when activated, dispense cubed ice, one that will provide crushed ice and the third supplies cold, filtered water. There is a single paddle that will deliver these materials, which seems to be the growing trend in newer side-by-side refrigerator models, replacing the two paddles.","The water and ice dispenser is located in the traditional spot in the middle of the left-hand freezer door. The ice maker, however, is moved off the top shelf in the freezer to the inside of the door. This frees up space and enables you to take advantage of the full 10.2 cubic feet of freezer space.","The control panel also has an Ultra Ice button, which drops the temperature in the freezer to its lowest to increase ice production.","This side-by-side refrigerator is very comparable to other refrigerators in its class when it comes to energy. The estimated yearly operating cost for the Kenmore Elite 51072 is $63, while the estimated yearly electricity use is 590 kilowatts. We just want to remind you that these numbers are just estimates, so your actual yearly cost may be different from this number due to several factors, including usage and local utility rates.","The Kenmore Elite 51072 live chat support was key to helping us find the information we needed during our research process. The representative was polite, patient, quick and willing to help and answer our questions. We had difficulty finding the user manual for this side-by-side refrigerator, but the chat representative provided us a link to the manual."]},"id":"9f8e5385-ca22-47d5-82a1-ef188290fc06","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54fd9ebe-bfac-49d5-b296-659d32039877","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore Elite 51072 does not have the newest techie gadgets and does not have as many cubic feet as our top-rated side-by-side refrigerators, but what it can offer is great.
