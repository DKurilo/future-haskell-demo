Luckily, Precision Medical’s PM4150 EasyPulse concentrator has the simplest interface of any on our list. A single knob lets you adjust your oxygen flow rate, and that’s it. A small LED screen tells you the battery level and alerts you if there’s an issue.","It weighs 6.8 pounds, which isn’t as light as the <a href=\"/inogen-review\">Inogen One G4</a> or the <a href=\"/caire-medical-review\">Caire Medical Airsep Focus</a>, but it’s still light enough to carry around by hand with its built-in handle or with the included carrying case. It measures 10.1 inches tall, 6.5 inches wide and 4.5 inches deep, so it is a manageable size, as well. It has a simple filter that’s easy to remove and clean whenever you need.","The best feature of this concentrator is its Controlled Minute Volume (CMV) technology, which provides you with a consistent amount of oxygen for each breath, but it also adjusts to your breath rate. With the device’s internal battery, you can get an average of 3 hours of run time, depending on your flow setting, but around 5 hours on the lowest setting. Otherwise, if you’re at home or somewhere with an outlet, you can use either an AC or DC power supply to power the device.","Running at an average of 44 decibels, which is equal to about a whisper, this oxygen concentrator is quiet. You won’t have to worry about the concentrator waking you up at night or causing any disturbances during the day, wherever you are.","For added portability, you can choose a carrying case in the form of either a shoulder sling bag or a backpack. Precision Medical also has a premium bag option that can provide extra protection for the concentrator against damage or the elements, which is handy if you travel frequently. Additionally, the PM4150 EasyPulse is FAA approved, meaning you can take it with you on a flight.","With Precision Medical’s PM4150 EasyPulse oxygen concentrator, you can get the right amount of oxygen no matter your activity level. Its lightweight design, built-in handle and carrying case make it easy to take the device with you anywhere, and its decent battery life can keep up with your lifestyle."]},"id":"804678df-16f6-499c-b57a-884bc2d4738f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68650","url":"/precision-medical-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alexander-eriksen","url":"/author/alexander-eriksen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Alexander Eriksen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"hwemruvZsTXWMqRixKJ49","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T20:46:07Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T20:46:07Z","name":"Precision Medical PM4150 EasyPulse","synopsis":"Using a portable oxygen concentrator can be stressful enough at times, and you may not want to deal with the hassle of navigating an unnecessarily complex interface.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Using a portable oxygen concentrator can be stressful enough at times, and you may not want to deal with the hassle of navigating an unnecessarily complex interface.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-28T20:46:07Z","id":"Wvmp3vNefSVMjUwnhBwHoA","meta":{"title":"Precision Medical PM4150 EasyPulse Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Precision Medical&#8217;s PM4150 EasyPulse automatically adjusts to your breathing rate, and it has a simple interface.
