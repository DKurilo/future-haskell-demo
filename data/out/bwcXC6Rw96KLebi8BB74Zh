The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Whirlpool Duet Steam WFW88HEAC front-loading washer finds itself toward the lower end of our front-load washer reviews, but it does have a 4.3-cubic-foot capacity washtub, which may just help you cut down on the amount of laundry you do, making it a worthy option to consider.","This Whirlpool Duet Steam front-load washer is Energy Star rated and is estimated to cost you just $12 to operate every year, consuming an estimated 112-kilowatt hours. Additionally, it boasts an EcoBoost option, which gives you even more energy efficiency by lowering the wash and rinse temperature and increasing the tumbling without sacrificing wash performance.","Despite missing a few wash cycles we generally like to see on a front-load washer, Whirlpool includes 11 wash cycles on this front-load washing machine, which is sufficient. However, it only has five wash options, which we are disappointed to see. Additionally, you get four soil levels and four wash and rinse temperatures to choose from for each load of laundry you do. Of the 11 wash cycles it includes, we were happy to see an allergen, sanitize, quick-wash and cold-wash cycle included.","We are impressed with this washer’s Precision Dispense feature that ensures the entire load of laundry has been treated by the detergent before it starts the cycle. This helps to treat stubborn stains and heavily soiled laundry. Additionally, if you select the PreSoak option, it will add additional time for soaking. You can select up to an eight-hour time frame, and the wash cycle you selected will immediately begin after the selected soak time completes. You can also add steam to many of the cycles to tackle stubborn stains if you don’t want to use the PreSoak option.","We also like the six-hour TumbleFresh option that is included on this front-load washing machine. When selected, you don’t need to stress about moving the laundry from the washer to the dryer right away because this option will continually tumble the load every so often, keeping the clothes fresh for up to six hours.","Whirlpool falls short on the warranty that it offers consumers who purchase this front-load washer. You only get a single year of coverage all around with this appliance; there is no additional coverage for the motor or washtub, which we tend to see included with other front-load washers.","You can contact Whirlpool by phone, live chat on its website or fill out an online contact form on the Whirlpool website to have the manufacturer contact you via email for support. Whirlpool also makes this product’s user manual and some FAQs available on its website for you to reference at any time."]},"id":"5b062fc1-9260-46b7-b597-5903d248fa89","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"685b9f1e-693b-41d4-8df4-5283b3a353df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Duet Steam WFW88HEAC front-loading washer boasts a large capacity washtub, a sufficient amount of wash cycles and a few attractive features.
