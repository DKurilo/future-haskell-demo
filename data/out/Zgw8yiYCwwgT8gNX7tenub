A window cleaning robot usually cleans a whole window from edge to edge, alerting you when it&#39;s finished.","<a href=\"/best-robot-vacuums\">Robotic</a> window cleaners combine automated movement with window cleaning technology, and they usually stick to windows using motor-powered suction. Once stuck to a window, they can automatically clean the window from edge to edge, allowing you to clean high, out-of-reach windows. Window washing robots like the <a href=\"#Winbot\">Winbot 730</a> and <a href=\"#Hobot\">Hobot 168</a> offer automated window cleaning on most types of windows, including high ones.","While most window washing robots offer the same general features, some provide different functions, cleaning methods and height restrictions.","<strong>Robotic Window Cleaners: What to Look For</strong>","The features you need will depend on how much window surface you want to clean at once. You should also consider whether you want a purely automated robot or one with a remote control, as well as how long you want the robot to run between charges. The following features are all considerations to keep in mind.","<strong>Battery Life<br/></strong>Most window cleaning robots have a short battery life that allows them to clean 10 or more windows on a single charge. This might mean you get a battery life of less than 15 minutes or over 30 minutes depending on the model. The more windows you have in your home, the more valuable a longer battery life is. However, models with longer batteries usually cost more.","<strong>Suction or Magnetic Connectivity<br/></strong>There are two main types of connectivity found in robot window cleaners: magnetic connectivity and motor-powered suction. Magnetic connectivity usually requires you to attach a second magnetic piece on the opposite side of the window, which may be difficult in some cases. Motor-powered suction is more convenient because you only have to place the window washing robot on the window. However, this type of connection might sometimes fail, so you need a safety cord to keep the window cleaning robot from falling.","<strong>Cleaning Process<br/></strong>Most window washing robots use cleaning pads or brushes to clean, but many also use a drying feature such as a squeegee to ensure that the window is streak free. The number of brushes and pads can vary depending on the model. You might also have to fill the model up with a window cleaning fluid before putting it out. A two-step cleaning process usually involves wiping away dirt and then polishing the window. Some also feature brushes for cleaning other surfaces, such as shower walls, doors and mirrors.","<strong>Remote Controls &amp; Automated Cleaning<br/></strong>Window washing robots come with both automated cleaning options and remote controls. While not all options include both, automation allows you the convenience of sitting back while your windows are cleaned. A remote control enables you to steer the robot around the window. Some models include both control options for versatility, allowing you to choose.","While there are several robotic window cleaners available, you can choose yours by deciding what you want it to do and finding the features that suit your needs.

It uses a three-phase cleaning process with cleaning pads and cleaning fluid to wipe off dirt and then a squeegee to dry the surface to prevent streaks and then wipes the surface down with a clean pad. The three-part cleaning process mimics the cleaning process most human cleaners use. However, it may leave streaks if the cleaning pads are dirty. While the window washing robot cleans large windows, it does not work with windows that are smaller than 18 inches wide and 24 inches tall. This is because the sensors allow it to run at least that far before stopping. The automatic sensors allow it to detect edgeless windows and window edges so that it cleans to the end of the window and no further. You can also use the included remote control to steer and control the robot as needed. The battery lasts for approximately 15 minutes, or enough time to clean up to six medium to large size windows.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/9895/why-buy-a-robot-2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fq2SbLHgYcGfMnY9y4haY.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"5fq2SbLHgYcGfMnY9y4haY","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fq2SbLHgYcGfMnY9y4haY.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b2234bc4-04ae-424d-84e4-9eacb496c0ec","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/iQwCkDc95UrgSjSiLWcJM5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":" suction off by flipping a switch so that you can remove the robot from the window.
