It comes with a single 200-pound weight stack, making it an ideal workout companion for one person. The durable design is what you&#39;d expect of BodyCraft, and that, complemented with its lifetime warranty, make this a device worth looking at."]},"id":"3048c5f5-dd37-4122-b6bc-f45ab2969766","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/bF8GBHyPaCe8tv2hRFSRQ8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57291-bodycraft-xpress-pro1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bF8GBHyPaCe8tv2hRFSRQ8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"bF8GBHyPaCe8tv2hRFSRQ8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bF8GBHyPaCe8tv2hRFSRQ8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f323a6e1-e1f7-4a24-b545-966bbce7f2dc","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BodyCraft Xpress Pro makes use of high-, mid- and low-level pulleys to deliver a full body workout. The addition of attachments like a leg press, while helpful in adding exercise positions, does cost extra. This home gym equipment is among the more expensive options, but between the warranty and the extensive capabilities of the machine, it&#39;s a good value in the long term.","It takes up less space than most other home exercise equipment manufactured by BodyCraft, yet even then it allows for a wide range of exercises comparable to larger setups. Many owners like how the BodyCraft Xpress Pro includes the ability to perform user-defined motion in the cable arms.","This is one of the best gym equipment setups out there. Not only are the cable arms quite diverse in and of themselves to perform more than 50 exercises in just one station, but the device also has a doubling 2:1 feature for benching as much as 400 pounds. The unit also comes with an exercise chart to show the many different ways you can use it, in addition to a workout DVD to help in better structuring your exercise sessions and maximizing results.","The only downside to the BodyCraft Xpress Pro, apart from the lengthy assembly process, is the 83-inch height of the unit. If your home gym is located in a room with a low ceiling, then it will prove quite problematic to fit this machine into the room.","The BodyCraft Xpress Pro, while pricey home fitness equipment, proves much more functional than many other options in terms of core lifts and free weight training. It’s much more compact than other models and still maintains its versatility in providing a full body workout."]},"id":"19b85631-0411-457e-9b4d-c7d52c9da1f2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57319","url":"/bodycraft-xpress-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-27T12:54:33Z","datePublished":"2013-08-27T12:54:33Z","name":"BodyCraft Xpress Pro","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-08-27T12:54:33Z","id":"QzPpDk7hN33ezc7cnP8Sj","meta":{"title":"BodyCraft Xpress Pro Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The BodyCraft Xpress Pro is a compact, albeit comprehensive home gym.
