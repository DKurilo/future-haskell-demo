There are other scoring models that lenders use, but FICO tends to be the most standard. So using myFICO gives you a firsthand look at what your lenders are seeing.","We reviewed the FICO Ultimate 3B plan that includes <a href=\"/best-credit-report-services\">reports and scores</a> from the three bureaus and some identity protection tools. One drawback of this plan is the cost. It costs $29.95 a month to get access to your scores. There’s a one-bureau plan that provides reports from <a href=\"/experian-review\">Experian</a> and costs $19.95 a month. You can receive a monthly score report from all three bureaus for $39.95 a month.","We prefer services that give you access to all three bureau reports. This gives you a more complete look at your credit. Each of the bureaus includes different items on your reports, so seeing all of them in one place can help you spot errors and send disputes.","FICO provides quarterly credit reports, which is not as frequent as some of the other services we reviewed. Still, most people only check once or twice a year, so having more frequent access lets you spot any discrepancies.","One drawback of using FICO for your credit reports is that it doesn’t offer a credit score simulator. This is a useful tool for estimating the impact that getting a new loan or paying off an existing one can have on your scores.","FICO allows you to send disputes directly through the dashboard, which is a helpful time-saver and simplifies what can be a complicated process. You’ll receive notifications about any changes in your credit and if any new accounts have been opened. These alerts can be sent by text or email.","Signing up for the FICO 3B Ultimate package also gives you access to some identity theft protection. This includes monitoring of personal information and help with identity restoration if your identity is compromised. This protection doesn’t include children though, so if you have a family and are concerned about your child’s identity being used for fraud, which is becoming increasingly common, you may want to look for a service with more robust ID protection features."]},"id":"a048ad7d-7254-4479-a985-30b8839fd22e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e846a4e-a719-4a87-86ce-780a3ad4bb06","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["FICO is one of the most standard scoring models used by lenders, so getting insight into your score is invaluable.
