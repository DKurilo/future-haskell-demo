You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP Omni 27 is an all-in-one PC that lets you condense all the wires and devices of a larger system into one simple computer unit. While the display doesn&#39;t equal that of more powerful all-in-one PCs or an iMac, you will appreciate the large 1920 x 1080 display resolution because it gives you enough space to multitask with ease. With such a large screen, we expected higher performance marks, but the specs of this PC are just average.","On a performance level, this computer sits at the industry average. The model we reviewed featured a 2nd generation i5 processor that runs at a speed of 2.5GHz. It&#39;s only a dual-core processor, and we recommend upgrading to the third generation processors, which are all quad- core and can be an essential upgrade for the computer&#39;s multimedia performance.","There is an integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics card inside the Omni 27, which means you can view quality videos such a Blu-rays on the screen; however, running high-end programs that feature in-depth graphics will cause the system to overheat and even lag. We tried playing some graphics-heavy games on the computer and had to use the lowest settings for the graphics to get the system to run without any type of lag. You can choose to upgrade the graphics card, along with any of the other internal components.","One of the best parts of this all-in-one computer is its audio capabilities. The speakers, featuring Beats Audio, are located on the bottom of the computer. Even though they are built into the computer, every song we listened to sounded crisp. We tested a few bass-heavy songs as well, and even at medium volume, we could hear the bass clearly. This PC also includes a Blu-ray player, no upgrade necessary.","There is a two-year warranty on all parts and repairs, including any damage that happens to the screen. HP offers several ways to get in contact with the company, including online chat. We found their assistance quick and efficient, plus we waited less than a minute to talk to a representative using the online chat feature."," "]},"id":"e069b2a2-2ba5-45fa-9456-65a50c6a21e4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"11328432-cf36-4db8-8efe-d6cb2aae157c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Omni 27 from HP is an all-in-one computer meant for basic computing, multitasking and the occasional high-definition movie.
