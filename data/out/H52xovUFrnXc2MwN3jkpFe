They’ve come a long way in the past 100 years, helping families along the way. One of their more recent kitchen appliances is the West Bend TEM4500. If you thought toasters were limited to toasting bread, you’ll be blown away by the TEM4500. Four large slots, easy-to-use settings and an attachment for cooking eggs are just a few of this toaster’s built-in extras. Imagine eating a restaurant-quality egg sandwich every morning for breakfast, and you’ll get a brief glimpse at this toaster’s possibilities."]},"id":"a26797bf-9954-457a-89f6-dfd2c28763e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"f3c06b60-8174-4821-9132-c62f2f410cda","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Eating a good breakfast is not convenient, but the fact is, skipping the first meal of the day isn’t good for you. The West Bend TEM4500 toaster takes the pain out of making breakfast by basically doing it for you. Pop a slice of toast in one of the four slots, place an egg in the heating tray, and in a few minutes you’ll have the makings of a delicious breakfast sandwich. This hypothetical meal is just one example of the many different ways to take advantage of the TEM4500’s cooking functions.","The 4-slice toaster comes with all of the accessories and specific instructions in the operator’s manual to poach, scramble or hard-boil an egg (soft, medium or hard). The instructions indicate how much water to use for cooking up to eight eggs, and they also tell you how to get different egg consistencies. You can cook hard-boiled, scrambled and poached eggs in the TEM4500 in less than five minutes. There is even a warming tray where you can heat up pre-cooked meats to go with your eggs and bread. The included user manual also has recipes for other delicious breakfast ideas.","Many toasters on the market settle for two small slots that each fit a piece of thin toast. Not the Egg &amp; Muffin toaster. Four large toaster slots grace the top of the appliance. These slots are large enough to comfortably fit sliced bread, bagels, English muffins, frozen waffles and even croissants. Four toaster slots means this toaster can also easily make enough for your hungry family in one or two toast cycles. The manufacturers don&#39;t recommend toasting pastries with a filling inside. The filling can easily drip into the appliance, ruining the heating coils and potentially starting a fire. Stick with a nice slice of bread or a thick croissant."]},"id":"73dc3fcc-ea93-4e7f-ab63-c54e2beabb5f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"538db225-2636-4eed-be22-e01480623d5e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Burnt bread is a common result of using a lesser toaster, especially one with a limited shade selector. You do not need to worry about carbonizing your bread with the West Bend Egg &amp; Muffin Toaster. It has not one, but two different shade selectors that control both sides of the toaster. This means you can personalize the shade settings for different preferences. The selector is a dial that can be turned to one of eight different shade selections.","If you&#39;re toasting a bagel, take advantage of the toaster’s specific bagel setting. Most toasters will cook a bagel just as they would a normal slice of toast; however, the Egg &amp; Muffin Toaster treats a bagel differently. When on the bagel setting, place your bagel in with the cut side facing the inside coils. The toaster will heat the coils facing the cut side to a higher setting than the other side, warming the outside and toasting the inside. To defrost a frozen slice of bread, select the defrost button and toast bread like normal. The defrost setting adds 30 seconds to whatever your shade selection may be.","When you&#39;re cooking eggs, no matter the style, the egg button must be illuminated. The heating tray will cook the eggs in accordance with the amount of water you&#39;ve used, and unless the egg control button is illuminated, the tray will not warm up.  The process was confusing to us at first, but the key is to remember that the water level controls the way the egg cooks, not the buttons.","To coordinate the cook time of both your egg and toast, use the egg/toast control button. When this button is illuminated, the bread will toast according to your set preferences, but will stay warm in the toaster until the eggs are done cooking. When your eggs are done, the toast will pop up like normal and the appliance will turn off. Both the bagel and defrost settings can also be used simultaneously when cooking eggs. At any time during a toast cycle, you can press the cancel button to terminate any process."]},"id":"06e746a9-1ef0-4ea1-b0c6-9f99f34f157e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"7a356fa0-13d0-43d3-9f6b-f00026149e29","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Egg &amp; Muffin Toaster is impressive in many ways, it is lacking somewhat in our features criterion.

However, despite the lack, this toaster has the essential features that the best toasters offer. For safety, a hide-away cord area is located on the bottom of the appliance. This allows you to minimize the cord’s length when the toaster is in use, and you can wrap the cord up and store it when you&#39;re not using the appliance. A removable crumb tray is also located under the unit, offering a quick and easy way to clean the toaster.
