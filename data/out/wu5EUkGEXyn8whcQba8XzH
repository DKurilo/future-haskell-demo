Fraud takes many forms, but retail businesses are especially vulnerable since employees regularly handle money and facilitate transactions.","Nearly half of retail losses due to employee fraud are related to billing schemes, skimming, check tampering or register disbursements. While having a <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">reputable credit card processing company</a> with PCI compliance and upgrading to EMV-compliant equipment can prevent many types of credit card fraud, your weakest link in your business&#39;s security may be the people you hired.","According to the ACFE, 87 percent of employees who engage in fraud have never been charged or convicted, and 84 percent have never been punished or fired for fraudulent conduct. These employees don&#39;t fit the profile you&#39;d expect: The highest percentage are in their 30s or 40s, college educated and have been with the company for one to five years.","So even though background checks are important, they don&#39;t guarantee immunity from internal theft. For this reason, it&#39;s vital that you know the types of employee credit card fraud and what to you can do to prevent it.","<strong>Common Types of Employee-Based Credit Card Fraud</strong>","Employee credit card fraud is difficult to detect because as members of your staff, they have inside knowledge of your processes, access to your systems and your trust. Here are five common ways employees engage in credit card fraud:","<strong>•\tUsing a card skimmer. </strong>A skimmer is a small, handheld electronic device that copies information from the magnetic stripe on a credit card. Employees then use the card information to create counterfeit credit cards or to make unauthorized purchases.<br/><strong>•\tPocketing credit card numbers.</strong> Employees keep receipts or copy card numbers and use them to make unauthorized purchases.<br/><strong>•\tIssuing credit to their own cards.</strong> Employees use the point-of-sale system to run credit transactions and apply the credits to their own credit cards, thereby moving money from the employer&#39;s merchant account to their own.<br/><strong>•\tUsing business credit cards for personal expenses.</strong> An example of this would be an employee who uses the company fuel card to purchase gas for his or her personal vehicle.<br/><strong>•\tDouble dipping.</strong> Employees who have company credit cards may charge something on the card and submit both the statement and a second reimbursement request in order to receive two reimbursements for a single purchase.","<strong>How to Detect Employee Fraud</strong>","It&#39;s no surprise that the longer employee fraud goes undetected, the more it costs you. Vigilance is key to preventing and curtailing fraud. Here are some clues that may indicate internal fraud is occurring at your business:","•\tDeposits aren&#39;t made according to schedule<br/>•\tThe amounts on internal deposit records don&#39;t match the deposit receipts from the bank<br/>•\tCredit card receipts are consistently lost<br/>•\tCustomers complain about payments not being properly applied to their accounts; for example, if a customer pays in full but only a portion of the payment is applied to the account<br/>•\tDecrease in profits while sales are still steady<br/>•\tDecrease in credit card payment volume when other types of payment are steady<br/>•\tDecrease in incoming cash volume while other types of payment are steady<br/>•\tCard readers look different than before, especially on ATMs or gas pumps. Perhaps the reader seems slightly ajar or the faceplate looks larger. This could be a sign that a skimmer has been installed.","<strong>How to Prevent or Combat Employee Credit Card Fraud</strong>","The following nine tips can help you protect your business against internal credit card fraud:","<strong>1.\tUpgrade to EMV technology. </strong>EMV-compliant equipment protects you from incurring liability resulting from counterfeit fraud that occurs at your point of sale. Many retailers are hesitant to upgrade their equipment due to the expense, but EMV chip readers make it more difficult for thieves to capture credit card data. <br/><strong>2.\tEstablish an open-door policy and a climate of trust between employees and management.</strong> According to the ACFE, 38 percent of whistleblowers reported suspected fraud to their direct supervisors or company executives. Having an atmosphere of trust where employees can approach management with problems, especially something as volatile as suspected fraud, can help your business catch thieves earlier on.<br/><strong>3.\tKnow your employees.</strong> The ACFE lists several red flags that may indicate employees may be stealing from the company. The top two signs are employees spending beyond their means and, alternately, having financial difficulties. Unusually close association with a vendor or customer, having a wheeler-dealer attitude and being unwilling to share duties are also signs to watch for.<br/><strong>4.\tPassword-protect your accounting and POS software. </strong>Use administrative controls to assign specific functions to only the employees who need them. Also password-protect all sensitive features, particularly the credit function. Change your passwords regularly and teach employees to protect their own passwords. <br/><strong>5.\tHave checks and balances built in to your procedures. </strong>If you personally aren&#39;t approving all expenses, split these duties between two people. Although it may not be as efficient, it decreases the chance that an employee will give into temptation to &#34;borrow&#34;  from the accounts.<br/><strong>6.\tKeep on top of your accounts. </strong>Reconcile your accounts daily. Have someone other than the employee in charge of accounts review the monthly statement. Conduct regular internal audits, including a few surprise ones. <br/><strong>7.\tAvoid double dipping. </strong>Establish a set procedure for reimbursements. You can either allow employees to submit expense receipts for reimbursement, or they can use the company card, but not both.<br/><strong>8.\tTeach employees to recognize signs of credit card fraud. </strong>Employees should know how to tell if a credit card terminal on the countertop, ATM or gas pump has been tampered with. They should know how to recognize a stolen card and how to handle a Code 10, which alerts the card network to possible credit card fraud. All the major credit card companies have procedures on how to handle such situations; learn them.<br/><strong>9.\tLet employees know your fraud prevention procedures.</strong> One of the biggest deterrents to employee credit card fraud is simply knowing that people are watching, are aware and will report fraudulent activity if necessary."]},"id":"65dc0aa3-0e32-437a-bbb9-1b04bdda1107","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Bottom Line: Vigilance is Key"},"id":"78b882ac-0867-42df-aa22-14aef0b97a62","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Internal theft can happen in the best of companies; even among family businesses, which is why it&#39;s important to keep a close eye on your accounts and on employee behavior.
