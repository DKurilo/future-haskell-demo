You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","ID Armor is an <a href=\"/best-identity-theft-protection-services\">identity theft protection service</a> that focuses mainly on the credit bureaus&#39; reports. Instead of keeping track of whether people are using your personal information on the internet, it establishes a fraud alert with the three credit bureaus. By doing this, you receive notification if anyone, including you, applies for credit with your social security number or other personal information.","By setting a fraud alert status through the credit bureaus, you can monitor your name, telephone number, email address, social security number and credit card information. Although you pay a monthly fee, this company doesn&#39;t actually monitor your data.","By having a fraud alert status on your credit report, creditors will have to take additional steps to approve loans, open lines of credit and more. Additionally, you&#39;ll receive less junk mail because the credit bureaus won&#39;t sell your data to credit card companies that send you preapproved credit card offers in the mail. You can obtain greater identity protection if you don&#39;t receive these types of offers through the mail.","ID Armor gives you an annual credit report from the three credit bureaus. However, you don&#39;t need a membership with this identity theft service in order to receive these. According to federal law, you can receive a free annual credit report with data from all three credit bureaus.","ID Armor doesn&#39;t provide recovery assistance. It doesn&#39;t freeze your accounts if there&#39;s suspicious behavior or contact your banking institution if someone takes off with your wallet. It doesn&#39;t keep track of your medical records, driver&#39;s license data or vehicle license plate either.","ID Armor has an unlimited service guarantee. If someone commits fraud with your information while you&#39;re using and complying with the ID Armor service, ID Armor will reimburse you for any fees you pay for professional assistance. However, ID Armor must approve the professional help you receive in order to reimburse you. To contact this fraud prevention and identity theft protection service, you can call the company or send an email. The only way you can sign up for the service is through the website."]},"id":"50da6312-63b4-4397-a0aa-1e8c82c9824e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"980df62c-04d5-4171-aecb-33495fe15190","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ID Armor provides minimal monitoring options, but it&#39;s also a relatively inexpensive service.
