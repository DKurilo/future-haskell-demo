While we did not test these products ourselves, we read manufacturer specifications and online user reviews to learn as much as we could about each model. During out research, we noted any common problems or unexpected perks users encountered with their own machines.","As we chose machines to compare, we focused on variety and opted to compare foot massagers that are many different sizes and offer many types of massages. The massagers we chose also range from basic inexpensive models to more expensive luxury products. After we decided which models to include, we compared them to see which ones offer the best options overall.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We spent over 25 hours evaluating 10 foot massagers to determine which are most convenient and have the most massage settings as well as what massage techniques they use. Products that offer more settings scored higher. For instance, foot massagers with multiple intensity settings and massage types did better than machines that only have one option. The <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/foothealth.html\">National Library of Medicine</a> has some helpful information and suggestions in addition to massage to help keep your feet healthy.","Since the machines we chose are vastly different from each other, we did not score them based on the massage technique they use. Additionally, price was not a factor into our rankings, though we do note where each massager falls on the price scale in its review.","We took each machine‘s dimensions into account since it determines what foot sizes it accomodates. Larger models scored higher since their size makes them useful for more people. Foot massagers are unavoidably bulky, so we also gave points to devices that are easy to carry and take up less space.","As with any kind of machine, we also took the warranty into account. Some of these foot massagers have warranties, but others do not. We gave more points to products that are covered for longer periods.","Some products are easier to keep clean than others. For instance, foot massagers with removable, machine-washable foot sleeves scored higher than products that weren&#39;t as easy to clean. ","<strong>How to Massage</strong>","No matter what foot massager you use, there are numerous pressure points you should pay attention to while using it. If you&#39;re using hand-held massager, start by rolling it over the ball of your foot in slow circles. Move to the arch and the heel gradually, feeling for the spots that respond best. If you practice reflexology, you&#39;ll be told there are specific spots on the bottom of your feet that correspond to the organs and other parts of your body. Stimulating these specific spots with a foot massager can have a positive effect on the corresponding organ or body part, according to practitioners.","For example, the ball of your foot corresponds with your heart, so massaging that part of your foot is thought to help cardiovascular issues. Your nose corresponds to the outer edge of your big toe, the lymph nodes correspond to the area right below where your toes become your foot, and the kidney corresponds to what is almost the exact center of the ball of your foot. There are many varied versions of reflexology body maps available online via a simple Google search.","<br/>If you’re using a mechanized massager, sit in a comfortable chair with your feet in the device. These machines automatically find pressure points and massage them. This can be really beneficial if you don’t want to have to think at all about how your foot is being massaged, but if you have sensitive spots, you’ll want to go with a device you can manually use yourself.","<strong>Things to Consider When Choosing a Foot Massager</strong>","There are many different types of foot massagers, and what you need depends on your intensity preferences and how often you plan to use the machine. Here are a few things to consider before making your decision.","Massaging Action<br/>Some foot massagers are simply built for relaxation, while others are built to be rigorous muscle-healing machines. Typically, foot spa massagers are on the gentler side, using bubbles and manual tools to provide a simple massage. Machines that have nodes and engulf your feet – and sometimes calves – tend to offer a variety of intensity settings. They also tend to use more deep-tissue, muscle-healing massage techniques like Shiatsu or Tui na.","Size<br/>You need a massager that is wide and long enough to accommodate your feet. Unfortunately, many of these devices don’t fit larger feet. If you have large feet, you should consider getting an open-ended massager, since they are more likely to accommodate them.","These machines are all decently bulky and take up a few feet of space. Massagers with more gears and nodes also weigh more. Still, the best massagers are designed to easily store away and feature a handle to make it easier to do so.","Additional Features<br/>Machines like foot spas use water to massage and relax your feet, and they also tend to come with pedicure kits. Some massagers work your entire calf along with your foot, while others only focus on the soles of your feet. Typically, the adjustment buttons are located on the top of the machine so they are easy to reach, but you have to bend down to make any changes. The best machines can also do heated massages to help circulate your blood and relax your muscles further.","Price<br/>We researched foot massagers and foot spas ranging in price from under $25 to $799. Devices under $100 provide a basic massage or soak designed for relaxation.
