You can use this sound editor to record a single audio file, which works great for podcasts but not so well for recording live bands. This software is fairly simple to use, and it&#39;s a good place for the novice audio engineer to begin.","When you open Sound Studio 4, the toolbar atop your wave editor is fairly empty. You can customize the toolbar to look any way you&#39;d like, and you can add as many tools and icons as you want. This helps you create the workflow that works best for you.","This sound editing software for Mac doesn&#39;t have any tools to remove unwanted hum from your audio recordings. If you have a noisy air duct that is humming in the background of one of your recordings, it will be difficult to successfully remove the noise from your recording.","You can connect a microphone to your computer and record using a USB microphone or an audio interface. Unlike <a href=\"/adobe-audition-review\">Adobe Audition</a>, Sound Studio cannot record more than one audio source at a time, which means it doesn&#39;t have multi-tracking capabilities. This software is more for recording podcasts than live-band tracking.","You can use this audio editing software for Mac to extract audio data from video files and edit the sound. We tested each program with seven different video files, and Sound Studio 4 was able to extract audio data from M4V, MOV and MPG video files. It was unable to extract audio files from DIVX, DV and WMV video files.","Sound Studio 4 doesn&#39;t have the audio cleanup and multi-tracking tools that other audio editors boast, but you can customize your toolbar so you can edit the way you want. This software is a good place for a beginner audio editor to start.","This Mac audio software gives you the flexibility to edit, save and export a wide variety of file formats. You won&#39;t have to worry about running into compatibility issues with OGG, FLAC or M4A file formats, as Sound Studio can import and edit them."]},"id":"2c813654-2281-4a15-a1cc-8d89697d9419","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69325","url":"/sound-studio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-23T14:13:12Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T14:13:12Z","name":"Sound Studio 4","synopsis":"Sound Studio 4 is an audio editor with a customizable toolbar and plenty of editing tools.
