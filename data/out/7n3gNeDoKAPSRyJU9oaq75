The reviewers at Top Ten Reviewers spend an average of five hours a day typing up notes, reviews and other materials for our website. That means we’re using a keyboard for more than half of the work day, so we know a thing or two about what makes a good keyboard and mouse.","Our reviewers have been testing various wireless keyboard and mouse setups since 2011. Because we spend so much time at our desks, our reviewers know what they like in a keyboard – whether it’s portability or quiet keys. Keyboard preferences differ from person to person, but because so many of our reviewers help test these products, we have a wide range of feedback to work within recommending the best keyboard overall. Wireless keyboard and mouse combos are a great way to upgrade your computer experience.","<strong>How We Tested</strong><br/> <br/>In 2017, we spent about 25 hours letting a dozen of our reviewers use the newest models to see which ones worked the best and which ones didn’t. To gauge how comfortable each keyboard was, our reviewers used each of the wireless keyboards and their mice for an extended period of time. Comfort is subjective but we used an accumulation of our reviewers&#39; ratings and averaged them to get a good idea of which models were best for most people.","We also had our reviewers do the same with the mice to find which ones fit the best in both large and small hands. We wanted to make to find the best devices for all kinds of users. We also tested each mouse on different surfaces: wood, laminate, glass, marble and even carpet and denim. Each mouse was used to trace a test pattern and any time the mouse lagged, jumped or stopped responding, we accounted for it. We tested each mouse five times to eliminate any discrepancies during the test and then averaged out the number of lags, jumps and stops that occurred during every test.","<strong>What to Consider When Buying a Wireless Keyboard and Mouse </strong>","Price<br/>Many wireless keyboard and mouse combos cost between $20 and $50. Sets in this price range offer a great mix of economy, performance and comfort, even if you spend several hours a day at your computer. Because so many products fall into this price range, it’s important to shop for features you need, such as a wrist rest or rechargeable mouse. Also consider the cost of batteries, as most products use AA or AAA batteries that last six months to a year, on average.","Comfort<br/>One of the most important features for a keyboard and mouse is comfort, though this is subjective. Some people prefer a wavy keyboard or one that splits the keys up into definitive left and right sections for each hand. Some prefer a standard keyboard with the rows in straight lines.","The wireless mouse should be comfortable to use as well as responsive. There are three main grips for a mouse – palm, fingertip and claw. The most common type is the palm grip, where your palm generally rests on the arch of the mouse. Fingertip mice are shaped so only your fingertips touch the mouse. They are generally slender, highly portable devices. Claw grips are shaped so the heel of your palm rests on the back of the mouse. This leaves your fingers hovering over the buttons like a claw.","Key Switches<br/>The mechanisms under the keys that send the signal from the keyboard to the computer are called key switches. The type of key switch directly affects the feel, performance and longevity of your keyboard.","There are three main types of key switches – dome, scissor and mechanical. Rubber-dome (or silicon) key switches are exactly what they sound like – little rubber domes under the keys. These switches make the impact of the key feel soft as you press down and were the most common switch on keyboards we tested. The key also has to be pressed down all the way in order for the keystroke to register. For the speed-demon typists, this can lead to fewer words per minute. However, the main problem with rubber-dome keys is longevity. Over time, the soft rubber dome becomes brittle and will eventually fail.","Scissor switches are synonymous with laptop keyboards and the like – the low-profile chiclet keys. Given the low profile, the key doesn&#39;t have to be pressed completely for the key to fire, resulting in speedier typing for most people. They also tend to have a longer life than dome key switches.","Mechanical switches are the most responsive and don&#39;t need to be pressed as far as domed switches, which allows for faster typing speeds. The responsiveness can be a blessing and a curse. It can lead to faster typing speeds but more errors due to the sensitivity. Also, mechanical keys can be noisier than the other two switch styles.","Your Mouse<br/>There are two wireless mouse technologies – Bluetooth and radio frequency (RF). Functionally, both wireless technologies send signals over the same 2.4GHz frequency. The major difference is the RF mouse requires that you plug in a USB that communicates with your computer. The advantage of this is that you can use it with any computer that has a USB port. A Bluetooth mouse only works with computers that recognize Bluetooth devices, which most computers can do.","Most Bluetooth mice use standard AA or AAA batteries which give you between six months and a year of battery life. You may want to consider a rechargeable Bluetooth mouse which will have a shorter battery life but you won’t risk your mouse dying when you’re out of batteries. Some mice also have additional buttons you can program for specific functions like copying and pasting text.","The sensitivity of a mouse depends on the optical resolution of the laser. The higher the resolution, the more responsive the cursor. This makes a mouse excellent for scenarios like creating graphic art. However, high resolutions also result in more lagging when you&#39;re moving the mouse quickly across your computer screen. So, for common tasks where cursor accuracy isn&#39;t critical to the activity, such as browsing the internet or selecting tiles within Excel, a lower resolution is better.","You’ll want to note the optical resolution on whatever laser mouse you choose to make sure it will work well for your tasks. You can usually adjust the sensitivity somewhat, but not by a lot.","Portability<br/>A huge perk of wireless keyboard and mouse sets is portability, so size and weight are important considerations if you’re planning to transport your mouse and keyboard frequently. Fingertip-hold mouse style tends to be the most compact. They’re ideal for travel and convenience, but not always the most comfortable for an extended period of time.","Keyboards with scissor-switch keys or chiclet keys are also ideal for portability, while mechanical keyboards and ergonomic keyboards are heavier and bulkier. Look for the presence of a right-side numerical keypad. These are great for data entry, but add unnecessary length to your keyboard. Most often, the row of numbers above the letter keys suffices for most applications.","There are plenty of interesting, if gimmicky, keyboards designed for portability as well. Chinese company Royole, which specializes in flexible tech, showed off its super thin transparent, roll-up keyboard at CES 2019. The concept of rollable keyboards isn’t entirely new, however, since flexible silicone keyboards aren’t a new concept.","Wireless Keyboards and Mice for Gaming<br/>Though convenient for their portability for normal office work, wireless keyboards and mice have a few disadvantages compared to wired peripherals when it comes to gaming. Wireless peripherals sometimes cause lag due to random un-syncing, poor connection or interference, and they are generally less responsive than wired devices. With a wireless device you also run the risk of batteries dying on you mid-game."]},"id":"ffa9364a-7659-4636-9290-0a504ebd573b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_187","url":"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-10T19:16:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-10T19:16:00Z","name":"Best Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combos of 2019","synopsis":"With a wireless mouse and keyboard, you can get rid of bulky cords that clutter up your workspace and keep you trapped at your desk.","review":{},"strapline":"With a wireless mouse and keyboard, you can get rid of bulky cords that clutter up your workspace and keep you trapped at your desk.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-14T20:55:16Z","id":"7n3gNeDoKAPSRyJU9oaq75","meta":{"title":"Best Wireless Keyboard and Mouse 2019 -
