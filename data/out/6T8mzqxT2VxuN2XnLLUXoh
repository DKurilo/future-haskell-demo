You can still read our original review below, but TopTenREVIEWS is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","LifeCore Fitness has come up with a nicely designed model among <a href=\"/best-elliptical-machines\">elliptical machines</a>. It delivers a smooth workout that positions you into an upright posture so your stride flows along in a comfortable and natural fashion. The LifeCore CD400 Elliptical gives you several programs and resistance levels so you can tailor your workout exactly the way you want.","This elliptical comes equipped with 12 different workouts: manual, random, hill, glute blaster, interval, interval mountain, speed interval, target heart rate, heart rate cardio, heart rate fat burn, heart rate hill and heart rate interval. You also have the ability to create custom courses and retain profile data for two different people who use this elliptical machine. You can set up such things as default time, weight and age for the two user profiles. There is one disappointing snag: you cannot change the incline, either manually or automatically.","The LifeCore CD400 gives you 20 resistance levels so you can adjust your exertion level to whatever is best for you from relatively easy to medium to highly challenging. One drawback is that the stride length is set at 21 inches, which is great for many people. However, if you are quite tall or quite short, the 21-inch length that cannot be shortened or lengthened could turn out to be a problem because this length might not suit your particular stride.","This elliptical’s console is illuminated by 10- inch by 14-inch LED display on which you can track such things as calories burned, the time you have exercised and the distance traveled. You can grip the hand-held heart rate sensors on the machine’s stationary handlebars to find out how hard you are exercising and whether you should kick it up a notch or slow down a bit.","With the LifeCore CD400, you get a water bottle holder to quench your thirst as you whir away the miles and a rack on which you can put reading materials. This elliptical also has front transport wheels, which means even thought this machine weighs 225 pounds you can move it from one part of the house to the next for a change of scene, to position it in front of a television or to get some privacy. However it does not have a locking pin, speakers, music plug-ins or a cooling fan.","The LifeCore CD400 takes up relatively little space for a machine that can accommodate a user who weighs up to 300 pounds. Its dimensions are 41 inches long, 31 inches wide and 64 inches high, making it a compact piece of home workout equipment.","You get a fairly generous warranty with this LifeCore Fitness elliptical. The frame has lifetime coverage, mechanical and electronic parts are covered for five years; and there is a one year warranty on labor. However, the company does not list any warranty for wear items.","This elliptical trainer’s manufacturer also provides quite good help and support. There is a FAQs section on its website as well as online manuals. You also get phone and email support."]},"id":"671342ad-7e97-4304-bd8c-c3a983ef4d08","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a11ab806-65c9-41e2-9cbe-b7fbc2f4235e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["LifeCore CD400 Elliptical is a durable and well-constructed elliptical that gives you plenty of options to vary your workout so you will not be bored, some accessories to make the experience more comfortable and it takes up far less room than most models."]},"id":"3e77bb3d-c533-43d4-abfc-e07b63d0c4c3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52708","url":"/lifecore-cd400-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-02T19:52:21Z","datePublished":"2011-05-02T19:52:21Z","name":"LifeCore CD400","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it is no longer available.
