Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","As legendary American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson so poignantly expressed, &#34;Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.&#34; Adhering to this philosophy, Vornado has attempted to take <a href=\"/best-tower-fans\">tower fans</a>  miles beyond their conventional limitations. Inspired by advanced propeller and jet engine designs, Vornado engineers created what they refer to as &#34;V-Flow Circulation.&#34; The idea being Vornado products not only affect the air around the unit like traditional fans and heaters, but they disperse all of the air throughout the entire room.","Touted as being far superior to conventional fan technology, Vornado&#39;s patented V-Flow Circulation works on the premise that &#34;vortex action&#34; can provide a constant and even distribution of air, far surpassing the effectiveness of traditional oscillating fans. According to Vornado, typical tower fans must circulate air by oscillating due to their limited range of air movement. The V-Flow Circulation technology speaks to the company&#39;s spirit of innovation. Vornado is certainly blazing its own path and differentiating itself from conventional tower fans in the process.","Capable of producing up to 400 cubic feet of air per minute, the Vornado 153 Tower Circulator is without question one of the most powerful and effective fans in our tower fan review. Even at a distance of 20 feet, the air output and distribution is extremely impressive. We believe the highest setting would be ideal for use in a garage or a perhaps even a factory. The Vornado 153 Tower Circulator is no doubt capable of cooling off a large room on even the hottest of days. While the noise level on the highest setting is considerable, the medium setting is significantly quieter, enabling you to carry on a conversation at reasonable volume levels. The lowest speed setting is hardly audible, and this setting will present no problems in the way of carrying on a conversation.","The programmable sleep timer, indicated by a small blue LED light, can be set for one, two, four or eight hours, ensuring your tower fan is operating in an energy-saving and efficient manner. We like the sleep timer&#39;s ability to allow you total control over when the tower fan is turned off and on. We also like the benefit of being able to have the fan turn itself off on cold mornings.","Like the tower fan itself, the included remote control boasts handsome looks, and it fits comfortably in your hand. Unfortunately, the remote suffers from a lack of responsiveness, and you may find yourself having to stand directly in front of the fan for it to work. For those prone to misplacing remote controls, the remote can be conveniently stored on top of the fan, using a magnet to keep it securely in place.","Standing at a height of 32 inches, the all black Vornado 153 Tower Circulator pairs progressive design with radical good looks. Even the prominent Vornado logo adorning the top of the tower is bold. Amidst the tower fan&#39;s audacious design stands a tower that is well built and durable. The fan&#39;s base is incredibly sturdy, making it impervious to the typical wobble that often plagues traditional tower fans.","Vornado features a well laid out and clear customer support page. Not only are the obligatory FAQs and Contact Information sections represented, but also information detailing the savings you&#39;ll accrue from using Vornado circulators during the summer months. In fact, Vornado claims your new circulator will pay for itself in just one season. The help and support page is rounded out by product registering information, manuals and warranty information, and yet more information regarding Vornado&#39;s commitment to helping customers reduce energy consumption. Of all the contenders in our tower fan review, Vornado&#39;s customer support and help is the most extensive. No stone has been left unturned. The icing on the cake? The Vornado 153 Tower Circulator is backed by a class-leading five-year warranty."]},"id":"cbc92aff-1d6d-4a2e-af07-26744d05b671","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2b29a5a8-86d4-40b0-87f4-ddf165aaa164","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Assessing the Vornado&#39;s strengths, it is evident that this tower fan does one thing better than most of its competition: It moves an incredible amount of air, cooling off even large room quickly and efficiently.","While the Vornado 153 and its patented V-Flow Circulation will not likely render traditional oscillation tower fans obsolete, we applaud the fan&#39;s efficiency and impressive air output.

The unit does produce a significant amount of noise, but then again not many tower fans are capable of the amazing air output this unit boasts."]},"id":"c8476f88-bdf7-42d9-b8ac-230f8188c771","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54131","url":"/vornado-153-tower-circulator-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-12-30T16:38:42Z","datePublished":"2011-12-30T16:38:42Z","name":"Vornado 153","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
