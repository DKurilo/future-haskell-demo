You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The midrange Toro 51496 offers moderate power and cutting capability, but it is limited to light and average tasks. This battery-operated <a href=\"/best-hedge-trimmers\">hedge trimmer</a> also has several usage and safety features.","This cordless hedge trimmer features a 24-volt lithium-ion battery pack with a panel that indicates the battery status, so you can see how much power the machine has left. The removable battery pack comes with a fast charger that charges the battery in one hour. However, to achieve maximum charge, the pack requires 24 hours of charging. The self-discharge rate is minimal, so the battery should not lose much power between uses.","At 24 volts, this hedge trimmer does not offer as much power as high-end gas models, so it is not suited to heavy-duty tasks. Even at 2,800 cutting strokes per minute, it can struggle with dense, woody stems or stems over 0.625 inches in diameter.","The Toro 514625 has hardened steel dual-action blades that reduce vibration. These 24-inch blades provide extra reach and shorten cutting time compared to the common 20-inch blades. However, that extra length also adds to the weight, has a negative impact on the overall balance, and gives you less control and precision than shorter blades do. This hedge trimmer comes with a protective blade sheath for safe storage and transportation.","To reduce muscle stress and fatigue, both the front auxiliary and rear handles of the Toro 514625 have an ergonomic shape and soft grip. The rear handle rotates 90 degrees in each direction for versatility of movement. However, there are just three positions, instead of multiple adjustment possibilities in each direction, so it isn&#39;t as flexible as some other hedge trimmers.","Weighing in at 6.8 pounds, this cordless hedge trimmer is comparatively light, allowing you to comfortably operate it for extended periods, even overhead, without excessive muscle stress. This model is of a similar weight to many corded hedge trimmers, so it is a good alternative if you do not want to be encumbered by a trailing power cord.","The Toro 514625 is best for light tasks. This hedge trimmer is unable to withstand heavy-duty tasks, but it is lightweight and reasonably agile with long dual-action blades for fast trimming. You compromise some power and cutting capacity for a light weight and freedom of movement with this midrange hedge trimmer."]},"id":"16fcab0e-15c6-4b9c-b462-a907cae0448c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62928","url":"/toro-cordless-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-20T18:44:00Z","datePublished":"2015-02-20T18:44:00Z","name":"Toro Cordless 51496","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-20T18:44:00Z","id":"C8UkR9J9biseSpNw4s4ZJn","meta":{"title":"Toro Cordless 51496 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Toro 51496 is a battery-powered hedge trimmer with a 24-inch dual-action blade.
