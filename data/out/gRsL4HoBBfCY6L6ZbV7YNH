The group&#39;s focus ranges from industrial machinery and security systems to home appliances. The french door refrigerator, B26FT70SNS, part of the Bosch 800 series, is a leading home appliance for the company.","This Bosch refrigerator is a valuable asset to any kitchen. The spacious french door fridge comes in a stainless steel finish and has a total storage capacity of 26 cubic feet. LED lighting illuminates both the freezer and refrigeration compartments, making stored items easy to organize and retrieve.","Bosch has equipped this fridge with a proprietary feature called VitaFresh. This feature keeps both the crisper bins and the full-width drawer at favorable temperatures and humidity levels in an attempt to preserve the flavor, texture and appearance of stored food. As this feature automatically controls the humidity and temperature levels, you are not able to adjust the settings if you find them unfavorable. The fridge&#39;s cooling system is designed to evenly distribute air through the refrigeration and freezer compartments.","Adjustable, spill-proof, glass, split shelves make customization a straightforward task. The full-sized deli drawer has a dedicated LED light that lets the owner easily see the freshness of stored meats and cheeses. The doors of the refrigerator section come equipped with eight storage compartments that include three gallon-sized bins and two dairy compartments.","The total storage capacity of the freezer compartment is 9 cubic feet, which is among the largest of the french door refrigerators we reviewed. Bosch has equipped the freezer with two full-width drawers that have a total of three plastic bins. While the organization options are lacking, the sheer amount of storage space is nice.","Bosch backs this refrigerator with a one-year limited warranty on parts and labor. Extended warranty options are available at an additional cost and vary by seller and by country."]},"id":"bea1ac93-95a8-4fd1-a956-a929fc506cc5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"19b92818-bb73-492c-a507-79ab3582e1fb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a super-capacity french door refrigerator offered by Bosch. Both the fresh food and freezer compartments are spacious, but the fresh food section definitely has a better organization system than the freezer. While you&#39;ll have plenty of space in the freezer, things could get lost thanks to the lack of organizational bins. Also, the VitaFresh system is a nice thought, but it takes away your ability to adjust humidity and temperature levels."]},"id":"b8fe1114-6842-4a3b-8e66-b2c3ce44a362","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51078","url":"/bosch-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-12T15:28:45Z","datePublished":"2010-10-12T15:28:45Z","name":"Bosch 800 Series B26FT70SNS","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
