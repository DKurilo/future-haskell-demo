You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Definitive Technology BP6B is one of the most uniquely designed tower speaker sets we reviewed. These <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">tower speakers</a> feature four total drivers – two 5.25-inch woofers and two 1-inch tweeters. What makes the design strange is two of the drivers are located on the back of the speaker. This could make for a cool design if the speakers were placed in the middle of the room, but speakers are generally placed by the TV, against the wall, leaving two of the drivers facing the wall for nobody to hear.","Another design flaw is the location of the binding posts. The posts are located in a nook on the bottom of the floor standing speaker. To connect speaker wire to the binding posts, you need to tip the speaker over to get to the binding posts. Where they are positioned within the little nook makes it difficult to make a good connection with the speaker wire. The whole process we found to be inconvenient, especially compared to other speakers.","We tested each set of speakers with a variety of songs and filled out a questionnaire to determine how well each speaker performed. While listening to a rendition of &#34;Venetian Gondola Song,&#34; we noticed that the home stereo speakers struggled to produce clear high frequency tones. Toward the end of the song, the piano does a two-note flutter on the high notes of the piano. During that section of the song, the sound got blurry and didn&#39;t have any definition.","During a Radiohead song we noticed unnatural overemphasis of high tones when compared to other speakers. The vocals and piano in the song sounded brighter and a bit tinny in comparison. After several passes though the song, it was evident that the speakers were overemphasizing those frequencies. The speakers do a good job at creating bass tones, but once you get into the higher frequencies, the speakers sound unnatural.","The stereo speakers boast a sensitivity rating of 91 dB, which is fairly efficient compared to many speakers. Anything above 90 dB is considered a good sensitivity rating. When your speakers efficiently convert power to sound, they tend to perform better and last longer.","These speakers are only available in black. They are covered by a five-year warranty. You can contact that manufacturer via email or phone if you have any questions concerning the BP6B speakers."]},"id":"010ee1d7-17b4-482d-8a35-cec8da94658d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2ebd68a3-0a02-4f6c-a39d-4157c9fd5e4b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Definitive Technology BP6B speakers have a few design flaws.
