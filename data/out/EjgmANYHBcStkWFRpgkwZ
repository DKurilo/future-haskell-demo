Unfortunately, once a person is aware that they are under observation, they modify their behavior in response. By using a hidden camera, you minimize the subject&#39;s awareness and preserve informative actions that would otherwise go unseen.","When properly carried out, behavioral research can benefit a variety of fields. Behavioral analysis has applications in engineering, architecture, law enforcement, business, education, security and other fields. Before you go about setting up a pinhole camera to observe others, though, you need to know the legal considerations, have a goal, and know the effects of observation on behavior.","<strong>Legal Considerations</strong><br/>In many states, it is illegal to use <a href=\"/best-security-cameras\">hidden cameras</a> for observation in a private setting. This means that you should not record video in any place where a person expects privacy; this includes but is not limited to restrooms, locker rooms and hotel rooms. In private residences and businesses, you must have the permission of the property owner.","It is perfectly legal to use hidden surveillance cameras in your home, your business or a public setting. Some states may require you to get consent from the person you are recording. This may affect their behavior, but you should always stay within the legal limits for the state you live in.","<strong>Always Have a Goal</strong><br/>Observation should always have a goal. With a proper goal, behavioral research can help you in a variety of ways. Without a goal, observation will not lead to any specific improvements in your business or other setting.","If you&#39;re a business owner, your goal might be to see if customers are trying to shoplift. As an educator, you may want to observe a student&#39;s classroom behavior to track which topics are the most engaging. In an engineering setting, you could observe how people move through a building so you can design a better building that more efficiently uses space. Have a clear vision of what you hope to achieve before collecting this research.","<strong>Observation Affects Behavior</strong><br/>In most cases, you can use standard security cameras without fear of modifying behavior. In public settings, people tend to be accustomed to cameras, so you&#39;re unlikely to modify their behavior in any significant way. In your home or business, hidden home security cameras are ideal. Hidden video cameras are great for keeping an eye on your house when you&#39;re not home.","In a business setting, you can learn how to protect your business and provide higher levels of service by observing your customers. You can also monitor your employees via secret camera. You don&#39;t need to inform them where the camera is, but it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to tell them that a camera is present. If you decide to tell your employees about the spy camera, it&#39;s important that you emphasize your trust in them. When employees feel untrusted, they may be more prone to stress and the illnesses that accompany a stressful work environment.","If you follow some simple guidelines, your hidden camera will be perfectly legal and give you valuable insight into the people around you. Behavioral analysis is an amazing tool that can help you learn and improve almost anything; however, it&#39;s important to use it wisely."]},"id":"b0dcedb7-402b-4f18-8873-fa787e977c21","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8774","url":"/hidden-cameras-reveal-a-persons-true-behavior","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-12T22:23:03Z","datePublished":"2014-09-12T22:23:03Z","name":"Hidden Cameras Reveal a Person's True Behavior","synopsis":"Behavioral psychology evolved around the idea that we can learn invaluable information about a subject by simply observing their behavior.","review":{},"strapline":"Behavioral psychology evolved around the idea that we can learn invaluable information about a subject by simply observing their behavior.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-04-21T01:42:41Z","id":"EjgmANYHBcStkWFRpgkwZ","meta":{"title":"Hidden Cameras Reveal a Person's True Behavior","description":"You can use a hidden camera to find out how people in your home or business really act when you&#039;re not around.
