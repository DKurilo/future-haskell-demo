And we&#39;ve been reviewing car technology for even longer than that, covering a wide swath of categories that includes car speakers, stereos, in-dash navigation, backup cameras, dash cameras, radar detectors and more. We regularly spend up to 120 hours researching, evaluating and testing the products we review, always with the purpose of helping you find the best product to make your commute better, safer and more enjoyable.","<strong>How Much Do Battery Charters and Jump Starters Cost? </strong>","Car battery chargers and jump-starters are used for different purposes. As such, they have different costs. Jump-starters are typically more expensive, ranging between $50 and $110. This is because they come with a portable battery designed to jump a dead battery. Chargers, however, don&#39;t have batteries. Rather, they require a power source to amplify the power and recharge a dead or dying battery.  These typically cost between $30 and $60, and are used to maintain battery performance on rarely driven vehicles rather than as an emergency preparedness tool.","<strong>What We Evaluated </strong>","For these reviews, we didn&#39;t test any of the products. Rather, we relied on extensive product research. To begin, we created a list of the 10 best car chargers and the 10 best jump-starters, based on user reviews and popularity. Then we narrowed this list down to the top five products for each by comparing and evaluating the power specifications, size, safety and convenience features.","Car chargers and jump-starters are very similar in many respects. Many of the features that we evaluated are shared – amps, reverse polarity protection, portability and easy-to-read screens. Chargers often have additional gauges, such as for the alternator and convenience features like USB ports for charging electronic devices.","However, car chargers and jump-starters are different, which means they were evaluated differently. Chargers require a power outlet and have a relatively low amp output that will charge a discharged battery enough so that it will start a vehicle. Jump-starters are batteries that provide a much higher amp output to get your car started immediately. They are typically used as part of an emergency preparedness plan. If your battery dies while you&#39;re out camping, for example, a car charger is useless, but a jump-starter can save you from being stranded.","<strong>Car Battery Chargers vs. Jump Starters </strong>","It&#39;s easy to confuse car battery chargers and jump-starters, especially if you&#39;re not an automobile enthusiast. Both provide power to your car&#39;s battery, but in very different ways and for very different purposes. Car chargers plug into a wall outlet and deliver a small charge that maintains a battery&#39;s charge when it isn&#39;t being used. In other words, car chargers are for long-term maintenance. You use a car charger for RVs, boats, four-wheelers, motorcycles and other vehicles that often spend weeks or months without use. If you don&#39;t frequently use a vehicle, the battery&#39;s charge will deteriorate. But when you frequently use a vehicle, the alternator keeps the battery charged, unless the battery is dead. That&#39;s where jump-starters come into play.","A jump-starter is a battery that delivers a high jolt of electricity to your vehicle so that it can get started. In essence, it temporarily takes over for your dead battery and helps your car get started. Then, after the car is started, the alternator should be able to recharge the dead battery, unless the battery is old and has lost its ability to hold a charge, which happens to all batteries eventually.<br/><strong> <br/>Types of Jump-Starters</strong>","There are two types of jump-starters: portable and ultra-portable. Portable jump-starters use a lead-acid battery like the one in your car and can start vehicles of any size in extreme conditions. They weigh around 18 pounds and are roughly the size of a plastic shopping bag, so you need some free trunk space to tote one around.","The best ultra-portable jump-starters weigh around 2 pounds and can fit in your glove compartment or under your passenger seat. These are ideal for small- or medium-size vehicles, but usually won&#39;t work on large trucks. In addition, they have USB ports you can use to charge your smartphone and an LED flashlight. Ultra-portable models use a lithium-ion power source, and you need to recharge them periodically based on how much you use them. You can expect to revive a battery more than 10 times in a period of several months before you need to plug yours into a wall socket to recharge.","<strong>What Should I Include in an Emergency Roadside Kit?</strong>","If you regularly drive in rural areas or you’re going on a long road trip, it’s worth taking some time to put together an emergency roadside kit. If your car breaks down or you get a flat tire, you shouldn’t rely on having a cellular signal or other drivers on the road to help. And even if you’re able to call for help, it could be hours before it arrives. So having a roadside kit in your trunk is the best way to ensure you’re safe, and even comfortable.","According to Philip Reed of <a href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/how-to/how-to-create-your-own-roadside-emergency-kit.html\">Edmunds.com</a>, one of the most important factors in creating your roadside emergency kit is tailoring it to your car’s age and condition and the environment you drive in most often.","Here is a list of items to put in a bag you can keep in your trunk or under a seat:  "]},"id":"5a80c6ba-c71d-4ac8-98b7-c9cd7ca2d9a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Food &amp; Water: Granola, energy bars, bottled water","Clothing: A spare set of clothing in case you get wet","A visual marker: Traditional flares, LED flares, triangle reflectors","First-aid kit: Antiseptics, washcloths, bandages, gauze, tourniquet, etc.","Pen and paper: Anything for writing","Blanket: Anything to keep you warm; the colder the climate, the heavier the blanket","Flashlights: Don’t pack just one  ","Extra batteries: Better to have a bag weighed down by extra batteries than to need batteries","Battery bank: A simple tool for recharging a phone."],"type":"ul"},"id":"a1b0d948-9f60-4af7-ac73-6bd58b8e581e","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In addition, you should make sure your car has items for preventing breakdowns or getting you back on the road if one happens:"]},"id":"14557bda-1448-4405-a9af-7c07e6a3f50c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Car battery jumper: A battery bank jumper like the ones we’ve reviewed is ideal, but make sure to have jumper cables, at the very least","Motoring fluids: A quart of oil, a gallon of coolant","Tool kit: Screwdriver, pliers, pocket knife","Tire care: Tire inflator, tire sealant and tire pressure gauge","Window care: Spray bottle with washer fluid, ice scraper"],"type":"ul"},"id":"bd0fd46f-4f70-4726-9ea6-70774413dfcf","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_176","url":"/best-car-battery-chargers","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T18:21:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T18:21:00Z","name":"Best Car Battery Chargers and Jump-Starters of 2019","synopsis":"We spent 30 hours researching 10 jump-starters and 10 car battery chargers costing under $100 each.
