It doesn’t offer much in the way of loans. It has some excellent benefits that members can take advantage of, though its interest rates are lower than many of the other banks we reviewed.","To enroll in Radius’s basic checking account, you’ll need a minimum deposit of $10. This is a lower deposit than banks like <a href=\"/discover-bank-review\">Discover</a> and <a href=\"/bank-of-internet-usa-review\">Bank of Internet USA </a>require. This account earns interest, but at a very low rate. If you’d like a higher-earning account, Radius offers a hybrid checking/savings account that earns a high rate of interest. This account has the best interest rate for any premium checking account and compares favorably with other high-interest savings accounts. One drawback to this account is that you’ll only earn that high rate on balances above $2,500.","When compared to the checking accounts, Radius’s savings accounts are lacking. The interest rates are very low. The money market account has the lowest interest rates we saw. CDs are available for terms ranging from 3 to 60 months.","One of the biggest advantages that Radius Bank offers is unlimited ATM reimbursements. This is the most generous reimbursement benefit we saw, and it’s available for both the standard and hybrid checking accounts. You can make a deposit through any ATM in the NYCE network.","Radius Bank offers credit cards with a variety of rewards options. This online bank doesn’t offer mortgages directly, but partners with Prosper, another lender. Radius doesn’t offer auto loans, but it does provide personal loans.","You can use Radius’s mobile app to deposit checks and manage your accounts. You can also send money to friends with the Radius Pay a Friend feature. Customer service hours are 8:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. Eastern time Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends. You can also reach customer service through email or live chat."]},"id":"59b3f6de-1a85-4ce8-826c-33be08b35f13","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e3ff2959-f80d-4ee9-b75d-23301040bf87","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Radius Bank offers a hybrid checking/savings account with a high interest rate.
