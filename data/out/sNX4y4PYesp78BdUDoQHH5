note: On March 21, 2018, Kidde issued a recall for its Kidde Dual Sensor (Photoelectric and Ionization) Smoke Alarms – Models PI2010 and PI9010. To check if your Kidde smoke detector is part of the recall, we encourage you to visit <a href=\"https://kidde-smoke-alarm-recall.expertinquiry.com/\">Kidde&#39;s recall website</a>. On an unrelated note, this review was previously removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-smoke-detectors\">Smoke Detectors</a> here.</em>","The Kidde PI9010 is one of only two wireless smoke detectors in our top 10 lineup that offers dual-sensor capability to detect smoldering and fast-burning fires. It comes with standard smoke alarm features, comprehensive help and support, and a 10-year manufacturer’s warranty.","The best smoke detectors on the market combine the ability to detect slow-burning, smoldering fires and fast-burning, raging fires. The Kidde PI9010 comes with a combination photoelectric sensor and an ionization sensor, which can protect you against both types of hazards. It does not come with a carbon monoxide (CO) detector, but since these are only necessary in homes with appliances that are fuel-burning, you may not require one at all.","It is battery operated, which means it does not require your home’s electrical power to operate. Likewise, its wireless nature makes it easy to install and more conducive for use in older homes that have not been wired for smoke detectors. Battery operated units can also be installed in any location, including detached sheds or garages. The PI9010 is powered by a single 9-volt battery. Although wireless smoke alarms may need to have their batteries replaced more frequently than hardwired smoke detectors, it is strongly recommended that you replace the batteries at least once every 12 months regardless of whether they’re still functional.","The Kidde PI9010 is relatively barebones when it comes to the presence of bonus features. It doesn’t have a voice alarm or safety lights, but it does include all of the necessary functions that contribute to its utilitarian nature. This includes a low-battery warning LED light that flashes red in accompaniment with an audible chirp that sounds off every 45 seconds when the battery needs to be replaced. A dual-purpose test and hush button can be used to silence an alarm that’s been triggered or to test the function of the device.","This smoke detector has a 10-year manufacturer’s warranty. Help and support for troubleshooting issues is available via telephone and email. In addition, there are several online resources, including downloadable user guides, FAQs and associated articles on the manufacturer site, that can help you get the most from your smoke alarm."]},"id":"53970f4e-a1d7-4673-8157-63394193d0dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"34775dd0-4f4e-4132-addf-518c7cdbc160","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kidde PI9010’s ability to detect both smoldering and flaming fires ranks it among the best smoke detectors available.
