They also liked the traditional experience of flipping through a list of available preloaded songs and entering in a code. The least popular machines were ones that only accepted a CD.","Setup<br/>Before you purchase a karaoke machine, consider how and where you intend to use it, and use this information to choose a machine that won’t be a hassle to set up. We recommend buying a machine that either includes all the necessary cords and accessories or clearly notes which pieces aren’t included so you can purchase them simultaneously. Discovering your machine is missing necessities when you are ready to sing can really put a damper on your karaoke party.","Most of the karaoke machines we reviewed have plug-and-play designs, meaning there isn’t much setup beyond plugging them in. We recommend this type of machine if you plan to travel with yours frequently, since they are small and easy to set up. Models with lots of components and a bird’s nest of cords are a hassle to travel with and better suited to being permanent fixtures in a room.","Accessories","Before shopping, consider how you’ll use your karaoke machine so you know whether you need to purchase extra equipment. For example, you may want to purchase additional microphones so two people can sing at the same time. Or maybe you want cordless mics so you can move and dance around while you sing.","Also, think about how you plan to play songs: Are you going to use a CD or connect a cord and pull them from the YouTube app on your smartphone? In addition, consider whether the machine has an onboard screen for lyrics.
