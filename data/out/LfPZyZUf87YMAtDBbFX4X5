This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">4K LED TV</a> also comes with a tablet remote that not only controls your TV, but allows you to watch TV on your tablet when you move from room to room. There is a lot to like about this TV, including its price point, though it also has some shortcomings.","We compared all of the TVs side-by-side by watching a handful of UHD, HD and 4K movies and shows. Since picture quality is great on the majority of LED TVs in our comparison, we needed to nitpick at the tiny discrepancies we found in the picture quality of each 4K TV set.","As we watched &#34;Gravity&#34; we noticed that the Vizio had a darker picture on its best settings mode – Vizio calls this setting calibrated – than other sets. As the astronauts were floating around the sky, the sky appeared almost pitch black with few stars in the sky where other sets displayed far more stars. In the same movie (spoiler alert), there is a scene where one of the astronauts detaches from his harness and floats away from his partner. As he was floating away, the stars started to pulsate. This is the display trying to render too much information at once.","We also spotted halos of light as we watched a streaming 4K version of an Emi Myers musical performance. Around the saxophone close-ups and encircling the performer&#39;s hands, you could see halos of light against the dark black background. This is the TV&#39;s inability to achieve full black, a common occurrence with full-array backlighting and local dimming. Those are minor issues though, and overall the TV actually had great color saturation and color accuracy for that matter. In that same Emi Myers performance, her dress is a bright, vivid red that was on par with the best 4K TV displays. During &#34;The Martian&#34; the detail in the orange sand and rocky landscape on Mars was not sharp and detailed. Only minor issues pushed the Vizio P-55 grade down to a B+.","As we tested the set with our Calman software, test pattern generator and sensor, the Vizio P-55 performed well. There were a handful of TVs with a better contrast ratio than the Vizio, but it does have great color accuracy compared to the competition. That came as no surprise considering the vivid visuals we experienced while we watched the display.","One of the main talking points with the SmartCast TV is the tablet remote. There is a lot to like about it. You can stream content on it and take it with you around the house. It uses Google as its search engine and allows you to sign in and access all of your Google accounts. Also, the tablet uses an Android interface. If you are familiar with Android phone layouts, it will be familiar to you.","The downsides to the SmartCast tablet remote are the constant updates, buffering and battery life. There were several occurrences when we attempted to change the picture settings or input settings and received the dreaded loading spin-wheel on the remote. At one point we waited over one minute for the tablet. We have used this remote several times and have already gone through three different system updates. These updates can take as long as 15 minutes to complete. It is also frustrating if you forget to put the remote back on the charging stand. Much like a smartphone, if you don&#39;t plug it in by the end of the day, the battery will inevitably be dead the next morning. The Vizio P-55 does come with another remote, but it is basic and doesn’t allow you to access all of the TV&#39;s functions like the tablet remote does.","This is the only 4K LED TV that features five HDMI ports. All others have four. It sacrifices a USB port to do so, where most TVs have at least three and the Vizio P-55 only has two. However, we prefer more HDMI ports to USB ports. The Vizio is available in a number of different sizes including 75-, 65-, 55- and 50-inch sets. This LED TV is covered by a one-year warranty on the date of purchase."]},"id":"d3dfca8a-3988-4a35-a40e-9516724880ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8e2e5e5c-8526-4e4c-9885-0ae6999ab93b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vizio SmartCast P55-C1 LED TV provides great color saturation and vivid detail.
