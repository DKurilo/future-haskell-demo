Do you need more sound up front or in the back? In the cabin or on the deck? Ask yourself if you want to simply replace the factory-installed speakers or if you will you be drilling new holes to install speakers. These questions will help you decide what kind of speakers you will need to look for.<br/> ","Boat speakers are directional. Keep this in mind as you install them. One strategy is to place the tweeters up front and facing toward the windshield. This allows the windshield to bounce the sound back and disperse it better than the speaker can on its own.<br/> ","If you are going to place your speakers on the center console or near the navigation equipment, check with the manufacturer to see if it is magnetically shielded. If not, the magnet inside the speaker could throw off the compass.<br/> ","If you choose to simply replace your factory installed speakers, double check the openings that they came from. Measure the diameter of the opening and make sure that you purchase a speaker that is going to fit correctly in that space or you may have to do extra work to get it to fit. Measure the diameter of the speaker as well when you receive it and return it if it is not going to work for your boat.<br/> "],"type":"ol"},"id":"9219b9da-2d7b-41c7-9146-3e445df79c06","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Have fun with your new marine speakers and remember to be responsible with them.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"13772f62-278b-4a09-a341-7d118ed911d6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7807","url":"/10-tips-for-choosing-new-marine-speakers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"elizabeth-carver","url":"/author/elizabeth-carver","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Elizabeth Carver","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"fAAomBacc23a4A2oaSyFj6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-03-06T22:41:53Z","datePublished":"2013-03-06T22:41:53Z","name":"10 Tips for Choosing New Marine Speakers","synopsis":"When selecting and installing your new marine speakers, there are a couple of things you'll want to keep in mind that may not be included in your instruction manual.","review":{},"strapline":"When selecting and installing your new marine speakers, there are a couple of things you'll want to keep in mind that may not be included in your instruction manual.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-03-08T14:52:44Z","id":"krfDLyiBHNdVPNSkqhZe7N","meta":{"title":"10 Tips for Choosing New Marine Speakers","description":"Planning to install new boat speakers?
