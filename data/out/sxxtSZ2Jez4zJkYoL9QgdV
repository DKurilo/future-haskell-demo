It works with most consoles and PCs, both old and new. Sharing your finest gaming moments shouldn&#39;t be a difficult task. The Live Gamer makes it easier.","The Live Gamer can handle 1080p resolution and up to 60 fps. That&#39;s enough to give you smooth recordings, though there are some other settings to keep in mind to achieve the best quality.","The Live Gamer doesn&#39;t compress the recording file, and that&#39;s a good thing. Anytime a file is compressed, it loses quality. This is particularly noticeable in video if you aren&#39;t careful. Uncompressed files can take up a lot of space on your hard drive, but they also give you the best-looking video. When you stream live or upload your recording to the internet, it automatically compresses, so you&#39;ll want to start with the highest-quality recording you can.","For the Live Gamer to work, you need to connect it to your gaming system of choice with an HDMI cable. Then, you connect the Live Gamer to your PC with the USB 3.0 port. The HDMI pass-through then connects to your TV or monitor. This lets you play your game on a display other than your computer monitor. The game capture device sees the video data as it moves over the HDMI cable, copies it and sends it to your computer through the USB 3.0 port.","At that point, RECentral, Live Gamer&#39;s recording, streaming and editing application, handles the video feed. You can use RECentral to include interactive elements in your stream, add picture-in-picture or edit live video. This application is quite capable, but it doesn&#39;t have all of the editing abilities you&#39;d find in dedicated video editing software. If you want a lot of post-processing, then you can save the video file and edit it with another program later on.","A couple of compatibility issues may present problems for you. The Live Gamer doesn&#39;t work with Macs, and it doesn&#39;t work with every PC either. On AVerMedia&#39;s product page, there&#39;s a compatibility tool you can download to see if the Live Gamer will work with your PC.","Should you have questions or problems, AVerMedia&#39;s website has many support resources. There&#39;s a knowledgebase you can search for quick answers, and you can also download the Live Gamer&#39;s product manual. You can find some tutorials on setting up a game capture device, and the forums are a great place to learn about the product and video game recording in general. Should you still need help, you can email the support team directly.","The AVerMedia Live Gamer HD is a capable HD game capture device that has everything you need to get started. The RECentral application will have you streaming in no time, and you&#39;ll have access to a host of useful features."]},"id":"8c6b0ef8-0fa1-41a3-9319-3b6d0039b3b2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68318","url":"/avermedia-live-gamer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-06T19:39:50Z","datePublished":"2016-09-06T19:39:50Z","name":"AVerMedia Live Gamer HD","synopsis":"The AVerMedia Live Gamer HD capture card has a host of features to improve your live streams and gameplay recordings.
