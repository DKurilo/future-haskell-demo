When a new program comes out or a software update is released, we subject it to a battery of tests and compare it to other products to find out which one is the best.","During our tests, we analyze each program’s interface, workflow, features and more. We use each program to burn a new copy of a commercial Blu-ray movie, and our team of video experts inspects the copied footage for quality degradation such as compression artifact, motion blur and interlacing issues.","We also time how long it takes to make a new Blu-ray with each product. Additionally, we note how long it takes the program to compress a Blu-ray movie onto a smaller-capacity blank disc, split content onto one or more discs, and save the disc’s image onto a hard drive. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","As we evaluated the best Blu-ray burning software, we subjected each application to a battery of tests:","Quality Tests<br/>Blu-ray burner software’s main purpose is to create high-quality copies of movies. Using each product, we burned test copies of multiple Blu-ray discs. We then asked video experts to watch each burned disc and note any video or audio degradation compared to the original.","Each burner we reviewed can create an exact 1:1 copy of a Blu-ray movie, and our video experts didn’t detect any quality degradation in copies made by the programs. So, no matter which software you choose, you can burn copies that are indistinguishable from their source discs – as long as you have the right size blank Blu-ray, of course.","However, blank Blu-ray discs large enough to make perfect copies can get expensive. As such, the best Blu-ray burner applications let you compress the content on commercial Blu-rays to fit onto less-expensive, smaller-capacity blank discs or even onto DVDs.","We burned multiple Blu-ray discs and DVDs using the programs’ various compression options. Compression almost always causes quality loss, and our video experts noted that while the new discs lost some of the high-quality Blu-ray goodness of the original, the compressed footage was surprisingly good. Pixelation, motion blur, interlacing and other quality issues were minimal. Even the DVD compression copies were as good as or better than their store-bought counterparts.","Timing Tests<br/>Because Blu-ray files are large (25GB to 100GB), burning new copies can be time-consuming. If you&#39;re making a disc-to-disc copy, expect it to take at least three hours.","If you need to make multiple copies, we recommend extracting the ISO file to your computer and burning discs from that. Doing this instead of burning individual disc-to-disc copies can save you hours. When we timed how long it took each application to burn a new disc using an extracted disc image, we found that, on average, it took about 45 minutes to make a copy.","Compression takes a bit longer, especially if you&#39;re compressing the movie onto a blank Blu-ray disc. In our tests, we found it takes up to 13 hours to compress a 50GB commercial Blu-ray movie onto a 25GB blank disc. This is because the program must examine a 50GB disc image, compress it to 25GB, write a new ISO file and burn it to the new disc. We found this was true regardless of whether we burned a disc image or made a disc-to-disc copy.","Ease of Use Tests<br/>We evaluated each Blu-ray burner’s interface and workflow and found the applications are all generally easy to use. Some are intended for more tech-savvy users, and people with less technical knowledge may experience a slight learning curve when using them. However, after a burn or two, even these more difficult programs are easy to get the hang of. The best programs eliminate the guesswork and are simple enough that a casual user can burn new discs on the first try.","<strong>Key Attributes of the Best Blu-ray Burning Software Applications</strong>","As we evaluated Blu-ray burning software, we used the following criteria to determine which applications are the best:<br/><br/>How Much Does Blu-ray Burner Software Cost?<br/>You can pick up a barebones Blu-ray burner program absolutely free. While it gets the job done, you don’t get a lot of extra functionality. Paid programs can run anywhere from $20 to $120. However, you start seriously overpaying when you exceed $60.    ","Copy<br/>Before any Blu-ray burner can start copying, it must first overcome the anti-piracy protections found on nearly every commercial disc. Most of the software we reviewed can do this. If a program cannot decrypt commercial discs, its usefulness is limited to copying homemade and unprotected Blu-rays.","In addition to making disc-to-disc copies, the best burning software can extract a Blu-ray’s image and save it to your computer. Once there, you can use the ISO file to burn unlimited copies of the movie without needing the original disc. This is a great timesaver if you want to make multiple backup copies of your movies.","Output<br/>Each application we reviewed can make an exact replica of a Blu-ray movie. This means you can use any of the products to burn a new copy of your Blu-ray movies with no quality loss.","There are three sizes of blank Blu-ray discs you can purchase: 25GB, 50GB and 100GB. The best Blu-ray burner programs compress large commercial discs to fit onto blank small-capacity discs, which are less expensive. Keep in mind that compressing a movie results in a loss of quality compared to the original.","Customization<br/>There will be times you simply don&#39;t want to burn an exact copy of a disc, and the best Blu-ray burners let you customize your new disc with only the content you want. For example, you may only want to back up the feature presentation. In this case, software with a &#34;Movie Only&#34; option can automatically strip away all menus, special features and audio tracks from the disc, which saves space on your hard drive and blank Blu-rays.","Some programs even let you split the content onto two separate blank discs. This is a good option if you want to back up all the content on a Blu-ray but don&#39;t have the more-expensive blank discs to make an exact copy.","Help &amp; Support<br/>The products we compared are all relatively easy to use, but there may be times you need help with a technical or customer support issue. The best resource a manufacturer can offer is a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page or a knowledgebase on its official website. Common questions and technical issues can most likely be solved by consulting these resources.","The best Blu-ray burning software developers also offer other options, such as email ticket systems and live chat support, on their websites. A few companies even answer tech and customer support questions on their social media accounts. The best companies respond within 24 to 48 hours.","<strong>Best Free Blu-ray Burner Software</strong>","If you want to burn DVDs and Blu-ray discs for free, consider <a href=\"https://www.wondershare.net/ad/win-dvd-creator/\">Wondershare DVD Creator</a>. We’ve reviewed several Wondershare products in multiple categories, and its software is generally very good. This program focuses on authoring new discs from the ground up. It has templates for menus, can input chapter breaks and includes a basic video editor.","However, it lacks some of the features we look for in this category. The biggest omission is it can&#39;t make duplicates of copy-protected discs. So, you can&#39;t create a backup copy of your “Avengers” Blu-ray with this software. If you want to do that for free, check out <a href=\"/aurora-review\">Aurora Blu-ray</a> – it’s the most basic program we reviewed, but it gets the job done."]},"id":"6eee9097-37f3-4f0d-8878-f72bbad421c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_245","url":"/best-blu-ray-burning-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
