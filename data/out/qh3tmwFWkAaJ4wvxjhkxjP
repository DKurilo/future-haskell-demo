Thanks to the lightening-fast abilities of credit-card software, the day your customer purchases something from you using a credit or debit card is the day that charge appears on his or her online banking or credit-card page, usually as something called a soft charge. Soft charges are like placeholders in the customer s account, alerting the bank or credit-card company that the charge has been requested. Usually, the account will show the word  pending  next to the soft charge to indicate that the credit-card charge has not been processed.","If a customer comes back to you on the same day with merchandise to return, there s a chance the charge will not have been settled for the day. In this case, you will be issuing a void rather than initiating the formal credit card refund process, although the customer will likely still see a soft charge or  pending  notation in his or her online account. The void will stop the payment from going through, and within days, both the charge and the  pending  notice will disappear.","You might have to explain to your customers that they won t be receiving actual refunds because their charges will not ever go through, but most customers likely will not care about the details as long as the soft charges are eventually reversed in their accounts.","Now, if a customer returns two days later with unwanted merchandise, you will be going through the formal credit card refund process. Since credit card software settles accounts each day, the soft charge on your customer s account will move to a real charge and be processed. At this point, your software system will alert the credit-card company that the customer has requested a refund and that the charge should be reversed. You customer will see this refund within a few days.","It all sounds straightforward enough, but there are some important things to keep in mind. As a merchant, you must be sure that the person requesting a refund actually purchased the merchandise they are returning. Check your sales-history logs and tags on the merchandise, and never refund a credit card purchase with cash. Ask the person to produce both the card that was charged and personal identification so you ll know for sure that this person is the legal cardholder and that the refund is going back to the credit card that was originally used to make the purchase.","Also, keep in mind that while you are charged a per-transaction fee when you accommodate credit-card payments, you may also be charged a transaction fee per refund. Merchant account providers typically call this a chargeback fee. If you re concerned about refund, per-transaction or other fees, you must shop around before applying for a merchant account. While you likely will pay fees for monthly account maintenance and minimum monthly transactions, some card-processing companies do not levy an additional annual fee, so do your homework."]},"id":"9029e805-e50d-4358-8866-5ff7bc0eb780","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6160","url":"/whats-involved-in-credit-card-refunds","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-22T16:18:14Z","datePublished":"2011-06-22T16:18:14Z","name":"The Credit Card Refund Process - How Does It Work?","synopsis":"For all of the convenience of credit card processing, the credit card refund process can be a bit confusing.","review":{},"strapline":"For all of the convenience of credit card processing, the credit card refund process can be a bit confusing.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-05-09T20:31:14Z","id":"qh3tmwFWkAaJ4wvxjhkxjP","meta":{"title":"The Credit Card Refund Process - How Does It Work?","description":"Understanding the credit card refund process can be a little bit confusing.
