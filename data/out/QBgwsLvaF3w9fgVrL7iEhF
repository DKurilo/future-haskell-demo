Home videos and Disney movies are among those videos that people cannot or will not get rid of. With DVD Wizard Pro, there is no need to. In fact, these home relics can be converted into DVDs to be enjoyed again and again. You just have to make sure you have the right hardware to get this feature to work.","DVD Wizard Pro offers a very versatile feature set. You can copy DVD movies to DVD-Rs or CD-Rs to be played in VCD-capable DVD players. You can also copy your DVD games (PS2, XBOX, PSX) if you have a mod chip installed in your game console. These mod chips can be purchased from a variety of manufacturers. While this isn&#39;t the optimal way to play the games, it does provide an option for backing up the discs. The time it takes to copy a movie is fairly comparable. Our test DVD only took an hour.","Since this DVD copy software was converted from an e-book to software, the ease of use has been dramatically improved. The instructions are very good, and they include step-by-step help information and images to assist you. Installation is fast and simple. Now there is only one product to download in order to accomplish your task.","The copy quality is perfect, and the special features and menu options of the DVDs we copied are all intact and functioning. There aren&#39;t any watermarks or hidden identifiable markers within the copied movie. We were pleased with the fact that there wasn&#39;t any kind of distortion in the picture and that the quality remained top-notch.","While trying to copy a DVD to a CD, we did run into a problem. During the conversion from the ripped DVD to SVCD, an error message popped up and the application would not continue. We switched to a DVD medium and the application produced an excellent copy of the original DVD, complete with the menus and features."]},"id":"2a20f162-c46f-4fa2-99dd-7b51027b080b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1aef32fb-89bf-4755-8183-24953bb05101","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, DVD Wizard Pro is a terrific and versatile DVD copy software product.
