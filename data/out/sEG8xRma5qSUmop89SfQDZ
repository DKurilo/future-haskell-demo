You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The French press is the traditional method of making coffee, but the My French Press <a href=\"/best-single-cup-coffee-makers\">single-cup brewer</a> is a novel twist on the idea. Able to take K-Cups and ground coffee, it&#39;s a quick way to make your cup of joe in the morning.","With any manual system, you have to do some of the work yourself, but the My French Press single-cup brewer makes coffee creation easy. All you do is snap the K-Cup into place, add hot water to the top and slowly push the plunger down. You can then pour the coffee into your mug. The entire process takes seconds, although you have to add in the amount of time it takes to boil the water separately.","This coffee maker is an eco-friendly way to brew individual cups as it requires no electricity. Naturally, it doesn&#39;t have an auto shutoff, and strength control depends entirely on how hard you push down on it — the harder you push, the weaker the coffee will be. That&#39;s also a slight disadvantage as it requires a little practice to learn to operate it well. Because it doesn&#39;t need electricity, it&#39;s ideal when you need a cup of something when you&#39;re camping. You can boil the kettle over the fire and add your coffee into a refillable K-Cup (or use a prepacked K-Cup).","It&#39;s not exactly what you call elegant, though. It&#39;s strictly practical rather than an aesthetically pleasing showpiece. It&#39;s made out of plastic as well, so it doesn&#39;t exude style. What it does exude is coffee, and it does this fairly well, even without electricity. If a manual device just isn&#39;t for you, take a look at the <a href=\"/black-decker-review\">Black &amp; Decker Brew &#39;n Go</a>.","Naturally, this single-cup coffee maker can be used to make a number of different sizes of coffee, as you just need to put in the required amount of water each time. It doesn&#39;t have a real reservoir, as it&#39;s not an automated system.","We like this My French Press single-cup brewer because it is so simple, and it makes use of the K-Cup system without needing a relatively expensive brewer. What it does lack is the aesthetic appeal of many brewers, and of course you can&#39;t just leave it and have a shower while the coffee brews. However, it will function regardless of power, so it&#39;s a good backup to another single-cup coffee maker or as an alternative when you&#39;re camping."]},"id":"b85f0b5d-65c3-4037-86b2-9d8590884eb2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61300","url":"/cafejo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-25T23:08:41Z","datePublished":"2014-11-25T23:08:41Z","name":"Cafejo My French Press","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-25T23:08:41Z","id":"sEG8xRma5qSUmop89SfQDZ","meta":{"title":"Cafejo My French Press Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The My French Press single-cup brewer lets you brew cups, caplets, ground coffee and pods, all without electricity.
