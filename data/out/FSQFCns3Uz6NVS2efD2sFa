It is a strong choice for transferring more demanding media files, such as high-definition videos. In addition to being able to do the heavy lifting of data-rich file transfers, this USB drive has handy design features, and it offers some security for your files as well.","While the MicroVault&#39;s sequential read speed is great, its write speed only averaged 54MBps in our testing. This means that transferring files to the drive takes significantly longer than moving files off of the drive. The MicroVault has a respectable 4K read speed of 5.8MBps, but its 4K write speed is terrible, clocking in at only 0.2MBps in our testing. You certainly don&#39;t want to run an operating system on this flash drive.","The MicroVault includes preloaded EasyLock software, with which you can secure your files with military-grade 256-bit AES encryption. The major flaws with this flash drive, however, are its lack of password protection, the ability to create private folders and online data backup. Although this pen drive does not come with a full or partial cloud backup service as a virtual safety net, it does include the option to download the File Rescue software from the company&#39;s website. If your data, photo or video files become damaged or deleted, this software can help you recover them. Be aware, however, that there is no guarantee your data will be recoverable, and the included software doesn&#39;t support game data recovery.","One area in which this flash drive comes up short is the warranty department. With a memory stick of this price and quality, the manufacturer typically includes a lifetime warranty. Sony provides only a five-year warranty for this product."]},"id":"0c5ce467-a329-43db-8344-1911af365c86","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cfd41236-2a22-43f2-bd42-0ac196e773e6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony MicroVault Mach is an elite USB flash drive that&#39;s as fast as they come in the file-transfer business.
