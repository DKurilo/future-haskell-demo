That question has become obligatory whenever Apple debuts a new model of the wildly successful iPhone.","In the case of the Apple iPhone 4S, the answer is that you can expect many important upgrades and even some groundbreaking features. While there are always detractors who will hasten to point out what new smartphones don&#39;t offer, we found it easy to select the Apple iPhone 4S as our Top Ten Reviews Bronze Award winner.","The iPhone 4S is the first Apple cell phone to be available from the three largest U.S. carriers, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. AT&amp;T has the longest history with the iPhone, having been its exclusive carrier through the first three iterations of the device. With AT&amp;T, you get a 3G data network that is typically America&#39;s fastest. The downside is that in some regions, that network can be somewhat less reliable than the Verizon Wireless 3G network. The data load created by the popularity of iPhones has sometimes overwhelmed the AT&amp;T network, but the problem seems to have been largely resolved.","With Verizon Wireless, which already carries the iPhone 4, you arguably get the nation&#39;s largest and most reliable network. Though the two biggest carriers&#39; speed and reliability claims echo each company&#39;s advertisements, research substantiates those claims. The effect of the popular device&#39;s availability on Sprint&#39;s network remains to be seen."]},"id":"f63012f8-d3fc-41b6-8813-1e9fc557a206","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"61b25624-fef0-4ac9-be9c-9e00898d1ec5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/g24Gz9mytfEBsBDPmwgHi6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"From an external-design perspective, there&#39;s nothing new to report with the iPhone 4S. If you&#39;ve seen the iPhone 4, you&#39;ve seen the new arrival. Inside, though, it&#39;s a different story. At the heart of the device is its A5 processor – a dual-core CPU with a clock speed of 1GHz per core. It&#39;s the same processor that powers Apple&#39;s iPad 2 and is a fundamental reason that everything on this phone works so well. With the A5, overall device speed is double that of its predecessor, and graphics rendering is reported to be up to seven times as fast, making for superb gaming performance and web browsing.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/53780-apple-iphone-4s2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g24Gz9mytfEBsBDPmwgHi6.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"g24Gz9mytfEBsBDPmwgHi6","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g24Gz9mytfEBsBDPmwgHi6.jpg","alt":""},"id":"ac42151a-ef17-4304-a156-08a2f03b8dc7","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The new antenna design may garner less attention but it&#39;s equally significant. The cellular signal of the iPhone 4 could be compromised by things as insignificant as the manner in which the phone is held. The iPhone 4S has two antennas, each of which can both send and receive signals and has the computing power to choose the best one.","The face of the iPhone 4S is dominated by the same 3.5-inch touchscreen that we&#39;re accustomed to. Like its immediate predecessor, it features the remarkable Retina display. Packing 960-by-640-pixel resolution into the 3.5-inch screen results in a super dense 326 pixels per inch. In practical terms, that produces razor sharp images for photos, videos and gaming. It also allows you to zoom way in on web content to see as much detail as you could ever want without irritating pixilation.","The size of the iPhone 4S&#39; screen is a matter of some discussion. We once considered it huge by smartphone standards, but now, as the size of its competitors&#39; displays have ballooned, it&#39;s smaller than the competition. While larger displays are nice for watching videos and gaming, the device size they demand makes them rather unwieldy to use as telephones. Given the exceptional image quality of the iPhone 4S&#39; display and the way it feels to hold the device given its size, we&#39;re perfectly happy with 3.5 inches."]},"id":"5e810815-fa94-4932-b9a9-720441ffafc1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"e0e79264-007e-49e7-aab5-ebba446c44c8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Rs9e5HC97UsXAPCRX55Mfk.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The iPod Touch has set the standard for portable media players since its introduction, and the Apple iPhone 4S essentially has a built-in iPod Touch.

IPhones have been criticized in the past for having cameras that really didn&#39;t compare well to other top-ranked smartphones. With the iPhone 4S, that has all changed. The first and most obvious improvement is bumping the camera&#39;s sensor count up to 8MP. That puts it right up there with the best phone cameras available.","Digital photography is all about gathering and processing light, and the pixel count plays an important role, but there&#39;s much more to consider. As with any type of photography, quality optics are critical, and Apple has added a custom lens with five elements to optimally shape incoming light. The aperture is also a larger f2.4, so more light is available regardless of the shooting conditions. In addition to the sensor and the optics, the A5 CPU&#39;s image-processing capability is on par with many DSLR cameras.","Using the camera is simple. With face detection, it optimizes settings for a single subject or up to ten faces for group shots. You can also use the pinch-to-zoom and tap-to-focus features that allow you to instantly designate which portion of any scene is most important.","These features work for video recording as well.

That&#39;s always the case with AT&amp;T phones because they operate on the world-standard GSM system.
