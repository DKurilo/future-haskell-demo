You need to be at least 50 years old to join, and you must pay the organization’s $16 annual membership fee. You&#39;ll pay that membership fee in addition to the cost of the roadside assistance program.","The Road ‘N Tow plan, AARP’s lowest service plan level, costs $58 a year, which is about $5 a month. It’s one of the most affordable plans we reviewed and compares well against <a href=\"/allstate-motor-club-review\">Allstate</a> and <a href=\"/aaa-review\">AAA</a>. If you want to include your spouse on your plan, you must pay an additional $10. The Road ‘N Tow plan limits you to three service calls a year.","The Road ‘N Tow plan includes all the standard roadside assistance services. If your car breaks down, AARP provides 5 miles of free towing. In a city, that should be enough to get you to a service station. If your lock yourself out of your car, AARP reimburses you $60 for a lock replacement and $25 for a key replacement.","AARP’s Premier plan costs $74 a year, which is the lowest price we saw for premium roadside assistance. It costs $10 to add your spouse and $30 to add your family. Even with the costs for extra family members, AARP has below-average prices. The Premium plan is limited to four annual service calls for a single user, five for a couple and seven for a family subscription.","The Premier plan includes 100 miles of free towing, which is standard for premium plans. The locksmith reimbursement allotment also increases – up to $130. If you’re in an accident at least 100 miles from home, AARP’s trip interruption benefit reimburses you for food, lodging and car rental up to $750 per incident and $1,500 per year.","AARP’s Premier plan includes discounts on hotels and car rentals as well as access to other useful features like repair referrals and travel assistance. In addition, you get a dispatch guarantee, which reimburses you $260 for services you find yourself if AARP is unable to find them for you."]},"id":"dde10a7b-dcb0-4657-bf72-5a23c110b055","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59340","url":"/aarp-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-15T20:16:08Z","datePublished":"2014-04-15T20:16:08Z","name":"AARP Roadside Assistance","synopsis":"AARP’s roadside assistance is available to anyone eligible to join AARP.
