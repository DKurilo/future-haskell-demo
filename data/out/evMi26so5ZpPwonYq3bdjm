The Hebrew keyboard displays an on-screen keyboard with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet arranged in order to ease data entry.

To add additional facts like addresses, events and attributes, medical history or notes to individual profiles, just double click. Sourcing entries takes only one click, so it&#39;s an easy program for beginners and professionals with piles of records to enter. It&#39;s always best to put your most reliable resources first by using the rating system for each source.","DoroTree also features a special Holocaust symbol that enables you to mark Holocaust victims in your database or family tree printouts to commemorate their passing."]},"id":"89a9ed11-9712-4596-acb8-05db593fdefb","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Xn6oDynpAYhGKK7tPUcUh.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"important family events.
