You’ll spend nearly all your time using the application’s single screen interface that consists of two options: “Add a Blu-ray Disk” and “Start Copying.” If you have operated a computer before, you should be able to make your way around this straightforward application.","One of the most fundamental aspects of any Blu-ray ripper is the ability to remove the copy protections found on commercial Blu-ray discs. Blu-ray to DVD Copy claims to have this ability. However, we have been unable to successfully decrypt a commercial DVD.","Our first attempt to convert a Blu-ray to a DVD using this software was halted with an error message that said the Blu-ray disc we were using was too new and could not be decrypted. We then attempted to make a copy of a Blu-ray disc that was at least 4 years old. We encountered the same error message that we saw on our first attempt.","This leads us to the inescapable conclusion that Blu-ray to DVD’s decryption codes are either wildly outdated or simply ineffective. Whichever is the case, the inability to decode Blu-ray discs in practice severely hampers the application’s usefulness.","We were eventually able to convert a Blu-ray disc that had no copy protection codes. The process was simple, smooth and speedy. We didn’t encounter any problems during the conversion or burning aspects of the test. The results were a DVD that played flawlessly in every player we tested it in."]},"id":"6203ee60-da20-47d4-8aa6-22a72acc8467","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"57769d1a-0fde-40e5-bbab-cd9a7312ba4f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Iovsoft Blu-ray to DVD is an application that doesn’t quite live up to the promise it makes to consumers.
