The camera&#39;s 1080p video produces impressive results in all lighting situations, day and night. It has a minor quirk with Wi-Fi connection that can cause problems, but it&#39;s not a deal breaker.","With the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro, you get 1080p video quality with clear, sharp images. When we tested it at this resolution, the camera had some trouble streaming video live. There was a several-second delay between real-world movement and when it showed up on the video feed. We got around this by adjusting the camera&#39;s video quality to a lower setting, which effectively eliminated lag at the cost of a little clarity. This is a helpful option that&#39;s not present in some home security cameras.","In our night video tests, the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro performed very well. It had one of the best examples of total-darkness recording in our review. While we weren&#39;t able to read every line on a white poster board at 16 feet from the camera, we could make out some of the text. This wireless security camera also offers two-way audio, which works like an intercom between your mobile phone and the app. The audio is good, but it lacks the quality of the top performer in our audio tests, theÂ <a href=\"/foscam-review\">Foscam C2</a>.","During our tests, the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro lost its Wi-Fi connection three times. Each time, we confirmed that our Wi-Fi network wasn&#39;t at fault. This connection performance was below average among the cameras in our review.","The Samsung SmartCam relies on a microSD card to store your video, supporting cards with a capacity up to 64GB. To prevent your memory card from filling up too fast, you can adjust the video resolution or set up the camera to only record video when it detects motion or sound. There is no cloud storage option on this camera, which can be an inconvenience but means no subscription fees.","Currently, very few wireless security cameras support smart home systems, but the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro is one of them. You can connect this camera to the Samsung SmartThings DIY home automation system. SmartThings can control the camera and give it extra capabilities such as scheduled recording and reacting to when you leave the house.","The Samsung SmartCam HD Pro has a one-year warranty, similar to that of comparable security cameras. Samsung offers direct customer support over email, telephone and live chat. To solve hardware and software issues on your own, you can take advantage of a library of tutorials and FAQs on its website."]},"id":"90032b52-afe6-4765-85c8-43d8089c9804","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f0b64293-6b4c-4229-846d-a966d282aecb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung SmartCam HD Pro is a very good home security camera.
