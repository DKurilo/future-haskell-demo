Using biometric systems such as fingerprint readers can greatly increase the security of your electronic devices, including your personal computer, company computers and the priceless data on your devices. Laptops often come with built-in fingerprint readers so that users can make their data more secure, but not all of them. If you are concerned about the security of your computer, a fingerprint reader may provide the secure, convenient protection you need. Three scanners that are popular within the markert are the <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Verifi P2000</a>, <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Fingkey Hamster II</a> and the <a href=\"/money/small-business\">BioMini</a>.","<strong><strong>Fingerprint Readers: What to Look For</strong></strong>","Fingerprint readers are often very similar to each other as far as technical specifications go. Reading a person s fingerprints does not require extremely complex hardware or software. The important thing for most people to look for, then, is the size and weight of the fingerprint reader. After all, you don t want a massive eyesore hogging valuable desk space next to your sleek new computer.","<strong>DPI (Dots per Inch)</strong><br/>The friction ridges on your fingers form patterns that are entirely unique to you. The exact arches and whorls on your fingers, when viewed up close, are not duplicated anywhere in nature. But because these unique differences are extremely small and subtle, it is important that fingerprint readers have the ability to image your fingers in great detail. The term DPI stands for  Dots per Inch,  which is an indication of visual fidelity   essentially how much information is available within an inch of space on an image. A DPI rating of around 500 is common for consumer fingerprint readers. A fingerprint reader with a low DPI will not offer incredible security because a blurry image of your finger notes fewer data points than a high-resolution image.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"58fe3299-bb28-4824-b669-398b49f302ef","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Fingerprint readers can be used for many purposes, so you should make sure you get one that fits your needs.
