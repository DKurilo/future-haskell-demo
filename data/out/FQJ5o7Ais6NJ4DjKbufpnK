The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-mac-internet-security-software\">Mac Internet Security</a> here.</em>","eScan Anti-Virus Security for Mac is in our Mac security software  review because it excelled  during Mac malware detection tests at the independent software lab, AV-Test. Unfortunately, if you take into account the rather brief feature list and significant effect on system performance, eScan does not compete among the best internet security for Mac products. Nevertheless it is second to none when it comes to malware detection. Furthermore it delivers excellent customer support.","eScan achieved perfect scores in Mac malware detection tests at AV-Test (September of 2014). The tests were for two kinds of detection. An on-demand test included 117 malware samples for discovery via scans. Another test measured the background virus checker while the lab copied 84 infected files from one folder to another. Just three competitors matched eScan’s detection rates.","eScan’s malware detection efficiency imposes considerable cost on system performance. The lab measured impact on performance by timing the copying of 7.3GB of data on a Mac running OS X 10.9.4 without any Mac security, which established a baseline at 17.2 seconds. The lab then repeated the test after installing eScan Anti-Virus Security for Mac and reported that it took 40.4 seconds to copy the same 7.3GB of data. There were competitors that took only a second or two longer than the control experiment.","eScan has a good user interface, as do all of the Apple security products we looked at. It watches for threats that lie dormant until they awaken. It also watches for threats that arrive via the internet. This software scans on schedule or whenever required. It also detects threats from removable storage such USB flash drives, discs or portable hard drives. What’s missing are features such as the ability to detect Windows malware, antiphishing, the ability to scan email for threats, parental controls and a firewall.","The publisher of eScan offers a level of service above and beyond most players in the market. You can reach support any day and any hour via live chat or email. Less than half of the competitors in our review match eScan’s help and support."]},"id":"6a2ff8b8-abe7-4bc7-8a7e-41d90358fcdd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"011c9646-1683-4252-b5b9-57d15aea10ee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["eScan is excellent malware protection for Mac even though its malware detection rates cost system performance.
