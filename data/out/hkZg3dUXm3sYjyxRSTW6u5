Software designed to spy on your internet activity is called spyware, and it can infect your computer without you even knowing it until the damage is done. <strong>Anti-spyware</strong> and <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">anti-virus software</a> can help safeguard you against these common threats.","Whether you have a home computer, notebook computer, smartphone or other wireless device, if you have access to the internet, you are vulnerable to attack. Good anti-spyware software will update regularly and inspect your device to ensure that malicious software is not hiding where you cannot find it. If your computer is suddenly running much slower than usual, certain applications are not functioning properly or you are getting error messages, you probably need to run an anti-spyware scan.","The best anti-virus software offers anti-spyware protection as part of the package. In this case, scanning your computer for known viruses will also scan for spyware signatures. Your virus scan may take longer, but your computer will be cleaner and will run more efficiently once all the malicious software is removed.","So, what does anti-spyware software do? Anti-spyware software removes spyware designed to keep track of the websites you visit, the keys you press, the advertisements you respond to and any other activity they are programmed to record. That information is then transmitted to whoever is collecting that data. On the surface, the purpose of the software is to inform advertisers of your habits and interests so that they can offer you more relevant advertising. Unfortunately, the information gathered can sometimes include personal information such as names, addresses, bank account information, social security numbers and other sensitive information.","Once these programs cross the line into malicious activity, they are commonly referred to as malware and legally referred to as computer contaminants. People who find their devices infected with contaminants have little recourse since they often have agreed to the installation of the software without realizing it. Here&#39;s how it works.","You find free software online   also called freeware   that you would like to have and you download it. During the download and installation process, a window pops up on your computer with a standard licensing agreement. Most people do not read the fine print. If they did, they would find it often includes permission to download and install adware, which is software that displays advertisements to the user.","By agreeing to download and install the freeware, you are also agreeing to download and install the adware. Acceptance also includes permission for the adware to transmit information about your computing habits to the developers. The adware has now become spyware. Now anti-spyware software is necessary to remove it because you did not read the licensing agreement and do not even know it is there.","Possibly the greatest benefit of installing anti-spyware software is the ability to immunize your computer to known contaminant signatures. Once the software is finished scanning your device and comparing its files to a list of known adware and contaminant signatures, it creates a virtual barricade that blocks those signatures from being installed on your device. Running an anti-spyware scan on a regular basis can provide peace of mind and keep your computer healthy with minimal effort.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "," "]},"id":"7c7db65e-4446-4457-9d26-03f042742d62","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6444","url":"/antivirus-and-anti-spyware-software-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-computer","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"denise-ferreira","url":"/author/denise-ferreira","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Denise Ferreira","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"sU7VAACANGjQPTh6T934a5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-15T14:35:07Z","datePublished":"2011-08-15T14:35:07Z","name":"Antivirus and Anti-Spyware Software: The Cure for What Ails Your Computer","synopsis":"Information is the key to success, and spying is an age-old method of discovering information that other people do not want you to have.","review":{},"strapline":"Information is the key to success, and spying is an age-old method of discovering information that other people do not want you to have.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-15T14:36:52Z","id":"hkZg3dUXm3sYjyxRSTW6u5","meta":{"title":"Antivirus and Anti-Spyware Software: The Cure for What Ails Your Computer","description":"Your computer is infected with spyware and, more than likely, you gave permission for it to happen."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:58:32Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/rdE7kLeiVAgFht7JvBTs9m.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:58:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"6444-antivirus-and-anti-spyware-software-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-computer.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6444-antivirus-and-anti-spyware-software-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-computer.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:58:32Z","id":"rdE7kLeiVAgFht7JvBTs9m","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rdE7kLeiVAgFht7JvBTs9m.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Antivirus and Anti-Spyware Software: The Cure for What Ails Your Computer","description":"Your computer is infected with spyware and, more than likely, you gave permission for it to happen."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/rdE7kLeiVAgFht7JvBTs9m.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:58:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"6444-antivirus-and-anti-spyware-software-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-computer.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6444-antivirus-and-anti-spyware-software-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-computer.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:58:32Z","id":"rdE7kLeiVAgFht7JvBTs9m","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rdE7kLeiVAgFht7JvBTs9m.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Antivirus and Anti-Spyware Software: The Cure for What Ails Your Computer","description":"Your computer is infected with spyware and, more than likely, you gave permission for it to happen."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/antivirus-and-anti-spyware-software-the-cure-for-what-ails-your-computer","label":"","tags":[]}
