Another good reason to have your own personal cappuccino maker is that you have the option to add a little or a lot of sweetener to your latte. Because this steam espresso machine uses steam pressure, it will take about two minutes to heat up and be ready to start brewing espresso.","The 303 espresso maker has a removable drip tray. This will aid in the clean-up process after a morning of great lattes and espressos. It is also handy to have a grate-style drip tray for the times when you remove the carafe before the coffee has been completely dispensed to help you keep your kitchen neat, tidy and free from coffee stains.","For those who tend to like their java a bit more robust and flavorful, this espresso machine offers a coffee and steam wand that you can use to adjust the potency of your coffee. If you prefer a bit less vigor to your morning espresso, simply move the wand to the steam side to add a bit more water. This will allow you to share your espresso maker with those around you who prefer a stronger or milder taste you do and still keep everyone happy.","It would have been nice to see this espresso machine come with a removable water reservoir. However, the carafe is easily removable and holds just enough water to make the perfect shot of espresso. Chances are you won&#39;t even miss having a refillable water tank with the other great features this espresso machine offers.","The Capresso 303 comes with a dishwasher-safe carafe for quick and easy clean-up. By using a dishwasher to clean your carafe, you are more likely to ward off germs that could be lurking in the corners. The heat from your dishwasher will sanitize your carafe.","Capresso offers a significant list of help resources that include comparison charts, instruction booklets, quick-reference guides and a list of FAQs. In addition, the company offers information on its warranties and product registration. You can contact Capresso using its toll-free customer service hotline. The nice thing about this company&#39;s customer service is that there are people available to answer your questions on Saturdays."]},"id":"011f7cad-53b7-4bcf-9428-3592ac2341c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f2688d77-b8fa-405d-a1fa-7a1409c85bda","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It would have been nice to see this espresso machine come with a removable water tank for easier filling.
