You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE 28522 phone line supplies some basic and useful characteristics for people who are not interested in paying high-end prices for high-end extras, but who want a solid <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phone</a> system for either the home or office.","The GE 28522AE4 model comes with four handsets, which would be plenty in most homes. However, you cannot add any other handsets to the base station.","The all-white GE 28522AE4 is a sleek-looking phone with light-blue backlighting for its LCD screens and buttons. This phone provides eight hours of talk time, which is not a great deal, but which might work well in many instances depending on the level of phone use. You get 20 minutes of recorded messages, which is quite helpful since it is as long as or longer than many higher-end cordless phones.","This phone is equipped with the excellent DECT 6.0 technology, which guarantees you great sound clarity, so both getting and receiving calls should be enjoyable; you will be able to clearly hear whatever is being said. This also ensures that your landline phone system will not conflict with the many other wireless devices that are becoming standard items in nearly every household.","The handsets are equipped with speakerphones, you can access messages through handsets, and you can choose from 10 different ringtones.","The phonebook is on the small side as it holds only 30 items, which is a reasonable but not remarkable amount. One nice feature is that the phonebook provides alphabetical phonebook searching, which will undoubtedly save time. The same holds true for the caller ID, which also holds only 30 items. For the redial function, you get five items.","The GE 28522AE4 offers call conferencing, an alarm and a headset jack. You also get the useful intercom function, which will come in handy if you need to summon all the employees of your small business or all the people in your household for whatever reason."]},"id":"d8daf231-1d43-40be-a42f-1bc732531a44","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2b43bd20-9ef8-4cd6-b957-30c8d24baa6d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE 28522AE4 cordless phone is an all-around bargain if you need only basic phone functionality and versatility, and if you are looking for something  that looks bright and attractive in your home or office."]},"id":"c15bfe43-ba2b-4e6d-85db-c429827266a3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57665","url":"/ge-28522-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-02T13:52:24Z","datePublished":"2013-10-02T13:52:24Z","name":"GE 28522 AE4","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"verdict":"The GE 28522AE4 model gives you four handsets, great sound quality and other helpful, but generally basic, cordless phone amenities.","pros":["You get DECT 6.0 technology for good sound clarity."],"cons":["You cannot add extra handsets."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-02T13:52:24Z","id":"wm2YbYTMkwhhsuWN6eKuYe","meta":{"title":"GE 28522 AE4 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The GE 28522 cordless phone provides four handsets and the sound quality of DECT 6.0 technology.
