They are intended to be easy to install, which can save money when it comes to paying anyone to install solar panels on the roof of your home.","These solar panels provide a solar efficiency rating of 14.4 percent, which is a respectable rate, but still the lowest of the solar panels in our product lineup.","These solar panels offer a decent 235-watt maximum power, with 29.2 volts of maximum power voltage and 8.05 amps as the top power current. These are designed to hold 60 cells per panel.","The Sharp ND-F2Q235 model has the following dimensions  64.6 inches long, 39.1 inches wide and 2.1 inches deep, and it weighs 46.7 pounds. It can operate nicely in temperatures ranging from 40 degrees below zero to 194 F. Since the panels are manufactured in both the United States and Japan, they qualify as American Made goods.","Although rain alone can wash away plenty of dust and bird droppings, you can clean the Sharp solar panels with soap and water. There are fairly simple tools on the market that can you can use to manually wipe down each panel or you can, for a relatively small amount of money, install an automatic system that sprays soapy water and then rinse water.","You get a 25-year warranty on power output, guaranteeing 10 years at 90 percent of the minimum power rated output and 15 years at 80 percent. Sharp also offers a 10-year warranty on the module&#39;s materials and workmanship, which means the firm will replace or repair any panels that are deemed defective through no fault of the buyer.","However, the warranty does not apply if the panels are installed incorrectly, have been moved from the original home on which they were installed, are exposed to acid rain or have been exposed to unusual power voltages or surges."]},"id":"2087fe30-84d1-4d76-a133-f484bc8e82aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8f25f350-d1bf-4cbf-ba70-4e9d71d75cd6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sharp has been manufacturing solar panels for 50 years and is a known quantity in the solar industry.
