Instead, with the added ability to identify studs and wires, it offers the versatility of multiple tools in one.","BullsEye falls short of other models on leveling features. It only projects 20 feet and has a fan angle of 40 degrees â€“ one of the lowest of all the laser line levels we reviewed. This means your beams won&#39;t project as wide or as far compared to other levels. For the quick job at home, this works just fine, but it would be problematic for larger jobs. It also cannot project cross beams. It does have a self-leveling pendulum to quickly set the lines straight within five seconds of set up, but it can&#39;t lock the pendulum in place, project angles or project vertical lines. It projects two horizontal beams on either side of the device. Overall, the leveling features are very basic compared to other products we reviewed.","The device has an LED screen that alerts you to studs or wires behind the wall. That is a very handy feature for the occasional job so you don&#39;t miss the stud and damage the wall or drill into a live wire. It also has an easy-to-use on switch and buttons to turn the device sensors on.","The BullsEye has limited mount options. In order to use it you have to hold it up to the wall or mount it to the wall by using the felt attachments on the back of the device that would stick to tape or Velcro strips; otherwise, you will need to use a pushpin or nail to hold the device in place. This can be inconvenient, considering you have to buy Velcro strips or put nail holes in the wall just to project the beams.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"d50ee8a2-4d8a-46d9-b890-6a1e799a4637","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"85a2b542-c095-4838-b51a-21bf77c16310","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This device has a solid two-year warranty, and Black &amp; Decker offers customer support, but this model doesn&#39;t offer the advanced leveling or projection features of other laser line levels.
