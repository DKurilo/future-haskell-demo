You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Home computers must be designed with the user in mind. They will likely be the primary computing device for several users and they must contain features to satisfy each individual’s needs. The Dell Inspiron 580 is a device that covers the basic computing needs. It may not provide the most advanced version of each feature, but the basics are available and provided for users. Visit our <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">home computer</a> page for more side-by-side comparisons and objective reviews on other highly-ranked products."]},"id":"1e9d2ba7-892a-4747-8e86-aedb12ce6a0e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"fe4893b3-e3d0-41a1-bfc5-081ea0b0cb67","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The first thing you will notice about this computing device is its appearance. The Dell Inspiron 580 features a sleek, slim and handsome look with a black front, chrome trim ring and a silver graphic design. There is no option to customize the appearance of the computing device, so if the overall look does not appeal to you, this may not be the right computing device for you.","The Inspiron 580 features the Intel core i3 and Intel core i5 processor as the computing device’s power options. Both of these processing systems will provide high quality performance so it just depends on what you are looking for and what type of power you need to run the tasks on your device.  However, both of these processors allow for strong multitasking capabilities. The ability to switch between tasks quickly and to open multiple applications at once works well on this device.","You can store hundreds of music, movies and photos on this Dell model. With the option of up to a 1TB hard drive and 8GB of memory, there is plenty of storage and memory available. However, this is the highest amount of memory you can place on your computing device, and the basic options available provide a significant amount of storage.","Graphics are important for any home computing device as these computers are frequently used for a little gaming, video editing and watching videos. This Dell product provides an integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD and there is the option of upgrading up to 1024MB NVIDIA GeForce GT220.  These graphic cards are ideal for streaming videos on the device but if serious gaming will be done on this computing device, you will be disappointed.","The Dell Inspiron 580 offers several connectivity options. Two USB ports, headphone connector and microphone connector are located on the front of the device. The rear ports include a VGA connector, HDMI connector, 4 USB ports, RJ45 10/100 network port, microphone connector, line-out connector and line-in connector. Also a Blu-Ray disc and Blu-ray disc burner are the optical disc options found on this Dell product.  <br/><br/>"]},"id":"0e085122-fd15-464b-a2a1-224df01c2388","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"64add87e-a4c7-48cf-a4ba-6bdd2fea23a8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dell Inspiron 580 is not the most advanced home computing device on the market today.
