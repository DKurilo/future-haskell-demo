The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</a> here.</em>","The Whirlpool WMH73521CS is a basic over-the-range microwave. It has most of the features we look for, and it has more power and capacity than microwaves with the lowest ratings. While the price is not outrageous compared to similar models, it is more expensive than many on our lineup.","Although some models in the Whirlpool WMH series offer convection for a higher price, the WMH73521CS does not. However, all models in this series have sensor cooking. Sensor cooking helps eliminate guesswork when microwaving because humidity sensors can determine how done your food is by detecting the amount of moisture in your food. You won&#39;t have to stop and check the temperature of your favorite dish and add more time accordingly, because the sensors do that for you. This over-range microwave also uses sensors to steam food by quickly raising the temperature to boiling and then decreasing it to maintain the simmer.","Automatic reheat and defrost are handy features of this above-range microwave. They have pre-programmed cycles to bring your leftovers back up to the perfect temperature or to defrost your frozen meats and veggies within minutes. No matter what you&#39;re cooking or reheating, the keep warm function will make sure your food stays at the ideal temperature if you aren&#39;t ready to eat right when it finishes cooking.","This built-in microwave has standard exterior dimensions, so it will fit in most kitchens. The 2.1 cubic feet of interior space provides ample cooking room, but if you find yourself needing more room, the rack will essentially double the amount of food you can cook. Models with convection cooking also include a baking rack, which is nice because the convection models have less interior space, as do the cheapest models of the series.","The WMH73521CS is a powerful over-range microwave with 1,100 watts and 10 adjustable power levels. Other WMH models only have 1,000 watts of power, but that is typical in over-the-range microwaves.","The hood and ventilation system is standard, venting either to the exterior of your house or filtering and recirculating air within your kitchen. The hidden vent makes the microwave look streamlined. The fan&#39;s airflow will clear the air at 400 cubic feet per minute, which is above average. The fan has four different speed settings, and it will automatically turn on at the lowest setting if your microwave detects smoke or too much heat coming from your stovetop. The hood has cooktop lights to help you avoid messes on your range, and the nightlight will provide illumination when it&#39;s dark.","As previously mentioned, this over-range microwave is pretty plain and boxy. It won&#39;t necessarily wow anyone, but the basic aesthetic design is still nice-looking. It comes in five different colors options, so it is a good fit for many color palettes. You can choose black with stainless steel features, stainless steel with black features, all black, white ice or white.","The manufacturer warranty is a bit disappointing, covering a standard one-year on parts and labor but no extra coverage on the magnetron â€“ the main cooking component. The website is easy to navigate. On the website, you can find the phone number and email address for customer service or take advantage of the live chat option."]},"id":"9ba00885-773c-4120-bc67-db17306c9d16","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97beacde-329d-4e6a-b737-68053cc47dd3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Whirlpool WMH73521CS has all the basic features we look for in over-the-range microwave ovens in a modern design.
