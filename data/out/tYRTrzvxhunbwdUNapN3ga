This left us with a not-so-tight seal. Oftentimes, we had to reinsert and adjust the earbuds during our workouts. The tips aren&#39;t as comfortable as others, mainly because they just felt loose. Just as Goldilocks struggled to find a bed that was just the right size, these earbud tips were either too small or too large.
