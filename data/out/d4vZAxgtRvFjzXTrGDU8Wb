ESky&#39;s E-500 is just the opposite, stretching almost 2 feet from tail to rotor tip. While no remote control helicopter fares well in windy conditions, the E-500&#39;s weight and girth help keep it stable in breezes that would send its smaller brethren spiraling out of control.","ESky&#39;s copter isn&#39;t intended for trick flying or traversing obstacle courses; it doesn&#39;t have the requisite maneuverability. The helicopter weighs almost a full pound and features a co-axial rotor system and crossbar stabilizer. These give it exceptional stability but prevent the sort of intense leans that let you rapidly dart around an area. That said, with four-channel control, the E-500 can sideslip to the left and right without changing its orientation, which is a lot more than many smaller copters can claim.","The E-500&#39;s radio transmitter is as much of a beast as the helicopter it controls. It&#39;s powered by four AA batteries and operates on the 2.4GHz band. This means the transmitter is highly resistant to interference and can control the E-500 up to about 275 feet away. That said, we still recommend flying the RC helicopter in a wide field, away from power lines or radio towers, for an optimal experience.","Flying the E-500 in a big field doesn’t just help keep you in control, it also minimize the possibility of crashes. The copter has a plastic hull that&#39;s not particularly durable, and its weight makes impacts significantly more damaging than they are on smaller, lighter RC helicopters we reviewed. Our test model experienced its fair share of crashes, shearing rotor blades and dislodging the landing skids. Eventually, it got damaged enough that its parts wouldn’t stop shaking, and the helicopter actually tore itself apart in midair. The moral of this story is to check the helicopter after every crash, and bring along a repair kit with superglue, tape and replacement parts."]},"id":"97971c24-7b4d-45f5-a24c-3251a4082ef2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3979786d-eee7-4bc1-87f7-a6c2cc75289f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While we&#39;re not quite ready to say that ESky&#39;s E-500 is one of the best RC helicopters you can buy, it&#39;s certainly one of the biggest and is very easy to fly, even for beginners.
