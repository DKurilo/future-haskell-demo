You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","HP’s ENVY Recline <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one PC</a> is flexible, and not just because it can position itself from 5 to 145 degrees. The computer is versatile and comes in several customizable setups with an array of price points. You can select from a 23-inch version or a more expensive 27-inch model.","The ENVY Recline gets its name for its ability to contort in several positions. This is due to its two hinges: one pivots up or down from the base and the other adjusts the screen&#39;s angle. If you wanted to, you could adjust the screen so it hangs off your desk directly over your lap so you could easily use its touchscreen. Or you could angle it in a way so it’s more comfortable to use while standing. Pivoting is smooth, and the stand is sturdy. You don’t have to worry about it toppling over, and you can adjust the computer with just one hand.","This all-in-one computer weighs 27 pounds and doesn’t have an internal battery so it&#39;s meant to stay on your desk. This touchscreen all-in-one PC has a 1920 x 1080p resolution and features 10-point touch capability, which means you can operate it with both hands. The screen is crisp and clear.","This all-in-one desktop computer is powered by an Intel Core i3 CPU, the 4130T processor to be specific. Its 2.9GHz speed and 8GB of RAM allow you to multitask. The computer is powerful enough for daily use, but other computers are faster and have more up-to-date processors. The computer is also equipped with a 1TB hard drive, which is plenty of storage for all your media. The base model doesn’t have a solid-state drive though, but you can upgrade to one for an additional cost. It also doesn’t have a dedicated graphics card. Instead, it relies on the Intel HD Graphics 4400 card.","The personal computer comes with a wireless keyboard and mouse. It has five USB ports: two USB 3.0 ports on the side and three USB 2.0 on the base as well as a card reader. It’s slightly annoying when using the ports on the side since cords get in the way. The device also lacks a disk drive. Fortunately, there’s an HDMI input for connecting your game console or Blu-ray player. One of the ENVY Recline’s major selling points is its speakers. It’s outfitted with Beats Audio and sounds much cleaner and less muffled than other all-in-one computers.","HP offers a one-year warranty that covers repairs and includes phone, email and chat support. A one-year warranty is standard among most all-in-one machines, but if a year isn&#39;t enough, you can upgrade your warranty and services to three years for an additional fee."]},"id":"34a4804c-63eb-48b7-8572-78443d0f223e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"04ca6ae3-2c8b-4171-9e34-a085f23b76ce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP ENVY Recline puts a new spin on all-in-one PCs.
