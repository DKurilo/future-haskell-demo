You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When you examine 007 DVD Copy’s list of features, it appears to be adequate <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a>. It has an acceptable list of features, a great website, decent help and support options, and the ability to convert various video formats for the iPhone and iPad. Unfortunately, in practice this DVD copy software does not function in a manner that most users would consider acceptable.","The software itself installs and runs with minimal problems; discs are scanned, ripped and compressed in what is seemingly an error-free process. However, when it comes time to burn that copied content onto a new disc, 007 DVD Copy would not burn to the DVD disc. It was unable to recognize the burner or media we were testing the product on, and after several tries, were still unable to get a finished product.","Ostensibly, 007 DVD Copy allows you to compress a DVD-9 to a DVD-5, choose to retain or omit bonus material, remove region codes, convert video games to DVD and add a menu. However, this DVD copy software application does not include any advanced features such as the ability to adjust write speed, support multiple languages or convert VHS to DVD, and we were disappointed with the supported configuration. We did like the list of tutorials available to preview on 007 DVD Copy&#39;s website, as well as the help and support options.","We found the interface of this DVD copy software extremely easy to use; however, its lack of additional features make it a little too simplistic and we do not recommend it for seasoned DVD burners. We had zero issues with installing 007 DVD Copy. When it came time to actually begin our copy process and get a finished product, however, we were unable to make a copy of our selected DVD. Unfortunately, we were unable to copy a DVD disc using this DVD copy application. It successfully ripped and compressed a DVD, but when it came time to burn, the software was unable to recognize the media we were using.","In general, this DVD cloner is stable. We had no problems while running it and it did not stop responding, but the whole process did not even work. We would have rather had a few glitches and still been able to burn a finished disc than have the false hope given to us by a perfect installation, rip and compression. The rating for this application may seem harsh when looking at the list of features, but if we, a technical review company, were unable to rip and burn a DVD correctly, then you are sure to have trouble as well."]},"id":"5dbd0ab2-b88e-4bef-978c-ae96fd39cb42","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aeb95830-66cf-41ad-a4bd-adb13ab738b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["007 DVD Copy has a great list of features, it was simple to install and the process of burning the DVD disc was also easy to understand, but when it came right down to actually burning a DVD, the entire process failed.
