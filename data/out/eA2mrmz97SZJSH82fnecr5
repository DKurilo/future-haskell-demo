A sound bar is a perfect addition to a small home theater. The Panasonic HTB 880 simulates immersive surround sound and has an attractive low-profile design. Panasonic has built a reputation of delivering complete home theater experiences. You can add this Panasonic sound bar to nearly any home theater to lend your movie watching more powerful, realistic sound.","One of the benefits the name-brand companies have over the smaller competition is components from the same brand work well together. Most Panasonic peripherals play well with each other. So if you own a Panasonic LED TV and Blu-ray player and you add the Panasonic sound bar, your system will connect easier, the components will recognize each other and you may even be able to run all your equipment through a single remote.","The Panasonic HTB 880â€™s sound falls a little short in our home theater tests. The sound is kind of hallow and lacks the depth that the top sound bars produce. It disperses sound throughout the room fairly well, though, and outperforms many of the other devices in our sound bar review.","This Panasonic has one of the most ergonomic and economic designs we&#39;ve seen. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but it is small enough to fit with most any home theater setup without getting in the way. This bar is designed to be placed under a TV or mounted on a wall where it can add sound without distracting from the aesthetic. This sound bar comes with a wireless sub as well."]},"id":"fdd69179-643f-430c-8e1d-ae91aa16b56e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a291c054-d9bd-460a-a200-57006a0302e2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic HTB 880 is one of the premier products on the sound bar market.
