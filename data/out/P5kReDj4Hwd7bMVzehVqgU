These speakers accurately reproduce music the way it was intended to be listened to, which is exactly what you want from your speakers. When it comes to accurate sound reproduction and overall sound quality, these bookshelf speakers are hard to beat.","As important as its frequency response is, the most impressive and distinguishing specification of the Klipsch B-20 bookshelf speakers is the sensitivity rating. This measures how well a speaker converts electrical energy into sound. Speakers that have a high sensitivity rating use far less power than speakers with a low rating. At 92.5 decibels, these speakers are notably more efficient than any other speakers we reviewed. This ability to efficiently convert electricity to sound provides less strain on the speakers and produces better sound quality. Klipsch has a knack for creating great-sounding, efficient speakers.","The amount of amplifier power required to effectively drive a pair of speakers doesn’t tell you how good they will sound, but it is important to know with regard to matching electronic components with the right speakers. Klipsch doesn’t state a specific minimum input wattage, but it’s impressive to note that it will handle a substantial 85W of power on a continuous basis – quite a feat for bookshelf speakers of this size. It will also handle peak power, or transients, of up to 340W. That can be particularly important when watching films with explosions or similar sound effects. It will also handle the most dramatic of musical crescendos.","The Klipsch B-20 is magnetically shielded. This guards against interference from other devices, in particular CRT televisions or monitors.
