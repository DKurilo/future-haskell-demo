In areas where a pool is not usable year round, winter pool covers help to keep pools cleaner and safer around children. Covering a pool when not in use helps keep the water from evaporating, stop the chemicals from leaching out and reduce the amount of time spent doing maintenance. Some pool covers include the <a href=\"/arctic-armor-review\">Arctic Armor 18 x 36 Ultra Light Pool Cover</a>, <a href=\"/meyco-review\">Meyco 20 x 40 ft. Rectangle Meyco Safety Pool Cover</a> and <a href=\"/midwest-canvas-review\">Midwest Canvas 18ft Round Protector Winter Pool Cover</a>.","Using pool covers saves on energy costs since a cover helps retain heat, reducing the energy needed to run your pool heater. In unheated pools, a solar cover raises the water temperature, making it more comfortable for swimmers. Pool covers also keep debris from entering the water, reducing the amount of time needed to run the filter, which saves energy costs.","<strong>Pool Covers: What to Look For</strong>","Pool covers are available in many materials, fastener types, sizes and with different warranties. Durability and strength of a pool cover are important consideration as well as rustproof anchors and fasteners. Learn what is available to choose the right one for your pool.","<strong>Construction</strong><br/>Pool covers may be made of mesh or solid materials. Common materials include coated fabric, mesh or flexible plastic such as vinyl, or polypropylene, normally in the form of a resin. Mesh pool covers are lighter weight, while solid pool covers provide more protection against light to inhibit algae growth. A major difference is that water cannot accumulate on the top of a mesh cover but can on many solid covers.","<strong>Anchors</strong><br/>Many pool covers come with grommets to attach cords or cables as tie-downs. Others covers are oversized, using water-filled tubes or some other type of weight to hold the cover in place. Solar covers have no anchors and float on the surface. Pools equipped with automatic or semi-automatic in-ground pool covers do not require anchors since they run along a track. In pool covers with grommets, rust-resistance can be an important consideration. The underside of a pool cover can also be important, since a darker underside on some covers provides more algae-growth resistance.","<strong>Pool &amp; Cover Size</strong><br/>Solar covers fit inside the pool, while others overlap the edges by several feet to allow for tie-downs or weights. You can also have custom pool covers made to fit. The size you choose depends on the type of pool you own, the type of cover you want and how you want to secure the pool cover.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>You find warranties for pool covers from short coverage to many years. These warranties generally are much longer for more costly, better-made covers.","Pool covers provide protection and can lower maintenance and the cost of chemicals for your pool. Finding one that suits your needs is simpler if you know what options are available."]},"id":"5c9f1cad-39e7-4aa0-b6fe-98e50301872f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"1c92480d-297e-4e8a-bfbc-3dd4c975f443","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.allsafepool.com/automatic-pool-covers/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw_9OoBRChj9vMo5CHrdUBEiQAJ6YRPfgH0fTV5u8eD_RDPHNp4tS7_bPPlmB5Uzn4GIwttxIaAhq88P8HAQ\">All-Safe</a>","<a href=\"http://www.inyopools.com/Products6/00800008047881.htm?gclid=CjwKEAjwucmoBRDmysGsgbDr5j0SJAAxL9ab0booL1zL2V3RzAPp8xA13xHD68sqtK6QzE142R7qhBoCoPnw_wcB\">Arctic Armor</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008PCVYZA/?&tag=ttr_pool-covers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1735[art|NA[pid|67089[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">GLI Pool Products</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00178M0EI/?&tag=ttr_pool-covers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1735[art|NA[pid|67080[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Intex</a>","<a href=\"http://www.poolsupplies.com/product/standard-blue-solar-cover-18ft-round-8-mil\">Leisure Living</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WKK6JG/?&tag=ttr_pool-covers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1735[art|NA[pid|67086[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Meyco</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037TQ442/?&tag=ttr_pool-covers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1735[art|NA[pid|67087[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Midwest Canvas</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091OUW9K/?&tag=ttr_pool-covers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1735[art|NA[pid|67083[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">PoolTux</a>","<a href=\"http://www.overstock.com/Sports-Toys/Robelle-Premium-Winter-Cover-for-In-ground-Pools/9830248/product.html?refccid=ITCWNZQHPLH2CUSNM4XWPEMWAE&searchidx=27\">Robelle</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OC7PAK/?&tag=ttr_pool-covers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1735[art|NA[pid|67081[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Ultra Armor Maxx</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d16abeff-5500-4389-ba86-cf3699a4b9c6","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1735","url":"/best-pool-covers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T15:22:28Z","datePublished":"2015-10-08T13:20:01Z","name":"Pool Covers Review","synopsis":"Pool covers provide safety for your pool when it is not in use and help keep it clean until swimming season begins again.
