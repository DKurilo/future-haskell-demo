While this unit looks like it belongs in a professional auto shop, it can be a great addition to your garage or home shop, if you have the room for it.","The Schumacher SE-4022 Wheeled is equipped with a battery tester and three charge rates, including a slow, trickle charge rate of 2 amps, 10 amps for fast charging and a rapid 40-amp rate that is compatible with 6- and 12-volt batteries. The Schumacher SE-4022 Wheeled is not compatible with automated glass mat (AGM), gel cell, or deep-cycle types.","The best feature of this large battery charger is its speedy recharge rate. A standard automobile battery can be completely charged in an hour or less on the 40 amp rapid recharge setting, and slow charge times usually take no longer than 12 hours.","The Schumacher SE-4022 Wheeled is not controlled by a microprocessor and lacks push-button controls. This means the car battery charger it must be manually operated and monitored, as it will not shut off by itself. This is not a problem if you are working around the charger all day, but it would not be wise to leave the charger unattended for more than a few hours or overnight, just in case the battery reaches capacity and begins to overcharge.","Schumacher guarantees this unit with a three-year warranty from the date of purchase. This model is also equipped with a cable-storage unit and a cooling fan to help disperse the heat generated by recharging. The cables are six feet long and you can wheel the unit closer to your vehicle for jump-starts. The wheels are not very sturdy and are designed for smooth floors, so you will need to be careful if you need to roll over grass or gravel.","This auto battery booster is by no means a small unit. It weighs 27 pounds and stands 19 inches tall, spans 11.7 inches wide and stretches almost 10 inches long. Adequate storage will be needed, as this unit is not designed to be stored on a shelf."]},"id":"2bcc8015-32c4-4060-8923-42cc8031c039","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2526b198-b4f6-4d4a-b59c-cda294566bf9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Schumacher SE-4022 Wheeled battery charger is good option if you have plenty of room in your garage or shop.
