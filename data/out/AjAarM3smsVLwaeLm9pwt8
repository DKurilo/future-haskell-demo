The washable pre-filter captures large particles like hair and dust, meaning you don&#39;t have to replace the more effective filters as often. Next, the carbon filter does a decent job of removing odors, though some users have noted it doesn&#39;t remove strong odors quickly. The True HEPA filter captures the smallest particles, ranging from very fine smoke particulates to larger pollen particles. Finally, the optional ionizer charges outgoing air for easier capture on the next pass. It&#39;s important to note that ionizers have been scrutinized and sometimes labeled as a health concern because they do produce trace amounts of ozone. If you don&#39;t want to worry about breathing very small amounts of ozone, this Coway air cleaner allows you to turn the feature off completely.","Although this Coway air purifier comes with a number of great features, it doesn&#39;t have the most impressive clean air delivery rates. The Coway&#39;s CADR scores are just under the average scores of the air purifiers we reviewed, meaning it is less effective at removing indoor pollutants than those machines with the best scores. However, the Coway AP-1512HH is still more than capable of cleaning your indoor air. This air purifier can make four air changes an hour, which means all the air in the room is pushed through the machine and its filters every 15 minutes. Like all the air purifiers we reviewed, this Coway cleaner uses HEPA filters, which are specifically designed to catch some of the smallest particulates.","The Coway does not have a sleep or quiet mode that you can use specifically at night to clean the air in your room without disturbing your sleep. However, it does have an auto mode that senses the air quality in the room and adjusts the settings to maximize the effectiveness of the machine."]},"id":"fd50d9a1-6ed5-4914-9870-326c1615f34a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience"},"id":"1ad9d8c1-f825-47f9-902c-a8fca4232fbe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/wz3dLfcUqpZf7CutP96eSQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"One of the best elements of this air cleaner is its small, lightweight design.

At the Coway&#39;s highest setting, it only produces 58 dB, meaning it is not too loud. For comparison, a whisper measures around 30 dB, while a telephone dial reaches about 80 dB.
