Its thin, light blades compress airflow to give its 1,500-watt motor more power, comparable to that of a 2,000-watt blower.","The InStyler BLU weighs 1.3 pounds and has a heavy-duty, 9-foot cord with a cord wrap. Its design is compact, its weight is well balanced and its ergonomic handle is comfortably arced. Although its concentrator and diffuser aren’t the highest-quality ones we found, they fit securely on the Turbo Ionic’s nozzle and are easy to attach and remove. Unlike most of the best hair dryers, this one doesn’t have a removable endcap, so keeping its filter clean may be challenging.","InStyler’s dryer combines tourmaline technology with a ceramic grill. The <a href=\"/hot-tools-review\">Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 2000</a> likewise features tourmaline, and six of the hair dryers we tested have a ceramic component. Tourmaline is a mineral that releases ions to seal the cuticle, retain moisture, smooth hair and combat frizz. Ceramic technology distributes heat gently and evenly and is good for all hair types, especially fine and dry hair.","The InStyler BLU also has a turbo switch. Choosing the turbo setting gives you more power for thick and coarse hair, while low is best if your hair is fine. The BLU has two heat settings, with a temperature range of 133 to 170 degrees. It also has a cool-shot button. It operates at a volume of 83.8 to 85 decibels, which is on the loud side.","Unique among the blowers in our review, this one has a variable Infinity Airflow Dial to give you precision control over air speed. Its minimum air speed is 24.7 feet per second. Its maximum of 34.3 feet per second is the highest air speed we measured.","Some of our testers liked the InStyler’s airflow dial, but it wasn’t a universal hit. “Rolling the thing gives you more power,” one tester said, “but you can’t really tell where you are. I would have preferred separate settings, including a third setting for heat.”","It’s interesting to note that the InStyler BLU’s instructions warn consumers to beware of counterfeits. This hair dryer has an MSRP of $99, and lower-priced models may be fakes.","InStyler provides only one year of consumer protection for the BLU Turbo Ionic Dryer, and customer service is only available by email. The best warranties are four times longer, and most other manufacturers also offer phone support and even live chat."]},"id":"ff204d15-fe28-450f-90a9-c8aa3b9dc4e9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70102","url":"/instyler-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-09T21:48:05Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T21:48:05Z","name":"InStyler BLU Turbo Ionic Dryer","synopsis":"The InStyler BLU Turbo Ionic Dryer has a high-power DC motor and a jet turbine fan.
