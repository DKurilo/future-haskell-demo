Your PC is always recording your activities and unless you install some protection, the PC will capture the web sites you visited and it will save a list of recently run documents. History Clean removes traces from many browsers: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Google Chrome and Safari. You can customize the URLs and cookies in Internet Explorer so that History Clean can remember what you want to keep so that it doesn’t delete things you need. It also destroys any evidence that Windows captures. It erases recently run documents, run history, find history, recycle bin, temporary files and clipboard data. You can schedule the cleaning times and have cleaning happen automatically every time that you shut down the system. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"13c234e9-20c8-45e4-bba9-617346233a95","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Media Player","MS Paint","Registry","WinZip","MSN Messenger","Adobe Flash Player","WinRAR files"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e56e6633-429a-4152-b4fa-27274d560cbf","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can start History Clean from the Startup menu or as a batch file.
