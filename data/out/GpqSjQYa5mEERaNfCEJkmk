The only time we had a problem with the balance of this grill is when we were moving it down a curved ramp. One of our testing crew members lost the grip and it tipped over onto one of its side trays. When it was placed upright again, we were impressed at how well the grill had taken the minor tumble. No parts were damaged, and there was no indication the side table hit the pavement. Very resilient.","<strong>Warranty</strong>","The best indicator of this grill’s longevity is its warranty period – 10 years for both burners and parts.

It’s simple enough to assemble, made of strong components, can withstand reasonable punishment, cooks consistently and evenly and delivers an overall enjoyable experience.
