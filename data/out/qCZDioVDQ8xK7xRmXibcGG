Dollar has an excellent rewards program, but as a smaller company, it’s not as widespread as larger <a href=\"/best-car-rental-services\">rental services</a>. In our pricing research it was cheaper than <a href=\"/hertz-review\">Hertz</a>, but more expensive than <a href=\"/thrifty-review\">Thrifty</a>.","To get an idea of Dollar’s pricing, we quoted a day-long and a week-long rental in New York City, Los Angeles and Houston. We looked at the prices for three different types of cars: economy, compact and full-size. While Dollar tended to be a more expensive option for a daily rental, the weekly rates were among the lowest.","We found that prices are better if you book in advance. The closer to your rental date, the more you pay. If you want to add another driver, Dollar charges a $10 daily fee, which is among the lowest fees in our comparison.","Dollar’s rewards program, Dollar Express, is free to join. It offers a variety of common benefits. You have access to a designated line for members to get preferential service and check out quicker. You can also return your car quicker.","If you use a frequent flier or other rewards program, Dollar Express partners with many programs to let you get those benefits on cars you rent. You can also use Dollar’s Renter Rewards, which provide points for each dollar you spend on a rental. The points are redeemable for free rentals later, with no blackout restrictions. The minimum to redeem a free rental is 500 points, which is more generous than the average rewards program.","With only 230 locations in the U.S. and others across the globe, it’s one of the smaller companies we reviewed. Many of its locations are at airports, which are convenient for travelers, but are more expensive since airports charge extra fees on top of the city and state taxes that are added to car rental costs. Because it’s mostly airport based, Dollar doesn’t offer a home pick-up service, though it does have parking lot shuttles."]},"id":"2356284f-1376-46b7-a228-b804039a3e5e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50189","url":"/dollar-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-26T15:20:03Z","datePublished":"2010-07-26T15:20:03Z","name":"Dollar","synopsis":"Dollar Car Rental is one of the smaller companies we reviewed.
