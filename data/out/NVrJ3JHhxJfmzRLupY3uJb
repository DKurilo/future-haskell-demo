You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Bosch 500 Series 30-inch <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktops\">electric cooktop</a> is a scaled-down version of the more impressive 800 Series, though it offers the same high level of cook settings. The ceramic face is sleek and easy to clean, and the touch controls are simple and uncluttered. Of the electric cooktops we reviewed, this is the most affordable. It has great capabilities and a bridge element that many higher-priced cooktops don’t offer. The Bosch 500 Series has a digital display, control lock and stainless steel accents, but it lacks some convenient features.","With only four burners, the Bosch 500 Series struggles at versatile arrangements but compensates with a bridge element. The best cooktops we reviewed offered triple and double burners, giving you a broad range to match your cookware. The Bosch 500 Series doesn&#39;t have a triple element, and the double burner doesn&#39;t have the same high wattage for rapid boil. The highest setting is 2,500 watts, which is less powerful than the higher-end model. Beyond these limitations, it is a good, functional cooktop. The bridge element between the two left burners gives you the option for even cooking, and a keep-warm option allows you to keep food at a safe, consistent temperature until your guests arrive.","The Bosch 500 Series lacks some of the functions of other cooktops, but its simplicity adds to its design. The burners have two buttons with easy-to-understand graphics. A range of numbers at the bottom allows you to choose up to 17 different power settings quickly. The warming and locking buttons are separate, meaning you won&#39;t have to memorize any complicated commands. Stainless steel runners come standard and give the cooktop an aesthetic appeal.","The child lock is easy to find and operate. You simply push the button for three seconds to lock the appliance. The ceramic cooktop has two different heat indicators and will warn you if the surface is hot due to any residual heat. There&#39;s also a separate clean-lock feature you can activate in the middle of cooking. For example, if there is a spill near the control panel, you can turn on clean lock and clean up the spill without changing your other settings.","This is a lower-end model than the Bosch 800 Series, but the website offers the same level of support. The dropdown menu provides in-depth FAQs, a wide array of how-to videos and quick access to customer support. Customer service is open during regular business hours, and email is an option when the phone line is closed. There is also a section to find a service agent. Bosch offers a one-year warranty on parts and service."]},"id":"e41386af-0f2a-43fa-9544-2be870f1c76f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d4ba470a-c4e2-4b62-b769-b8efe657ca21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch 500 Series is a great, affordable electric cooktop with less-complicated functions than the higher-end models.
