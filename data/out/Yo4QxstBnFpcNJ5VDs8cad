You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Privacy Drive is a very basic <a href=\"/best-encryption-software\">encryption software</a> program that doesn&#39;t offer many additional security features aside from two types of algorithm encryption keys. This and its overall difficulty of use made it fall to the bottom of our encryption software review.","Privacy Drive is among a handful of encryption programs in our ranking that isn&#39;t simple to use at all. Installation is easy enough. Getting started is a little more difficult – if you don&#39;t already know what a mounted virtual drive is, it might be a bit confusing. Upon installation, the program opens along with a browser pointed at the company&#39;s website. But it goes to the What&#39;s New page instead of anything that&#39;s actually helpful to a new user.","Once we were able to use the software, we found it&#39;s fairly fast at encrypting files. However, it can&#39;t do folder encryption. This means if you have multiple files in a folder that you&#39;d like to encrypt, you have to drag and drop each one into the virtual drive first rather than the whole folder, which decreases the overall speed of the process.","Privacy Drive lets you email files right from the virtual drive, but that doesn&#39;t ensure their encryption. Files only stay encrypted when they stay in the volume. You would have to move the volume to a USB drive or email the whole volume.","The software offers a strong and secure encryption algorithm key – the top-notch 256-bit AES, and you can also choose 128-bit. However, it doesn&#39;t offer much more in terms of security. Unlike many of the encryption programs we reviewed, such as <a href=\"/folder-lock-review\">Folder Lock</a>, Privacy Drive doesn&#39;t even offer a file shredder to make sure your deleted data is unrecoverable. You don&#39;t get a password strength meter or a password generator either, which would help you come up with a solid password.","As long as you have one of the four latest versions of Windows – 10, 8, 7 or Vista – you&#39;ll have no compatibility problems with this software on your computer. If you still use Windows XP and want to use Privacy Drive, it&#39;s time to upgrade, as you won&#39;t be able to run it on XP. If you have multiple computers in your household or are interested in this software for a business, you&#39;ll need to install it on all of your PCs, or you won&#39;t be able to access your files in encrypted volumes.","In case you get stuck and need help with the program, Privacy Drive offers customer support and some helpful online resources. You can view a list of FAQs, the manual and tutorials on its website."]},"id":"4acd0b7b-096d-4e0d-8a2f-fe920b63bcf6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f65a0cc4-2557-4097-bbc3-046b3000fc98","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For basic encryption, Privacy Drive provides the strongest encryption key and is fairly fast.
