One such product is the Pursonic S400, a midline electric toothbrush that utilizes sonic technology. Despite its small market share, online reviews indicate the brush works as well as comparable brand-name power toothbrushes.","The S400 rechargeable toothbrush rotates 30,000 times per minute, which is typical of the best power toothbrushes. The benefit of this is the brush creates enough motion and intensity to dislodge hard-to-reach plaque, even that found in between teeth and beneath the gum line and other places brush bristles might not reach.","Similar to comparable models, this one also has a timer, a charging station and several replacement heads. In fact, the main unit comes with 12 replacement heads. Part of the reason it comes with so many heads is that the manufacturer touts the S400 as a shareable toothbrush, with easy-to-remove brush heads that enable the whole family to share the main unit. Each brush head is a different color for easy and quick identification. It probably isn’t practical for most families to share a brush handle, but it might be something to consider if you’re on a budget.","One of the best features of this electronic rechargeable toothbrush is its three operation modes: Power/Clean, Soft/Gentle and Massage. Each mode offers a different brushing intensity, or pressure, so whether you have sensitive or firm gums, the brush probably has a mode that is comfortable for you.","The Pursonic S400 is priced significantly less than other sonic toothbrushes. As such, you may think the cost difference is indicative of a lack of quality. However, most people who use this brush claim it is an excellent value and works just as well as other, more expensive sonic power toothbrushes.","While the Pursonic S400 does not offer anything unique in an electric toothbrush, it does work well according to its customer reviews. If you are looking for a low-priced alternative to the popular brand name models, this one could be a good fit for you."]},"id":"d731b25a-4a14-4be0-9850-6796336f7a96","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59539","url":"/pursonic-s400-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-16T14:52:50Z","datePublished":"2014-05-16T14:52:50Z","name":"Pursonic S400","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
