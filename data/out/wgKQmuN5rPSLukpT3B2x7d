Insurance providers deny claims that do not meet their specifications and coding requirements, which wastes valuable time and money that you can&#39;t recoup. ","Further, most software solutions integrate with electronic health record (EHR) programs and include patient management features to streamline the daily workflow for both you and your staff. "]},"id":"c36df94f-770d-494e-8f8c-1fb61d9b3dbb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Medical Billing Software: Our Verdict &amp; Recommendations  "},"id":"b4a3f4ba-af09-4069-b509-9b5ce7330626","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We&#39;ve monitored this burgeoning software category for three years. The first software application was the brainchild of a nurse. Since that time, it has grown from one program to dozens. ","In the three years we have evaluated medical billing software, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/advancedmd-medical-billing-services/\">AdvancedMD</a> has impressed us with its robust offering of features as well as its ability to suit small and large medical practices alike. It&#39;s a web-based solution that also acts as a patient management tool with all the features you need to schedule appointments, organize your information and efficiently bill patients. ","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/athenacollector/\">Athenahealth</a> is a leading name in health care products and lives up to its reputation by providing nearly every feature you could possibly need to run your practice&#39;s billing, EHR and patient management processes smoothly. Web-based, and featuring the capacity to integrate with other software solutions, athenahealth provides a firm but adaptable foundation on which you can build your billing and EHR system.","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/kareo-medical-billing-services/\">Kareo</a> is a highly customizable billing system with several customizable features and programs you can integrate into your system. With the essential features like a patient portal and the ability to accept online payments, it will make your life – and your patient&#39;s lives – easier.","<strong>What We Evaluated, What We Found</strong>","Besides offering a platform in which you can prepare and submit insurance claims and bill patients electronically, medical billing software saves your medical practice time and money, and it does this two different ways. ","First, it streamlines the normally cumbersome and time-consuming process of submitting insurance claims. Second, most applications review or &#34;scrub&#34; each prepared claim before it&#39;s submitted to the insurance provider to ensure it&#39;s free from errors and meets stringent insurance and medical coding requirements. ","Insurance claims must be completely accurate for you to get paid. A denied claim means more work for you, and in some cases, an error will lead to underpayment for your services.","<strong>Features to Look for in Medical Billing Software</strong>","<strong>First-Pass Resolution Rate</strong><br/>Medical billing companies usually report an average first-pass resolution rate with their software, which is a certain percentage of claims that are accepted by the insurance companies upon the first submission. These rates are tracked and reported by the medical billing companies themselves, with an industry average above 90%. (There&#39;s no third-party organization that verifies these claims.)","<strong>Online Patient Portal</strong><br/>We favored applications that allow you to set up an online portal where your patients can pay their balances online. The best billing software allows you to process credit cards (including those for flexible spending, health savings and health reimbursement accounts). Patients can also make an installment payment if they are on a payment plan with your practice.","<strong>Patient Management Features</strong><br/>It&#39;s fair to say that your office staff spends hours each day handling the small yet critical tasks of running a medical practice: calling patients to remind them of their appointments, checking in patients, verifying patients&#39; insurance eligibility, etc. ","The best medical billing applications come with patient management features that either manage these details for your staff (such as calling or sending reminder texts to patients) or they significantly streamline certain processes (patient check-in, insurance verification), which allows your staff to focus on the other important, often neglected details of running a medical practice.","<strong>Importing &amp; Integrations</strong><br/>When switching to a new billing system or integrating other health care programs into the system, it&#39;s imperative to have a software solution that easily imports data from your old system into the new one.  ","You don&#39;t want to have to copy patient information and other data to the new system. The best programs import data from your old system automatically. There are some companies that will do this for you, but it costs extra.","In addition, look for software that scans and stores documents and performs instant insurance verifications.","<strong>SaaS vs. Self-Hosted </strong><br/>Most of the billing software solutions on our list are SaaS (software as a service), which means they are cloud-based software you can run from just about any computer with a strong internet connection. ","There are a few on our list (which are designated on our matrix) that are self-hosted, meaning you install the application on your computer. If you go the self-hosted route, check with the developer to see what the minimum computer requirements are to run the software.","<strong>Third-Party Integrations</strong><br/>If your office is looking for medical billing software but wants to keep the same EHR system, it&#39;s important to look for a program that supports third-party software integrations. What programs the software can integrate with vary, but if you use a well-known, widely used EHR, then it&#39;s likely the medical billing program integrates seamlessly with it. ","If you&#39;re looking to overhaul your entire system, many companies that offer medical billing software also offer EHR and patient management programs that merge, giving you a centralized software solution. ","<strong>Software vs. Services</strong><br/>Pursuing medical billing software for your practice means you&#39;re committed to doing your billing in-house, as opposed to outsourcing it to a specialized billing company. And that means you must have a certified medical coder on staff, and your practice must keep current with changing regulations and policies. ","Billing in-house is usually cheaper, but depending on your situation, outsourcing this work to service may be in your favor. A medical billing service submits your claims, ensuring they comply with standards. Billing services oversee collections, too, which frees up your staff&#39;s time. (Services typically charge a fee or a percentage of the bill.)","Another benefit of using a billing service is that it is usually on top of the ever-changing laws and regulations that affect the health care industry, so it can comply with changes faster than your own staff might be able to. If you have a small staff that you&#39;d rather have focus on other matters than billing and you can afford it, then outsourcing to a billing service may be a better solution than software.","Medical billing software is a rapidly evolving field that is becoming more and more integrated into larger health care systems; not only is it capable of incorporating EHR and patient management systems, but it&#39;s moving into the cloud. ","When we evaluated this year&#39;s leading software companies, we not only scrutinized each program&#39;s billing features, but we assessed how well they are moving toward a bigger, centralized system, which includes EHR and patient management features. At the same time, we value choices for software users, so programs that are modular and allow for diverse customization of systems are also highly regarded. If you prefer a certain EHR application but want to change the billing system, a modular system is a must.","Choosing the best medical billing software for your practice can increase reimbursement rates from patients and insurance companies. Although getting paid is essential to keep your practice going, medical billing shouldn&#39;t consume more of your staff&#39;s time than it needs to. The right medical billing solution will make sure it doesn&#39;t."]},"id":"05f24528-e652-4d71-a1d9-3561d2646488","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"851d0d88-7567-4dc9-a17e-47881630f110","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.advancedmd.com/features/check-in\">AdvancedMD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.athenahealth.com/athenaCollector/Practice-Management.php\">athenahealth</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kareo.com/practice-management\">Kareo</a>","<a href=\"http://www.nuemd.com/features/practice-management\">NueMD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.carecloud.com/practice-management/\">CareCloud</a>","<a href=\"https://www.nextgen.com/Products-and-Services/Ambulatory/Practice-Management\">NextGen</a>","<a href=\"http://www.greenwayhealth.com/solutions/intergy/intergy-practice-management/\">Greenway</a>","<a href=\"http://www.isalushealthcare.com/Medical-Billing-And-Scheduling-Software\">iSalus Healthcare</a>","<a href=\"http://www.adsc.com/practice-management\">Advanced Data Systems</a>","<a href=\"http://www.healthfusion.com/medical-billing-software/\">HealthFusion</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c22cffc5-342b-4e06-8277-06d86b22643f","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1418","url":"/best-medical-billing-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"andreas-rivera","url":"/author/andreas-rivera","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Andreas Rivera","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"WxjvxyhZNtkBfxLLfmCHVe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-25T16:32:47Z","datePublished":"2017-06-20T21:47:50Z","name":"Medical Billing Software Review","synopsis":"With features to handle both your medical practice's billing and scheduling processes, medical billing software can improve the efficiency and profitability of your practice.","review":{},"strapline":"With features to handle both your medical practice's billing and scheduling processes, medical billing software can improve the efficiency and profitability of your practice.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-06-20T23:16:33Z","id":"wgKQmuN5rPSLukpT3B2x7d","meta":{"title":"The Best Medical Billing Software | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Need help choosing the best medical billing software for your office?
