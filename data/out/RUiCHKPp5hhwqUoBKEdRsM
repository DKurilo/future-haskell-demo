The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","3D printers like the Afinia H480 allow you to manufacture quality products from your own home. This Afinia 3D printer can print small objects in good quality using both ABS and PLA. All you need is the provided USB cable to get started – this printer requires no assembly.","With a maximum printing size of 5.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches, you can only produce small 3D designs and models. The print speed is only 30 mm per second, so although you have to wait patiently for each print, the Afinia H480 doesn’t skimp too much on quality. Print layer heights, or resolution, can be between 0.15 mm and 0.4 mm; the latter is roughly the width of nice cardstock paper.","3D printing materials for the Afinia H480 include both 1.75 mm ABS and PLA. Although you can use generic filament cartridges, Afinia recommends you purchase its specially calibrated ones. There is only one print head, so multicolor printing isn’t possible either.","The outer casing of the Afinia H480 is sturdy polished steel with a brown-red finish that gives it a sense of sophistication. The printer weighs only 11 pounds, so it is light enough to move around your house or office. It is just 10 inches long, which means it won&#39;t take up much space on your desk.","One drawback to the design of this 3D printer is the lack of a safety enclosure. In order for a 3D printer to print ABS, the plate has to heat up – and it gets very hot. You should be extra careful when using this printer, as it can be easy for little hands to sneak in and burn themselves. There are a few safety instructions included in the manual to help you use the 3D printer safely.","A power supply and USB cable are included in the box. The USB port is the only way this printer communicates with your computer, since the Afinia H480 isn&#39;t wireless-ready. However, the printer supports partial untethering. When you start a print, your printer must be connected to the printer. After the print has started though, you can unplug your computer and the print will continue. A variety of tools are also included with this printer, such as a putty knife, X-Acto knife, pliers and tweezers.","The Afinia H480 3D printer has a one-year warranty on all parts. The company’s website has telephone and email support but no forum or blog. There are FAQs, tutorials and manuals available on the website for quick browsing."]},"id":"f9f0c3be-253b-48d2-ba1e-b1302e324b41","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6f0aa16e-3f5a-42a2-bb80-28368481642f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Afinia H-Series 3D printer is one of the few printers that include everything you need for 3D printing: printer software, a USB cable and tools for you to use once printing is completed.
