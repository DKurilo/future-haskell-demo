The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-car-battery-chargers\">Car Battery Chargers</a> here.</em>","The Antigravity Batteries AG-XP-10 is a strong alternative power source for camping or emergencies. This portable power source also serves as a car battery charger and is capable of jump-starting your car. The AG-XP-10 is quite capable, but it&#39;s not as powerful as larger battery boosters.","The biggest frustration with the AG-XP-10 comes from its very short jumper cables. While the AG-XP-10 is light and easy to move around, the cables are so short that you might have a hard time finding a place for the device to sit while jump-starting your car. It also has less jump-starting power than the 500 CCA of the best car battery chargers.","One of the major differences between this and other chargers is size and weight. This car battery charger is tiny compared to most others and weighs a mere 1 pound. Still, it&#39;s bulky enough to be somewhat awkward in the hand, and there&#39;s no handle to help here. You don&#39;t get any sort of built-in cable storage either, though you do get a case to put everything in.","This car battery charger comes with a three-year warranty, indicating that Antigravity Batteries is confident in the quality of its product. Three years is plenty of time to notice any major issues or factory defects.<br/>Far and away, the AG-XP-10&#39;s strong suit is its role as a power bank or alternative power source. It comes with two USB ports and a DC power port. It also has enough juice to keep your electronic devices going for days. This can be extremely useful while camping or in emergencies. It also has an LED flashlight built into it, which is helpful at night."]},"id":"15dd8546-688a-4846-ba8f-209ebcba7165","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce5ed5ae-79bf-408b-8b8f-752d96c000e9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Antigravity Batteries AG-XP-10 is an excellent tool in most situations.
