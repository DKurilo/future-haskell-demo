Each technological step gives us clearer, quicker and deeper visual reproduction to enjoy. If it has been more than a couple years since your last upgrade, it might be time for you to look into purchasing a better computer monitor. For more information on monitors and their technological advantages, check out our articles on monitors.","A good monitor, such as the <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">Dell UltraSharp U2312HM</a>, <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">Asus VS239H-P</a> and <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">BenQ GW2450</a>, can be especially advantageous to those who enjoy viewing visual media on their computers . More and more people use their computers to access media, whether it is video games, movies, online videos or other forms of content. These ever-growing forms of entertainment cannot be enjoyed to their fullest potential without a monitor that can provide the high-definition picture that we all want.","Widescreen 16:9 has become the dominant aspect ratio for just about everything, including media, some software, internet webpages and so forth. Anyone who still has an older 4:3 standard-definition monitor, even if it is a flat panel, will often find that content has to be resized or scrolled through to be seen. Since TVs adopted HD with a 16:9 aspect ratio, it was inevitable that monitors would follow for consistency in video-game play and movies. Media aside though, this aspect ratio is also beneficial for business because it allows you to view two documents side by side. Businesses that utilize any word-processing software, CAD applications and more will find this change beneficial.","<strong>Monitors: What to Look For</strong>","When it comes to buying a monitor, the display is the most important part, of course. However, some monitors offer additional features and have varying types of connections (HDMI, VGA and so on). You should also look for a company that has a good help and support system in case you have to use your warranty. We looked at the following categories when we evaluated the monitors in our lineup.","<strong>Display</strong>","Flat-panel technology varies, but currently, the best monitors are made with IPS (In-plane switching) technology. High levels of brightness and a broad-range contrast ratio will result in brighter colors and more color depth. Monitors with LED backlighting should have the best of both of these. Look for quick response times to lessen blur from on-screen movement. In addition, you will want wide viewing angles so that the picture can be seen from a broader area within a room.","<strong>Features</strong>","Since desks and people come in all shapes and sizes, monitors with adjustable height, swivel and tilt make finding your preferred positioning possible. Most models do not include all of these adjustments, so be sure to pick one that meets your needs. If you do not have much room on your desk or would like more space, you can mount some monitors on a wall behind your desk. A few monitors have built-in speakers, but none can reproduce audio at a quality level that any audiophile would accept. Beyond that, you will want to look at the dimensions, weight and amount of power consumption.","<strong>Connections</strong>","The connection options you&#39;ll find on monitors vary. Be sure to find one that has the same connections as your graphics card; otherwise, you&#39;ll need a converter cable that will most likely be sold separately. The common connections on modern monitors include HDMI, DVI, VGA and DisplayPort. Some monitors also have a USB hub, but those are generally for connecting additional USB peripherals such as a webcam.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>","A good support system is always important. Most manufactures offer plenty of support and information to answer any questions and solve any problems that customers encounter, but be sure to choose a manufacturer that provides the kind of support that meets your personal needs. In addition, some companies will guarantee their products for more than the typical period of one year. Warranties that cover products for more than one year are far more reassuring than those that only last for one year.","These were the main features we used to compare and rank the top ten monitors on our lineup. The varying specifications are not usually significant, but there are enough differences that you will want to buy a monitor that works best for you. Most importantly, keep in mind what you plan to use your monitor for and how well it will integrate into your office setup."]},"id":"5c2a667c-d183-4975-bb53-0d4e692ce806","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f4918c70-0288-4288-b0ea-bbaa803191e8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://geni.us/DellU2312HMTTR\">Dell UltraSharp U2312HM</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008DWITHI/?&tag=ttr_monitors_computers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|278[art|NA[pid|53667[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ASUS VS239H-P</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-6551514-12675113?url=http://www.sears.com/benq-va-led-monitor-gw2450-24-inch-screen/p-SPM10087233920?sid=IDx20110310x00001i&gclid=Cj0KEQjwnsPGBRDo4c6RqK-Oqu8BEiQAwNviCZ556-grPQEhxVUqKkQeMDHniCrs-7vVpJuAqQjq5DIaAiBX8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds\">BENQ GW2450</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P81RKAY/?&tag=ttr_monitors_computers-20&ascsubtag=ttr|278|53670|\">NEC MultiSync EX231WP-BK</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XNRAQY/?&tag=ttr_monitors_computers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|278[art|NA[pid|53671[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">LG E2442V-BN</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N7P6TC/?&tag=ttr_monitors_computers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|278[art|NA[pid|53672[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Acer S231HL</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D601UC8/?&tag=ttr_monitors_computers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|278[art|NA[pid|53673[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ViewSonic VA2406M</a>","<a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/monitors/LS23WHUKFK/ZA\">Samsung PX2370</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00413PHDM/?&tag=ttr_monitors_computers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|278[art|NA[pid|48348[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ASUS VE228H</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NMP8J0I/?&tag=ttr_monitors_computers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|278[art|NA[pid|33601[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">NEC MultiSync EA243WM</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"cb7faa78-2251-4c02-98db-42ede5ab70f7","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_278","url":"/best-monitors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brian-westover","url":"/author/brian-westover","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Brian Westover","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"TBtnELo8v5XHxqU9uBG9c7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-07-01T15:52:28Z","datePublished":"2011-09-28T13:36:31Z","name":"Monitors","synopsis":"From online videos to movies and even just regular day-to-day use, the crystal-clear imagery that the latest monitors produce takes the visual aspect of our digital world to the next level.","review":{},"strapline":"From online videos to movies and even just regular day-to-day use, the crystal-clear imagery that the latest monitors produce takes the visual aspect of our digital world to the next level.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-01-04T20:51:28Z","id":"C4v8RsaPymWWqysJawL4V4","meta":{"title":"The Best Computer Monitors | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Compare the best monitors available.
