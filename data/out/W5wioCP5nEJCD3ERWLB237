A turkey with a succulent skin, moist white meat and flavorful dark meat that will delight holiday guests especially the in-laws. But if you’re relying too much on the pre-included plastic pop-up <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">cooking thermometer</a>, you’ll likely get dry, tasteless turkey meat. That’s why you need something like the Oxo Chef’s Digital Leave-in Thermometer.","This Oxo digital thermometer has the convenience of the disposable pop-up thermometer with but the precision of an instant read thermometer. It comes with a metal probe that fits into the base of the thermometer for storage. You can remove the probe from the base, place it inside the meat and run the narrow cable through the oven door to continuously monitor the roasting temperatures. You don’t have to guess at the doneness of your meat, nor open the oven door to test the meat, allowing heat out and drying out your meat.","The digital display is angled, providing easy viewing when it sits on the counter. The temperature reading is in large numbers on the LCD screen, which helps you monitor the temperature as you work in the kitchen. Plus, you can choose display it in either Fahrenheit or Celsius, so you can follow recipes written with in either Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures without difficult mathematical conversions. The display base also come preloaded with preset USDA and chef-recommended temperature settings for nine types of meat, poultry and fish that will signal you when the desired temperature is reached.

This thermometer is hand wash only. This shouldn&#39;t be a major problem for a leave-in style thermometer, as the monitoring base will be well away from the meat. Cleaning the probe portion of thermometer is a necessity to prevent cross contaminating meat, it is recommended for you to do a careful but thorough cleaning to prolong the thermometer’s life span.","Don&#39;t suffer through another tasteless turkey. Take your culinary prowess to another level with the help of a digital meat thermometer. The Oxo Chef&#39;s Digital Leave-In will provide you the tools to help roast the perfect bird – for Thanksgiving or any other special occasion."]},"id":"6e6c823d-915f-4cd3-8567-365ac7a3145a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58145","url":"/oxo-chef-s-digital-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T20:50:08Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T20:50:08Z","name":"OXO Chef's Digital Leave-In 1158800V3","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-11-13T20:50:08Z","id":"W5wioCP5nEJCD3ERWLB237","meta":{"title":"OXO Chef's Digital Leave-In 1158800V3 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Oxo Chef&#039;s Digital Leave-In is a cooking thermometer designed to give continuous temperatures throughout the cooking process.
