Active Junky tested sleeping bags on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado, and they declared the Country Squire their first choice for a car camping comforter.","This sleeping bag has a rectangular rather than mummy form, but it still provided a comfortable and warm sleep. Even taller hikers should find this sleeping bag roomy enough for moving around in. The manufacturer says the bag will fit sleepers as tall as 6’6”. The Active Junky users especially enjoyed the cotton liner, which was not only soft and comfortable but removes for easy washing. Few sleeping bags offer this feature.","Rather than down materials, it has a synthetic filling. This provided mattress-like comfort and water resistance but comes at a price. The bag weighs 11 pounds and needs a duffle bag – that’s 16 x 40 inches of space just for sleeping. Too bulky and heavy for hauling on your back, it may be large for some car trips. The duffle itself is compact, as you can roll and store it in the head of the bag itself, which zips off the bag for use as extra storage and carrying.","The bag is rated to 20 degrees Fahrenheit and lived up to that promise. In addition to the comfortable filling and soft Cotton Duck lining, it has a draft tube along the zipper to prevent drafts. You can zip it to another sleeping bag to make a two-person bag; although, it might be large enough on its own if you like to share.","<strong>Tester Comment:</strong> Almost hotel-like, Squire is a different way to travel. I’m renting an RV for a fishing trip and will use this over a sheets-and-blanket arrangement, no question.<br/><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Cozy<br/><strong>Best For: </strong>Car camping, use as a duvet in an RV or camper van.<br/><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>While this is not a great sleeping bag to carry on backpacking trips, the comfortable design of the Slumberjack Country Squire 20 makes it a luxurious choice for car camping."]},"id":"72422d62-fc50-429e-85ab-2d29903b8ca6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68163","url":"/slumberjack-country-squire-20-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:57:55Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:57:55Z","name":"Slumberjack Country Squire 20","synopsis":"The Slumberjack Country Squire 20 is not a great choice for taking on a backpacking trip, but if you are interested in comfort when car camping or where bulk and weight are not a concern, it’s a","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Slumberjack Country Squire 20 is not a great choice for taking on a backpacking trip, but if you are interested in comfort when car camping or where bulk and weight are not a concern, it’s a","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-02T20:11:09Z","id":"xsN9HfivbHBmntUmopPb5X","meta":{"title":"Slumberjack Country Squire 20 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While too heavy for backpacking, the Slumberjack Country Squire 20 provides a comfortable sleep when car camping and is warm in freezing temps.
