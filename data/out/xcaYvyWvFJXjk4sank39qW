The company sells several frame styles, and you can choose from a variety of lenses, but it carries few name-brand options.","Zenni Optical carries more than 6,000 tailor-made frames for men, women and children. It manufactures its own frames and lenses, which eliminates the middleman and makes glasses more affordable. The result is some of the highest-quality glasses you can buy online, whether you chose full-rim, half-rim, rimless or sport-style frames.","If you want frames made from a particular material, you can search by style and select from plastic, aluminum alloy, titanium, hypoallergenic and stainless steel. The company sells nonprescription sunglasses, and you can add a tint to any pair of regular glasses. If you are in the market for designer frames you&#39;re better off shopping at <a href=\"/framesdirect-com-review\">FramesDirect.com</a> or even <a href=\"/discountglasses-review\">Discount Glasses,</a> since Zenni carries only three name brands. ","When you select a pair of frames, the product page shows the dimensions, a full description, color choices and lens options. In addition, you can add custom text on the frame arms to give your eyeglasses a personal touch. Zenni also sells reading glasses and frames without lenses. Zenni used to carry ski goggles but we discovered during our most recent round of product updates that is no longer the case, as the one pair available is out of stock. ","If you want to see how a pair of glasses looks on you before you buy them, the website has a virtual try-on widget. To use this widget, you upload a picture of yourself, input your pupillary distance number (the website has information on how to get this number) and click the Try On button next to the frame picture.","This online eyeglasses store sells standard single-vision lenses, high-index lenses, polycarbonate lenses, polarized lenses with an optional tint, and photochromic or transition lenses. Zenni Optical also accepts progressive and bifocal prescriptions.","In addition, all eyeglasses come with a free anti-scratch coating and a UV protective coating. For a fee, you can also add an anti-reflective lens coating, which prevents glare and makes it easier to see when you drive at night. A protective case and microfiber cloth are also included with each order. Any pair of prescription glasses can be turned into prescription sunglasses by adding an 80 percent tint to the lenses.","Zenni Optical uses standard shipping for orders in the U.S., and it takes 14 to 21 days to receive your glasses. It can also ship internationally, and you can pay for expedited shipping. In addition, you can track your order. You can contact Zenni Optical by phone, email or live chat, and the website provides helpful information about its policies and eyeglasses in general.","<em>Contributing Reviewer: Linda Thomson</em>"]},"id":"c83f7772-decc-4256-b626-8e1eda5f67c9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53997","url":"/zenni-optical-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-11-30T18:38:44Z","datePublished":"2011-11-30T18:38:44Z","name":"Zenni Optical","synopsis":"With its wide selection of reasonably priced frames for men, women and children, Zenni Optical is a good place to purchase stylish eyeglasses online.
