It also a has a good combination of features that allow it to cool a room of up to 250 square feet.","This Danby unit has a variety of operating modes, including a sleep mode that gradually raises the temperature throughout the night. That way, you don’t wake up to a freezing cold room. It then returns to the previously selected temperature during the day.","There is also a dry mode that turns the air conditioner into a dehumidifier. In this mode, the unit removes excess moisture from the air without cooling it. This is a great feature if you live in a humid climate.","You can set this AC unit to maintain your preferred temperature using its compressor, fan or a combination of both. You can also set it to turn itself off after a fixed number of hours so you don’t cool an empty room. The air conditioner comes with a remote, so you can control its features from anywhere in the room.","The Danby DAC060BGUWDB has an air filter behind its front grille, and it’s easy to clean with a vacuum cleaner and soapy water. A light on the keypad lets you know when it is time to clean the filter.","This is a relatively compact unit, but it’s a little on the heavy side, weighing 52 pounds. That matters when it’s time to install the air conditioner or remove it for the winter. You may need someone to help you lift it in and out of place.","Danby includes a one-year warranty that covers all the air conditioner’s parts – this is unimpressive but pretty standard. Some competing units carry longer warranties on their compressors. There is a FAQs section on the company’s website in case you have questions, and you can contact the company by email, telephone and live chat.","This Danby window air conditioner would be even more competitive if it was lighter and had a better warranty, but those are minor drawbacks considering how efficient it is. This energy efficiency, coupled with the unit’s variety of operating modes and fan speeds, mean the DAC060BGUWDB can save you money on your energy bills as it cools a room of up to 250 square feet."]},"id":"dbb001f1-11f4-4b3f-ba0e-f58c41c517ee","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69963","url":"/danby-dac060bguwdb-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-21T18:11:52Z","datePublished":"2018-05-21T18:11:52Z","name":"Danby DAC060BGUWDB","synopsis":"We reviewed several efficient window air conditioners, but the Danby DAC060BGUWDB stands out from the group.
