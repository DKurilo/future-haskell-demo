WM3997HWA <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">washer dryer combo</a> uses TurboWash technology with high-pressure nozzles. It may be the largest washer dryer we reviewed at 4.2 cubic feet, but its efficient use of space makes it one of the best options out there. This LG has a complete list of diverse cycles, a customizable drying program and additional features that keep the machine quiet for washing at night. The LG WM3997HWA is taller than most competitors, but its length and width are still convenient for storing in average closets.","The most important benefit all-in-one washer dryers offer is how little room they take up in your home, so your main concern about this LG unit is likely whether it can be stored easily. It is much taller than other combos, but its length and width only add a couple of inches. This means that even with its height, it should still fit in the space you can spare for laundry.","The LG comes with 14 different washer settings, which is quite nice. There was only one unit that had more selection on wash cycles. This one ties for the most drying cycles. It also ties for the most selection on soil levels, so you can be precise about the water and energy you use. If your clothes are lightly soiled, using a lower setting saves you money over time. <br/>This machine’s estimated yearly operating costs are higher than most washer dryer combos, but this makes sense given the large capacity of this unit. Its capacity is more than double the average capacity of the washer dryer units in our lineup. If you prefer a smaller, more energy-efficient machine, check out the <a href=\"/haier-review\">Haier HLC1700AXS</a>.","With the number of washing and drying cycles it offers, the LG is the most complete washer dryer combo. It includes common cycles you expect to see on a top all-in-one washer dryer, such as normal, delicate, colors and permanent press.","Beyond the usual, though, it includes a cycle for self-cleaning, the option to preprogram a favorite cycle with your choice of heat and soil level, and a high-speed bleach wash specifically for white fabrics. One standout features is the sanitizer cycle. The washing machine is designed to deeply clean clothes, removing 99.9 percent of germs. This is useful if you have a young child with a favorite stuffed animal that needs to be decontaminated.","A big concern with combination washer dryers is that the drying option might be treated as a secondary function of the unit. These units have a reputation of defaulting to a hot temperature and only allow you to control the length of the drying cycle. LG gives you a lot of different drying choices. Timed drying is available, but you can also control the dryness level and the temperature setting. This is an important option for a dryer when you have clothes made of materials that are prone to shrinking. With other units, you may have to air dry materials like wool sweaters or denim jeans.","The digital display on this LG machine is easy to read. The machine uses both buttons and a knob for controls, and the timer is bright on the LED screen. This is a great feature, considering that some units expect you to estimate how much time is left by looking at the movement of the knob.","These machines are compact and should remain out of sight and out of mind. This is hard to do when the appliance shakes if a load is uneven or lets out a shrill beep when the machine has finished. The LG lets you silence the signals for running the machines while the household is asleep, and it automatically regulates noise through vibration reduction features. When the load becomes uneven, the machine senses it and relaxes the drum enough to allow the load to even itself out. This leads to a smooth, quiet wash.","The warranty coverage on this unit is the best of the machines we reviewed. The motor is covered for 10 years and the drum is covered for the life of the machine. Parts and labor have a standard one-year warranty."]},"id":"92ef00f3-e816-4494-b962-21e5cc9edbdf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"67b3e640-3a4c-4591-a260-5e8505238a4b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG WM3997HWA is larger than the other machines we reviewed, but double the capacity compared to others.
