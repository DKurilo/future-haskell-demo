It also has a great warranty and a technical support staff with experience and knowledge.","The audio performance of the Sherwood RD-8504 is superb and powerful. The sound quality is great in any home theater. You&#39;ll appreciate the high signal-to-noise ratio and low distortion that this receiver provides. The amplifier of the unit can power speakers with a 110-watt peak power output and a 100-watt continuous power output.","HDMI ports are sparse on this digital receiver, with only three inputs and one output. There are no network connections such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. The included setup microphone takes the pain out of speaker calibration, and the RD-8504 allows you to set up speakers in multiple rooms. The legacy device connections of this unit consist of component, composite, optical and coaxial ports. There is also an AM/FM radio and a headphone jack.","This home theater receiver supports 3D video and has 1080p video upscaling that does low-to-high resolution conversion. Bluetooth audio transmission is possible via an add-on from Sherwood. The built-in equalizer gives you many options to customize your listening experience. The full range of audio decoders from Dolby and DTS integrates directly into the software of this AV receiver.","Sherwood has passable customer service. You can contact them directly via phone or email and access FAQs via the company&#39;s support website. There is presently no online manual available for the RD-8504, so hold on to the printed copy that comes with the receiver. The two-year warranty on this product covers parts and labor."]},"id":"8f1f92ce-bc0b-4146-b279-cbdb0b1ff16d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dd276957-baa4-4433-9edd-d70d5eb7d4ba","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The audio performance competes well with other receivers with a similar price.
