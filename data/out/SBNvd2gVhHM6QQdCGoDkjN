You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","With its large display and buttons, AT&amp;T’s CL82313 proves easy to use – even for those with large hands or poor vision. Still, this phone is missing many of the features found on the best <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phones</a> such as Bluetooth connectivity. However, its decent performance and strong design make it a usable home phone.","In our testing, the CL82313 maintained a strong connection to the base all the way up to 250 feet, and it didn’t drop calls. Call quality remained high until we reached about 250 feet, and at that point we notice some background static. While not a major issue, the static can be a little annoying.","During our testing, we found that the cordless phone’s battery is only mediocre. It lasts for one and a half days on standby before it needs to recharge – that’s about average for the phones in our review. The CL82313 requires 12 hours to reach a full charge, which is significantly longer than most phones.","The standard version of this home phone comes with three handsets. That’s likely enough for most families, but you can expand the system up to 12 handsets. Each handset beyond the initial three costs extra and must be ordered separately. The built-in intercom is very useful, as it uses each handset’s speakerphone to communicate with other people in your home.","You won’t find Bluetooth connectivity on this landline phone, which means you can’t link your cell phone. There also isn’t a way to connect a headset. The base doesn’t have a speakerphone, so you have to rely on individual handsets for that functionality.","With room for only 50 contacts, you may find managing your list of important phone numbers a pain – especially if you keep the CL82313 for a long time. The best home phones can keep 600 or more contacts in memory. Still, the CL82313 provides enough memory for 50 caller ID entries, which is on par with the other phones we reviewed.","The phone comes with 14 minutes of space for recorded voicemail storage. That’s about average, but it doesn’t give you much room to work with; you’ll need to delete old messages to make room for new ones before too long. This cordless phone stores the last 10 numbers you called so you can quickly redial them."]},"id":"2d22077d-80ec-4966-829f-c803b09fc1c5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"21b4c5f2-4969-4bdd-9297-08f9e2c221c5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the AT&amp;T CL82313 isn’t the very best cordless phone on the market, it still has something to offer.
