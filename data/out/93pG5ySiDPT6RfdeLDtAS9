Power Team Canister Vacuum looks like a little red sports car, but it was not the speediest at picking up messes in testing for our <a href=\"/best-canister-vacuums\">canister vacuum cleaner</a> reviews. It was able to clean all of the test messes eventually, but it took more passes than most competing units. We loved how quiet it was, though. A few more passes of your carpets might be worth it with this vacuum, especially if you are easily annoyed by a lot of sound or live with people who are. If you need stronger suction, consider the <a href=\"/dyson-review\">Dyson Cinetic</a>. ","It got everything clean eventually except for the hardwood flooring. There were traces of our test messes on the hardwood section even after many passes with this vacuum. Other canister vacuum cleaners struggled with that too, though. Also, one of the best things about canister vacuums is that they clean so much more than floors so we can forgive this one somewhat if it struggled with the hard flooring.","This small canister vacuum has a few nice touches in its design that really matter to convenience and ease of use. All of the wands are designed to stand on their own, for instance, but this one actually does. That comes in handy when you have to step away to move something out of the way and you just want to come right back to where you were. Also, lots of the other wands seemed like they were going to stand on their own but then slammed to the ground the minute we stepped away for even a second. That was a pain.","This was one of the best for winding its own cord, too. That may seem like a little thing, but it was quite handy, especially compared to some of the other ones that are designed to wind but only did it somewhat, or slowly. This one quickly rolled up its own cord with the push of a button."]},"id":"1fa64526-5406-46b3-a001-a753742d66b0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4259f9ad-c2ac-4415-8b5b-de8295bdd128","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This canister vacuum didn’t clean the fastest, but it eventually got the job done.
