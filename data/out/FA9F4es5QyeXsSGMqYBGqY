It is one of the more affordable, high-quality scooters on the market and is equipped with popular features like quick and easy disassembly, a high weight capacity and anti-tip wheels, giving you the peace of mind you need to enjoy your ride.","This power scooter is priced inconspicuously when compared to other scooters. With this unit, you’ll find yourself paying a lot less for something that offers all, if not more, of the same features that a scooter costing twice as much may tout. A few of the popular features of the Phoenix HD scooter are its adjustable seat and armrests as well as its ease of portability. Disassembly is quick, allowing you to break the scooter down into four pieces. The seat also lies flat, making storage and transport more convenient for putting it into the garage, your car or anywhere else. The heavy-duty nature of the frame is also quite evident with its high maximum weight capacity of 350 pounds.","The Phoenix HD handicap scooter is also equipped with many safety features. A concern for many is how easily the device might tip on uneven surfaces. This scooter combats that fear with unique non-marking, flat-free, anti-tip wheels. You’ll be riding at the peak of safety with a maximum speed of four miles per hour, with a maximum battery range of 15 miles. And if you decide to travel at night or in a low-light area, the Phoenix HD scooter comes standard with a headlight to maximize visibility.","When it comes to charging batteries on cheap mobility scooters, you typically have two options of plugging in the batteries from the scooter, or else removing them and charging separately. This scooter works for both options and comes with a six-month warranty period that covers any issues that may arise with the battery. In addition, a 14-month electric controller and drive train component warranty as well as a lifetime warranty for the frame are also included.","The Phoenix HD is luxurious yet affordable scooter and offers you a great combination of safety and comfort. People of all shapes and sizes are able to use this scooter and enjoy its adjustable seat and extremely safe wheels. While this isn’t the fastest mobility scooter available, it combines reliable performance with numerous safety features to create a comfortable driving experience for both indoor and outdoor use."]},"id":"1fa3ff16-e20e-4bff-b9de-eac3e53dd415","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59639","url":"/phoenix-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-04T13:32:07Z","datePublished":"2014-06-04T13:32:07Z","name":"Phoenix HD","synopsis":"Mobility scooters offer a wide range of customizable and luxury features, many of which can be found on the Phoenix HD scooter.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Mobility scooters offer a wide range of customizable and luxury features, many of which can be found on the Phoenix HD scooter.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-06-04T13:32:07Z","id":"FA9F4es5QyeXsSGMqYBGqY","meta":{"title":"Phoenix HD Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Phoenix HD is a cheap mobility scooter that offers you the best combination of safety features and reliable performance.
