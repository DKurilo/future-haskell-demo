In our evaluation process, we looked at top-of-the-line DVD players, budget players and ones designed for other specific purposes. Each DVD player was carefully assessed and thoroughly tested by seasoned professionals who have years of experience using them. We set up a controlled test environment where we could evaluate things like ease of use and how quickly they start playing a disc. In our tests, we also looked at things like design, connectivity options, language and audio support, and upscaling. We noted which DVD players were the easiest to use as well as the most capable.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","After first researching DVD players online, we ordered the top devices and tested them ourselves. For hands-on testing, we used each DVD player in a controlled environment. We looked at picture quality, ease of setup and ease of use. We also evaluated how quickly each player could start playing a disc from the time we closed the tray, as well as remote control options and connectivity options.","We also looked at each DVD player’s upscaling ability, seeing if it actually looked like it made a difference to the picture, and it suffered a bit with every single player we tested. If you’re watching videos, we recommend buying a Blu-ray, remastered or digital version of the movie, if picture is really important to you, and that you invest in a high-quality television. However, given their small size and basic functionality, all of these DVDs do exactly what they’re designed to do, and do it well."]},"id":"052c6428-b472-4a8b-87f9-2bbe01b29f73","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/iRvU6EUEg6Tw7kAnWJAAiR.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electronics/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS80L08vODE5MjQwL29yaWdpbmFsL0RWRC1QbGF5ZXJzLVRlc3RpbmctMDA0LmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRvU6EUEg6Tw7kAnWJAAiR.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"iRvU6EUEg6Tw7kAnWJAAiR","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRvU6EUEg6Tw7kAnWJAAiR.jpg","alt":""},"id":"afba3f80-3994-478f-9c78-ff2d4db9ef98","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a DVD Player</strong>","Connectivity<br/>Some DVD players offer basic connectivity in the form of SCART or HDMI cables, and budget models that offer internet connectivity usually only offer a wired connection. Others offer wireless connection options and can also connect to other compatible devices such as cameras, smartphones, tablets and computers wirelessly for maximum convenience. Some also have a USB port so you can attach a USB drive to access files, movies, music and photos, or you can connect a USB-compatible device to retrieve and view files.","Picture Quality<br/>We recommend verifying the minimum resolution of your television or monitor, then checking that the DVD player you want can match it. There’s no point investing in a DVD player that can play HD content if you’ve got a basic low-resolution TV, and vice versa. However, a full HD television or monitor working with a DVD player with matching resolution provides much better image quality that’s noticeably crisper, more vibrant and more detailed.","If you have a high-resolution television and a stack of older, low-resolution DVDs, you should choose a player with upscaling abilities. These devices can slightly improve the image quality of old or low-resolution discs to give a near-HD output. If you’ve got a compatible television and you enjoy immersive movie experiences, you can choose a Blu-ray DVD player that supports 3D playback.","Extra Features<br/>Many DVD players that have internet connectivity also provide a variety of apps, including streaming services and catch-up TV. Others also include social media or web browsing applications, turning your entertainment center into a smart TV. If you want to use your DVD player as part of a home theater or home entertainment setup, consider choosing one with a universal remote that can control all your entertainment equipment."]},"id":"8bbc0b33-e28d-4538-8759-d94f2a8fd73f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/9gPLMCfjZYpxkCJy7HkThE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electronics/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS80L1EvODE5MjQyL29yaWdpbmFsL0RWRC1QbGF5ZXJzLVRlc3RpbmctMDAzLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gPLMCfjZYpxkCJy7HkThE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"9gPLMCfjZYpxkCJy7HkThE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gPLMCfjZYpxkCJy7HkThE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d6f3e091-db11-449c-b38c-9db82bc32c5b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>DVD Players vs. Blu-ray Players</strong><br/>If you’re unsure whether to purchase a standard DVD player or spring for a fancy <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a>, we can help. For many, the obvious choice is to spring for the fancier Blu-ray player with its myriad internet-connected features. But if you don’t own any Blu-rays – or if you already have another Blu-ray compatible device, like a <a href=\"/best-video-game-consoles\">gaming console</a> – there isn’t much incentive to make the jump.","Standard DVD players are less expensive than their Blu-ray counterparts, which is nice for those on a budget. They are a cinch to set up, and their simple interfaces and remote controls are also easy to use. DVD players are usually smaller than Blu-ray players as well, making them an all-around good choice for those who don’t have a lot of space to spare.","However, DVD players are becoming less and less common, as they are being replaced with Blu-ray players and gaming consoles. Standard DVD players lack modern physical connectivity options, like HDMI, and aren’t usually Wi-Fi compatible. Their aging design means they are less likely to be compatible with new TVs and auxiliary peripherals. They also aren’t designed to handle high-definition or 4K playback, despite the fact that many of them claim they have high-definition upscaling abilities. In our tests, we didn’t see a single DVD player that could make a standard-definition DVD look amazing on a new OLED screen.","Blu-ray players, on the other hand, are quite compatible with modern flat-screen TVs, and they offer far more connectivity options. Most of them are Wi-Fi enabled and support streaming apps – including DLNA for home media servers – allowing you to have one central device through which you can watch DVDs, Blu-ray discs, downloaded movies and video from streaming services.","If you’re on a tight budget, or don’t plan on owning any Blu-ray discs, we recommend going with a standard DVD player. But if you can spare a few dollars for the slight price increase and like having the bonus features and connectivity options, we recommend Blu-ray players all the way."]},"id":"ada2078c-aac7-43b6-ab88-ac4bde0e69aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"d4aaa434-21ef-4bdd-8a1e-67cefc2b5653","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/panasonic-dvd-s700-review\">Panasonic DVD-S700</a>","<a href=\"/sony-dvp-sr510h-review\">Sony DVP-SR510H</a>","<a href=\"/impecca-dvhp-9117-review\">Impecca DVHP-9117</a>","<a href=\"/craig-cvd401a-review\">Craig CVD401A</a>","<a href=\"/lg-electronics-review\">LG DP132</a>","<a href=\"/gpx-dh300b-review\">GPX DH300B</a>","<a href=\"/sanyo-review\">Sanyo FWDP105F</a>","<a href=\"/insignia-ns-hdvd18-review\">Insignia NS-HDVD18</a>","<a href=\"/sony-dvpsr210p-review\">Sony DVPSR210P</a>","<a href=\"/sylvania-sdvd6655-b-review\">Sylvania Sdvd6655 Dvd Player With 1080p Upconversion</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"15cf49cd-a111-4e2b-bda6-d7415e3bc79f","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_363","url":"/best-standard-dvd-players","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T21:58:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T21:58:00Z","name":"Best DVD Players of 2019","synopsis":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
