If you were to buy a program for each feature from one of the top PC utilities, you would end up spending a fortune and having a desk with stacks of different boxes on it. People want a program that does everything, but costs nothing. That s where PC utilities factor into the equation. For the little bit of money that you would spend on one of the top PC utilities, you&#39;re going to get so much in return.","It s understandable to panic and think your computer is broken when it s starting to have problems. Electronics have a way of breaking down; however, we can sometimes imagine that they re breaking down when we have just used the new, top of the line model. Our computer is likely running at peak condition. It s just not running at the level of the newer models. There comes a time in every computer user s life when they have to upgrade their system. That doesn t mean you should trade your current model in for the new one every time a new model comes out. You should wait until your current computer stops working before you get a new one.","Cars have a way of breaking down, no matter how old they might be. The same goes for computers. You wouldn t trade in a car right after you got it because it had some minor problem, so why would you do the same when your computer is suffering from a minor issue? Of course, you re not going to want to try and piece together the shambles of a computer following a catastrophic failure. When it comes to any item you purchase, there s a time when you should cash in your chips and replace whatever it is that you bought. But that time shouldn t come when you re experiencing nothing more than a slowdown.","If your computer is starting to drag a little, don t go out and buy a new one tomorrow. Reach for one of the top-rated PC utilities and your system will start running like new once again. In fact, its performance after using PC utilities might be greater than what you experienced when you first got the computer out of the box. You&#39;re never going to know the benefits that come with using PC utilities until you pick up one of the many great PC utilities on the marketplace today.","A lot of computers come loaded with excess advertising software that can make a new computer slower than it should be out of the box. If you have any problems with preloaded software, we recommend that you uninstall all of it yourself or take your computer to a trained computer maintenance professional. They will be able to get all of it off of your machine for you so it s running at peak condition. Preloaded software is dangerous, so you need to get rid of it before it starts to cause serious problems you can t fix. PC utilities can help you figure out the other things that are going wrong with your computer."," "]},"id":"1a177c05-bee9-41ff-8c4c-52726f86b154","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4927","url":"/pc-utilities-why-you-need-them","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"allen-glines","url":"/author/allen-glines","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Allen Glines","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"BiyVe2vAJdgjoSh5weh9rf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-21T19:21:56Z","datePublished":"2010-09-21T19:21:56Z","name":"PC Utilities: Why You Need Them","synopsis":"PC utilities combine the best of the best in terms of maintenance tools and diagnostic features.","review":{},"strapline":"PC utilities combine the best of the best in terms of maintenance tools and diagnostic features.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-03T20:04:06Z","id":"rFopsbRN3XGVChgE3aXjgN","meta":{"title":"PC Utilities: Why You Need Them","description":"PC utilities combine the best of the best in terms of maintenance tools and diagnostic features.
