The manufacturer makes nearly every aspect of this antenna look and sound better than it actually is. The HD-2605 does not reach signals that are 125 miles away, as Lava claims it will, and we’re almost certain that it’s impossible for any <a href=\"/best-hdtv-antennas\">HDTV antenna</a> to reach that far."]},"id":"7e17e73e-9d41-4a8b-80ee-c4b107140864","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Signal Quality"},"id":"038d188e-76c9-43a5-82ed-269cab125b04","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It is always frustrating when you’re in the middle of your favorite show and your antenna inexplicably freezes up and loses the signal. If the reception from the HD-2605 wasn’t so spotty and frequently dropped, we would love it. We found that this antenna usually relays sharp HD images until there is some sort of outdoor interference, at which point it will freeze up, go blank or become muddled.","Although it does receive both UHF and VHF channels, the HD-2605 does not like signal interferences. Its performance quality is noticeably lower in places with mountains and large buildings, so if you are using this antenna in an area with trees or hills, mount it high on your roof."]},"id":"89cf78eb-5dac-4964-8fba-4cb4e8a85b02","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"58dad4fb-0c66-4537-ae83-ad9ac5843beb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Lava says that its HDTV antennas can get a hold of signals from up to 125 miles away, but we are not convinced. Even the largest outdoor antennas can only receive channels from about 90 miles away in optimum conditions, so we can hardly believe that this small antenna will reach any farther than that.","It does do well for it size, however. Picking up channels from up to 60 miles away is impressive for an HDTV antenna that is less than three feet long, but we wish this exceptional reach was mirrored with exceptional signal pickup and maintenance quality."]},"id":"aeb7e1d2-d65a-403c-ab85-c3882c58cf66","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"5f71b6d4-ffe4-423b-b888-55f5436b5a47","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We’re worried about how long this antenna will last. It is made mostly of plastic and seems rather fragile for an outdoor antenna. It almost seems like the HD-2605 will snap with the slightest gust of wind, so we are not sure how well it will survive under the weight of snow or in a fierce windstorm.","Our favorite thing about the HD-2605 is its remote-controlled rotor built onto the base of the antenna unit. With it, you no longer need to climb to your rooftop in order to change the antenna’s direction to pick up different channels. Rotating your HDTV antenna is as easy as stepping outside, pointing the remote at the antenna and holding down a button until the antenna is pointing in the desired direction."]},"id":"0a68a796-ef98-46b5-b18e-c4052c0c924f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c3848796-bfdc-4536-a043-e968b2ca4f8a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The<strong> </strong>HD-2605 Outdoor Antenna from Lava could be a fantastic HDTV antenna if it were better at receiving and holding channels.
