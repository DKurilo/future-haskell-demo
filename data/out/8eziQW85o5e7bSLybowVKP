The American Heart Association recommends you walk 10,000 steps per day to be active. When you accomplish the recommended goal, whatever the number, you&#39;ll feel proud of yourself and have more energy. Pedometers are the perfect way to track your activity throughout your daily routine. Counting your steps will encourage you to walk or run more and boost your step count. The Ozeri 4x3sport motivates you to be more active and records up to 1 million aerobic and walking steps. That&#39;s more than 200 miles!","The Ozeri 4x3sport its sister model, the 4x3motion, records distance, calories, and aerobic and walking steps. It also clocks the amount of time you were active. Other features on this pedometer are handy for organizing and timing your activity. This Ozeri model comes with a clock, calendar and sports timer. Regardless of your activity level, the built-in memory lasts 30 days so you can see your progress over the last month."]},"id":"3ea6a208-4fb2-44eb-a1ed-267c40214dea","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/US4pcRtqxpaskkJTHkvAxG.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Older and lower-end pedometers use a pendulum to record your steps based on the swing of your hips, a method that is prone to miscounting steps. The Ozeri 4x3sport has a built-in tri-axis sensor, sometimes called a 3D accelerometer, inside to record movement in all directions. This means you can wear this Ozeri model at any angle without manipulating the step count. With the belt clip and lanyard, you can wear it like a traditional pedometer or slide it in your pocket or purse. At only a half-inch wide, the Ozeri 4x3sport will fit anywhere on your person. Weighing 1.3 ounces, it&#39;s light enough to fit in your pocket or comfortably on your hip but durable enough to last if you drop it.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56364-ozeri-4x3sport6.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/US4pcRtqxpaskkJTHkvAxG.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"US4pcRtqxpaskkJTHkvAxG","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/US4pcRtqxpaskkJTHkvAxG.jpg","alt":""},"id":"dd54a3a3-2c56-4c8b-8d1c-5f4e2ef65197","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pedometers are one of many devices that require daily use to actualize their full potential.
