The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about DVD to MP4 Converter Software <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/convert-dvds-to-digital-files,review-4813.html\">here</a>.</em>","The 4Media DVD Ripper<strong> </strong>may not be the most well-known DVD ripper on the market, but the application proves to be an effective and easy-to-use converter. While we reviewed the basic standard edition of the software, there is also an ultimate edition that offers additional features and more robust editing tools. However, the standard version is great entry-level <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/convert-dvds-to-digital-files,review-4813.html\">video to MP4 converter</a> software that can satisfactorily convert DVDs to the digital MP4 format.","4Media DVD Ripper maintains a decent conversion speed that can convert three minutes of video in slightly less than a minute. While it&#39;s not quite as speedy as our top-ranked video to MP4 converters, the difference in speed isn&#39;t very significant, and most users (perhaps with the exception of advanced users) should find it completely satisfactory. The software&#39;s conversion quality is right on target with what we would expect from a video to MP4 converter that makes it into our top 10 lineup. When we kept all the software&#39;s settings the same as the original DVD&#39;s, we were unable to detect any differences in quality on the converted video.","The application&#39;s editing tools – or lack thereof – were a bit disappointing. This version of 4Media DVD Ripper doesn&#39;t offer any features outside of a few usability components. These include a preview window and batch conversion. The preview window is convenient because it allows you to preview specific DVD chapters in the queue before actually converting them. Batch conversion is likewise convenient because it enables you to convert multiple DVD chapters or titles in a single conversion process. Furthermore, the batch conversion allows you to select different output formats for each title or chapter you want to convert.","Given the software&#39;s no-frills functionality, we were surprised to find that its format support rivals that of our top-three video to MP4 converters. 4Media DVD Ripper can convert DVD-ROMs and DVD folders into all major audio and video formats, including AVI, WMV, DivX, MPEG2, MP3, M4A (the MPEG4 audio-only format) and others. What&#39;s more, the software&#39;s list of preset devices is equally impressive. The preset devices located in the profile field on the interface allow you to convert DVDs into formats that are compatible with many mobile devices. In addition to popular devices such as the iPhone, iPod and BlackBerry, the software can convert DVDs for playback on Xbox, Apple TV, iPad, Zune, PS3 and Wii.","The help and support options that accompany the 4Media DVD Ripper are mediocre at best. There are a few FAQs and a supplementary product guide. You can obtain technical support through an online email address. Considering the software&#39;s limited help and support, we were pleased that the application itself is easy to navigate and suitable for users with all levels of technical ability."]},"id":"e4b999c6-dda1-4d3c-be90-8751fdb08f90","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"25e7b813-daa1-4b9c-8b31-d4dddc066b48","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There&#39;s no question that this conversion application can convert DVD to MP4 exceptionally well; the software delivers decent conversion speed and top-notch video quality, and it&#39;s definitely worth a look for anyone seeking software that can perform basic DVD conversion.
