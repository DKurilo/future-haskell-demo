Online trades are priced at $6.95, and broker-assisted trades cost $19.95. cost to buy into a mutual fund is a relatively low $19.95, which is much lower than many of the more prominent brokers. Capital One does not offer any commission-free ETFs.","Capital One doesn’t offer a pure robo-advisor, but it has a hybrid approach that includes personalized management. To begin you’ll discuss your investing goals and risk tolerances with advisors who will then craft a portfolio proposal of ETFs that meet your criteria. Managed Portfolios do require a significant investment though, with a minimum amount of $25,000.","The research section on this online broker&#39;s website provides up-to-date news and investment reports. It is conveniently divided by type of investments offered. Stocks, ETFs, mutual funds and options each have their own research page, offering insight into what the markets are doing in that category. It does not offer webinars, seminars or live events like other services do."]},"id":"c67fe800-69b9-4e25-ba2d-24679381af9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b8d55309-6bfc-4c4e-abb0-016c5388f991","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Capital One Investing offers a good selection of online stock trading services and competitive pricing.
