You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Jensen is part of the Voxx International group, which also owns companies such as Audiovox and RCA, and is no stranger to electronics. Jensen makes two types of car audio head units: mechless receivers and CD receivers. The Jensen MP1516 is a CD receiver and is the newest model in the MP series.","The Jensen MP1516 is a basic head unit with limited improvements from standard, factory-installed head units. The sound quality is not as good as it could be, and this is directly related to the fact that the MP1516 is underpowered. With its power maxing out at 160 watts, it is the weakest head unit we reviewed. Also, there is not much you can do to improve the sound quality for the environment within your car.","The Jensen MP1516 comes with four preset equalizer curves. If you turn off the presets, you can manually adjust the bass, treble, balance and fader. As for expansion, the MP1516 has only one pair of RCA outputs, which will allow you to connect an amplifier or another set of speakers. An amplifier will help improve the sound quality because the car stereo system will be better powered overall.","The Jensen MP1516 has a CD player and Bluetooth capability. The microphone is included in the purchase, and you can place it on the visor or another nearby location to make and receive calls. You can stream music via Bluetooth, and you can use the three other physical inputs to play music files. The auxiliary port and the USB connection are both located on the front of the faceplate. The SD card slot, however, is located behind the detachable faceplate. The Jensen MP1516 supports an SD card with up to 8GB of storage. With all the inputs combined, the MP1516 can play both MP3 and WMA files.","Jensen provides a one-year limited warranty on the MP1516 that covers defective materials and workmanship. To contact Jensen, you have to go through the Voxx International customer care site. You have to create an account, but once you log in, you have access to live chat and an email support form. In our experience, we had trouble connecting to a customer service agent via live chat, but we received prompt responses through the question and answer email form. It is also on this customer care site that you will find the FAQs page and a sort of knowledgebase with a collection of questions and answers. If you are looking for the warranty card or the user manual, you can find them on the MP1516 product page."]},"id":"719f538b-d36a-405f-94fc-46c013e91034","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"918bde13-e8d9-4920-a3a2-c9942a6b9821","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The sound quality issue and the limited ability to customize the sound do not help the Jensen MP1516 stand out from other head units we reviewed.
