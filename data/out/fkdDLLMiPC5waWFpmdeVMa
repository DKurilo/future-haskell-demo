You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you’re searching for a new <a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">through-the-wall air conditioner</a> to replace your existing unit, you know the pain of retrofitting and trying to find a comparably sized product. The Friedrich Uni-Fit US14D30 was designed to eliminate that headache, as it fits existing 24.5-inch, 26-inch or 27.5-inch sleeves without the complication and time needed to do most retrofits. According to the manufacturer’s website, this wall AC unit should fit virtually any other through-the-wall air conditioner sleeve quickly and cost-effectively.","While this unit is definitely on the higher end of the cost spectrum for 12,000 to 13,000 BTU wall air conditioners, you’re paying for the versatility more than other features. It’s high functioning enough to be considered a decent unit, but it definitely lacks some of the more advanced features found on similar units. This unit has a 13,000/12,600 BTU cooling capacity with an exemplary six-way directional airflow. Its capacity makes this wall air conditioner ideal for rooms that are around 550 square feet, or about 25 feet by 22 feet. The dehumidifying capability is impressive; it can remove up to four pints of moisture per day.","With an energy efficiency ratio of 8.5, the Friedrich Uni-Fit US14D30 is not ENERGY STAR® qualified, though other Uni-Fit models are. All models, including the US14D30, have a “MoneySaver” setting to help conserve energy, as well as a programmable 24-hour timer that lets you decide what time the unit kicks on and off. This prevents the unit from cooling the room when you’re not home, and avoids the annoyance of having to wait in sweltering heat while the room cools after you turn the unit on manually. The remote control and auto-restart, which turns the unit back on at previous settings after a power failure, are also convenient. To help keep your air clean and fresh, this wall AC unit comes with a stale-air exhaust and a washable antimicrobial filter, though there’s no filter change reminder function.","Help and support options focus more on the generic side of things, with articles about air conditioner basics, product manuals and a glossary. There also is a list of FAQs and some how-to videos. Contact options include a 1-800 number and an email form. The included five-year warranty provides split coverage: the one-year warranty covers parts and workmanship for the whole unit; years two through five are covered by a warranty for the sealed refrigeration system only."]},"id":"e76519dd-dac7-447e-927b-4f70adcb45eb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58551","url":"/friedrich-uni-fit-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-04T21:51:05Z","datePublished":"2014-01-04T21:51:05Z","name":"Friedrich Uni-Fit US14D30","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
