The All Out Terra Trail weighs in at 10.5 oz – a relatively lightweight trail running shoe – with mesh and TPU uppers material, exemplifying the philosophy of &#34;shoe as shell&#34; while providing crucial omni-directional control. And the built-in sock liner in this <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-running-shoes\">men&#39;s trail running shoe</a> helps keep rock, dirt and other debris out of your shoe while cruising along the trail. Integrated into the upper is reflective detail for when your runs leave the trails, and visibility in lowlights means added safety.","This Merrell trail running shoe takes advantage of Vibram outsoles with 6 mm-deep diamond-shaped lugs. Vibram, which has its own trail running team, focuses performance across all kinds of terrain. Its multi-functional design and special rubber compounds add traction and control when cruising trails and hills. The TrailProtect pad in the midfoot offers additional protection against sharp rocks scattered across trails and when cruising off trail is required.","The synthetic leather lacing system in this men&#39;s trail running shoe is sufficient when combined with foot conforming cushioning that cups and elevates the heel for a semi-steep 6 mm drop. The cushioning footbed is removable for air drying, which is important in basic shoe maintenance and increasing the overall life of your trail running shoe. The Vibram outsole performed well in muddy conditions, though clearing the treads took running across up to 300 yards of gravel.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments: </strong>Merrell All Out Terra Trail is a top performer, if cushioning is particularly crucial. Its stability was surprising and underfoot protection acceptable. This model is a better choice for moderate distances rather than long jaunts over extended runs.","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Design","<strong>Best For:</strong> Spirited, short weekend trail runs, supplementing higher-mileage beefier models, one of the best minimalist trail running shoes","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"a8537133-e95e-41d2-8662-1a29f3ee5cc3","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 10.5 oz","Drop: 6 mm","Stack Height: 24 mm heel, 16 mm forefoot","Upper: Mesh &amp; TPU","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber-Vibram"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1521632f-ac33-439f-ab32-f8b855b21a37","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background: </strong>With a focus on hiking boots designed to conquering summits, Merrell was founded in 1981, starting with Randy Merrell who created custom boots.
