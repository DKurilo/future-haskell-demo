You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Liberty Wireless is a simple <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\">cell phone provider</a> with a simple offering: You can buy either a 500-minute time card or a two-week or four-week unlimited talk and text plan, and get a free phone with your order. It seems like a good deal if you don&#39;t care what device you get and just want a prepaid phone you can use to make calls. But when you consider how expensive the plans are, you can spend the same amount of money on a different provider and get much more for your dollar.","Liberty has three plans you can pick from. The first is a 500-minute plan that works a lot like a prepaid calling card with an expiration date. You pay $20 for 500 anytime minutes, and these minutes have to be used within 30 days of purchase. If you don&#39;t use all your minutes, they expire; if you do and need more, you can buy another 500 minutes, but those new minutes will still expire on the old expiration date. Thus, if you buy 500 minutes and use them up five days before the end of the 30-day cycle, then decide to buy more, you only have five days to use your new minutes. You can avoid this by waiting until the new month to buy more minutes, but you won&#39;t be able to use your phone in the meantime.","The unlimited talk and text plans Liberty offers are much more lenient. A $35 plan buys you unlimited minutes and texts for 14 days, while a $50 plan gets you 28 days of use. The two-week plan strikes us as something a covert spy might use for a burn phone – we can&#39;t think of many scenarios where someone would need a phone with unlimited minutes for just two weeks. The $50 plan, on the other hand, is close enough to a monthly plan that it might work into your budget. You should be aware, however, that because you&#39;ll pay every four weeks rather than every month, you would face 13 pay periods per year instead of 12.","You don&#39;t have a choice of devices with Liberty Wireless. Not only is there only one phone listed on its website – an LG Rumor feature phone with a slide-out keyboard – but Liberty won&#39;t always send new customers that particular phone. Given that it&#39;s free, you may not be concerned about the type of phone you get, but plenty of other prepaid providers offer a selection of discounted or free phones you can choose from, with pricing plans that easily beat Liberty&#39;s options."]},"id":"f07c28c7-18c5-4794-9d00-2bba324d8e8e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e3ccbb12-5567-4050-9d21-a8894d0d4860","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Liberty Wireless is an aging name among cellular providers, and it has an outdated pricing model to prove it.
