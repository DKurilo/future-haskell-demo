This Kenwood GPS features everything you would expect from a navigation system, along with everything you could want in a car stereo.","This in-dash navigation system easily switches between navigation and multimedia. You can even do a split-screen so you can have both your map and your music controls viewable at the same time. The large buttons on the touchscreen interface allow you to keep your eyes on the road instead of at the controls. This handy GPS will get you to where you need to go, and entertain you along the way."]},"id":"47fe1255-70b4-4506-a411-3af179cda084","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Navigation &amp; Connectivity"},"id":"570ee4cd-f74e-4562-8737-6a20d2bf962f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Before you purchase an in-dash navigation receiver, you&#39;ll need to make sure that it will fit in your car. Double DIN means that the Kenwood DNX7160 is the height of two standard car stereo receivers. It measures approximately 7 inches wide, 4 inches high and 7 inches deep. Most cars have a spacer or storage area below the factory-installed receiver that can be removed in order to make room for a double DIN unit.","This in-dash navigation system uses the reliable Garmin GPS technology, which means it features the comprehensive NAVTEQ map database. This map database gives you over 6 million points of interest (POIs). Points of interest are specific locations programmed into the GPS, so you can find popular restaurants, amusement parks, landmarks and other sites just by typing in the name. Plus they have 500 programmable waypoints, so you can enter specific addresses as your personal point of interest.","The large 6.95-inch wide video graphics array (WVGA) touchscreen monitor makes it easy to see the driving directions on the 3D map provided by the in-dash navigation system. Additionally, this GPS can display the speed limit of the road you are traveling on, so you can avoid the gripping fear of not knowing how fast you should be going when you pass a police officer with a radar gun. The Kenwood DNX7160 also has a multi-lingual interface, so you can change the language of the voice and the keyboard, if needed.","One of the most impressive aspects of the Kenwood DNX7160 in-dash navigation system is the FM TMC Traffic feature. This receiver gets traffic information that is broadcast over the FM Radio Data System. This information is then applied to your navigational route so that you can avoid traffic jams, construction or other travel delays. This is an extremely valuable tool for those that need to time their commute or get somewhere quickly and will be appreciated by everyone who uses it.","Another attractive feature of this in-dash navigation unit is the ability to help you become more eco-friendly. The Kenwood DNX7160 uses ecoRoute, which can give fuel-efficient navigation to your various destinations. It can also monitor your fuel economy and give a report of your mileage and fuel usage. These features will help teach you how to save fuel and reduce harmful exhaust emissions.","To help make sure you keep your eyes on the road, the Kenwood DNX7160 offers voice guidance and text-to-speech. Voice guidance allows you to choose the voice or accent you want guiding you, and it will give you simple directions such as &#34;Turn left&#34; or &#34;You have arrived at your destination.&#34; Text-to-speech is a computer application that actually reads the text, so you will get specific directions such as &#34;Turn left on Mockingbird Lane&#34; or &#34;Take exit 28 onto Waimea Way.&#34;","In addition to this, you can also control your Kenwood in-dash navigation system with your voice. The speech recognition software of this GPS can recognize a number of commands such as &#34;Go home,&#34; &#34;Where am I?&#34; and &#34;Find nearest gas station.&#34; You can also search for popular locations by name. This is another feature that makes the Kenwood DNX7160 an outstanding navigator."]},"id":"8c3591e8-06a2-412d-a2cc-be66ca3acc20","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Features"},"id":"370cafe4-2da8-4c26-b440-7850a8b38d29","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["GPS aside, this is still a very desirable car receiver. It includes a number of additional features that will help keep you informed, entertained and safe. You control these features using the same large touchscreen that you use for navigation.","The built-in Bluetooth can sync to your phone, so you can choose contacts, dial numbers and even voice dial while using your in-dash navigation system. You can also listen to music using a Bluetooth-enabled audio player or cell phone through this receiver. This in-dash source control will help keep you from having to fumble around with your cell phone or iPod as you drive.","This car GPS navigation system has the standard AM/FM tuner you can find in most in-dash receivers, but it also is ready for HD Radio and satellite radio. If you want to listen to satellite radio, such as SIRIUS, you&#39;ll need a conversion cable (CA-SR20V); and to connect the XM tuner, you&#39;ll need the XM interface box (KCA-XM100V). You&#39;ll also need an additional accessory for HD Radio. It&#39;s disappointing that these features are not built in, but it&#39;s good to know the Kenwood DNX7160 is ready for this kind of technology.","This in-dash navigation system can play CDs and DVDs, as well as DVD-Rs and CD-ROMs. A quick push of the eject button will make the motorized face panel fold down so you can remove or load your disc. If you hold down the eject button for a few seconds, the panel will fold down even more and expose an SD card slot. This allows you to use another method of loading multimedia.","The Kenwood DNX7160 also has an auxiliary input and a USB input so you can connect your MP3 player or other device into the sound system of your car. There are also three RCA output connections on the unit. These preouts allow you to connect external amplifiers to your system, giving you high-quality sound with additional power.","For additional safety, there is an input for a rear camera. No camera is included with this Kenwood in-dash GPS, but you can connect your back-up camera to this in-dash navigation unit so that you can see the video feed right on your dashboard. This will help prevent backing into something or someone by accident."]},"id":"6d187ac2-9dfc-4914-9e0e-6464bc16105e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"8086b5b2-2a06-4537-bd32-48e5e2f6291b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In case you need help with your in-dash navigation system, you can contact Kenwood by email or by telephone.
