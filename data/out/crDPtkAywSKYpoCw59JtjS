You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Eureka Easy Clean II 2-in-1 is a <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vacuum cleaner</a> with an odd design but surprisingly good performance. Most convertible stick vacs with a handheld-vacuum option have a hand vac that clicks off the main stick, but the Easy Clean looks like a hand vac that has a handle stuck to the top of it. It works like a regular electric broom and, when you need to convert it to a handheld vac, you simply pull the stick off the top.","The motor is a 6-volt, about half the power of other stick vacuums, but it still performed well in our in-house tests. It was particularly good at carpet cleanup, picking up all the dust and debris after only four passes, comparable to the best stick vacuums we tested.","We attempted the same tests with pet hair and the Easy Clean picked up every strand. Although the brush roll can be turned off for hardwood, the Easy Clean didn’t perform as well on hardwood, taking 8 passes before finishing the job.","This vacuum is harder to move around than other models because all its weight is near the floor. Still, it doesn’t weigh much: The whole unit weighs only 6 pounds. The motor is loud at 92 decibels, which is second to last in our lineup. The Easy Clean is twice as loud as some of the other vacuums we tested.","We also would have liked a rechargeable battery. It’s not a cordless stick vacuum, which is forgivable for using around the house, but a pain if you need the hand vac for cleaning your car or other inconvenient areas. It does include a crevice tool for tight spaces. Emptying the bin is simple. It can hold 1/2 liter of dirt and clicks off with a button. You do not have to purchase bags for this model, and the filter can be cleaned and reused.","The customer service on the Eureka website is abundant. The usual phone and email options are available, but there is a robust FAQ, how-to videos and live chat. The Easy Clean comes with a standard one-year warranty for parts and service."]},"id":"6c86304d-b59a-43aa-9f4e-4b3e41e60a6b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"063632e4-8c1c-4c49-bb63-06427572136a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a vacuum that performed well on our tests and would be a good, solitary vacuum for a small apartment or home.
