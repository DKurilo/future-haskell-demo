You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","An advantage to navigation GPS devices over using a smartphone app is the real-time traffic updates and assistance. Garmin has a program called Garmin Traffic on many of its GPS units, including the Nuvi 2577LT, that provides valuable traffic information when you need it. With a combination of useful features and lifetime traffic updates, the Nuvi 2577LT really shines as a GPS unit that is designed to help you navigate your way around tricky traffic situations.","The Nuvi 2577LT&#39;s 5-inch screen has a screen resolution of 480 x 272 pixels, giving the display a clear, bright appearance. You can choose the orientation of the device based on your preference – either horizontal or vertical – but you will have to manually adjust the orientation in the settings menu.","While this car navigation system doesn&#39;t come with free lifetime map updates, it does include free lifetime traffic updates. Garmin Traffic will provide updates and traffic information for the life of your Nuvi 2577LT, making this device a traffic expert. Garmin Real Directions provides accurate driving directions using buildings, traffic lights and other landmarks to tell you where to go and when to turn. This feature, combined with the constant traffic updates that appear on the GPS device&#39;s map, helps you get around traffic buildups, construction and accidents. To keep you focused on the road, the Nuvi 2577LT uses both speech commands and Bluetooth, so you can keep your hands on the steering wheel and your phone safely tucked away. While you&#39;re driving, the car GPS unit&#39;s lithium-ion battery will charge for as long as you have it plugged in, but it can survive for up to two and a half hours on battery life.","When you get in the car and power up the GPS unit, you can input multiple points of interest (POIs), waypoints or both, and the Nuvi 2577LT will auto-sort those destinations into the most direct route possible. The device comes preloaded with ten million POIs and you can save up to a thousand of your favorite waypoints and a hundred of your most common routes. To help you out further, the Nuvi 2577LT comes with lane assistance to let you know which lane is the best for the exit you need. It also comes with a speed-limit indicator that lets you know both how fast you are going and what the posted speed limit is, as well as a school zone speed limit indicator."]},"id":"84371827-bdf4-4116-859e-28ca64009f69","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5dfae4f9-bbc7-493b-a8b8-834db87e6191","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["During our reviews, we found that the Garmin Nuvi 2577LT is a great car navigation system that specializes in traffic information.
