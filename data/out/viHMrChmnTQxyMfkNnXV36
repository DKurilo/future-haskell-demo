You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The First Alert SA710CN is an eco-friendly smoke detector because it&#39;s recyclable as an electronic device. It comes with a 10-year limited warranty and an optional theft-prevention lock. When the lock is activated, the battery or the alarm can&#39;t be removed without using the proper tools. As with all <a href=\"/best-smoke-detectors\">smoke alarms</a>, the First Alert SA710CN should be replaced every 10 years to ensure it remains in good working order.","This smoke alarm is battery powered and has a blinking light to confirm the alarm is on and receiving power. It runs on one 9-volt battery that&#39;s included in the package. A low-battery alert lets you know when the battery needs to be replaced.","In general, you should change the battery at least once per year, or when you turn your clocks for daylight saving time. When it&#39;s time to change the battery, an easy-access battery door that slides out lets you change the battery without removing the smoke detector from the ceiling.","The alarm uses a photoelectric sensor for fire detection. Photoelectric smoke sensors are great at detecting a slow, smoldering fire, such as a fire from a cigarette burning in couches or bedding. These sensors are not as sensitive to a flaming fire from kitchen grease or paper burning in a wastebasket.","Photoelectric sensing technology can also reduce alarms caused by cooking fires and shower steam. In case an accidental alarm does occur, a test/silence button silences the alarm for up to 15 minutes. The same button is used to test the alarm. You should test the alarm weekly to confirm it is functioning properly.","With detection for smoldering fires and technology that reduces false alarms, the First Alert SA710CN is a great choice for your home. One-button testing and silencing and a 10-year warranty add to the value of this inexpensive alarm. As with all battery-powered smoke detectors, you&#39;ll need to be vigilant about changing the battery to ensure the smoke detector works when you need it to."]},"id":"dcbb415d-a6c7-4f36-a375-cd1186c0b761","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60819","url":"/first-alert-sa710cn-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-15T20:29:36Z","datePublished":"2014-10-15T20:29:36Z","name":"First Alert SA710CN","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
