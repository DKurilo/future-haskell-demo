It helps allergy sufferers with its five-stage filtration system that removes allergens. This air purifier is best suited for medium-sized rooms. It is large and loud, making it noticeable in smaller rooms.","This air purification system has a five-stage purification system. First, a washable antibacterial pre-filter captures. Next, the HEPA filter captures allergens like pet dander and pollen. The air is then sent through the third-stage cleaning process, which is a microbial treatment. Then a carbon filter captures odorous gases. Finally, the ionizer charges the exiting air particles to make them easier to capture on the next pass.","It is important to note that extensive exposure to ionized particles can be harmful to lungs, especially if you have breathing issues. Ionizers charge normally neutral particles as they pass through the unit, and these now-charged particles can enter your lungs and cause irritation or harm. Fortunately, you can turn off the ionizer to avoid lung irritation.","The Winix Ultimate Pet WAC9300 control panel displays a lot of information and can be somewhat confusing. In our testing, we found the remote is easier to use than the control panel. The air-quality sensor estimates the best fan speed for the pollutants it detects. This air purifier lacks a scheduler, so you can&#39;t set the unit to run at specific times of the day, but the operation timer runs the filter for one, four or eight hours at a time. After operation, the WAC9300 enters a sleep mode to save energy.","The Winix Ultimate Pet WAC9300 comes with a one-year warranty to protect against defects or damages. The Winix website offers a FAQs section and downloadable user manuals. If you need personal help, you can contact customer support representatives by telephone and email."]},"id":"0fadae42-79e9-4c79-ace0-af63948068b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cbb4f625-f123-4c77-b434-5f386b505dae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Winix Ultimate Pet WAC9300 is a good allergen-removing air purifier for medium-sized rooms.
