For the most part, the speakers that created the legend are powerful, huge and expensive. They also defined audio clarity and precision to a degree that has seldom been reached. The Klipsch Reference Series RF-52 floor standing speaker presents this heritage in a downsized package that is absolutely superb as a component in today’s home theater systems. They’re also good enough to excel in the role of standalone stereo speakers.

As a general, but pretty accurate, guideline, human hearing ranges from 20Hz (hertz) up to 20,000Hz, or 20kHz. A hertz is the number of cycles per second. To translate this from physics to music, it’s helpful to know that the low E note that would typically be produced by a bass guitar or upright bass is 41Hz. Middle C comes in at 262Hz while high C, the defining note of the soprano voice is two octaves higher at about 1047Hz. A small cymbal is likely to produce a pitch of around 15kHz.","The Klipsch RF-52s do a remarkable job of reproducing this broad range of sounds, especially when considering that it’s done with just three rather small drivers. Their rated frequency response range is from 34Hz to 23kHz. At first blush, it may seem that being able to reproduce sound higher than 20Hz isn’t important but that isn’t the case. Despite not actually hearing the higher sounds, known as overtones, we do perceive the frequencies. They contribute greatly to the natural, live feel of great music.","On the low end, bass response down to 34Hz can capture just about anything that a musical instrument is apt to produce; nonetheless, bass lower than that also adds to the feel of audiophile music reproduction. Addition of a subwoofer would help in this regard, but it is less critical than for most other speakers in this range."]},"id":"7bb19542-e9f2-4e00-831c-1c2e21ccabc9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Peformance"},"id":"855afd78-dcdd-4aa2-84d3-0f6a0daa04ff","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Klipsch Reference Series RF-52 floor standing speakers are remarkably efficient and sensitive with a 96dB rating. In practical terms, this means that they’ll produce next to no sound when they are not conducting signals but when driven, even with very modest amplifier power, there will be volume to spare. Additional input wattage serves to make the sound even more precise and appealing.","The manufacturer recommends 20W as the minimum input wattage for these speakers. Maximum sustained power handling and amplifier power are 100W. They can handle transients up to 400W."]},"id":"8e767ccc-1d4d-4f6f-a850-4c6014f80673","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Speaker Design"},"id":"058fef9f-3f19-440f-abe5-db8715dc06c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["No single speaker driver is capable of cleanly reproducing the RF-52’s 34Hz to 23kHz with a single driver. It’s remarkable, in fact, that Klipsch has been able to do so with just a tweeter and two rather modest 5.25-inch cone woofer/mid-range speakers. The quality of those drivers has a lot to do with the accomplishment.","When thinking historically of Klipsch speakers, it’s the tweeters that first come to mind. The company has built much of their reputation on the horn tweeter configuration which they’ve honed over the years to produce great precision and clarity in the upper ranges. Behind the patented Tractrix horn, there is a 1-inch titanium tweeter which offers superb musical realism.","As mentioned, the bass and mid-range frequencies are handled effectively by two 5.25-inch drivers with cones which are constructed of anodized aluminum. The material makes them strong and lightweight. They’re also notably more rigid that typical cones with the result being exceptionally precise mid-range sound and bass that is almost unbelievably tight given the driver dimensions. The drivers also feature copper dust caps that are very stiff compared to their light weight. This, too, adds to the overall performance precision."]},"id":"2d6efe83-87ef-42e7-85fc-d7a25f321d0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"96e881ed-2022-4892-8053-a8bc0ebaf10e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The audio speaker featured in this review site are aimed towards consumers who want to achieve a home theater sound experience that is beyond that which can typically be achieved with all inclusive systems.
