The detector certainly looks the part. Its Realtree camouflage print would feel right at home at a Louisiana duck shoot. It&#39;s one of the more attractive metal detectors we&#39;ve reviewed, and it sports a bevy of features that would put competing detectors to shame, were it more comfortable to use during long sessions."]},"id":"25094d58-ad53-4681-aa5d-fd2a1897780b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/YfyDPC8tLJ4sXUqe6kjuKX.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"When unboxing the Treasure Commander TC3X, it&#39;s easy to think you&#39;re in for a treat. Its sturdy housing looks fantastic beneath the camouflage, and it has modern curves that give it a futuristic feel. In a great design change from other detectors, the TC3X&#39;s telescoping shaft cleanly hides the search coil wire in its core. In contrast, most detectors force you to wrap the wire around and around, all the way up to the control box. Even the detector&#39;s rubberized pistol-style grip looks inviting and comfortable.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/54395-treasure-hunter-3019-deep-search5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfyDPC8tLJ4sXUqe6kjuKX.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"YfyDPC8tLJ4sXUqe6kjuKX","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfyDPC8tLJ4sXUqe6kjuKX.jpg","alt":""},"id":"0b1a8c45-b409-4141-b65e-94a7fdc023da","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sadly, the excitement over that grip goes away the more you use it. The trigger hole is far too narrow and ridged down the middle, which pinches your index finger and puts too much pressure on the middle one. The arm cup is neither padded nor adjustable, and it can rub your arm a little raw. At a full 4 pounds, the TC3X is noticeably heavier than its competition, and its unbalanced design can be tough on your wrist. Simply put, this metal detector is ergonomically disappointing.","Fortunately, the TC3X makes up for those ergonomics with features every detectorist will love. Its 11-inch DD coil cuts deeper into the earth with better precision than concentric coils. Fully custom notching lets you isolate and ignore any part of the detector&#39;s search spectrum. When you combine the TC3X&#39;s depth indicator with its pinpoint mode, you have no issues knowing exactly where to dig. With four audio tones and a combination graphic and numerical target ID, the TC3X will grow with you in the hobby, ranking it with the best metal detectors for beginners.","Since the TC3X is the flagship of the Treasure Commander line, it offers some extras you won&#39;t find on other machines, like the ability to save your dig site locations using an integrated GPS system. Granted, if you have a smartphone with GPS, then you already have that functionality, but it can be a helpful plus if you find yourself covering a lot of ground out in the wild."]},"id":"779eeb11-92af-43cd-a28f-d357841a208b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bc39142c-77ca-4a39-952e-a0e927e37ca1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There&#39;s no doubt that the Treasure Commander TC3X is a great detector, hardy and ready to impress with a beautiful design and a bevy of helpful extras.
