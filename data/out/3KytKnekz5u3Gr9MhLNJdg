You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The Onkyo Dv-cp704 is a good mid-range DVD player with nice features and the ability to hold up to 6 discs. It supports DVD-R/RW, CD-R/RW, WMA, MP3, and JPG discs, so you can view digital photos, recordable and rewritable discs on your television. For the price, this multi-disc player has quite a few really nice features.","Of course, one noteworthy feature of this player is holding up to 6 discs. Another standout feature of the Onkyo Dv-cp704 is Onkyo’s Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry, and Direct Digital Path, which makes for a clear and crisp audio signal.","Users like the Onkyo Dv-cp704, though note a few problems. Consumers have found that the disc changer is pretty slow, which is especially noticeable in the random shuffle mode. But for the value of having six separate discs and good sound at a decent price, customers like having this all-in one player for DVDs and CDs.","If you’re looking to consolidate your CD and DVD players but still be able to hold 6 discs, the Onkyo Dv-cp704 is a great solution in the mid-price range. It boasts superior audio signal and HDMI output when used with compatible HDTV displays. The price is very competitive considering the capacity. This is a good standard DVD player with additional features that make it a great value."]},"id":"92cd92c6-92d9-48d4-8577-926811726765","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_6434","url":"/onkyo-dvcp704b-3152-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","name":"Onkyo Dv-cp704 DVCP704B","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it is outdated.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it is outdated.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-08-11T18:02:08Z","id":"3KytKnekz5u3Gr9MhLNJdg","meta":{"title":"Onkyo Dv-cp704 DVCP704B Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
