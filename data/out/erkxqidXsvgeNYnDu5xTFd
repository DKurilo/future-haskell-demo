This device utilizes a powerful motor and comes with multiple attachments to create a wide array of hairstyles, all at an affordable price.

Without any attachments, these hair trimmers can cut down to a length of less than two millimeters. It won’t achieve the same shortness as a simple shave, but for individuals who want to avoid razor burns this device delivers one of the closest crops you’ll be able to achieve.","When it comes to motors, this hair trimmer has a powerful V5000 motor. This provides it with enough torque to cut through wet and thick hair alike without any major deterioration in performance. If you’re cutting through a full head of hair, you might notice the blades slowing down slightly. However, if you regularly trim hair that has only grown out over the period of a week to a month, the device will perform well.","The device also comes with oil and care instructions for maintaining it for long-term use. The typical set of hair shears has two blades fitted tightly together, with one blade vibrating left to right over a stationary blade. Despite the blades being so close together, it is still possible for hair to creep into the crevice and make its way into the motor, which can jam and burn out electrical elements. The key to avoiding this is regularly cleaning and oiling the blades to ensure they continue to operate smoothly and effectively.","Provided you properly take care of the blades, the Wahl 84701 Super Taper II is one of the best clippers on the market for at-home haircutters. The product description indicates this device is suited to salons and barbershops, but many individuals in such professions may be more inclined to purchase more expensive and feature-filled devices."]},"id":"9f93c740-6263-4dd3-80b9-916f72593526","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58167","url":"/wahl-super-taper-clippers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:28:29Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:28:29Z","name":"Wahl 84701 Super Taper II","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
