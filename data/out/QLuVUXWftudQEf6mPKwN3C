Total Protection blocked all the malware samples we used to test <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus software</a>, which included malicious websites, rootkits, Trojans, viruses and phishing schemes. It gives you in-browser reports about the threats it blocks, which we found more convenient than trying to find this information from the dashboard. These reports include the type of threat blocked and the risk of continuing to the site or downloading the infected content. It also lists the IP addresses connected with the threat, which allows tech-savvy users to avoid websites connected to those addresses.","When viruses tried to download to our computers, McAfee interrupted and tagged them. Even when we tried to resume the download, McAfee again stopped the download and displayed its warning messages. When we persisted, McAfee quickly caught the threats as the downloads completed and move them to the quarantine folder.","Overall this antimalware program wasn’t difficult to set up. It required the same steps and processes as most antivirus software. Links and tabs are clearly labeled, and the most important features, like real-time scanning and automatic updates, are active once the program is installed. We did find it hard to locate the quarantine folder but finally found it after clicking on the Settings icon. Also, while McAfee automatically updates itself, you do have to restart your computer for updates to go into effect.","We had slowdown issues while McAfee scanned our computer for threats. Several times while trying to use the cursor to attach files to email, open programs or navigate software, there was significant lag, and we often made errant clicks because the computer hadn’t caught up with the cursor. While playing games online there was noticeable lag that created a lot of distraction and in some games directly affected the outcome because we couldn’t keep control of the cursor. For this reason, we feel it’s better to let McAfee scan your computer when you don’t need to use it. However, if you don’t want to walk away during virus scans, take a look at <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus</a> that has great protection but also doesn’t create disruptive slowdown.","This malware protection software has several extra security features to keep your whole computer protected. It is one of the few programs that have a personal firewall that monitors your internet connection and alerts you if anyone is trying to piggyback on your connection. The spam filters and antiphishing tools kick in as you receive email to make sure there isn’t anything dangerous in the messages themselves or in files attached to them. McAfee Total Protection includes parental controls that let you restrict kids from visiting shady websites and set time controls that restrict internet access during certain times, like school hours and bedtime.","One great tool that comes with McAfee is social protections. These tools are specifically designed to scan your social media pages to make sure links and files posted on your profiles don’t lead to a dangerous site or a virus download. Social media sites have become a big target for malware creators since most everyone has social media accounts and uses them often."]},"id":"9098bd2d-ff05-4d1c-9bd6-53677ca319b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"99ee0267-a77b-424e-bbde-e447f5ff6b21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["McAfee Total Protection is a good Windows antivirus solution, and while it’s effective at blocking internet threats, it does create a lot of slowdown.
