Aside from the hardware used in these transactions, the procedure of the transaction is identical to that of traditional credit card processors. When you swipe a card through the iPhone credit card reader, your customer&#39;s information is securely routed to the processor, the card network, your customer&#39;s bank and, at last, your bank account, where the money, minus the processing costs, is deposited.","The most important features of the best iPhone card readers include the following:"]},"id":"0371da80-7941-4092-921c-953d9a09a3ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Pay-as-you-go or month-to-month service","Flat-rate pricing","No monthly minimum","No PCI-compliance fee","EMV-compliant card reader","Customer support available via phone and email"],"type":"ul"},"id":"24ee1422-775f-49f1-ac2b-00b06bde94ed","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re looking for a card processor that lets you accept online payments, be sure to look at our <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-accept-credit-cards-online/\">Accept Credit Cards Online</a> review.

Although some processors may claim that the EMV certification requirement doesn&#39;t apply to iPhone card readers, it actually does, according to Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Half of the processors in our review currently offer EMV-compliant card readers for iPhones and several of the others have them in development. Processing apps that scan the cards using your iPhone&#39;s camera are exempt from this requirement as they use different technology to process the card data.","<strong>Mobile Credit Card Processing: Fewer Fees</strong>","Very few of the companies offering iPhone card readers charge a monthly fee or PCI-related fees. Most also don&#39;t set a monthly minimum processing requirement, and those that do are typically full-service credit card processors that also offer mobile credit card processing as a stand-alone service. Approximately half of the companies we reviewed don&#39;t charge chargeback fees.","<strong>Mobile Credit Card Processing: Flat-Rate Pricing</strong>","Flat-rate pricing is the most popular pricing model for processors that provide iPhone credit card swipers, and most of the services in our review offer it. Flat-rate pricing is the easiest to understand since you usually pay a single percentage rate for each transaction, regardless of the type of card. Many times, you pay a different and slightly higher rate if you manually enter the card&#39;s information rather than swiping it. Some processors in our review also charge a per-transaction fee, though some only require this on keyed-in transactions.","Initially, flat-rate pricing may look more expensive than the typical starter rates that some companies advertise. One of the trademarks of flat-rate pricing, however, is that there are fewer fees with this model than with a traditional merchant account that has tiered or interchange-plus pricing. Many of the best mobile processors don&#39;t charge any additional fees.","There are some variations to flat-rate processing. Some companies, such as Cartwheel Register and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/moolah-iphone-card-reader/\">Moolah</a>, charge the same flat rate no matter how the card information is captured. Some processors charge a per-transaction fee on top of the flat rate.
