The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use.</em>","Aurora Blu-ray Copy brought up the rear of our lineup of the best <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-burning-software\">Blu-ray burning software</a> applications. The software does what it does well – burning new copies of Blu-ray discs – but outside its core functionality, it doesn&#39;t do much.","This Blu-ray burning software application has a simple interface with two simple fields: Source and Destination. All you have to do is load the disc you want to burn in your Blu-ray drive then select it in the &#34;Source&#34; field. Then select the destination you want to copy or burn the disc to.","You can either select your Blu-ray drive or another destination on your computer&#39;s hard drive. If you select the Blu-ray drive, it will perform a disc-to-disc copy which can take several hours. If you choose to copy it to your hard drive, Aurora Blu-ray Copy extracts the Blu-ray&#39;s disc image (ISO file) and saves it to your computer.","Once a disc&#39;s image is on your computer, you have the ability to burn as many new copies as you want – even without the source disc. It also acts as a virtual Blu-ray disc that you can play in compatible media players on your computer. If you want to digitally archive your Blu-ray library, extracting all your discs&#39; images is a great way to do it.","If you&#39;re going to burn multiple copies of your Blu-ray movie, we recommend burning from the disc image. This will literally save you hours than if you were to burn individual disc-to-disc copies.","We tested each Blu-ray copy software application on our lineup and timed how long it took the program to burn a new copy of a Blu-ray movie from an extracted disc image. Aurora Blu-ray Copy took 13 minutes. This is the fastest burn time we recorded among the 10 applications we tested.","In addition to our timed tests, we asked video experts to inspect each of the copies we created. Our video experts watched the Blu-ray movie Aurora Blu-ray Copy created. The end product was excellent. They could not find any flaws in the movie&#39;s video or audio. So, you get exact 1:1 copies of your Blu-rays using this software.","Despite all these great qualities, this program ranked last on our side-by-side comparison chart. Other than the above-mentioned features, Aurora Blu-ray Copy lacks the tools we look for in this category. You can&#39;t customize your discs, burn a movie-only copy or even compress large commercial Blu-rays onto smaller-capacity blank discs. Some or all of these features are present on all the other programs we reviewed."]},"id":"0f43e95e-794e-4dbe-acce-d087199fea1e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"376a4601-12a9-42ea-a330-6cbae82264dd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aurora Blu-ray copy does exactly what it name suggests – burns copies of Blu-ray movies – and it does it well and fantastically fast.
