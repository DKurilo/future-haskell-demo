Once you have recorded your LPs into the software, you can use the tools to clean up and enhance the sound quality. Audacity features tools to reduce noise, remove clicks and pops, and normalize the audio so it has more consistent volume throughout.","The Audio-Technica LP120 has multiple features that ensure the best-sounding playback for you turntable. The tone arm has a counter weight to help keep the right amount of pressure on your record. This keeps the needle and the record from being worn out too quickly. It also features an anti-skating mechanism that keeps the needle from skipping around the record. There is also pitch adjustment and a pitch lock that disables the slider once turned on. All of these features allow you to dial in your record player to get the best playback possible.","The LP120 does have RCA outputs to plug external speakers to your turntable, but it doesn&#39;t have built-in speakers or a headphone jack for private listening. Some converters act as all-in-one units with built-in speakers which make it convenient to use your turntable for actually listening to records without extra equipment.","Audacity comes with this turntable. Unlike EZ Converter – a program that comes with the <a href=\"/ion-review\">Ion Air LP</a> – Audacity does not walk you through the conversion process. You will have to set the input and output correctly before you start to record. Once those are set the process is fairly straightforward – you press Record, hit Play on the record and the conversion begins.","Audacity does not have an automatic track detection feature like other programs do. This feature recognizes silences between songs and will automatically split them into individual tracks. This makes the conversion process less hands on. With Audacity, you will need to go through the waveform and manually divide and export individual songs. When you export a song, you can add metadata such as song title, band name and album. Then when you archive your music it will all be organized.","This turntable is covered by a one-year warranty. It also comes with a user manual to help you properly set up the counter weight and the rest of the turntable&#39;s components upon arrival.
