Their cleaning power is strong, and for some people there is no substitute. However, many units are available for much less that provide great performance.","It can be difficult to judge the most important feature of any vacuum before you buy – its cleaning power. Keith Quimby, a Utah-based vacuum dealer and repairman with more than 30 years of experience, said the best way to evaluate a vacuum&#39;s cleaning ability before you buy it is to get a demonstration in a shop that services vacuum cleaners. Those are the people who know what will break first on a vacuum, and they know the reliable products and brands.","Maintenance also plays a major role in determining how well your vacuum is cleaning, especially as it gets older. Cleaning filters and dust cups regularly can make all the difference, according to Caitlin Wagner, product manager for upright vacuums at Shark. Ignoring maintenance can lead to less suction or even the total loss of a vacuum cleaner. &#34;That&#39;s when you do see a lot of malfunctions in a vacuum,&#34; said Wagner.","Utah resident Diana Lea has owned her own house cleaning business since 2002.

The vacuum cleaners that completed the tasks with the fewest passes scored the best. We purposely ground in much of the breakfast cereal to recreate a common scenario in most homes. We also purposely used debris of different types to get a sense of each vacuum&#39;s suction.","We wanted to evaluate more than just cleaning power, so we also ran each vacuum cleaner through an obstacle course in our laboratory. We observed how well each unit could get around table legs and under low-slung furniture. We also used a sound meter and made note of the decibels produced when using each vacuum cleaner. Finally, we considered features that impact portability, including each vacuum cleaner&#39;s weight and the quality and quantity of handles.","<strong>Is It Safe to Vacuum Hardwood Floors?</strong>","Because most vacuum cleaners have a stiff rotating brush on the front, it may seem like a bad idea to use them on hardwood floor, especially older flooring or flooring with a thinner finish. However, this hasn&#39;t been an issue in our experience – we have tested a lot of vacuum cleaners on a lot of surfaces and haven&#39;t seen any scratches or nicks. Some people say that the rotating brush can wear down the finish over time, but we assume that is only on the most delicate flooring. Also, while metal wheels on really old vacuum cleaners probably did cause a little damage back in the day, most are now made of softer material.","The bigger problem with vacuuming hardwood flooring is it just doesn&#39;t get clean. The rotating brush often knocks debris out of the suction path or the suction is too far from the surface to pull stuff in.

Our comparison includes bagged and bagless models. Both have their advantages: Bagged units are generally better for containing dust at all points in the cleaning process, but they do add a layer of expense because you have to keep buying bags for the lifetime of the machine. Bagless machines can sometimes create a dust cloud when being emptied, and are generally not as good at containing allergens during the cleaning process either, but you don&#39;t have to worry about buying bags.","Price<br/>The very best deep cleaning vacuums can cost more than $1,500. Our research indicates that most people are not willing to pay that much, though, even for a vacuum that is designed to have better than average cleaning power. We decided to stay in a more universally accepted price range – right around $350 and below – and found some great vacuums for the money.","Convenience<br/>Whether you decide to use an upright or canister, bagged or bagless, you want a machine that gives you the right accessories. Look for the ones that come with brushes and other tools to help you clean furniture, draperies, stairwells and other surfaces besides carpets. Features like a wide cleaning path and a long cord can add convenience by allowing you to cover more area quickly and to hunt for new outlets less often.","Help &amp; Support<br/>All products are better with good customer support from their manufacturer.
