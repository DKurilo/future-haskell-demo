The Sylvania LED lamp lasts for 25,000 hours, which is the industry standard for LED bulbs. If you use this bulb for three hours per day, every day of the year, it will last for almost 23 years. Can you imagine not having to change light bulbs in hard-to-reach locations for more than 20 years? That alone may be worth the change.","Another convenience is that this bulb doesn&#39;t contain mercury, which is a component in CFLs. When your solid-state LED lights finally need to be replaced, you won&#39;t have to dispose of them as hazardous waste. Perhaps best of all, LED lights turn on automatically. You can say goodbye to all the times you have to wait for a CFL to warm up before it shines enough light in the room for you to perform everyday tasks.","Sylvania LED lights come in several colors, one of which is a warm white. Its correlated color temperature is 2700 Kelvin. It is also high on the color-rendering index, at 90 out of 100. This means that the color of objects appear similar to how they would in sunlight.","This LED light bulb operates between the temperatures of -4 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit. It can operate in humid conditions; however, it should not come into direct contact with water.

This makes the LED light bulb a little taller and wider than a standard incandescent bulb, which on average have dimensions of 4.25 inches (MOL) and 2.37 inches (diameter).
