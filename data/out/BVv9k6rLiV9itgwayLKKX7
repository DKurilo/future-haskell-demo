It comes preassembled and folded, with buckles to give you extra peace of mind.","Unlike other baby wraps, the Hotslings baby sling carrier isn&#39;t just a long piece of fabric that wraps around you. It is already sewn into a loop that slips over your head and fastens with two buckles at the shoulder. You can pull the adjustable straps through the buckles to tighten the sling around your body. Between these buckles and the two available sizes – regular and large – the Hotslings carrier fits a parent of just about any build.","This baby sling has light padding on both sides for added structure and comfort in various carry positions. Each carry style has a handy recommended age range so you don&#39;t make the mistake of trying to place your baby in a position that he or she is too young to manage. The sling is designed for use with children as small as 8 pounds up to 35 pounds, so even young toddlers can be carried in it.","The Hotslings Adjustable Pouch Carrier is made of a blend of 97 percent cotton, 3 percent spandex to give it just a little bit of stretch. The filling of the pouch padding is 100 percent cotton, so the sling should be fairly cozy in slightly cool temperatures.","The website has a handy PDF file with details on each carry position and its recommended age range, as well as important safety information. The Hotslings website has instructions, along with photos and videos, for three carry positions: semi-reclined, front and hip. The safety instructions include visual examples of correct and incorrect placement, which is vital to ensuring that your baby can breathe adequately in the sling.","You can choose from several patterns or solid black if you don&#39;t want the flair. This particular sling seems to be designed more for moms to wear, though dads should have no problem with the basic black. And should a spill – or worse – happen to stain your sling, you can just toss it in the washing machine on the gentle cycle for easy cleanup."]},"id":"9408f7e7-d1f3-40ed-ae22-9843b444722b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58772","url":"/hotslings-adjustable-pouch-carrier-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-03T23:51:39Z","datePublished":"2014-02-03T23:51:39Z","name":"Hotslings Adjustable Pouch Carrier","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
