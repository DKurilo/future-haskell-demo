With an overabundance of advanced compression options that only a person with in-depth knowledge of the subject would understand, this <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD burning software</a> falls short of the mark in ease of use, even though it produces some of the best-looking copies we’ve seen. There is also no CSS decryption tool in the application, so you will need to find a third-party application that allows you to remove copy protection, making copying or burning DVDs even more inconvenient.","Fortunately, DVD95Copy’s feature set is respectable. There are tools you can use to compress a DVD-9 to fit into a single DVD-5 disc, as well as write to dual-layer DVD-R discs. Like several other DVD burning software applications, you can keep or omit bonus material and menus, and you can back up episodic DVDs (like TV shows) and remove region codes that prevent a DVD from being played on players outside of the region the DVD was produced in. You can also modify the specifications of the compression, though unless you have in-depth knowledge of the DVD you’re burning as well as the compression specifications you desire, this won’t be easy to implement.","Of all the DVD burning software we tested, DVD95Copy was the most difficult to use. You have to know what you’re doing with DVD copying to be able to fully utilize the application because of the huge number of compression options. So, if you’re just starting out, this isn’t the application to begin your DVD burning projects. An unintuitive interface and a lack of time-saving tools make it clunky and difficult to manage. Even the built-in error messages are difficult to interpret, and occasionally help text doesn’t even appear in the windows, making the burning process needlessly complicated.","The lack of a CSS decryptor was the only problem that we encountered when installing and setting up the application. The extra step made it more of a headache than the other applications we tested and can be a hassle if you’re already into the burning process when you find out (as we were). Be sure to download a third-party decryptor beforehand to avoid the unnecessary complications.","After hacking and slashing our way through the recurring errors and technical terminology, the DVDs we burned turned out wonderfully. DVD95Copy produces DVD copies that are easily comparable to the originals and near the top of the pile as far as DVD burning software is concerned. And, while there were constant error messages, it never seemed to affect the quality of the DVD, nor did it cause the application to lock up."]},"id":"4eed8b07-b7d3-457a-bafd-ccb3ed93933a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f7c65c93-dbe7-4227-82cd-70db67a1ae99","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you’re familiar with DVD terminology and you feel confident in your technological skills, DVD95Copy will give you high-quality DVDs whether they’re copies or original creations.
