Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Muskoka MHC35BL electric fireplace has a unique curved design and includes more heat settings than most units. It also includes a handful of design and convenience features that make it a sleek-looking, modern appliance.","Most <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplaces</a> operate with just two heat settings – low and high. The Muskoka electric wall fireplace has 10 heat settings and includes an always-on option. The 10 heat settings let you choose your desired temperature between 64 degrees and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, the unit can operate without heat to give you just the flame effect.","This unit has a Btu capacity of 4,777 and requires 1,400 watts to operate. Although it is designed to heat a 400-square-foot room – and heats it in a sufficient amount of time – it doesn&#39;t heat it to your desired temperature quite as quickly as other units on our lineup that have slightly higher Btu capacities.","This modern electric fireplace comes with both log and rock inserts, but the manual recommends you only insert one or the other when you install it. Both the rock and log inserts give the fireplace an authentic look while operating and also when it&#39;s turned off. It also has an LED flame effect, which gives the flames a realistic look. You can spice up your home or office by choosing between three different flame colors: amber, blue and a mixture of the two.","This electric fireplace weighs 36.2 pounds. It measures 36 inches wide and 17.3 inches high and sticks out from the wall 5 inches. The depth might seem like a lot at first, but considering some electric fireplaces stick out almost 9 inches from the wall, this is actually fairly thin.","If you plan on installing this unit on a wall above or below a television or above other furniture, you need to make sure you have a minimum 36 inches of clearance. This is pretty standard across electric fireplaces and ensures the unit is safely away from any combustible item.","This fireplace doesn&#39;t have touchscreen controls, but you can operate it with the remote control or the control panel on the side. The remote control comes in particularly handy when you want to turn the fireplace on from across the room.","We were also happy to see this unit includes both an automatic shut-off function and a timer. The automatic shut-off prevents the fireplace from overheating. You can set the timer to keep the unit on from one to eight hours before it shuts off automatically.","The Muskoka wall-mounted electric fireplace comes with the standard one-year warranty coverage. Additionally, you can contact the manufacturer for customer support by phone and email. Muskoka, however, doesn&#39;t provide live chat on its website for support, nor does it provide the product manual online. It does, however, provide a list of FAQs on its website that can be a helpful reference.","The Muskoka MHC35BL wall-mount electric fireplace has many heat settings that allow you to set your desired temperature. You can also use the timer to make the heat stay on for a certain amount of time before automatically turning off. And if the ambiance of a fireplace is all you want without the heat, it has that function, too. These convenient features place it among the best electric fireplaces, though Muskoka has some gaps in its customer service."]},"id":"d8e81170-e3d3-4ecc-a952-0238ded31bcb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59383","url":"/muskoka-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-18T16:04:19Z","datePublished":"2014-04-18T16:04:19Z","name":"Muskoka MHC35BL","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":92,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-07T00:00:00Z","id":"orTDZYtfanVaisXrG3grj8","meta":{"title":"Muskoka MHC35BL Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Muskoka has multiple flame color options.
