That means about 84 percent of the fuel it uses is converted into useable heat, which is high for a gas heater. This is still, of course, less efficient than electric or solar heaters like the <a href=\"/hayward-heatpro-review\">Hayward HeatPro</a> or <a href=\"/smartpool-review\">SunHeater</a>, but the payoff is that gas heaters work much faster and operate independent of the outside temperature.
