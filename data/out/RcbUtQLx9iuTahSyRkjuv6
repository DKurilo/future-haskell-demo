You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Cobra SPX 7800BT is a Bluetooth-enabled <a href=\"/best-radar-detectors\">radar detector</a> with a full-color LED display similar to the <a href=\"/cobra-dsp-review\">Cobra DSP 9200 BT</a>, which makes reading alerts much easier than most radar detectors, which generally use a single-color display reminiscent of a digital alarm clock. By connecting to your smartphone, it integrates with the community threat-sharing app Cobra iRadar. It also uses your phone&#39;s GPS to mark locations and alert you to red light and speed cameras. Without a smartphone, it&#39;s still a good radar detector with good sensitivity and accuracy, but it lacks the alert and control features that require GPS.","In our performance-detection evaluation, we looked at thousands of user reviews and consulted with experts to gauge how well the radar detectors perform, relative to each other. We gave the Cobra SPX 7800BT a B, which was the average grade.","In simple terms, most users are generally happy with its performance, though many found the Cobra iRadar app to be less than useful, despite the fact that the app boasts over a million users. The most common positive user review of this product was of the clear, high-resolution, multi-colored display.","One of the first features you&#39;ll notice is the 15-band detection, which is impressive at first glance when you consider that radar guns in the U.S. only operate within three radar frequency bands: X-band, K-band and Ka-band. The 15-band detection actually represents three types of signals: radar, laser and safety systems. Within these, it detects seven radar signals, though three of these are radar-detector detectors (RDDs), six brands of laser guns and two safety-system signals. In truth, this isn&#39;t different from most radar guns except for the addition of the Ku-band and the three RDDs.","In the U.S., radar guns are only allowed to operate within the X-band, K-band or Ka-band frequency ranges, which is why most radar detectors, like the <a href=\"/escort-max-360-review\">Escort Max 360</a>, ignore the Ku-band. Currently, only Europe uses the Ku-band, and even in Europe, it&#39;s used sparingly.","One of the best features of the SPX 7800BT is the Bluetooth connection to your smartphone. This gives it access to the Cobra iRadar app, which has an extensive community of users that report an average of 40,000 threats a day. Not only does this give you value in the form of alerting you to speed traps, speed cameras and red-light cameras, but you can get information from other users about where law enforcement is actively using laser guns.","The reliance on your smartphone is also one of the downsides. Since the radar detector lacks a built-in GPS, all of the GPS-related features that the app provides are dependent on your phone, which is dependent on a cellular signal. This means that if you&#39;re driving on a highway, away from cities and cell service, you won&#39;t benefit from the GPS features. In addition, if your phone has a slow processor, it can freeze up or slow down to the point where alerts don&#39;t give you enough time to recognize and adjust your driving. However, if your phone&#39;s battery dies, it still performs as a good radar detector. You just won&#39;t be alerted to potential threats that radar and laser detectors can&#39;t pick up."]},"id":"6bb9228b-4093-47fe-b0ea-c01b3effc32c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ba958676-ed72-40a8-bcff-be0789026c31","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cobra SPX 7800BT boasts 15-band protection, which includes the European-used Ku band and several generally useless RDD signals.
