You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Advanced series from Garmin includes features found in the Essential series, but with more innovative and intuitive functions. You will find that you have points of interests (POIs) and waypoints, and you will be able to add custom POIs and save your favorite routes. In the Advanced series models, you have access to traffic information and updates. The Garmin Nuvi 2497LMT car navigation system is a solid option in the Advanced series, with many of the functions that make navigation GPS units worth the purchase.","The screen size on the Nuvi 2497LMT is 4.3 inches measured diagonally. It has a resolution of 480 x 272 pixels and has dual orientation. The images are clear and crisp, but are only standard for a GPS unit in this category. More advanced models use twice the number of pixels. The dual orientation gives you the option to mount your car GPS unit either horizontally or vertically, depending on your preference.","The Nuvi 2497LMT comes with free map updates and free traffic updates for the life of the device. You get four map updates a year free so that you can stay up to date on road changes, business moves and newly opened restaurants. If you feel that you need an update sooner than one of those four, you can purchase updated maps from the Garmin website. With the lifetime traffic updates, you receive messages and updates while you are driving to give you vital traffic information such as accidents or blocked roadways as soon as possible. If you are still on the fastest and most direct route, the traffic program will update you with the time delay. The program can also re-route you if you come upon a faster route.","To keep your hands safely on the steering wheel, the Nuvi 2497LMT has both speech access and Bluetooth. You can control the device by voice commands, and you can make and answer calls through the GPS unit&#39;s internal speaker and microphone. However, if you choose, you can still control the device with the touchscreen. You can also connect your smartphone to your GPS system with the Garmin app. This allows you to locate your car, get real-time information on traffic conditions and share your destinations and POIs with your phone. The Nuvi 2497LMT has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that is powered by a car charger. The battery can power your GPS device for up to two and a half hours.","The Nuvi 2497LMT is preloaded with ten million POIs. Those include restaurants, businesses, gyms, schools, natural wonders, manmade wonders and more. You can save a thousand waypoints and a hundred different routes to your GPS unit for future reference. Your device also has lane assistance, a speed-limit indicator and route avoidance. However, if you want to use the Eco Route option (the most fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly path), then you&#39;ll have to purchase it separately. The device doesn&#39;t have a pedestrian mode either, which could help you navigate a city on foot."]},"id":"ca6673eb-481e-4a65-8504-5ea87149121b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5b90023b-f7a2-45a5-a01e-ca6f6b7656dd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for a GPS device that has not only the basic features, but also advanced functions that are both convenient and useful, then the Nuvi 2497LMT has what you are looking for.
