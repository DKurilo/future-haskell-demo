To learn about the fees on your card, we advise reading the cardholder agreement, which contains a detailed schedule of all the fees."]},"id":"fd495b88-e67f-4d52-8094-be2b8c51bd74","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"0e87236e-cb5f-4942-9068-fe38a9127f23","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Where Mango stands out the most is in the features it offers. Like all the reloadable prepaid debit cards we reviewed, Mango does not require a credit check to sign up. It&#39;s important to know that Mango has no effect on your personal credit, so the card will not help you improve a poor credit score.","When using Mango, you can sign up for wireless alerts that send you a text message anytime the card is swiped or money is deducted from your account. This is useful for telling you when automatic payments go through and is a useful feature for keeping track of how much you spend. Mango charges no fees for this feature, but your phone carrier may.","Mango has a smartphone app for both iPhone and Android. With this app, you can view your account balance, reset your PIN and transfer funds.","One of Mango&#39;s best features is the savings account it offers cardholders. When you sign up for an account with Mango, you can open a savings account with only $1. You can transfer funds between the savings account and the regular debit account. Mango gives you six free transfers a month. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on Mango&#39;s savings account is the highest of any of the prepaid debit cards we reviewed. Once the account reaches a certain threshold, the APY drops."]},"id":"14a24f15-adfb-4161-96ba-a6a14541f320","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Funding Options"},"id":"afc9de9d-d504-4b1e-9292-40c0a2e6fcb7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Mango offers a variety of funding options.
