You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The compact Cricut Create can help you make impressive paper crafts at home or on the road. This <a href=\"/best-die-cutting-machines\">die cutter</a> folds up, has a handle and works without a computer to make it easy to take along for crafting parties and other events.","As portable as the Create is, we think it should be even more so. At 17 pounds, it has a bit of a weight problem. It is also a less-versatile die cutting machine in some ways. It is limited to cutting and drawing only, and it will only do those with a limited selection of materials.","On the plus side for convenience is the fact that the Create is a cartridge-based system. In general, we prefer die cutters that don&#39;t require cartridges to cut, but this type of system is good for people who are less tech-savvy and super-busy types.","This quality die cutting machine can communicate with your computer through Cricut software, but only if you want it too. You can cut as much as you like with just the cartridges. The software gives you more control over the final image, though – you can adjust the size and weld letters together, or blend images from different cartridges. But at the end of the day, you have to own any image you want to use through the purchase of its associated cartridge before the Cricut Create will cut it for you.","This die cut machine gives you great control over the finished product with things such as adjustable blade pressure, depth and cutting speed. You will appreciate these features more and more as you become familiar with which settings work best for each material.","This die cutting machine seemed a little lackluster compared to others on our lineup in terms of the materials it can work with. If you are a devoted scrapbooker, it will be all you need – it&#39;s a marvel at cutting all types of cardstock. You can even throw a little chipboard, sheet magnet and foam at it. It is not designed to take on sturdier stuff, though. If you want to venture into other types of crafting, the Cricut Create may not be the right unit for you.","In terms of capabilities, this die cutting machine also falls a bit short in comparison to the best die cutting machines. The Create will certainly be leaps and bounds better than cutting out designs by hand or using a hand-crank cutter, but it does not go too far beyond cutting and drawing. It will not going to become your favorite embossing tool. It lacks that capability.","Cricut has good customer service overall. Its site is professional and organized. Inspiration and answers are easy to find. The response time for email support is not good, however. We recommend calling for answers you can&#39;t find on the company&#39;s website."]},"id":"a0d4ac7c-49d2-4115-a08e-22dfa1e733df","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"73539273-9b4a-44cb-aa9c-3bfdd3d6b74c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Cricut die cutting machines are popular and user friendly, especially if you don&#39;t like computer-aided scrapbooking.
