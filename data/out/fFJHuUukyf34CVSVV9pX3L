The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\"><em>Weed Whackers here</em></a><em>.</em>","The Echo SRM-225 weed whacker is popular among lawn care professionals and weekend yard-work warriors alike. The machine packs excellent cutting power, even though its 21.2cc, two-cycle engine is on the small side. As a result, the Echo gas trimmer is lighter to carry than the competition, weighing in at only 12 pounds. The machine also starts up reliably. It will last for years to come with minimal maintenance requirements and great technical support.","This straight-shaft model comes standard with a dual-line exit at the head, so you can get your trimming done in half the time. It also comes with a bump-feed system that works dependably. This Echo grass trimmer also comes with a black plastic debris shield to keep flying green waste off your face and clothes. The shield is rather small, so you may need to take extra precautions by adding safety glasses and steel-toed boots to your ensemble when you use this weed whacker.","The Echo trimmer&#39;s best feature is its rapid grass and weed trimming capability. The machine can slice through unwanted growth with a 17-inch-wide cutting swath. The heaviest weeds can bog down its 21.2cc engine, but the machine won&#39;t stop working completely, like some of its competitors will.","Furthermore, the Echo trimmer is easy to use. You must mix gas and oil to power the two-cycle engine, but as long as you use 89-octane fuel, the trimmer will start up and run quickly and efficiently without filling your lungs with smoke. This Echo trimmer includes anti-vibration technology, which prevents vibration-related muscle trauma.","The weed whacker&#39;s powerful engine is ideal for cutting brush, edging your lawn and cultivating a vegetable garden. It lacks attachments that allow you to prune trees and trim hedges, and sweepers and blowers for easy cleanup. A harness is available, though.","The Echo SRM-225 has one of the best warranties in our reviews. A five-year consumer warranty is more than double what you can find on most weed eaters. The driveshaft carries lifetime protection as well, so you&#39;ll never have to worry about it failing on you. Echo also provides many support services, such as service centers, an online manual and direct telephone or email support."]},"id":"5f5f55b5-13dd-40e3-ab81-87eb6b5cefff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9a4f0c9e-3779-4077-976a-b50a4618aa49","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The quality of Echo SRM-225&#39;s workmanship is apparent in its five-year consumer warranty.
