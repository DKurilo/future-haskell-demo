You ll come across computer security issues or software installation problems, and nothing is more annoying than looking for that printer driver that you need to connect your computer. These computer problems can be extremely time consuming and costly. If you try to remove a virus or don t properly remove a security threat, you can cause irreparable harm to your hard drive. This is why an <a href=\"/best-online-tech-support-services\">online tech support service</a> can be so useful. Some of the best services include <a href=\"/geek-squad-review\">Geek Squad</a>, <a href=\"/iyogi-review\">iYogi</a> and <a href=\"/support-com-review\">Support.com</a>.","Most online tech support services offer a contract that will allow you to pay a single fee and then access the customer support whenever you d like for the duration of the contract time. The online support options generally include email, chat and telephone services. The most common option is the chat support option. Online tech support services are not just for those that are unfamiliar with computers. Even if you just need some extra assistance finding a driver, changing operating systems or recovering data, the live support options could be the perfect solution.","When you use this chat feature with an online tech support service, it can become a remote access management tool and a customer service representative will be able to access your computer and fix whatever issue is plaguing you.","This remote access management tool can be intimidating to someone who has never used one. It is a very basic and safe process. After the chat is initiated and the window is opened, a representative will ask if he or she can access your computer. The window display will allow you to permit access or deny access. After you click accept, the online tech support customer service representative will be able to access your computer and control it as if he or she were sitting in front of the monitor.","There are several safety features involved with this process to help protect yourself. The first feature is that you will be able to view everything the support representative is doing. You ll be able to see everything being installed and all the files that are being viewed. Nothing will be hidden. The second safety measure is that you can stop the representative s control at any time. You will be able to block him or her from seeing your computer, installing any programs or performing any tasks on your computer. Another added benefit to this service is that because you ll be able to view all tasks performed, you may be more able to solve the problem yourself next time an issue arises.","The remote access management tools for online tech support services will allow you to have your technical issues and other problems solved with very little effort on your part. This is one of the most effective tools available for those seeking online tech support services. Rather than having someone walk you through each step, the remote access management tools can help a customer support representative solve your technical problems.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "," "]},"id":"49045599-4a1c-4466-8d65-ec32a445e8c4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6880","url":"/online-tech-support-is-remote-access-management-safe","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"seth-bracken","url":"/author/seth-bracken","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Seth Bracken","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"GEMXumKVXecmu7NVigQsKZ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-11-25T16:32:23Z","datePublished":"2011-11-25T16:32:23Z","name":"Online Tech Support: Is Remote Access Management Safe?","synopsis":"Whether you’re a computer novice or a seasoned professional, it’s very likely that you’ll encounter problems you just can’t solve.","review":{},"strapline":"Whether you’re a computer novice or a seasoned professional, it’s very likely that you’ll encounter problems you just can’t solve.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-03-13T15:45:41Z","id":"F3GtowH6gF8Pihejb5abwZ","meta":{"title":"Online Tech Support: Is Remote Access Management Safe?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
