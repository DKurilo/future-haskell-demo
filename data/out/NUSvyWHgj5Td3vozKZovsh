These tests have given us valuable experience that helps us reach our conclusions concerning more complex HVAC equipment. When we can&#39;t test products in person, as is the case with gas furnaces, we use the same thoroughness to verify our research so our decisions echo our mission to help our readers find the right products for their needs and budget.","To inform our research, we looked at resources such as the U.S. Department of Energy’s <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/home-heating-systems/furnaces-and-boilers\">Energy Saver website</a> and got advice from professional HVAC installers. We also spent time looking at pricing information, which isn’t as predictable as with other types of home appliances. Finally, we read reviews from customers and installers to evaluate each brand&#39;s reputation in terms of quality and affordability.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","As we researched to create this guide, we looked at 10 major gas furnace brands and assessed the specifications and energy efficiency of 133 models. To date, we&#39;ve spent more than 100 hours researching for this guide and its previous iterations.","Since we don&#39;t have the facilities or resources to perform physical testing on these products, we contacted local HVAC installers as well as the <a href=\"http://www.ahrinet.org/About-Us\">Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute</a> to get informed opinions on what consumers should look for in a gas furnace. The conclusions we reached and how we value the specifications of each gas furnace manufacturer&#39;s products leverage years of experience, evaluations and product testing in other categories we review.","The biggest takeaway from our research is that choosing a furnace is much more technical than an average consumer is prepared to deal with. This is why it’s best to consult with a reputable local installer whenever you decide to get a new furnace.","<strong><strong>How Much Do Gas Furnaces Cost?</strong></strong>","You can expect to pay between $2,500 and $5,000 on average to have a new furnace installed in your home. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no standard rule for how much a gas furnace costs because it depends entirely on your home&#39;s size and location, the installer you choose, the furnace brand, and its efficiency rating. This is one of the reasons that it&#39;s important to get multiple quotes from multiple installers when it&#39;s time to replace your furnace.","While researching this topic, we came across a <a href=\"https://asm-air.com/heating/furnace-installation-cost-guide-whats-a-fair-price/\">blog post</a> from All Systems Mechanical, a Santa Clarita, California contractor that gives one of the most helpful explanations we&#39;ve seen of the factors that go into a gas furnace&#39;s price. It&#39;s certainly worth a look."]},"id":"48f25eed-75db-48bf-9881-724955558c02","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"What to Look For in a Gas Furnace"},"id":"86e50523-7543-49e9-bcc8-e1fff5635e57","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>A Professional Should Install Your Gas Furnace</strong>","Most HVAC contractors have the education, skill and familiarity required to install your gas furnace properly and safely. This includes the ability to do brazing, electrical work, plumbing and framing if necessary. They should also be licensed and certified to install your new furnace. If a contractor is unable or reluctant to supply this information, that&#39;s a sign to choose someone else.","As you search for a contractor, you can check out their reputations using online customer reviews on Yelp, Google and similar websites. If they don&#39;t stand up to scrutiny, don&#39;t use them, even if they are the lowest bid. Natural gas furnaces are long-term investments, so don&#39;t budge on getting the best appliance and installation your budget allows.","A good HVAC professional will listen to your requests, answer your questions, clearly outline the required work and costs, and know detailed information about the gas furnace’s warranty. Installers will also have gas furnace suggestions for your home.","<strong>Efficiency Ratings</strong><br/>When selecting a furnace, consider its Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating. This standard was created by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and represents how much heat a furnace produces from a cubic foot of gas. For example, an AFUE rating of 96 percent means the furnace produces 96 Btu of useful heat for every 100 Btu of natural gas burned.","Furnaces with high AFUE ratings can save you a significant amount of money in heating and electricity bills. However, the furnaces with the highest AFUE ratings normally cost more than other models, so you may want to compare the higher cost with your potential energy bill savings over time to see if it&#39;s worth the investment.","The national minimum efficiency AFUE requirement is 78 percent, though most modern units start around 80 percent. Although the most efficient furnaces we came across during our research have an AFUE of 98.7 percent, over half of the models we evaluated have an AFUE rating above 90 percent.","<strong>System Size</strong><br/>Every home is different in its layout, ducting, insulation, materials and location. A natural gas furnace that is too small will not produce adequate heat in the winter or circulate enough cool air in the summer. Conversely, a system that is too large for your home will cost more to run and not efficiently maintain correct temperatures. Check with your contractor for suggestions on the best size for your home, local climate conditions and budget.","<strong>Heating Stages</strong><br/>Gas furnaces use heat exchangers to produce heat; these come in two varieties: single-stage and two-stage. Single-stage furnaces switch on and off until your home reaches the desired temperature. These are usually older, less-efficient models and are a good choice for most homes. In two-stage gas furnaces, a second, stronger stage turns on to achieve quicker results with less effort and fuel when the first stage is not effective enough.","<strong>Blower Speeds</strong><br/>In addition to heat exchangers, most gas furnaces have a blower that blows at an unalterable speed. However, you can get a variable-speed blower that tailors its output to provide constant heat in a longer, less demanding cycle. As a result, variable-speed furnace blowers use less gas and operate more quietly.","<strong>Modulating Valves</strong><br/>Some furnaces have a special modulating gas valve that works together with a variable-speed blower to provide stable temperatures in a home. Modulating furnaces can reach an AFUE of up to 98 percent. While they cost more, these furnaces maximize your comfort and can greatly reduce your overall energy costs.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>Gas furnaces usually carry two individual warranties: one for the heat exchanger and another for all other parts. The heat exchanger is the most important part of the furnace and should have the longest warranty possible, preferably over 20 years. However, the parts warranty only needs to be five to 10 years. As a separate consideration, your contractor should provide a warranty on their installation.","<strong>Rebates</strong><br/>Discuss the availability of manufacturer rebates or tax credits with your installer. This is a great way to save money and offset the initial cost of a new furnace. Government agencies actively encourage homeowners to improve their energy consumption, and you may be able to deduct the purchase of a new heating system on your taxes. In a similar way, your utility company may offer a rebate, depending on the furnace you choose. For more information, you can also visit the <a href=\"http://www.dsireusa.org/\">Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency</a> (DSIRE), a resource created by the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center that catalogs energy efficiency incentives and policies throughout the United States.","<strong>Picking a Thermostat</strong>","While installing or replacing a gas furnace goes a long way in cutting energy bills and keeping your home warm, it also helps to have a good thermostat. If you don&#39;t already have a <a href=\"/best-programmable-thermostats\">programmable thermostat</a>, it&#39;s a good way to optimize your home&#39;s heating based on a schedule. Another option is a smart thermostat that lets you control the HVAC system with your smartphone. Smart thermostats, like the <a href=\"/nest-review\">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> and the <a href=\"/ecobee4-review\">ecobee4</a>, also help you learn better ways to save energy. Many gas furnace manufacturers also make thermostats, though you can check with your contractor for other suggestions.","<strong>Switching From Oil Furnaces</strong>","While gas furnaces are the standard for forced air heating across the nation, some regions, such as the northeastern United States, still use oil furnaces as their heaters. If you are considering converting from an oil furnace to a gas furnace, consult with a licensed professional to learn about your options.
