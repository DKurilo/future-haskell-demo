With the emergence of the cloud, more and more CRM solutions are finding their way there, being hosted on the CRM company servers rather than your own, business server. This has its advantages and its cautions, just like on-premise CRM programs. Here is the rundown on both on-premise and cloud-based CRM solutions and some things to consider when choosing a <a href=\"/money/small-business\">CRM software</a> solution for your company.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>The biggest difference between cloud-based and on-premise CRM software is where your sensitive data is stored. On-premise CRM software is downloaded, or installed, onto your own server. This means you can monitor suspicious activity and provide security measures, such as anti-virus software. On-premise CRM software provides peace of mind that isn&#39;t present with cloud-based solutions.","Cloud-based CRM software is also secured on the host company&#39;s server. Since these companies are in the business of protecting so much information from a multitude of customers, it is necessary for them to make sure it is kept under lock and key. CRM host servers have additional software and security measures that may not be available for your personal server, including IT staff whose sole responsibility it is to monitor this information 24/7.","<strong>Mobility</strong><br/>Cloud-based CRM software is available whenever you need it. You don&#39;t have to be sitting at your computer in your office in order to get to your client&#39;s account and profile. With cloud-based CRM, you can access this information from any computer, laptop or mobile device. Some CRM software has mobile apps that you can download. These apps let you enter information from your mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, and will automatically update your CRM software with that information. This information will then be available to everyone in your organization, whether they are answering customer service lines or closing an investment deal.","On-premise CRM solutions don&#39;t have the same flexibility and mobility options as cloud-based CRM. Usually you are required to install some of the software applications onto each computer and network them together in order for each user to be able to effectively use it. Some local CRM software solutions have mobile apps available so you can connect with your base server and access client information, though additional software and hardware may be required for it to work properly.","<strong>Storage Limits</strong><br/>With cloud-based CRM software, you don&#39;t have to worry about running out of storage space. These solutions offer endless storage space for your data. Since this information is saved on an external server, you also don&#39;t have to worry about your computers getting bogged down with too much data. This frees up valuable computer space for more important information and allows your systems to run quicker and more efficiently.","Hosting your own CRM software will take up space on your server. Eventually you may find that additional server space will be needed and it will cost more in hardware, software and manpower to get additional servers up and running. While it is possible to have &#34;unlimited space&#34; and host your own CRM software, it is definitely more cost effective to have this information stored in the cloud.","<strong>Tech Support</strong><br/>If you have computer and electronic equipment, you need tech support. While your company is still young and in its critical growth phases, you also need as much capital as possible to invest in areas of your business where it is most important. Using a cloud-based CRM eliminates the need for additional IT support, meaning you can use those funds for more critical business investments.","On-premise CRM software will require a lot of technical support, particularly in monitoring for security threats. This option may be more desirable for your company if you feel that housing data locally on your own server is important. Just realize there will be additional operating costs and include these expenses in your work your company budget.","Whether you choose cloud-based or on-premise CRM software, it is important that you feel comfortable with your solution and that it works to help you reach your business goals.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"04f7d89e-1097-4503-954e-f32516da7efc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8358","url":"/cloud-vs-on-premise-crm-software-hosting","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-12T16:27:34Z","datePublished":"2014-03-12T16:27:34Z","name":"Cloud vs On-Premise CRM Software Hosting","synopsis":"CRM software is a great tool for organizing all of your customers’ contact information and business interactions in one place.","review":{},"strapline":"CRM software is a great tool for organizing all of your customers’ contact information and business interactions in one place.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-03-12T16:36:14Z","id":"jtsYsrMUPGqLhjLrmyVor3","meta":{"title":"Cloud vs On-Premise CRM Software Hosting","description":"Whether you want a cloud-based or on-premise solution we&#039;ll help you decide which CRM software solution is right for your business."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T21:03:34Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/RB8gqv4gfBm8oyLYXzNPr9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:03:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"8358-cloud-vs-on-premise-crm-software-hosting.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/8358-cloud-vs-on-premise-crm-software-hosting.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:03:34Z","id":"RB8gqv4gfBm8oyLYXzNPr9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RB8gqv4gfBm8oyLYXzNPr9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cloud vs On-Premise CRM Software Hosting","description":"Whether you want a cloud-based or on-premise solution we&#039;ll help you decide which CRM software solution is right for your business."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/RB8gqv4gfBm8oyLYXzNPr9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:03:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"8358-cloud-vs-on-premise-crm-software-hosting.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/8358-cloud-vs-on-premise-crm-software-hosting.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:03:34Z","id":"RB8gqv4gfBm8oyLYXzNPr9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RB8gqv4gfBm8oyLYXzNPr9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cloud vs On-Premise CRM Software Hosting","description":"Whether you want a cloud-based or on-premise solution we&#039;ll help you decide which CRM software solution is right for your business."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/cloud-vs-on-premise-crm-software-hosting","label":"","tags":[]}
