This hatchet is made from steel reclaimed from the Canadian Pacific Railway, forged into a neat tomahawk-style head with a 19-inch rosewood handle.","Although heavy, this 2.75-pound axe has a toughness rating of 58-61 on the Rockwell scale. The next hardest axe on our lineup tops out at 58, while the average for axes runs between 45 and 55. The hardness is due to the repurposed steel, which was tempered by decades of freight and passenger trains speeding over the tracks. The term &#34;buckeye&#34; comes from slang to describe railway couplings that connect rolling stock in a train.","The rosewood handle is also harder than the usual hickory found in most camp axes. It offers three gripping points for a strong swing, a precise hit, or gentler control for carving or shaving. The result is an extremely durable axe that can take punishment while still delivering great chopping power.","There are some disadvantages to this camp hatchet. For one, it is heavy, making it less suitable for longer hikes, but it&#39;s still a good choice for car camping or keeping at the family cabin. Some people may find the heavier head harder to control as well. It may take some practice to get into the groove of the swing.","The blade itself may be harder to sharpen. You&#39;re likely better off with a sturdy sharpening stone. The owner&#39;s manual has instructions on how to best sharpen the Buckeye Hatchet.","The leather sheath fits over the entire head, keeping it safe from the elements and your items and fingers safe from the cutting edge. The company offers only a 30-day guarantee, according to the website. This is much stricter than any other axe company we featured, but it applies to all products, so if you&#39;re concerned, contact the company before purchasing. You can contact customer service by email.","Treeline Outdoors was founded in 2013 by outdoorsmen and adventurers in Canada. In fact, the idea for the company started on an ill-fated camping trip in which a bear kept the founders trapped in their tents."]},"id":"c5246411-a10a-4335-8a11-20cf183b17eb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68367","url":"/treeline-outdoors-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T19:10:36Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T19:10:36Z","name":"Treeline Outdoors Buckeye Hatchet","synopsis":"The Treeline Outdoors Buckeye Hatchet is a cool-looking camping axe with a fun origin story.
