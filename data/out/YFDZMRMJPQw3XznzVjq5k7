The varying density in the sole provides stability and durability on the peripheral while providing flexibility up the center.","A shoe for the serious trail runner, Active Junky testers found unstable inclines, sketchy ridges and muddy holes irresistibly attractive while wearing these Salomon trail running shoes. With a steep drop of 10 mm, these shoes were not designed for leisurely trail strolls. In fact, these shoes make simple trails for enthusiastic runners and our field testers a bit boring.","The Endofit interior sleeve holds the foot in place while reducing friction and hotspots. Active Junky found the cushioned insole, while adding comfort, increased the tendency for a warmer foot. However, the testers solved that issue by taking the waterproof shoe through a quick river stroll. The mud guard and anti-debris mesh help ensure the remained free from buildup that could affect its performance. Further, the tongue cover protected against mud and rocks flipping up into the shoe.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments: </strong>Any time the course smoothed out to a flatter stretch, it was difficult to stick to the test trail and evaluation protocol. The temptation to go off course and cross-country were high as rubble, mud and off-camber trails do not phase this shoe. Take a second pair of shoes for base miles and save this one for hill sprints.","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Design","<strong>Best For:</strong> Apocalyptic conditions, building power and agility, first mountain running races","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"f9d471d7-61ca-49ae-9544-bf5fe0a5dd6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 11.4 oz","Drop: 10 mm","Stack Height: 30 mm heel, 20 mm forefoot","Upper: Mesh","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d9f89093-839e-4bb2-885f-c26c5b7fef1c","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background: </strong>A company that has been around for well over half a century, Salomon Group spent a signification number of years focusing on ski gear.
