You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Moultrie&#39;s Game Spy M-100 game camera is one of the most favored <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-cameras\">game cameras</a> at the mid-level price range. The camera has several strong points: it was designed with infrared technology; it offers 6-MP resolution, a time-lapse function and a sturdy case. It has many features to offer at a competitive price. While we did notice that a number of the night photos came out blurry, photos taken during the day have exceptional quality and really provide details that you may not expect from a trail camera.","The Game Spy M-100 is one of the smaller game cameras that we found on the market. It is roughly the size of an aluminum soda can and provides a 2-inch display screen and a full control panel for simple use. This game camera differs from the previous model by offering the 2-inch display screen. With this display screen, you can review your photos and delete them if you choose. The game camera offers an infrared flash for nighttime use and captures an area of approximately 50 feet. Don&#39;t let this camera&#39;s small size fool you; we found it to be durable and packed with features that you won’t find in other game cameras.","With the Game Spy M-100, you will be looking at a resolution of 6 MP. While this isn&#39;t as high as other standard cameras on the market, it is on the high end of resolution for trail cameras. While performing research on this product, we were impressed with the photos and the details that we took from each one. As with any photo, the closer the subject came to the camera, the more detail we are able to take away. When the subject moves at 50 feet away, you will still get an image of it, but it won&#39;t be as clear or detailed as you may have hoped.","One aspect of the photo quality that did disappoint us is that the photos taken at night with the infrared technology were blurry more often than they were clear. The movements of animals caused the photos to be blurry, so the only way to get a clear photo is when the animals stand completely still. While this may not be a deal breaker for all scouts, it is a serious flaw that made us think twice about the overall capability of the camera.","This Moultrie game camera offers both infrared technology and the ability to set a timer, or time-lapse photography, to capture footage of an area. The time-lapse photography feature allows you to specify when you would like footage captured, such as 30 minutes before dawn to 30 minutes after dusk, occurring every 10 minutes, or for only a portion of the day between specified hours. The time-lapse photos can only be set for daytime hours, after which you will be required to use the infrared motion-sensor technology. Thankfully, the camera can be set as a hybrid in which you set it for time-lapse photography during the day and motion-sensor snapshots at night. When we first learned about this feature and the camera&#39;s ability to automatically switch to infrared at night, we were eager to try it out. We are very pleased to announce that it works.","To make the most of the battery life, you can use eight AA batteries. If you don&#39;t have eight, the trail camera will run on four AA batteries as well. The life of the batteries is determined by the amount of footage that you capture each day and your camera&#39;s settings. In our research, we found that approximately two months of battery life is average for this camera. The camera holds an SD card up to 32GB, which provides you with a great deal of memory for the potential two months of scouting footage you could capture.","If you do have any questions or concerns, you can contact Moultrie customer support by email or a toll-free phone number. A user manual comes with the camera, and you can also access one online. The game camera has a one-year limited warranty, which hopefully you won&#39;t have to use. After emailing Moultrie, we never received a response, so our recommendation is to contact the company by phone. Each time we called, we were able to speak with a representative fairly quickly who answered all of our questions. The representatives have an advanced knowledge of the product and seemed eager to help us understand all of the camera&#39;s functions and capabilities we could take advantage of."]},"id":"89f81730-a316-497e-9243-6cd40226d7f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"85eb1cc7-6d66-4a97-887a-235eb4db51c1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite the blurred photos that we saw from the infrared technology capturing photos at night, we still found a number of features that make this an excellent choice for a game camera. This camera has the ability to either capture photos based on body temperature or movement, as well as with a timer, or time-lapse photography. Another strong feature we found on this camera is its password-protected security. Many scouts are tired of their game cameras being stolen. While password protection won&#39;t stop theft, the thief will not be able to use your camera and may think twice before taking it. While there are other cameras that we recommend above the Game Spy M-100, it is still an option to consider if its features fit your needs."]},"id":"6a03f8b7-396f-4605-a545-fe4cf4fcda3a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54329","url":"/game-spy-camera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-01-26T01:22:11Z","datePublished":"2012-01-26T01:22:11Z","name":"Game Spy M-100","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.
