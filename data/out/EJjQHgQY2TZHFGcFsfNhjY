Not everyone will use those features, but having the option is nice. This is a great machine in terms of energy efficiency, too. It has an Energy Star and ties for the best Combined Energy Factor (CEF), one metric the EPA uses to determine a dryer’s efficiency.

One type of cycle it is missing is a steam option, which can be nice for getting things to come out wrinkle-free. With a 7.3-cubic-foot capacity, this is considered a full-sized machine with ample room for most loads, but it is worth noting there are even larger dryers out there. If you do a lot of extra-large loads you may want to look for an even bigger dryer. Those with tiny laundry spaces also might want to consider something different. This is over 29 inches wide. That is not huge but there are smaller options.

We contacted manufacturers and other professionals to find answers to questions and get their expert opinions on best brands and models on the market and features to look for. Richard Spencer, owner of Utah-based Mark-A-Newt Appliance Specialists, has been in the appliance repair business since the 60s. He said the brand he repairs the least when it comes to the laundry room is Speed Queen, which is not sold online, but he also recommends Whirlpool, which also makes units sold under the Maytag label. His general rule of thumb is to look for good warranties on any appliance you buy and research how easy it is to find replacement parts before you buy. All appliances eventually break down and need repairs.","<strong>Finding the Right Dryer for You</strong>","Price<br/>Dryers range in price from $300 on the budget end to over $1,000. Higher-end machines usually have larger capacities, more settings options and upgraded features such as moisture sensors. Another thing to consider is the cost of using the dryer. Products with Energy Star certification and energy-saving modes can reduce the amount of energy consumed each time you do a load of laundry.","Capacity<br/>A <a href=\"https://www.interstatebrick.com/sites/default/files/library/nahb20study20of20life20expectancy20of20home20components.pdf\">National Association of Home Builders study</a> concluded that washers last an average of 10 years and dryers last an average of 13. If you don’t have the budget to replace the whole set at one time you may be picking out a dryer on its own, without the manufacturer&#39;s matched pairs recommendations to guide you. A good general rule is to pick a dryer with roughly double the capacity of your washer. That way even the largest load you can fit in your washer will have sufficient room to move around and get thoroughly dry.","Energy Source<br/>Not everyone has a choice of gas or electric hookups, but if you do it is worth noting that gas dryers and electric dryers tend to perform similarly. There are subtle differences in cost, though. Generally, gas dryers cost more initially but less over time than electric dryers. Gas dryers also tend to run at slightly higher temperatures so they dry laundry faster.","Key Features and Technology<br/>Most modern dryers have a wrinkle-prevention mode where it tosses a load of laundry intermittently after a cycle to prevent excessive wrinkling, so you don’t have to worry about returning home to a load of crinkled clothes. Some dryers also allow you to delay the start of a load so you can time it to finish just when you or someone else gets home.","The best dryers have a generous selection of cycles so you can customize the setting to whatever type of laundry you’re drying. Some dryers have drum lights so you can see if you, for instance, leave a stray sock behind. Other nice features to look for include a reversible door, vibration reduction, a child lock, and an end-of-cycle signal to let you know it’s time to gather you wash.","Design &amp; Appearance<br/>In addition to finding the right dryer features for you and your family, you want a dryer that looks nice and will complement the room it occupies. A matching pair creates a nice aesthetic. Often these appliances sit in kitchens and other areas where people see them, so they shouldn’t be an eyesore and should blend with the room.","The design should be practical and straightforward, with and intuitive control panel that lets you easily perform functions like adding steam or activating wrinkle reduction.","Energy Efficiency<br/>In recent years, companies have developed dryers that cut down on the use of electricity while saving you money on utility bills. Top-quality clothes dryers have advanced sensor systems that monitor the moisture content in clothing and stop the cycle when your clothes are dry, resulting in significant energy savings. Lint filter and duct-clog monitors also help conserve energy (and guard against fire hazards) by keeping airways clean.","<strong>Ventless Dryers</strong>","Vented dryers are the most common type of dryer in our comparison. The exhaust from this process – evaporated moisture – is vented outside. There are some options available that might come in handy if you do not have a way to vent the air. Some ventless options can also save a lot of energy."]},"id":"1ccb4dcc-5c87-4c1f-b1ca-41401ae52459","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Condenser Dryers – These dryers use a heat exchanger that removes moisture from warm air that has passed through your wet laundry. Once the moist air comes out of the drum it goes back into the condenser, where it is cooled to removed moisture. The resulting liquid is then pumped to a drain hose or a tray. These models can leave a room rather humid and function best in a room with good ventilation.","Heat Pump Dryers – This style of dryer takes it even a step further. When the moist air is created in the drying drum, it goes through a heat pump. A cold side condenses the moisture and the resulting mixture goes down a drain pipe or into a tank. The warm side reheats the remainder of the air to be used again for drying the laundry. Heat pump dryers don&#39;t leave the room they occupy moist, which makes them better for apartments and other small spaces. They also use very little energy, about half of what condenser dryers and vented dryers use.
