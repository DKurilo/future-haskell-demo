However, some users don&#39;t need the most advanced cooling capabilities, and these features may make the laptop cooler they choose unnecessarily expensive.","Belkin’s CoolSpot Anywhere is a laptop cooling pad that eschews features found on more advanced models in favor of a more attractive price. It&#39;s not the most powerful, quiet or feature-rich option out there, but its smart combination of cooling abilities and price make it a great choice for some users. Power users may be disappointed with its cooling ability. With only a single fan and one small, centralized output vent, this cooling pad doesn’t produce the same airflow as intense gaming models. Despite its low power, the CoolSpot Anywhere isn&#39;t particularly quiet either, producing an average noise level of 25.4 dBA. ","An included cable plugs into one of your laptop&#39;s USB ports to power this cooler. Some cooling pads come with an additional USB port to compensate for this, but the CoolSpot Anywhere does not. Once the USB cable is plugged in, the fan starts up automatically. To turn it off, you simply unplug the cable. The CoolSpot Anywhere has an ergonomic, tilted design, so it is very comfortable to use. Perhaps the best feature of this cooling pad is its rear intake vent that lets you use the cooler in your lap, on a cushion or on a bed without obstructing the fan. It is also one of the lightest and most compact cooling pads we reviewed, weighing in at only 1.3 pounds. Because of this, it&#39;s a good choice if you need a cooling pad that can travel with you.","There isn&#39;t much information on Belkin&#39;s website, so it’s best to contact the company’s support services if you have questions or concerns about this cooler. Belkin offers support through many channels – you can connect with a representative by phone, email, social media or live chat. The CoolSpot Anywhere also comes with a warranty that lasts for one year."]},"id":"15b8eb18-f7cf-4d62-991a-1c56a9c228ff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3f39b73b-a095-4b0a-8559-81f833a6ce21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Belkin CoolSpot Anywhere is a humble cooling pad that doesn&#39;t have much in the way of flashy features or additional functionality.
