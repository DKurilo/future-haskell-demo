We regularly check with manufacturers for new versions and updates to every model. Over the years, our team of reviewers has spent dozens of hours comparing, researching and rating palm routers. They have considered more than 20 models to find the perfect router for your needs and desires.","<strong>What are Palm Routers Used For?</strong>","Routers are tools that craftspeople use to hollow out and shape wood. They&#39;re essential tools for woodworkers, but many people also use routers to work on plastics and soft metals like aluminum. Just keep in mind that many of the parts are meant specifically for wood, so when you use them with some other materials, they could break, not work very well or be dangerous. Routers are typically two-handed devices that can help you cut divots and designs into wood – for example, for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WPZIG7C/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">classic colonial molding</a> for a doorway. Palm routers are small, so you can operate them with one hand and use the other hand to stabilize your material and have more control over projects. This makes palm routers ideal for working on smaller objects. Some craftspeople also attach palm routers in router tables. This method helps to steady the devices so you can use two hands to work with your material.","For additional project ideas, check out master woodworker Norm Abram at <a href=\"https://www.newyankee.com/\">New Yankee</a>.<br/><strong><br/>How We Picked the Best </strong>","We looked at several aspects when rating the palm routers. We considered how much power each tool provides, which can be ascertained by examining motor amperage, rpm range and horsepower. The higher these specs, the more muscle the tool delivers, and thus the more points it scored.","We also compared how well you can adjust each model, and awarded higher point to routers that featured such flexibility. For example, routers with variable speeds allow you to fine-tune how much power you’re using for each individual project. Tools with spindle locks can be positioned at various levels that will give you more control.","Extra features such as LED lights and a transparent sub-base are excellent at keeping your project visible and illuminated. Features like a soft start and spring-loaded release tabs help reduce wear and tear and keep a tool in good working condition.","We also considered the warranty period of each tool, since it’s is a good indicator of how well the manufacturers stand behind their products.","<strong>How Much Do Palm Routers Cost?</strong>","The palm routers we evaluated cost $128 on average. Our research shows more expensive trimmers have more muscle, accessories and features that make the machine easier to use, like an LED light.","<strong>What to Consider When Choosing a Palm Router </strong>","When considering a palm router, first determine how often you will be using it. You want to find a router that is durable and can cut and trim even the hardest substances without fail.","Most routers are powered with an extension cord, but many palm routers use battery packs. Battery models give you greater freedom to work where you need to, at any time. Consider the criteria below when choosing the best palm router for your shop or toolbox.","Durability<br/>Look for a router that has a motor with higher horsepower and amperage, and fast rpms, and is made from quality metals and plastics. The best palm routers can last for years, even decades, with proper care.","Also, consider the overall weight of the palm router. These tools are supposed to be portable, and a palm router that weighs too much for your level of strength can fatigue you quickly, potentially forcing you to take longer to complete projects or not finish them at all.","Design<br/>Not all palm routers are created equal. Look for a palm router that fits easily into your hand, has comfortable grips and is evenly balanced. Some routers are designed to be used by right- or left-handed craftsmen. Your local hardware store may have floor models you can try out after you have searched online, but if you purchase a router that is well-designed and comfortable to use, you will be much more productive.","Another important design feature to look for is whether the router has a plunge or fixed base. Plunge bases allow you to cut into your medium&#39;s interior and are ideal for custom designs, through cuts and mortises. Fixed-base routers are more stable and are perfect for beginners or craftsmen who desire more precision and stability as they work. While some routers have just one base option, others allow you to interchange base types, increasing your crafting options.","Accessories<br/>Palm routers often include accessories such as a carrying case, spare bits, wrenches and the all-important charger for battery-powered routers. Some cordless palm routers require you to purchase a charger separately, so be sure to check before buying.","Another important factor to consider is replacement bits. Because of their compact size, palm routers may or may not have the option for larger diameter bits. Be sure to check for the maximum size the router allows if you plan on using larger bits.","Warranty<br/>Most routers are covered with a standard one-year warranty. There are some with two-year warranties or a 30-day guarantee that will replace your malfunctioning unit for free. These warranties are all contingent on the unit malfunctioning because of normal wear and tear. If you know you are hard on your tools, look for a palm router that is backed by a solid warranty or replacement option.","The good news is, you have many options to explore before you buy. Palm routers in general don t vary too greatly in features or price. This is a tool that you&#39;ll want to count on for years, so be sure to find one that fits comfortably in your hand, gives you the power and speed you need and fits in your price range."]},"id":"4f63285a-82c4-4fde-8ab4-2afbd1375c97","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_163","url":"/best-palm-routers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
