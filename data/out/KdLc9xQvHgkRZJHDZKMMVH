It&#39;s one of the <a href=\"/best-compact-microwaves\">best compact microwaves</a> we tested, tying for the highest score on our tests. This one was good at basically everything. It cooks food completely and quickly. It even tied for the best score on popcorn, preparing every kernel to perfection. It would rank higher if it had a lower price. For a more budget-friendly option, check out the <a href=\"/farberware-review\">Farberware FMO07ABTBKA</a>.","This microwave has been on the market long enough that we&#39;ve tested it twice. It was great on both rounds. Like the other top-rated countertop microwaves on our list, the GE aced the first test with its ability to quickly and thoroughly cook a frozen macaroni and cheese meal. We followed the directions on the back of the box and cooked it for a total of 3:30 minutes. The temperature of the meal when it finished cooking was 171 F, which is above the recommended minimum temperature of 165 F.","We also cooked a kids&#39; frozen meal with mini corn dogs and other compartments of food. After following the instructions on the box, we recorded the temperature of each corn dog. One near the center only registered at 145 F, so we cooked the meal for another 30 seconds, which was plenty of time to bump the temperature of the colder corn dog up to 175 F. Overall, this compact microwave performed better than most of the others we tested.","Although the GE microwave is smaller than the two roomiest microwaves in our lineup, it can still fit a big mixing bowl, a tall glass or a standard dinner plate with no problem.","This GE compact microwave, like most microwaves today, includes popcorn, pizza and potato buttons. However, it is missing a sensor reheat button, so you have to guess at the time your leftovers need and monitor your food to make sure it doesn&#39;t overcook.","We cooked a potato in this microwave for six minutes, which is the average time it takes to cook a standard-sized russet potato in a microwave. It had a few raw spots, but it was still good overall.","In addition to these standard presets, the GE includes buttons for a beverage, a dinner plate and a frozen vegetable. This gives you a good variety, though some other microwaves include even more food settings, such as ones for fresh vegetables and frozen entrees.","This GE compact microwave only has a standard warranty of one year to protect your purchase. If you find that your microwave has any defective parts, including the magnetron, you can send it back to GE for a free repair or replacement. That&#39;s not great. Other units offered more coverage."]},"id":"c56cdd5d-7e07-4ffd-ad6d-1f00454bd569","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"51f1e0db-56f0-4439-b508-70e3841b5a6f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The price seems high, especially considering the small size and low wattage, but the GE JES1145SHSS outperformed some of its bigger and more powerful competitors in some tests.
