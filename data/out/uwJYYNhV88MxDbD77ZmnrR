You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The Seiki SR4KP1 is a budget-friendly, no-frills, region-free <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a>. It has a gaudy design and is entirely made of plastic, but the player has impressive picture quality.","The SR4KP1 upscales your Blu-ray discs to 4K Ultra HD. If you don&#39;t have a 4K television, it plays Blu-ray and DVD discs in Full 1080p HD. To improve picture quality even further, this model has the Deep Color video enhancement feature, which fills your screen with more vibrant colors. Out of all Blu-ray players we tested, this one booted the fastest. It took just five seconds to power on, while others took 11 seconds, on average.","We found this Blu-ray player to be one of the hardest to operate, however. The menus are complicated, and the remote feels cheap and has tiny buttons. While it’s a minor complaint, we also wish the power cord was just a little bit longer.","Although the Seiki SR4KP1 has an Ethernet port, don&#39;t expect to stream any online video from services like Netflix or HBO Go – the port is only used to service the machine. The USB port on the back is also less than useful; other players let you play video or view photos using their USB ports, but not this one. The unit also lacks an optical digital audio output and an HDMI audio output. It does have a coaxial audio output, though.","This Blu-ray player’s most attractive feature is its ability to play DVDs and Blu-ray discs from almost any country. Other players are region specific and don&#39;t play disks from foreign countries. Most region-free players are extremely expensive, but this one is quite affordable.","Seiki only includes a 90-day warranty with its SR4KP1 Blu-ray player. Most other manufactures provide you with a one-year warranty. If you need support, you can reach Seiki by phone or email."]},"id":"65c3e25e-5659-4dc8-bc71-3a91b7e91524","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97d3d8ea-6a51-4007-8556-f7df846fcd36","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although the Seiki SR4KP1 isn&#39;t as feature filled as other Blu-ray players, it has impressive video quality and doesn&#39;t have a region lock.
