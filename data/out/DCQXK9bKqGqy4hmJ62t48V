The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-beat-making-software\">Beat Making Software</a> here.</em>","Magix&#39;s ACID Music Studio 10 has the attractive outer shell of a top-rated Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) – unlimited tracking, large loop library and a decent amount of plugins. This program&#39;s shortcoming become more apparent when you begin to go in-depth with the beat program&#39;s inner workings.","When you open a blank audio template, the entire interface is white with a grid-like arrangement window to the right of the workspace. The white interface with white tracking information looks clustered and becomes difficult to navigate once you begin recording. Other beat software has dark-colored interfaces with bright tracking colors which makes it easier to work with.","The audio engine that drives ACID Music Studio 10 is a 24-bit/192 kHz audio engine. The industry-standard engines are 32-bit but 64-bit engines are becoming increasingly popular. A 24-bit audio engine isn’t as powerful as its successors and doesn&#39;t give you the headroom with audio signal that a 32- or 64-bit audio engine provides.","Unless you upgrade to the ACID Pro, you will need to do your recordings without the use of external controls. Unlike <a href=\"/logic-pro-x-review\">Logic Pro X</a>, ACID Music Studio 10 is not compatible with external control channel tracking surfaces. External controls can be useful if you prefer hands-on tools to mix and record.","Unlike most introductory beat making software, ACID Music Studio 10 does not limit your recorded capabilities. You can add as many audio and MIDI tracks per session as you need to without running into any restrictions. When you record, you won&#39;t have the ability to bus you inputs. Bussing is generally done to consolidate many audio tracks to one audio channel. This is most commonly done with drums to time, space and CPU.","Novice users will be satisfied with the loop library that holds 3,000 premade sounds and loops ready to be inserted into your compositions. There are also more than 60 plugins to choose from when adding extra effects to your recorded audio. This music creation software gives you the option to apply as many effects as you want to your audio recordings. The unrestrictive nature recording nature of this program is impressive."]},"id":"783246e2-bfd3-4cf6-80bf-1b95a1a6c217","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b45bda29-848b-42f5-8932-27228edd4ec1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ACID Music Studio 10 has its share of accolades and drawbacks.
