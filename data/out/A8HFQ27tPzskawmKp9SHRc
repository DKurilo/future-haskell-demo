The results of our tests are presented in our side-by-side comparison chart and in-depth reviews. We contacted manufacturers, professionals and industry insiders to get informed opinions and gather information that would lend authority to our recommendations and ensure that we didn&#39;t overlook essential features.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To help you choose the best digital grill thermometer, we performed several tests while grilling steaks on a gas grill. We used a stopwatch to measure how long it took each thermometer to register a change in temperature. When grilling a steak, every second counts and leaving a slab of meat on for just a bit too long can mean the difference between a medium-rare and medium steak.","Many digital grill thermometers have built-in temperature presets and doneness levels for several types of meat. We tested the functionality of these presets by grilling four steaks to four degrees of doneness: rare, medium-rare, medium and medium-well.","Although instant-read thermometers are extremely accurate and fast at reading temperatures, they did not fit our ranking criteria. We instead focused on wireless probe thermometers, which allow you to step away from the grill while your meat is cooking.","Manufacturers provide their own specifications and data, such as response time, battery life and accuracy. Response time is measured after the thermometer calculates 62.3 percent of the temperature. As we discovered, this means it actually takes longer to get a true reading than the response time manufacturers advertise. If a manufacturer offers a downloadable app to complement the thermometer, we downloaded it and assessed its usefulness and how easy it is to navigate.","<strong>What Do Digital Grill Thermometers Cost?</strong>","You can buy a fine-quality digital grill thermometer for under $20, though prices vary considerably for these products, going as high as $70. However, even those in the low to mid-price range can do a good job if they are well designed.","<strong>Further Information</strong>","Using a thermometer for food safety is &#34;just common sense,&#34; said Mark Lambert, president of the National BBQ and Grillers Association.  He believes people love digital grill thermometers for another reason: Convenience.","&#34;Barbeque has gone mainstream, and many people like to participate, but don&#39;t always like the time commitment that comes with it,&#34; Lambert said. &#34;They&#39;re busy and they don&#39;t have all day to sit by the grill. They like to be able to monitor the temperature and still go on about their lives. They can go inside, help their kids with homework, go to the store.&#34;","Lambert said digital grill thermometers also give BBQ enthusiasts confidence in their grilling so they don&#39;t overcook food to the point of dryness in an effort to avoid making anyone sick. When cooking meat, it gives people another measure of doneness rather than just gauging by how it feels to the touch or how it looks. &#34;People know that it&#39;s properly cooked,&#34; Lambert said.","Scott Radmall is a Utah CPA whose career is in corporate finance, but as a self-taught cook, loves grilling at home because this combines his love of family and good food.  He, too, depends on a top-quality thermometer because he wants the best results. “I typically use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of meats that I&#39;m cooking. To some extent I use them for food safety, but it&#39;s really a matter of monitoring so I get the meat to the right level of cooking: safe, but not overcooked,&#34; he said.","Radmall said he strives for &#34;restaurant-quality&#34; food at home, and an excellent thermometer is one of the tools that helps him achieve that.  &#34;I&#39;m someone who really cares how things turn out, especially when it comes to food.&#34;","<strong>How Does Undercooked Meat Make You Sick?</strong>","Health experts say it is safe to eat rare and medium-rare meats under certain circumstances. However, it’s a good idea to keep a grill thermometer around so you can test meat and keep your family and friends healthy. According to a 2018 <a href=\"https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/consequences-eating-rare-meat-10828.html\">article</a> by SFGate, the online companion to the San Francisco Chronicle, foodborne illnesses come with symptoms ranging from mild digestive upset to death.","It’s best to cook steaks, roasts and chops from beef, lamb and pork to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Ground red meat should register 160 degrees Fahrenheit internally, and poultry should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit to reduce the risk of illness.","If you eat undercooked meat, you could be exposed to these:","<strong>E. coli:</strong> This bacteria is found mostly in undercooked ground beef, and it can produce diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps. Symptoms typically start between two and eight days after eating the contaminated food and can last as long as a week.","E. coli bacteria are typically on the surface, so searing whole pieces of meat on high heat can sometimes kill off enough to make your meal safe. However, the bacteria may get pushed inside ground beef and mechanically tenderized meats during processing. As such, they need to be cooked all the way through.","<strong>Salmonella</strong>: You can get salmonella poisoning by eating undercooked or raw red meat or poultry. The symptoms include abdominal cramps, fever and diarrhea, and they typically develop 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Salmonella poisoning can last as long as a week, and people with compromised immune systems can die from it, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture data cited in the SFGate article.","<strong>Listeria:</strong> While listeria is often associated with prepackaged foods like lunch meat, you can get it from undercooked poultry, meat or seafood. It causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and nausea. Listeria is particularly hazardous for pregnant women, since it can cause miscarriage and other health problems. In addition, pregnant women are 20 times more likely to get sick with listeria than women who are not pregnant, the SFGate article states, citing information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."]},"id":"f34400a1-d632-4c6b-9d43-9106fcd2d73b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_174","url":"/best-digital-grill-thermometers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-14T09:15:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-14T09:15:00Z","name":"Best Digital Grill Thermometers of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best digital grill thermometers, tested and ranked by their performance, special features and customer support.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best digital grill thermometers, tested and ranked by their performance, special features and customer support.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-22T15:52:00Z","id":"A8HFQ27tPzskawmKp9SHRc","meta":{"title":"Best Grill Thermometers of 2019 - Digital, Wireless Thermometer Reviews","description":"Here are the best digital grill thermometers, tested and ranked by their performance, special features and customer support."},"products":[{"slug":"weber-igrill2","url":"/product/weber-igrill2","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","name":"Weber iGrill2","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"2yrU58H328TuUsruZWEmfB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"polder-classic","url":"/product/polder-classic","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","name":"Polder Classic","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"TUY95szxorLoqJGpvbUYTj","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"weber-igrill-mini","url":"/product/weber-igrill-mini","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","name":"Weber iGrill Mini","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"8R9no5UmYy3dNFDj4Ve8CK","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"maverick-et-735","url":"/product/maverick-et-735","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","name":"Maverick ET-735","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"Lo6D6CjEt82NBwryyzgb79","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"oregon-scientific-aw131-grill-right-talking-thermometer","url":"/product/oregon-scientific-aw131-grill-right-talking-thermometer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","name":"Oregon Scientific AW131 Grill-Right Talking Thermometer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"9hbpUmcniKojeesXfyViQ4","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/so7qe8AUphvm92PzsZdB2G.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Digital-Grill-Thermometers-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/G/H/819665/original/_Hero-Digital-Grill-Thermometers-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"so7qe8AUphvm92PzsZdB2G","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/so7qe8AUphvm92PzsZdB2G.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Digital Grill Thermometers of 2019","description":"Here are the best digital grill thermometers, tested and ranked by their performance, special features and customer support."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/so7qe8AUphvm92PzsZdB2G.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Digital-Grill-Thermometers-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/G/H/819665/original/_Hero-Digital-Grill-Thermometers-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"so7qe8AUphvm92PzsZdB2G","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/so7qe8AUphvm92PzsZdB2G.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Digital Grill Thermometers of 2019","description":"Here are the best digital grill thermometers, tested and ranked by their performance, special features and customer support."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gadgets","url":"/kitchen/gadgets","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","name":"Gadgets","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:33Z","id":"hw664pAQ3ic5obm4EFCZjh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
