You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Araya Collection is a high-performance line of <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fans</a> produced by Monte Carlo Fans. This unit is quite amazing in its design, utilizing eight blades and a 58-inch span to pump more than 5,000 cubic feet of air per minute. Its high circulation combines with a precision-balanced motor to prevent wobbling even on the highest speed setting. The motor even comes equipped with a reverse spin to better spread warm air throughout a room, making it not only a beautifully-modern device, but also multipurpose in use.","One of the most frequent complaints about even the best ceiling fans is that at high speeds, they wobble. This is especially true for non-flush mount ceiling fans, as ceiling fans tend to suffer from instability. The Araya prevents wobbling with a precision-balanced motor with 188 by 25 millimeter torque induction. This motor has a triple capacitor, allowing the fan to achieve three different speeds. Those speeds can be controlled with a wall control panel or via a remote control. The wall panel itself can be installed into an outlet box and covered with a front plate. The remote is set up separately, but it can adjust the fan’s speeds and turn the ceiling fan’s lights on and off.","When operating at full speed, this top ceiling fan achieves circulation of 5,211 cubic feet of air per minute. The Araya’s blades can be reversed to spin in the opposite direction. All of the best ceiling fans have this option. During the summer you can have the blades spin counterclockwise to send cool air down, and in the winter you can set the blades to spin clockwise to breakup cool pockets and spread warm air around. The ability to reverse the fan’s blades should save you money all year long.","The design of the Araya Collection is quite modern. Eight blades surround a brushed steel center structure that is cylindrical in shape. The blades are a cherry wood color and sport a very thin, but highly-durable appearance. This is one of the best ceiling fans with lights, offering a frosted white dome cover. The fixture itself consists of two bulbs—both included—one being 15 watt and the other 10 watt.","The Araya Collection sports a very modern and stylish appearance, utilizing its eight-blade design to achieve high levels of air circulation while still remaining a quiet ceiling fan. Its motor not only allows for multiple speeds and reversing the blades for different air circulating needs, but it also prevents wobbling. Its wide span ensures a higher level of air circulation efficiency, making this fan a desirable choice when distributing air in a large living space.","ou can set the blades to spin clockwise to breakup cool pockets and spread warm air around. The ability to reverse the fan’s blades should save you money all year long.","The design of the Araya Collection is quite modern. Eight blades surround a brushed steel center structure that is cylindrical in shape. Beneath the fan blades, directly in the center of the unit, is a light with a frosted white dome cover. The lights consist of two bulbs, one 15 watt and one 10 watt. Both bulbs are included. The blades are a cherry wood color and are very thin. It is the type of ceiling fan that puts all others to shame, stylistically.","Monte Carlo has a bunch of helpful resources for its customers. There are downloadable user manuals, FAQs and a help and support email address and phone number. All of the fans come with a limited lifetime warranty."]},"id":"4ec6a50c-f36d-46d5-b2e6-45be603aafc4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56756","url":"/araya-collection-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-14T01:56:59Z","datePublished":"2013-06-14T01:56:59Z","name":"Araya Collection by Monte Carlo","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-06-14T01:56:59Z","id":"Lvp4cxom35zkf9w58Njf3c","meta":{"title":"Araya Collection by Monte Carlo Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Araya Collection is a line of fans made by Monte Carlo that have eight blades.
