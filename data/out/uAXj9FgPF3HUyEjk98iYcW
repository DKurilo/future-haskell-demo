If you are a remote worker, this lets you stay informed about what is occurring in the office and increases your ability to communicate more effectively with your team. The technology can also make you feel as if you are actually in the presence of your coworkers, even if you are continents away. Some of these advanced video technology systems include the <a href=\"/double-review\">Double</a>, <a href=\"/ivci-review\">Acano</a> and the <a href=\"/vgo-review\">VGo</a>.","Using this type of system in the workplace makes scheduling and attending meetings flexible for all parties involves. It also reduces the need to spend time and money traveling to the meeting site. In addition, it makes it possible for you to retain your best employees, even when they decide to move away from where your business is located.","<strong>Telepresence: What to Look For</strong>","There are certain elements to look for when you&#39;re choosing video conferencing solutions. These elements will determine how you can use the technology and what benefits it will give you and your staff. The right system should help you collaborate more effectively, get work done and build relationships with your employees.","<strong>Screen Resolution</strong><br/>The screen resolution of your telepresence equipment is an important factor due to the experience it provides. A negative experience caused by low-quality screen resolution can affect how often the solution is used and how effective it is. Many conferencing systems use at least a 1080p resolution so that a large monitor may be used so that it resembles a face-to-face meeting.","<strong>Mobile Avatar</strong><br/>Mobile telepresence through avatars lets you interact with the remote environment without having to be physically present. Many of these avatars let you move about in the meeting area, navigating to different locations or even turning to face those who are speaking to you in real time. This puts you in control of conversations and collaborations with co-workers and employees.","<strong>Tablet Compatibility</strong><br/>While some telepresence video conferencing systems come equipped with built-in screens that let you see and speak to remote workers, others act as only a base and are compatible with your tablets. They may work with Android, iPad or Windows tablets, but they may require additional applications before they can be used.","<strong>Headset Compatibility</strong><br/>Headsets are a vital part of communicating through advanced video conference technology. Headsets can let you multitask as you participate in meetings and can provide a high-quality experience. Using the right headset can ensure your voice is heard in crystal-clear sound with minimal feedback and chatter. They also improve comfort, especially during long periods of use. Many telepresence systems are compatible with headsets to offer these benefits.","Communicating effectively even when you&#39;re in a remote location is possible with telepresence technology. You will want to be sure to consider each of the solutions features prior to making any purchasing decision to ensure it is the right one for your company."]},"id":"c29271ca-17e5-464e-a53d-91b8d49e0519","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0697dcc0-18dc-47c5-8640-a35eb9ec6107","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.suitabletech.com/beampro/\">BeamPro</a>","<a href=\"http://www.brothercloud.com/omnijoin/pricing.aspx\">Brother OmniJoin</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/telepresence-system-ex-series/index.html\">Cisco TelePresence</a>","<a href=\"http://www.doublerobotics.com/pricing.html\">Double</a>","<a href=\"http://www.irobot.com/For-Business/Ava-500.aspx\">iRobot</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ivci.com/product/acano/\">IVCI Acano</a>","<a href=\"https://www.revolverobotics.com/get-kubi/en/8-kubi-classic.html\">Kubi Classic</a>","<a href=\"http://www.mantarobot.com/products/teleme/index.htm\">MantaroBot</a>","<a href=\"http://www.polycom.com/products-services/hd-telepresence-video-conferencing/realpresence-desktop/realpresence-desktop-hdx-4000-series.html\">Polycom RealPresence</a>","<a href=\"http://www.vgocom.com/what-vgo\">VGo</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b250a443-5b7a-4fd7-bf9e-dc4c7be22435","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1763","url":"/best-telepresence-solutions","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-02T22:26:47Z","datePublished":"2015-08-17T17:49:02Z","name":"Telepresence Solutions Review","synopsis":"Telepresence technology changes the way businesses can operate by providing the tools necessary for flexible and seamless remote collaborations.
