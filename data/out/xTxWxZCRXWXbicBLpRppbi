The four additional burners include two with midrange outputs of 9,500 and 8,000 Btu, another 15,000 Btu burner, and a 5,000 Btu simmering burner. The middle burner can be used with a griddle. However, unlike some other gas ranges, the Whirlpool WFG525S0HV doesn’t include a built-in griddle. The full-coverage continuous grates are made of porcelain-coated cast iron, and you can throw them in the dishwasher for quick cleanup.
