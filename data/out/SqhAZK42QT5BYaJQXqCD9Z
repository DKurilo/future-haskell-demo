Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Roomba 650 is one of the older models in iRobot&#39;s product line, but it is of such high quality, so well-known and so well-regarded that it still earns a spot in our comparison of the best <a href=\"/best-robot-vacuums\">robot vacuum cleaners</a>. There is only one competitor that had more suction than the Roomba 650, which also was among the best for its ability to maneuver around obstacles. It may not have all of the latest upgrades, like a mobile app, but this unit does a great job of cleaning – and for a very low price.","In our home tests the Roomba 650 got up and over an almost 2-inch transition from hardwood flooring to tile quickly. After watching a long line of competitors hesitate and even get stuck completely on the same threshold obstacle, it was refreshing to see this one glide right over it and keep on vacuuming. It did have problems on one transition from hardwood to a thicker carpet but for the most part it was a champ in terms of self-sufficiency. This is one of the ones you would be safe to leave unattended and expect to find it doing its job when you return rather than getting stuck.","In laboratory suction tests this vacuum robot was very impressive. It struggled on pet hair, on both carpeting and vinyl flooring, but for other test messes like kitty litter and Cheerios it was always among the best.","You do not get a mobile app or remote control for programming and changing your settings with this vacuum, which can make it more difficult to control. You have to control it just using the buttons on the top. Also, its interface offers less information than some of the others, so it was not the most intuitive to use. One thing that makes it easier to use is its rubber bumpers on every side, which ensure that it does not leave scuff marks on furniture and floorboards.","It weighs just under 8 pounds and measures approximately 13 inches around, which is average. That size proved to work just fine in home tests because it was able to clean around the legs of the dining room table and under couches, even though it was not particularly petite. A carrying handle would have been nice, but since the 650 needs repositioning so rarely it won&#39;t matter very often. It almost never gets stuck, and when the battery is running low the vacuum automatically returns to its base by itself.","When you buy the iRobot Roomba 650, you get a fine assortment of customer support and help. The website has a telephone number, email address and live chat. You get a one-year warranty with this device, which is pretty typical."]},"id":"82d80c7c-f920-487b-935a-b2153f37e3a8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8d0b42db-c0af-4a05-b419-e1b0498fd318","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iRobot Roomba 650 is not the most modern of robot vacuums – the interface looks a little dated and is hard to understand, and you can&#39;t control this vacuum from your phone – but the essentials all are in place.
