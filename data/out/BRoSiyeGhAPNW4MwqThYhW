Stratasys manufactures and sells 3D printers, and it is a direct manufacturer of manufacturing parts and products.","Three additive manufacturing companies were combined to form the direct manufacturing arm of Stratasys — Harvest Technologies, RedEye and Solid Concepts. This 3D printing company works with clients from the aerospace, architecture, automotive, commercial products, dental, defense, educational and medical sectors to print on-demand products, parts and prototypes.","The company uses both additive manufacturing and conventional 3D printing technologies. Additive manufacturing adds multiple layers of material to create a product and is used to create functional parts and components for industrial purposes. Conversely, conventional manufacturing creates prototypes and models by carving layers away from a block of material. This 3D printing business offers a range of materials and printing technologies designed to meet your company’s unique needs. Also, you can incorporate numerous materials into a design to enhance functionality.","If your company needs to incorporate 3D printing into its internal process, Stratasys can help with that, too. The company manufactures 3D printers, design tools and materials around the world. Stratasys offers professional and consulting services to help you identify what technology best serves your workflow and how it can be integrated into current processes, which can help reduce printing costs and increase efficiency. Stratasys&#39; strategic transitional services include assessments, project implementation, training and proof of concept. Onsite technical services extend to system operation, application, customization and in-house support.","The MakerBot division of Stratasys has developed an affordable line of tabletop 3D printers that can be used in classrooms, small businesses or homes. The company’s Mojo and uPrint 3D printer lines offer additional desktop versions. These 3D printers come with software, materials and bases, so you can use them right out of the box. These advancements make 3D printing a viable option for educators and designers who have little or no experience with the technology.","Stratasys has become one of the top 3D printing companies in the world. Its direct manufacturing services and 3D printers for industrial, home and classroom use make it a versatile 3D printing company."]},"id":"c3088b28-8d75-476e-b26c-6cbcbbcdaa2a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66924","url":"/stratasys-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:53:40Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:53:40Z","name":"Stratasys","synopsis":"Companies across various industries use Stratasys 3D printing services to generate products, parts and prototypes.
