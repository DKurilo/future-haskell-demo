Our team of reviewers combed through dozens of models to determine which ones were the best. They spent more than 40 hours researching, comparing and evaluating these tools. They considered aspects such as weight, bevel capacity, motor power and other specifications. They also reached out to everyday, real-life users to gauge their feelings on which model is the best for certain circumstances. They combed through online reviews to find common complaints and praises. All of these factors informed our decisions to decide which miter saw is the best for you.","<strong>How We Picked the Best </strong>","Our reviewers compared and contrasted the features, benefits and drawbacks of dozens of miter saws. They chose the products we feature here based on their usability, durability, raw power and overall design. They looked for features such as bevel capacity, digital readouts, jobsite lights, soft-start, dust collection and several other common features. They looked at each product and compared them to the competition, examined results from real-life users and considered their opinions. We weighed all these points against the price tag of each miter saw to see which model gives you the most bang for your buck. We also picked the best overall based on how well it strikes the balance between the needs of all user types. In the end, the best miter saw is the one that fits your personal needs. You can examine our in-depth reviews to see which features you need for your individual situation.","<strong>How Much Do Miter Saws Cost?</strong>","We reviewed miter saws costing an average of $338, but there’s a wider range of models available designed for different tasks. More expensive saws costing $800 or more have large cutting capacities and extra features, while those closer to $150 are bare-bones for simple projects.","<strong>Can I Use a Circular Saw Instead of a Miter Saw?</strong>","It depends on the kind of project you’re working on. Miter saws allow you to cut at angles, whereas <a href=\"/best-circular-saws\">circular saws</a> are intended to only make straight cuts. That being said, you can make angled cuts on a circular saw, but it&#39;s a trickier process. If you don’t feel confident with a circular saw, then this might not be safe to attempt and we’d suggest getting a miter saw instead. For further information on how to miter cut with a circular saw, read these instructions we found on <a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/tools/miter-saws/how-to-make-perfect-cuts-with-circular-and-miter-saws/view-all/\">Family Handyman</a>.","You cannot say that either type of saw is better because they are created for different purposes. According to the <a href=\"https://sitemakerstudio.com/blog/miter-saw-vs-circular-saw\">Site Maker Studio blog</a>, you can keep your hands at safer distances from the blade when using a miter saw and you’ll have more control over the cutting process. However, circular saws are less expensive, costing $40 to $100, while miter saws typically range from $200 to $600. Circular saws tend to be smaller, while miter saws are much larger and a lot less portable, designed for a home workshop.","<strong>Important Factors to Consider When Shopping for a Miter Saw</strong>","What Are You Building?<br/>The type of wood you work with and the kind of cuts you intend to make will guide you in choosing the right miter saw for your project. A sliding compound miter saw will cut in one direction, while a dual-bevel compound miter saw can be pivoted to cut in two directions. The size of the blade matters because the smaller the blade, the more precise cuts you can make. If you are making tiny cuts, look for a model with a laser guide and an electric brake for the blade. The more powerful the motor, the deeper and faster it will cut wood. If you know you need a real workhorse, look for a motor with at least 15 amps.","Your Work Environment<br/>If you know you will be consistently working in an area that lacks access to electrical outlets, you may need a cordless miter saw. If you will be logging hours of work on the cordless, invest in extra batteries for backup, as the miter saw will eat up battery power quickly. If your workshop is already crowded and you need to optimize your workspace, consider a compact model that sits directly against the wall. If you are concerned about ventilation or quick cleanup, make sure the miter saw has an integrated dust channel to collect the debris. If you know you will move the saw around during your project, look for a lightweight model.","Level of Experience<br/>A professional is going to have different needs than a DIY homeowner. If you are doing the occasional project, you can get away with a smaller investment in a saw that can survive your weekend projects. However, if you are using this on jobsites, be prepared to spend more on equipment that can handle a lot of use. Read the fine print on the service contract and the warranty to ensure you&#39;re covered if it fails on the job.","Miter saws are among the most common woodworking tools and are a staple in any woodworker&#39;s arsenal. How often you plan on using a miter saw and the working conditions will dictate the level of investment you should make. Fortunately, there are nearly countless options and models for both consumers and professionals.<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"06ac4ac1-7f59-4aa1-965f-e7d9af3f36ec","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_175","url":"/best-miter-saws","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
