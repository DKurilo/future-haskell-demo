This premier rice maker doubles as a steamer and includes cake menu settings for baking cakes and brownies. Small rice cookers simply can’t compete with the capabilities of this Zojirushi, which account for its also high-end price tag. If you want good features and capabilities, but at a lower price, check out the <a href=\"/oster-20-cup-review\">Oster 20-Cup Digital Rice Cooker</a>.","The design of the Zojirushi NS-TSC10 is flawless. Its egg-shape gives it a smooth, futuristic look, and its picnic style handle makes it easy to transport. The inner pot holds up to 5.5 cups of uncooked rice and makes 11 fully cooked cups. The front of the unit is much more complex than simple one-touch rice cookers, but it offers a very high level of control. By utilizing fuzzy logic technology, the Zojirushi NS-TSC10 compensates for even the slightest mistakes in measurement, adjusts throughout cooking, and keeps the rice fluffy and consistent during the cooling phase. The model includes settings beyond a normal rice steamer, offering you the option to choose the grain of rice and your desired texture.","The Zojirushi NS-TSC10 also has many additional features that help justify its price tag. Even the least expensive rice cookers include a warming function, but the NS-TSC10 adds both a unique reheating function and a delayed timer, allowing you to choose when cooking begins and when you’d like the rice to be ready.","The retractable power cord makes the machine easily portable. Basic units have dragging cords, while detachable cords may come off too easily or get lost in your busy kitchen. The Zojirushi NS-TSC10 comes with a steaming basket, a rice measuring cup, a non-stick rice spatula and a spatula holder. The steaming options are more versatile than most rice cookers, and there is a steam menu setting included.","While the Zojirushi NS-TSC10 will make perfect rice, only the most discerning taste buds will be able to tell the difference between this machine and a more basic model. However, this rice cooker offers high-end features with gourmet results. It is an excellent rice cooker for tackling any grain, and it has the capability to do much more in your kitchen."]},"id":"bd006a9a-3286-44fe-a1c8-f4d485dc7c32","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60295","url":"/zojirushi-ns-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-22T19:56:51Z","datePublished":"2014-08-22T19:56:51Z","name":"Zojirushi NS-TSC10","synopsis":"The Zojirushi NS-TSC10 Rice Cooker is a high-end electric rice cooker with a sleek, stainless steel design and a multitude of add-ons.
