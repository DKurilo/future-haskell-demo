More extravagant and larger gift baskets are priced around $300, but there are also plenty available closer to the $40 range. Keep in mind many companies tack on fees if shipping requires an ice pack or other special handling. Of course, how much a gift basket is going to cost is dependent on the size of the basket, and how decadent the foods are.","<strong>Laws</strong>","Some state laws regulate the shipment of alcoholic beverages to consumers. These laws vary, but according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), you cannot ship alcohol to private addresses in Alabama, Oklahoma and Utah. This includes shipping gift baskets containing alcohol to your friends and family in these states, so shop accordingly.","Many other states&#39; laws are specific to purchasing and shipping wine. You can ship wine in Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and South Carolina if it was purchased at a winery. You can ship both wine and beer directly to Delaware, Massachusetts, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Virginia. Some states also restrict the maximum quantity you can ship, but this isn’t a problem for most gift baskets. Some of the less restrictive places to ship alcohol to are Mississippi, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, all of which have laws that specifically allow the direct shipment of alcohol.","Before you shop, make sure you know the laws for the state you&#39;re shipping the gift basket to. You can find this information through the NCSL or through each state&#39;s legislature website.","<strong>Allergies</strong>","Keep in mind while shopping that not everyone can enjoy everything offered in a gift basket. According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db10.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,</a> food allergies among children have become more common over time. The reported food allergy rate for children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007 alone. About 65 percent of humans have a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine&#39;s <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance#statistics\">Genetics Home Reference.</a> Be cognizant of this when you&#39;re looking at gift baskets that contain a lot of cheeses. If you’re unsure what someone can and can’t eat, it’s best to get a basket with a variety of things to choose from.","<strong>Best Gift Baskets for the Ketogenic Diet</strong>","One of the newest health crazes, the ketogenic diet, is a low-carb, high-fat diet plan. Users are encouraged to all but eliminate carbohydrates and replace them with fats. That way, your body only burns fat for energy, oftentimes causing weight loss. There are variations of the ketogenic diet, according to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-101#weight-loss\">Healthline,</a> but as a general rule carbohydrates are eliminated. Finding a keto-friendly gift basket can be hard, but they do exist. Look for gift baskets with cheese and meat but no crackers. You should also avoid sugar-laden gift baskets or those that include a lot of chocolate. Some keto diets do allow for chocolate, but only the dark kind. Look for baskets that include chocolate with a minimum of 70 percent cocoa. A milk chocolate Hershey&#39;s bar won&#39;t make the cut. Nuts are also allowed on the keto diet, so the multitude of baskets out there with a large selection of nuts are a good option.","<a href=\"https://www.ketodelivered.com/\">Ketodelivered.com</a> also sells gift baskets specifically for keto dieters. These include &#34;ultra low-carb food products&#34; like spices, condiments, coffee, snacks and sweet alternatives. <a href=\"https://www.ketokrate.com/\">KetoKrate</a> is another website where you can shop for keto-friendly gift baskets. These &#34;krates&#34; come monthly and include items like hemp brittle, dark chocolate, veggie spaghetti, meat snacks and various nuts. No matter where you shop, make sure you’re getting a basket with lots of healthy options.","<strong>Seasonality</strong>","Keep the season in mind when shopping for gift baskets. While many ship with cold packs to keep perishable items fresh, they&#39;re not foolproof. Also, they won&#39;t keep a basket fresh if you don&#39;t see the delivery notification and the food sits on the porch in the sun. Buying items that are appropriate for the time of year can save you the heartache of having a basket inadvertently ruined in the mail.","Buy chocolate in the winter because it&#39;s less likely to melt in the mail then. Cheese can also melt if the cold pack fails or the basket lingers in the mail for long. Be careful, though – there are some things you don&#39;t want to get too cold. For example, some alcohol, like champagne, might freeze if shipped in the winter to a particularly cold location. If it stays too cold for too long, you risk the bottle cracking. Buy fruit in the summer because it&#39;s more likely to be fresh. It also might cost less because it&#39;s in season. Candy and other sugary goods could also melt in the heat, so avoid them in the summer.","And remember, it might be the middle of winter in North Dakota, but temperatures aren’t nearly as extreme in southern states like Arizona and Texas. Keep the climate of wherever you send the basket in mind while you shop.","<strong>Gift Basket Subscriptions</strong>","Whether it&#39;s cosmetics, clothing or food, there are a lot of subscription services you can use to get fun products delivered every single month. This is true when it comes to gift baskets as well.","Harry and David has several Fruit of the Month Club baskets to order. You pay once and can have the basket delivered once each subsequent month. These baskets come with a variety of pears, mixed nuts, apples, crackers and other goodies.

Upcycling, by finding other uses for the basket or canisters, is both an enjoyable crafting opportunity and an environmentally friendly solution. Here are just a few ways to upcycle gift basket materials.","Upcycle your wicker basket with a fresh coat of spray paint. If you don&#39;t like the color or feel, or the basket looks dated, try taping off half or more of the wicker for an edgy, modern look. If you want something more exciting, spray-paint the entire thing a bright color, and use it as a flowerpot or storage bin. If the basket is large enough, add a cotton liner to make your own small laundry or storage basket. You can also affix small decorative signs to the front of the basket with wire available at most craft stores.","If your gift basket came with decorative canisters, you can give them another life with a coat of spray paint. There are many ways to reuse them – for example, turn a nut canister into a fun pencil holder, or fill the canister with sand or salt and top it off with a small candle. Upcycled canisters also make great gift containers, but make sure you don&#39;t get any toxic paint inside if you plan to use them to package food.","<strong>FAQs</strong>","There&#39;s one thing in this gift basket I don&#39;t like.
