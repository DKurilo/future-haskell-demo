We looked at how fast each switcher jumped between HDMI sources, checked whether any sources wouldn’t display, and gauged the overall use and feel of each product. We scored each switcher based on our experiences and other factors.","HDMI switchers are basic devices, but we put them through their paces because no one else has done a thorough test of HDMI switchers. We focused on testing brands you’ll find on Amazon.com, as well as a Rocketfish switcher from Best Buy in case you’re scrambling and need to purchase a switcher from a physical store.","Our recommendations are based mostly on our impressions of these devices while doing side-by-side testing, but we also like to scour the web looking for articles to help us understand all the important features. We found <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/59478/hdmi-switch\">this article</a> particularly helpful because it has images of a few different connection scenarios to help you visualize how to connect all your devices to the switcher.","Top Ten Reviews has been reviewing tech products for over a decade. I am an experienced writer and reviewer, and I have tested and written reviews for numerous digital products and services for Top Ten Reviews. I’ve set up my own home theater system and am constantly learning about the latest AV products.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We connected each switcher to the following devices: a Phillips UHD 4K Blu-ray player, a Chromecast Ultra, an Apple TV (not the new 4K version), a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 smartphone with an MHL cable, and a laptop with an HDMI cable. We set up a TV in our test lab, plugged in all the devices, and started switching through the HDMI switchers.","We used the remote and the physical button on each switcher to toggle through the sources, making sure each one was working properly. To test the auto-switching, we turned off the Blu-ray player and then turned it on again while the switcher set on a different HDMI port to see if it would automatically change inputs.","We used a UHD copy of “The Martian,” a dozen movie trailers from the Apple TV and a YouTube video from “National Geographic” to test our video sources.","We found that most HDMI switchers function the same, but several of the cheaper models failed to play media from the smartphone or couldn’t play the UHD Blu-ray without interruptions to the audio and picture. We took detailed notes of each switcher’s capabilities and how easy each was to operate.","<strong>Important Things to Consider When Choosing an HDMI Switcher</strong>","HDMI switchers are essentially HDMI hubs that let you plug your HDMI devices into the switcher and then connect a single HDMI cord to your TV. If you’re running out of HDMI ports on your TV, or you have an older TV with just a few HDMI ports, an HDMI switcher can give you more ports for less money than an expensive AV receiver.","Price","Basic HDMI switches cost less than $15. These devices offer one or two extra ports but use slightly older technology and may not support automatic switching. Between $20 and $50, you can find switches with more ports, but these still may not support things like 4K or HDCP 2.2. Higher-end switches that do support those features are mostly made for expensive home theater setups and cost much more. For most uses, including 1080p HD and 3D, you can get away with using an inexpensive switch.","Automatic, Manual &amp; Remote Switching","HDMI switches feature either automatic or manual switching. The difference between the switching styles is straightforward: Manual switchers have a physical button or switch to toggle between your preferred input, while automatic switchers have sensors that detect what input is currently active and automatically send that input information to the output device. Most of the HDMI switches we tested have automatic switching, and some allow you to turn off this feature if you prefer manual.","Some HDMI switches have an infrared sensor and come with a small remote, so you can manually switch between inputs without getting up. We preferred products with an external infrared sensor as opposed to a built-in sensor, as they keep the switch itself out of sight without losing the remote function. Both automatic and manual HDMI switches can support remote switching.","HDMI Switcher vs. HDMI Splitter","Though the names are similar, HDMI switchers and HDMI splitters perform very different tasks. An HDMI switch takes multiple inputs and a single output. A switch allows you to connect a gaming console, Blu-ray player and a streaming device to the same television and choose which of the three inputs to display. An HDMI splitter does the opposite – it takes a single input and directs it to multiple outputs to allow a single device, like a Roku, to deliver content to multiple devices. ","HDMI and HDCP Versions","It’s important to understand that different versions of HDMI may not be compatible with one another. While HDMI cables come in only two versions, high-speed and normal, devices that use HDMI can have different versions. The latest HDMI version is 2.0, and TVs or switchers that use this version are compatible with earlier versions like 1.4 and 1.3. However, a TV that supports only HDMI 1.3 won’t be able to play content from an HDMI 2.0 Blu-ray player.","HDCP is closely tied to HDMI and is a digital “handshake” protocol that ensures you’re not playing pirated content. Similar to HDMI, HDCP versions need to match up for content to be played correctly. The newest version of HDCP is 2.2, and not all devices will support pass-through from all versions of HDCP.","HDMI Cords","None of the HDMI switchers we tested come with an HDMI cord, so you’ll have to purchase at least one to connect the switcher to your TV. Don’t pay attention to HDMI cords that advertise support for various HDMI versions or HDCP.
