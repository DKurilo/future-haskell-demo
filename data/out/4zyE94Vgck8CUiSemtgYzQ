You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This <a href=\"/best-car-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaner for your car</a> has the power to suck up nearly any mess. The Dirt Devil Gator BD10125 uses an impressive 7 amps of power. It weighs only 3.25 pounds, making it extremely lightweight and portable. The handle is comfortable and the vacuum handles nicely. It’s also fairly compact with a length of 16.2 inches.","The 7-amp motor is one of the most powerful motors you will find on a hand vacuum, and it should help you clean up messes in your car. It does a great job of picking up pet hair. It also features standard filtration and a standard air system, and both function nicely. The filter is easy to extract and clean out. You can also replace the filter when it gets too old and doesn’t function quite as well as it used to. It doesn’t have a dirt cup, which would allow you extract and clean it out thoroughly, but this is a small complaint. The dirt empties easily with a quick release button.","This auto vacuum is battery operated, making it portable enough that you can charge it up and take it along on trips. It features a bagless design, which is also a benefit because you don&#39;t have to worry about purchasing or replacing extra bags.","This vacuum is missing some accessories. It has the all-important crevice tool to get to the tight, hard-to-reach sections of the car. And the nozzle, which is unusually wide at 2.25 inches, does a nice job of sucking in dirt and debris. It lacks a brush tool that can help with deep cleaning upholstery in your car and there is no wall-mountable charger. It also lacks a hose, which would help you get into tight areas of your car and living space, but this vacuum isn’t really designed to accommodate a hose attachment.","The vacuum comes with a generous three-year warranty, which is the best warranty of any of the products in our car vacuum reviews. The customer service options are limited to phone and email. You may have best results with the phone service. We had a hard time getting responses to our questions using the email form."]},"id":"87a4272c-7473-48d4-86b7-da48ba4845b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"13c61748-3526-4833-a7bf-2639197fda14","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dirt Devil Gator is well worth your consideration if you want a handheld vacuum with a powerful motor.
