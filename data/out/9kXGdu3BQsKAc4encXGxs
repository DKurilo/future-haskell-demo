It’s a boat parents will enjoy along with their children, but as a boat strictly for adults or hobbyists it will fall short. This basic remote control boat is designed for children 5 and up. It isn&#39;t advanced so older children may become bored with its simplicity. For the young at heart, this boat is the perfect companion for any lake, pond or swimming pool.","The Police Patrol Cruiser travels at speeds up to 8 miles per hour, which for small children is all they need for an exciting glide across the water. This RC electric boat has dual rear propellers, which add to this boat&#39;s power. It comes with a full-function remote that allows you to go forward and backward and turn right and left, giving the boat ultimate maneuvering freedom on the water.","The overall appearance of this patrol RC cruiser is one of our favorite aspects of the boat. It has a high-gloss paint job with EAL decals. It is made from ABS plastic, giving it the durability and strength to withstand a little roughhousing from children. It is the perfect size for young children to enjoy, at 17 inches long. It is 5 inches wide and 5.5 inches tall.","As a boat that caters to children, the lack of safety features is especially disappointing. We would have liked to see a safety mechanism to prevent this boat from running while it is not in the water. It takes approximately four hours to charge this radio controlled boat&#39;s battery, which is a little disappointing too.","The Police Patrol Cruiser is ready to run right out of the box. There is very little assembly required, which is a benefit for younger children. This RC boat comes with a full-function remote and batteries, a 4.8-volt boat battery, a battery charger and a telescoping antenna. We would have liked to see a display stand for the boat, which would make storing it easier. Extra propellers would have been a nice addition too because children have a tendency to lose small pieces to toys."]},"id":"0fad601d-ca6f-463a-8054-0c5b8923c5c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"af22dc18-28ff-4292-a8b2-fb1f20f51b18","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Police Patrol Cruiser is a basic racing boat with plenty to offer young children.
