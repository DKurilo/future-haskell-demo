The buttons are tap-touch, which makes cleaning the surface easier than it is with traditional knobbed cooktops. The LG is an affordable, compact cooktop with a lot of nice features to recommend it.","The cooktop has all the safety features you need, including a child lock and individually labeled heat indicator lights to prevent you or anyone else near the stove from accidentally touching a hot burner. It also has an automatic shut-off feature to turn off any burners that have been left on. This is a 30-inch electric cooktop, so it takes up less space on your kitchen countertop than some other cooktops. Despite its smaller size it is still a versatile cooktop, with five burners, a dual element and a wide range of temperatures. However, one key feature it lacks is rapid boil functionality.","This glass cooktop has five burners, including two for small saucepots and one double burner. The smallest cooking burner is 6 inches and can reach a maximum power level of 1,200 watts. You also get a 6-inch burner solely for keeping foods warm. It has a minimum power level of 100 watts, much lower than other cooktops, so the food does not overcook but simply stays nicely warmed and ready to serve. You get nine warming settings for foods of different heat sensitivity, so you won’t overcook creamed soups or undercook a hot beverage.","This cooktop only allows space for one dual burner, but it expands from 6 to 9 inches and reaches a maximum of 3,000 watts, which is great for getting pasta started. It will take this cooktop a couple minutes longer to bring water to a boil when compared to the best electric cooktops in our lineup, however. The other cooking burners on this cooktop measure 7 and 8 inches and reach 1,500 and 1,900 watts respectively. The wide variance of temperatures on the burners allows for precision cooking.","This cooktop has a unique design that looks both modern and retro at the same time. Specifically, the burners have a uniquely minimalistic modern look, but the control panel, while highly functional, looks like something you’d see on James Bond’s dashboard in a movie from the ‘60s and is contrastingly busy. Instead of square buttons and vertical lines, the intuitive panel is arranged in a semi-circle and features small circles that display the power level on each burner. The buttons align nicely with the burners so you always know which burner you’re controlling.","This electric cooktop has an indicator light that lets you know when the surface is unsafe to touch. The indicator lights for this cooktop are small LEDs set off to the side, each individually labeled “hot,” so there is no question which burner is still hot. This design saves on electricity. The child-lock button is highlighted with a lock graphic. You simply hold that button for three seconds to lock the unit, keeping it safe for children and you when cleaning it. However, if you are willing to pay more for other extra features, including such things as a bridge element that lets you cook with a griddle, the <a href=\"/bosch-review\">Bosch Benchmark NETP666SUC</a> is worth a look.","The LG LCE3010SB is an attractive electric cooktop with a well-designed, though busy, control panel that is easy to use and has all the safety features you need, like a child lock and clearly labeled heat indicator lights. The range of burner sizes and temperatures make it good for any foods you cook. For its price, the LG is a feature-rich and appealing cooktop. It lacks a fast boil function and is limited to on dual burner, but it is a compact cooktop that is a great pick for smaller kitchens."]},"id":"f5b61b2b-790f-46c0-b8ce-5a2111598108","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57679","url":"/lg-lce3010sb-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-03T12:20:03Z","datePublished":"2013-10-03T12:20:03Z","name":"LG LCE3010SB","synopsis":"The LG LCE3010SB radiant electric cooktop has a stylish design and a unique control panel.
