It&#39;s not until the very last question on the FAQ page where you see the website isn&#39;t accepting cards from individual sellers, and this is after the other questions on the page explain how you would be paid. There is even an informational video about how the website works that would really be great if it didn&#39;t start off with an explanation of how you can sell your unwanted cards to them. You can&#39;t.","But on to the positive. This website has a lot of cards to pick from at great discounts. You can shop by vendor, dollar amount or category and you&#39;ll be prompted right away if a specific store has any restrictions on the card. You can then sort available cards by their format, value, price you&#39;ll pay and discount you&#39;re reiving. It&#39;s great when websites like this do the math for you. You simply add the cards you want to your shopping cart and checkout. Checkout is secure and if it makes you feel better, the Better Business Bureau accredits and rates this website at an A+.","However, we noticed errors regarding the rate of discount at which each card is available. For example, we saw an AllPosters card listed at 99 percent off, but once we clicked on it the steepest discount available was 7 percent. There were also cards available on the search page that werenâ€™t actually for sale once you clicked on the retailer. Keep in mind though, discount and availability of cards varies by supply and demand. In our tests we looked for gift cards from Amazon, Walmart and Target across all websites on the same day within about a half an hour time span. Giftcard Zen had two of the three cards, available, earning a C+. <a href=\"/gift-card-granny-review\">Gift Card Granny</a> and <a href=\"/gift-card-spread-review\">Gift Card Spread</a> were the only two websites we tested that earned an A+.","This exchange service lacks a mobile app and is part of RetailMeNot, Inc., a digital coupon company. You can set up email alerts and build a wish list with the cards you want though, which is a useful feature. Customer service is also available via email, website and telephone 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., weekdays and 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Saturdays, all in PST.","This website also has a 100-day money-back guarantee. You&#39;ll be refunded if you don&#39;t get your card within 30 days or if it&#39;s inaccurate in any way. Keep in mind it will take 3-10 business days to receive physical gift cards in the mail."]},"id":"4acdbeab-714e-49fb-99f9-7126f732bb7c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56131","url":"/giftcard-zen-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-04-05T17:06:55Z","datePublished":"2013-04-05T17:06:55Z","name":"Giftcard Zen","synopsis":"Editor's Note: As of our most recent round of updates, the \"Sell Cards\" feature is not functional on Giftcard Zen.","review":{"rating":41,"verdict":"Giftcard Zen by RetailMeNot has an easy to use website and a large selection of gift cards, but it&#039;s not the place to sell your unwanted cards.","pros":["There is a 100-day money-back guarantee.
