Whether you enjoy camping, hiking or landscape viewing, these binoculars give you a sharp, clear perspective on the world around you. However, because they have a relatively high magnification, these binoculars have a lower field of view, only 96 meters, meaning it can be difficult to spot fast movement from birds and small animals with them.","The objective lenses, the lenses furthest from your face when you look through them, are 56 millimeters in diameter, which is excellent for low light situations. Generally speaking, the larger the objective lens, the brighter the images appear, as the lenses capture more light to direct toward your eye. This means you can use these binoculars when you hunt and they will produce bright images at dusk and dawn, the time when game is active.","One of the reasons why the Celestron Nature DX produced high results in our optical quality survey is the BAK-4 prisms it uses to reflect light to your eye. BAK-4 is an optical glass that produces clearer and brighter images than other prism materials, so you experience edge-to-edge sharpness as you use these binoculars. Additionally, the lenses on these binoculars are multicoated, which allows more light to pass through the glass instead of being reflected off of it. This optical element also helps produce bright, sharp images.","These binoculars use the roof prism design, which essentially means the barrels that hold the lenses and prisms are straight instead of curved. Because of this design, the prisms need a phase correction coating to make sure light doesn&#39;t split into two separate beams as it reaches your eyes. The Celestron Nature DX has this prism coating to ensure that images are not fuzzy or blurry as you view the world around you."]},"id":"fab113c9-47d4-47bd-96ca-a510024a06fb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Usability"},"id":"2190ec3d-3bb8-4a0b-9c54-251ac62914bb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/9KJxAiLinWxxxbR4DwqygG.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Celestron Nature DX weighs 36.2 ounces, making it heavier than most of the other binoculars we reviewed, which had an average weight of 26 ounces.

Our participants found the Nature DX incredibly easy to use, and bringing objects into focus took no time. This means you can expect a seamless viewing experience and don&#39;t have to fumble around with the optics trying to focus them. The central knob that focuses both lenses simultaneously works smoothly and easily.","Eyeglass wearers won&#39;t have trouble with this pair of binoculars, as the eye relief is 16 millimeters. In other words, your eye doesn&#39;t need to be close to the lenses to see the full image without fuzzy edges. This pair of binoculars uses twist-up eyecups, so you can quickly adjust the eye relief distance depending on whether you wear glasses or not.","The Celestron Nature DX is both waterproof and fogproof, so you don&#39;t have to worry about water damage when you use these binoculars outdoors. As with every pair of binoculars we reviewed, rubber armor helps protect the chassis and internal components from small bumps and drops. However, regardless of the rugged design, it is important to avoid excessive damage to the binoculars. Even what may seem like minor damage can permanently alter and ruin the internal components, resulting in poor image quality. This being said, the Nature DX was built for outdoor use, meaning it can handle an unexpected bump or two when you&#39;re on the trail.","This pair of binoculars is tripod adaptable, which removes any shakiness from hand movements. You have to purchase a binocular tripod adapter in addition to the optics themselves, but this is a minor expense. This feature is especially helpful if you want to use the binoculars to stargaze, as even the slightest hand motion in low light situations can make the binoculars unusable for checking out the night sky."]},"id":"d6787921-406d-4558-94c2-dda479c3e218","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"f6109b37-37bb-4a81-8f19-15e09220f91c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/QBskc2xtRweFFH9Jq6aPx3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Like all the binoculars we reviewed, the Celestron Nature DX comes with a limited lifetime warranty.
