The surround sound comes across in clear, distinct drivers. Like most other wireless stereo headphones, this model (like even the best wireless headphones) is not heavy on the bass. We also noticed the earphones often interfere with several other wireless devices. When we tried to use these headphones we were unable to connect to Xbox Live.","The advertized range for the device is 95 feet. We found the device to be most effective within about 30 feet of the transmitter. The sound quality decreased rapidly as we went more than 30 or so feet away from the transmitter, and the background static became louder and louder. We also noticed that the bass sound is sorely lacking."]},"id":"14d5bf7b-f9bd-495a-98d2-26d4fd9b597b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"09637d8d-57b5-4f69-8a36-e98e75b8856a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony MDR-DS6000 RF wireless headphones use a radio frequency to transmit sound from basically any audio source to your headphones. This allows the device to have a much larger range than other similar products that use Bluetooth and infrared technologies. Infrared use light emitting diodes (LEDs) and has a very limited range, and you must be within sight of the transmitter. Bluetooth devices are even more limited in their range.","They also include a volume control on the earpiece as well as a power switch. The batteries recharge as you rest the model on the transmitter. The battery life is approximately 10 hours, more than enough to watch several movies. The headband is adjustable and the earphones are comfortable. Even after hours of use you will feel totally comfortable with these headphones.","The wireless headphones have several drivers in the earpieces that enable a surround sound quality. The 5.1 channel includes a subwoofer, front audio and rear audio. The quality is fantastic and we loved the texture it gave to sound as we were using the headphones to watch DVDs."]},"id":"4e4b9c15-28b7-4e3a-b84a-01002da009b9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Accessories"},"id":"bb3bf6d0-a535-4464-bfc5-c2638549c7a3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["These wireless headphones come with everything you need to instantly connect with an audio output device and begin listening to all your favorite music, TV shows and DVDs.
