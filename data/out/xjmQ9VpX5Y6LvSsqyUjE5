A lack of originality in your interface could do a lot of good and bad things for your program.  It can provide a comforting, familiar sight to the users who want something that looked like what they have used before.  It can also put you behind the competition because you will be standing in place while they will be pushing the envelope and trying new things.","PhotoStudio allows you to work with layers, add animated text and stamps and apply the standard menu of photo edits.The auto enhance mode shows you nine previews to select from while the full edit mode will allow you to fine tune your edits.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"3a3ea64e-69fe-4996-b432-c7ff6908ad3e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"12f382cc-7df2-4d21-a447-0b9ef1fb7a93","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ArcSoft PhotoStudio is outdated and outdone by the higher ranked products.
