You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Pioneer released the Elite Series as a premium line of products and it lives up to its name. These <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a> boast great quality and performance in a home theater. The Pioneer Elite VSX-42 is the entry-level model in this series, and other, more complex receivers round out the rest of the series. The ports and features in the VSX-42 are both modern and extensive. The Elite Series of products also has better technical support than Pioneer&#39;s other products due to a two-year warranty.","The Pioneer Elite VSX-42 delivers a dynamic performance and great sound quality. This quality comes from a high signal-to-noise ratio, low total harmonic distortion and a broad frequency response. The 7.1-channel sound system offers 80 watts of peak power output and 80 watts of continuous power output for your speakers.","There are a number of ports on this digital receiver. Six HDMI inputs and one output provide for all your high definition displays and media devices. For network connections, this unit only has an Ethernet connection. There is no Wi-Fi. Two USB ports expand the receiver with an iPod or MP3 player and an optional Bluetooth add-on.","This receiver works well for multi-room setups so you can listen to music in two rooms at the same time. The included setup microphone automatically calibrates your speakers for optimum acoustics. The legacy ports on the Pioneer Elite VSX-42 are component, composite, optical and coaxial connections. Headphone and AM/FM radio antenna connections are also included.","The features of this home theater receiver are useful, whether you listen to music of watch movies. The unit comes with support for 3D video and 1080p video scaling but lacks support for 4K resolutions. The included network media server can access your digital music library on your home computer as well as internet radio. A remote control app for either Android or iOS is available for most smartphones and tablets. This receiver is compatible with Apple AirPlay, which lets you stream music and movies wirelessly from compatible devices, provided this receiver is connected to a wireless router. Dynamic volume preserves the original quality of the music at any volume.","Pioneer offers notable product support for the Elite Series. This comes in the form of phone and email support, FAQs and an online user guide. The Elite Series carries a two-year warranty."]},"id":"3966b216-0914-462c-84fa-194c457f4fc9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a772fc63-776a-4816-a2c0-27f1362fd591","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is truly a premium AV receiver series with clean, reasonably priced, high quality sound.
