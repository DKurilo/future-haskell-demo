This camera provides two megapixels of resolution, which may not compare to high-end adult models but is a whopping 0.7 megapixels above its nearest competitor. Some of the best <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital cameras for children</a> still slack on providing an adequate amount of memory for the kids to use; KidiZoom Plus not only provides the highest amount of memory but also has an SD slot for additional memory.

The videos can be transferred to the computer just as easily as a still photo. Another feature found only in digital cameras for children is the capability to play games built right into them. Your kids can be entertained for hours by the features on this camera. Other plusses include a photo editor, which will edit and add special effects to pictures, and an option that allows your kids to add up to 10 seconds of voice narration to any photo.","Out of all the digital cameras for children none offer the quality or the quantity of features that the KidiZoom Plus makes available. It provides a playback mode which allows your kids to view the pictures that they have taken on a 1.8” color LCD screen located on the back. In addition, it can connect straight to your TV for another convenient way to view pictures and movies."]},"id":"28814442-f6fa-49bf-bcae-1643881c04e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"1fa8acd9-a1f2-4f69-a5ba-d03edbf38c78","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can tell by looking at it that this is a digital camera for kids. The large, plastic exterior will be easy to grip with little hands  and was built to survive accidental drops that, let’s face it, are more than likely to occur. The buttons were designed larger than on most digital cameras for children and add to the ease of use.","Because the children in our lives like to take picture after picture we felt like a large memory was ideal to avoid countless trips to the computer to download. The KidiZoom Plus provided more storage than any of the other digital cameras for kids plus provided an SD slot for additional memory. The camera runs on AA batteries which we felt is convenient because the batteries can be purchased at most stores and disposed of, or we can insert rechargeable AA batteries providing us with different options based on the child’s age and circumstance.","As we mentioned above the color LCD display screen size is 1.8” and provides the children with a nice size screen for viewing pictures. The camera weighs slightly over one pound and is light enough for the kids to tote. We found that while the children feel more confident and grown-up with a camera, we felt relaxed and at ease knowing it was designed for them and for their little hands."]},"id":"96d426e1-adc1-4677-8f91-e3c62b3798c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"23fac6e1-5677-4ac4-83d9-2fbfe21f090b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With our top digital camera for kids users will be able to tell that every aspect was designed for the children.

If your child for some reason forgets to turn it off after use, the KidiZoom Plus will automatically shut down after several minutes without use. They have also designed an image of a battery that will help you and your kids know when the batteries need to be changed.","From taking a picture to editing it and putting it on your computer, your kids will find the camera enjoyable and easy to use. There are some steps (for instance connecting the camera to a TV or computer) that we felt would be better completed with an adult. Those steps are nearly hassle-free and can be accomplished in just a matter of minutes before turning control back over to your children."]},"id":"60039504-a2e0-416c-96e5-d1117ee1ccd8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"ec4ee0bb-8109-42f4-b7ad-85027da14fba","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["VTech Electronics of North America has created several options for you to contact them regarding any questions or problems with their digital cameras for children.
