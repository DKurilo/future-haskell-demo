You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Westinghouse Bendan 72557 is sleek, modern and clean, offering a frosted glass light fixture is encased in a satin chrome finish, with five dark, wooden blades rotating out from the middle. This is a beautiful <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fan</a> with long fan blades for creating exceptional levels of air circulation. Combined with the device’s powerful, but quiet motor, this is a fan that will break up cold and hot air pockets in your room with little audible output.","This top ceiling fan is 52 inches in circumference, which is the perfect size for rooms up to 360-square-feet in size with 8-foot ceilings. The size of room a ceiling fan can handle can drastically affect the noticeable performance of air circulation. If a fan is installed that isn’t suited for the room it will still circulate the air, but not efficiently. If you install this device in a room of ideal size, you will get airflow of at least 4,739 cubic feet per minute.","Quiet air circulation is an important feature for even the best ceiling fans with lights. The Bendan ceiling fan has a rolled-steel motor with a dual capacitor, which means it can circulate air powerfully, yet quietly. The motor itself is covered by a lifetime warranty so you can rest assured that it will operate for as long as you own the fan. The unit is controllable through three different fan speeds, which can altered with the included remote control.","This quiet ceiling fan is designed for an 8-foot-tall ceiling, and comes with a four-inch downrod, but no flush mounting kit. In addition, the unit has a 78-inch lead wire to accommodate even longer downrods for higher ceilings. All of the included parts come with a two-year warranty, along with an instruction manual for installing the unit yourself. The light fixture is operable with a dimmer and can accommodate up to a 100-watt bulb.","The Westinghouse Bendan 72557 is a modern and powerful fan capable of circulating air for most mid-sized rooms. It comes with a remote for controlling its speed, enabling you to circulate up to nearly 5,000 cubic feet of air per minute. Combined with its sleek appearance, halogen lighting and quiet operation, this fan is one that will deliver reliable and long-lasting performance."]},"id":"0b36ee34-d05a-44ed-b11c-4f4c8201c797","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56748","url":"/bendan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-14T01:56:20Z","datePublished":"2013-06-14T01:56:20Z","name":"Westinghouse Bendan 72557","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-06-14T01:56:20Z","id":"K94tFDncHgqc8t2HfM2Ho","meta":{"title":"Westinghouse Bendan 72557 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our reviews of the best ceiling fans to see if the Westinghouse Bendan is the right fan for your space."},"products":[{"slug":"westinghouse-bendan-72557","url":"/product/westinghouse-bendan-72557","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","name":"Westinghouse Bendan 72557","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","id":"ezxnzAyYrhaAB93SP6k7fZ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Vx2NAKFPj9wq6JnzTev5oe.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"6d7fabee06c28fb6773bb97a53cb5c7d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6d7fabee06c28fb6773bb97a53cb5c7d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","id":"Vx2NAKFPj9wq6JnzTev5oe","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vx2NAKFPj9wq6JnzTev5oe.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Westinghouse Bendan 72557 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our reviews of the best ceiling fans to see if the Westinghouse Bendan is the right fan for your space."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Vx2NAKFPj9wq6JnzTev5oe.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"6d7fabee06c28fb6773bb97a53cb5c7d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6d7fabee06c28fb6773bb97a53cb5c7d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","id":"Vx2NAKFPj9wq6JnzTev5oe","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vx2NAKFPj9wq6JnzTev5oe.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Westinghouse Bendan 72557 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our reviews of the best ceiling fans to see if the Westinghouse Bendan is the right fan for your space."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/bendan-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-conditioning","url":"/home-and-garden/air-conditioning","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","name":"Air Conditioning","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:28:19Z","id":"pVrs4zPdxV4QVcV5FoWtAd","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
