We approached the comparison process as if we were customers looking for a new receiver. That means we pored over each model’s spec sheets and user manuals, looking for the must-have features you won’t learn about by skimming the marketing materials found in stores and on websites.","We identified what separates the best AV receivers from the rest of the pack and then found all the features that contribute to those areas of performance. Our reviewers and editors are most interested in researching and explaining the important strengths and shortcomings that don’t show up on spec sheets or in customer reviews.","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","We believe power handling, audio format, connectivity, and help and support are the most important considerations when buying an AV receiver. As such, we identified the features that contribute to performance in each of those categories and compared the receivers based on them.","For instance, in the audio format category, we found that every receiver we compared has the Dolby TrueHD and DTS:HD lossless surround codecs, but only half of them have the Dolby Atmos and DTS:X multidimensional surround codec. So, the models that include that new audio format received a higher score in that category.","Connectivity options weighed heavily in our rankings. An AV receiver is the hub for your entertainment room, and it should have all the necessary connections to integrate new components into your system. HDMI cables are the industry-standard delivery method because they can send audio and video information through a single cable. As such, it’s important to choose a receiver that has more HDMI inputs and outputs than you currently need because new AV components will, most likely, use that connection. Receivers with more than four HDMI inputs and two HDMI outputs received higher connectivity scores.","To compare each receiver’s power handling, we evaluated the manufacturer’s advertised power handling and compared it with the advertised power consumption. Power ratings are hard to test and often vary, even between two receivers of the same model. For this reason, we ranked products by their advertised rating. While we realize this number may be overinflated, it is most likely consistently so across the different manufacturers. When a receiver has a high power rating and low power consumption, the power rating is likely grossly overinflated, so keep that in mind as you pair it with speakers.","<strong>What Else Is Important?</strong>","After power handling, audio formats and all the toys you can connect to your receiver, there are a few other features you may want to consider.","Size","Most of these receivers are big, boxy devices. They can be over 10 inches tall, 20 inches wide and 17 inches deep – better make sure yours will fit wherever you plan to put it.<br/><br/>","Legacy Inputs","In addition to the number of HDMI inputs, we looked at which legacy inputs, such as analog audio and digital inputs, component inputs, and composite inputs, each receiver has. These are all used by older technology. While you likely don’t still use a <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">VCR</a> or a first-generation video game console, legacy inputs are necessary if you want to connect them.","Two-Zone Audio","Since most movie soundtracks have a 5.1-channel format, you may not know what to do with the extra two channels on your 7.1-channel receiver. You could upmix the audio, which simply means that you send the same signal from one or more channels to the additional channels as well. However, with two-zone audio, you can connect the two additional channels to speakers in a different room. For it to truly be two-zone audio, you must be able to choose a different audio source for the second zone. For example, you could simultaneously play music in the second zone and watch a movie in the first zone.","Help &amp; Support","We looked at each receiver’s warranty term, which varies significantly from model to model. You can expect your receiver to last anywhere from six years to a decade, and most have a two-year warranty.","We also considered the support options each manufacturer provides. AV receivers aren’t simple devices, and if you have trouble, the manufacturer should be able to help. The best companies provide educational resources to help you become a master of home theater.","<strong>Should You Upgrade Your Current AV Receiver?</strong>","If you’ve owned your AV receiver for years, you may be wondering whether you should upgrade to a newer unit. The answer depends on why you want an update. Connectivity and audio limitations are typically the biggest reasons why people consider an upgrade, but neither are completely necessary, plus it depends on your available budget.","If you simply like having the latest electronics, and price isn’t a concern, go for the update. There’s something nice about having the latest edition of a product, especially of nice electronics.","Now, if you believe that an upgrade will bring you much-needed access to the latest and greatest technological components, as would be the case with computers or smartphones, you’re probably mistaken. AV receiver technology doesn’t see changes quite as often as laptops and smartphones do, so your receiver’s sound is likely still as good as that of newer receivers.","However, if your receiver precedes DTS Master Audio or Dolby TrueHD, you may also want to upgrade, as some older cables may be limited to standard DTS/Dolby Digital. Though if you’re a top-notch audiophile, you may already know it is difficult to differentiate between these formats. We recommend going for upgraded speakers instead.","If you’re wanting to update your receiver for the sake of modern connectivity options, this is when an upgrade is a good idea. Depending on how old your current receiver is, you may not have HDMI connectivity, which limits what you can do with the receiver. It’s not a necessity, thanks to input switches, but it makes for less of a hassle. Of course, if you have a good universal remote and don’t mind the extra setup, honestly, you’re fine as is.","<strong>Contributing reviewer: </strong><em>Suzanne Humphries<br/></em><br/><strong>More Home Theater Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"b126eabb-9532-4fd3-9361-df5fa9ebab3f","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-sound-bars\">The Best Sound Bars</a>","<a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">The Best Floor-Standing Speakers</a>","<a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">The Best Home Theater Subwoofers</a>","<a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">The Best Home Theater Speakers</a>","<a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">The Best Blu-ray Players</a>","<a href=\"/best-hdmi-switchers\">The Best HDMI Switchers</a>","<a href=\"/best-hdmi-cables\">The Best HDMI Cables</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6b677627-f695-4c3f-9d85-3a23af89551f","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_17","url":"/best-av-receivers","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-09T20:38:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-09T20:38:00Z","name":"Best AV Receivers of 2019","synopsis":"We think $600 is the sweet spot for home theater receivers (for most people).
