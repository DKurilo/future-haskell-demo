As a <a href=\"/best-hotel-booking-services\">hotel booking service</a>, Booking.com is useful and extends beyond travel staples to include restaurant and taxi reservations.","Booking.com is easy to use, with many options to sort the results and find the best hotel for you. This includes price, star rating and distance from downtown. One interesting feature Booking.com adds is a review score and price sorting option. This lets you find high-scoring hotels that are also affordable.","You can also filter your results by price, amenities and proximity to certain landmarks. We noticed that Booking.com isn’t as good as other services at pointing you toward lodgings near the neighborhoods or landmarks you want to visit. It does give you a map view of all results, which is helpful. Booking.com also didn’t present as many results as some other services we used. Nor does it offer price-watch notifications. It does have a price-match guarantee, however, so if you find a lower price after booking, you’ll get reimbursed for the difference.","Booking.com includes hostel and apartment options in its results. If you’re traveling by yourself and don’t mind bunking dorm-style, a hostel is an affordable option. You can also bundle flights and cars together with your hotel to save money. Assembling your package through Booking.com is relatively simple and provides more options for customization than some of the other services we used. It’s not as good at directing you toward maximum savings as other booking sites, though.","Because its parent company also owns OpenTable, you can book restaurants through Booking.com. There are also options to book airport taxis and trains.","One of the biggest disadvantages to choosing Booking.com is a lack of a rewards program. If you sign up for an account, you’ll get access to members-only pricing and newsletters with discount offers. There’s no option to earn points for your travels. We like booking services that offer point rewards or some other way to recoup some of your travel expenses."]},"id":"e2d24905-d5e7-4220-9f37-2c335c8203bd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4160d72e-cb0c-4681-9fd0-b6de865f6189","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Booking.com is a useful service, but it doesn’t provide as many results or offer a rewards program.
