What it does not have is compatibility with an array of file types to really justify all those tools. It does convert from a limited range of file types to a similarly limited range of file types, but the best software we evaluated has wider selections.","Again, though, the list of tools is impressive. Blaze allows you to do so much with just audio. That&#39;s not that common with video converter software. Audio tools include fade in and out, flanger, echo, chorus, distortion gargle, resample, reverb and more.","You will definitely have full creative control over your video conversions with Blaze. You can add  rain, embossing, lightning, text, motion blur, streak and wave effects to your video, and that&#39;s just a sampling. You can also make your videos look like vintage films, enhance the edges or extract snapshots from them.","Blaze Media includes two of our favorite features: the ability to record audio from a line in or streaming music directly from your computer and a Decompile function that enables you to break down your entire video frame by frame. Alternatively, you can create a video frame by frame using the Construct Video function. If you click on More Video Options at the bottom of the screen, you will find functions called DVD Ripper, Video Capture and Extract Audio Content.","On the surface, the interface of this software makes it easy to use, but it is slow to load and requires a lot of RAM. The version we tested stopped working from time to time for no apparent reason. It&#39;s an easy-to-use application that&#39;s trapped in a sluggish, resource-intensive shell.","It seems that the designers put more effort into this product&#39;s additional and special features and not enough into its file compatibility, which is especially noticeable in its inability to work with iPod formats.","The Blaze Media video converter has a comprehensive online and in-application help guide that answered the questions we had easily."]},"id":"174d5950-2349-470b-b577-69cc1e420282","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"61980e7f-74eb-4484-a009-9af240c34442","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Blaze Media Pro has a truly impressive set of tools for creating exactly the type of video and audio output you want, but you have to work within the confines of a comparatively small list of accepted file types.
