The keyboard has a slim profile and weighs less than 2 pounds, so this unit is portable as well as efficient.","The keys themselves are slim, so you definitely won’t be making a lot of noise as you type. In fact, this keyboard is among the quietest models we reviewed. One of the things that makes this keyboard stand out are the dedicated media keys that allow for quick access to volume and various other music player functions.","The laser mouse is accurate and includes a four-way scroll wheel, something not all models come with. Some of our reviewers noted they personally enjoyed the fact that the scrolling wheel was red, a fun design element in a sea of black keyboards and mice. The mouse has a relatively high resolution of 1600dpi, which means it’s very responsive. We really liked the fact that this mouse is comfortable for both left-handed and right-handed users. Our research showed most companies cater more to right-handed people.","This wireless keyboard and mouse setup uses  radio frequency (RF) to connect to your computer with a small USB receiver. You simply plug the receiver into a USB port on your computer and place the mouse and keyboard within about 4 inches of it. Then, turn on the mouse and keyboard and press the “pair” button. You’ll know you’re connected when the status indicator on the mouse or keyboard blinks five times then stops.","Its battery is supposed to last for two years depending on how frequently you use your setup. Regardless of your usage, you’ll know when the batteries are running low thanks to an LED warning light. When the AA batteries in your mouse do die, you can simply replace them.","While it’s price point is a little high considering this keyboard lacks some of the extra features like the <a href=\"/logitech-wireless-desktop-review\">Logitech Wireless Desktop MK710’s</a> soft wrist rest or the <a href=\"/logitech-wireless-wave-review\">Logitech Wireless Wave Combo MK550’s</a> extra-large media keys, it’s still a solid option."]},"id":"85f8b2de-27d0-4169-8a9d-31a375ca5bad","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69699","url":"/lenovo-professional-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-01-19T15:50:47Z","datePublished":"2018-01-19T15:50:47Z","name":"Lenovo Professional Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo","synopsis":"The Lenovo Professional Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo works well and has an accurate, ambidextrous mouse and comfortable key layout.
