You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>"," ","The Orbit Baby G3 is a simple <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">infant car seat</a> with some excellent safety features and an amazing base. With a weight range of 4 to 30 pounds, it should last through your baby&#39;s first year.","Its circular base allows you to secure the carrier at any angle, so you&#39;ll never have to struggle getting your baby into the car again. However, the carrier weighs a massive 12 pounds, and it is only compatible with the G3 stroller. Also, its thin carry handle bends under the weight of the seat; so despite its extra heft, it doesn’t feel as sturdy as other carriers in our baby car seat reviews.","This seat&#39;s base is surprisingly easy to use. Like most baby car seats, the base offers both LATCH and seatbelt connections. The knob helps you tighten the belts and secure the base. You&#39;ll notice that the base has a large circle in the middle. This allows you to secure the carrier from any angle. Once the carrier is attached, you can rotate it to the proper rear-facing position, and it will lock in place.","This circular connection is necessary, since the carrier weighs in at 12 pounds, heavier than most infant car seats. When your child reaches 20 pounds, taking the carrier out of your vehicle will become a burden. Fortunately, you can always rotate the carrier to a comfortable position to get your child in and out of the seat.","The G3 is not as convenient as many other car seats. Its best feature is its machine-washable cushions. It is only compatible with the G3 stroller, which also uses the circular base to secure the carrier. Its adjustable handle is a thin strip of plastic that rests easily on your arms, but it bends under the weight of the carrier and never feels sturdy enough.","Orbit Baby supports the G3 with a two-year warranty. The Orbit Baby website has a local retailer finder and downloadable user manuals. If you need to contact customer support, representatives are available by email and phone. We were able to get answers to our questions quickly."]},"id":"1c3cd19f-af41-4f92-89fd-115951a9601d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f47b5dbd-2ee6-4e84-990b-b52853b2d56c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Orbit Baby G3 is a simple baby car seat, thanks to its base.
