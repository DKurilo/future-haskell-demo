You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The KitchenAid Architect Series II KDTE504DSS <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> offers a variety of wash cycles and options to clean your dishes. The unit includes express wash, light, normal, ProWash, rinse only and a tough cycle. You can pair some of the cycles with the numerous wash options, including a delay start timer, high temperature wash, ProDry, ProScrub, Sani Rinse and top rack-only wash. The dishwasher also has a concentrated wash zone on the upper rack where you can clean heavily soiled or oddly shaped dishes.","This dishwasher is not very energy-efficient. It has an estimated operating cost of $31 annually and lacks ENERGY STAR certification. However, it has ProWash and ProDry options that conserve energy and water. The ProWash cycle determines the length and strength of the cycle by the soil level on the dishes. It will automatically adjust a cycle until the dishes are clean. The ProDry option uses a recessed heating element and fan to dry your dishes.","This KitchenAid dishwasher fits up to 14 place settings on its two racks. Both the upper and lower rack have fold-down tines, and you can adjust the height of the upper rack to fit your tall dishes. The unit has several features that make it easy and convenient to use. It has a delay-start timer you can set for eight hours ahead. It also has a status light, child lock and hidden touch-sensitive controls that all make operating the machine easy.","This built-in dishwasher does not have a hard-food disposer, so you have to manually remove food particles that are left behind. However, the lack of a disposer contributes to this machine’s quiet operation. It measures at 39 decibels when running, which makes it one of the quietest dishwashers on our comparison. It also has a manual filter that requires regular cleaning.","The dishwasher is made out of stainless steel. The steel serves multiple purposes including insulating the machine and acting as a heat source. The quiet operation can partly be attributed to the steel. This stainless steel dishwasher has three spray arms and 40 spray jets that work together to clean your dishes.","KitchenAid warrants this integrated dishwasher’s parts for one year and also pays for any labor during the first year. The electronics and racks have a five-year warranty, and the tub and door liner have a lifetime warranty. To contact KitchenAid, you can use the company&#39;s live-chat option, or contact customer service by email or phone."]},"id":"cf4560be-b937-4ea3-9fc1-8b531929eac5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e39a6ebc-4352-49dd-92ce-cf82d931c3d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With the various features and multiple spray arms and jets, you can expect this machine to thoroughly clean your dishes.
