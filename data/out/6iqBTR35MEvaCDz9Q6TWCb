You also get a rather whimsical and fun feature with this <a href=\"/best-instant-approval-credit-cards\">instant approval credit card</a>: You can customize your card free by uploading a photo of your own or an image supplied by the company onto your card.","This instant decision card offers an introductory period in which you pay 0% APR for purchases. The upcoming end-date for the introductory period is prominently listed on the company website and it will change regularly. After that time period, the APR is 19.80% for both purchases and transfers.","You get a grace period of 25 days, which is the amount of time after you have made a credit card purchase in which you accrue no interest charges. In this case, 25 days is generally standard for the industry.","The APR for cash advances is 24.90% and the penalty APR is 29.40%, which again are not bad in the world of credit cards. You do pay an annual fee of $39 and, unfortunately, there is no introductory period without any annual fee accompanying this card.","There also are some other fees: for cash advances, you pay either $10 or 3% of the amount; a $29 fee if you go over your credit limit; and there is a $35 fee if you make a late payment or have a payment that is returned. You do not pay any fees for transfers.","With the Capital One® Classic Platinum Credit Card, you can set up automatic text alerts to remind you that it is time to pay or let you know if a charge over a certain amount has been posted. You also can check your account 24/7 online.","Under an arrangement that gives you  MasterCard® Platinum benefits, you get such things as 24-hour travel assistance such as dispatch help if you are locked out of your car or are stranded if it stalls; an extended warranty program; and the opportunity to get car rental and travel accident insurance.","The company that issues this card offers stellar customer assistance complete with phone help, email support, automated phone service, 24/7 customer support and live chat. Its website clearly describes what the card offers, and customer service representatives are polite and helpful."]},"id":"498b94cb-1da3-4a62-98c9-d7cf40f6451a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"af876008-7d50-4ecd-b0fe-377c6dd20f13","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are not saddled with poor credit, but still have a few financial missteps that have pushed your credit rating to the average category, this card gives you the chance to possess and use a credit card at reasonable rates.
