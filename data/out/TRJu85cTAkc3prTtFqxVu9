While it is best suited for small lawns, it can easily perform nicely on larger yards, even if it takes more time than some of the more powerful push mowers in our review. Like other push mowers with similar designs, Great States is quite easy to assemble. Out of the box there are five components to assemble, including three bolts you&#39;ll need to tighten and two e-rings to put together.","While the instructions with this <a href=\"/best-lawnmowers-review\">reel lawnmower</a> state you don’t need any tools to assemble this lawnmower, in our assembly test we found that we needed a pair of pliers to tighten the bolts. We also had to use pliers to attach the e-rings, because even the thinnest fingers have difficulty reaching into the tight space where you must apply them.","This push lawnmower has an advertised cutting width of 16 inches. In our tests we found that the effective cutting path was 14 inches. This type of discrepancy is not unusual with push mowers, though the difference is larger with this model than with some of the others we tested.","We were able to cut a 10’ x 10’ portion of lawn in 12 passes in order to get the grass at a consistent level. The highest grass we cut in our test area measured 4 inches. After our test mow, the tallest grass in our test section was 2 inches, making this mower a pretty effective machine, especially considering its two-wheel, T-handlebar design.","Unlike similar models, this reel mower didn’t have any trouble handling lawn debris. Lesser mowers come to a dead stop if they encounter even the smallest twig. In our test, Great States only jammed once, and it was able to handle small sticks with ease. It didn’t cut the twigs; it just rolled over them and continued cutting grass as though nothing were there, which is worth noting. However, as with any push mower, you would be best served to remove as much debris as possible from your lawn before you mow.","At a mere 8.5 pounds, this is the lightest product in our review of the best push lawnmowers on the market, which makes it extremely easy to use and store. Despite its ultra-lightweight status, it feels solid in your hands, and you don’t get the impression that it’s going to fall apart if you push it too hard.","This reel mower doesn’t include a bagger to help with clean up, so you’ll have another chore after you get done mowing – raking. However, it’s worth noting that when we used the baggers included with some push mowers in our testing, they proved difficult to use. They required frequent emptying, and the buildup of clippings often got in the way of the mowers’ blades.","While this isn’t necessary  best push lawnmower available, for its price, size and design, it performs better than similar reel mowers in our review. This is due to its solid design, reliable cut and superior performance in our mowing tests."]},"id":"0f45f9ac-4dfc-4ffa-9bb1-f14e3d4ea366","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64525","url":"/great-states-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
