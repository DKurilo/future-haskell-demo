It comes in silver, burnished bronze or peach copper so you can find a style that looks best in your home. ","The best part about this frame is its convenience. The Iris relies on Wi-Fi in order to view your favorite photos. It has 8GB of internal storage, but since it doesn't have SD or USB slots, you cannot add more storage space.    <br />\n   <br />\nTo use the Iris, you’ll need to download the Nixplay app on your smartphone and create an account. Once that’s done, you can share your photos with any family members or friends who own an Iris. Simply take pictures and upload them to the Nixplay Cloud and select the Nixplay devices you want them to show up on. Every Nixplay account gets 10GB of free cloud space and can connect with up to five frames. This way, Grandma doesn’t need to fiddle with the frame to get new images to appear. You can simply send new pictures to her whenever you want. This device does not come with a remote since you control it with your smartphone. The power cord comes with interchangeable adapters so it can be used in both Europe and America.   <br />\n   <br />\nWe found that this frame's display quality was one of the best we tested, with images appearing clear and true to color. The main things that kept this device from being the number one product was the high price – roughly $200 – and the fact that you cannot play videos. However, you can add photos to it from anywhere instead of toying with an SD card or USB, which makes this frame more attractive.    <br />\n   <br />\nThere is no hole on the back for hanging the Iris on the wall; it is meant to be placed on a flat surface. You can position the frame horizontally or vertically, and the cord doubles as a stand to help you save space and make the device look less cluttered. However, it felt less stable than many of the other stands. As far as settings go, this is a relatively basic device, but you'll find plenty of transition options in the menu to help spice up your slideshows.","<a href=\"/nixplay-iris-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"f5962591-0f1c-49f1-b9f7-d19078aeb745","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best for Email & Media"},"id":"ee506bbc-2dc6-48f1-8162-d0f1aef2ec1b","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/XvaQEcYf5MBgDrm6wAoMDZ.jpg","link":{"href":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/pix-star-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/U/N/787775/original/PixStar-Edited.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvaQEcYf5MBgDrm6wAoMDZ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"XvaQEcYf5MBgDrm6wAoMDZ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvaQEcYf5MBgDrm6wAoMDZ.jpg","alt":"Pix-Star FotoConnect"},"id":"29b5261d-9302-404e-bd7d-f2b0d4a4046f","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Pix-Star FotoConnect\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":90,"url":"/pix-star-review","name":"Pix-Star FotoConnect","id":"1150"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/pix-star-review\">Pix-Star FotoConnect</a>","pros":["This frame has the most advanced image sharing features of any device we tested."],"cons":["It's expensive."]},"id":"cfd4bf69-00b7-44fe-aa18-30803be4ba9c","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This digital photo frame is one of the most advanced units we tested.

We were surprised to find that the stand in the back doubles as a connecting cable for the power source. Plug one end of the cable into the wall and the other into the end of stand. The cable/stand is made of a flexible material so you can bend it one way or the other to hold your frame up in either a portrait or landscape position.

We set them up side by side, showing the same photos in the same lighting to our four experts. Each tester has an understanding and appreciation for what constitutes a good photograph, and some have had formal photography composition training. To get better digital photo frame insights, we spoke with an employee at a local camera and printing service. We also contacted Beatrice Bisais, Social Media Manager of Nixplay, to ask questions about their products.","We spent over 50 hours researching digital photo frames and had four people test the devices. Each person examined the photo displays and gave ratings for clarity, color and overall aesthetic quality. We averaged those scores to obtain an overall quality score for each frame. We used photos from a mobile phone, images from an SD card, and vintage 1970s <a href=\"/best-photo-scanning-services\">paper photos that had been scanned</a> onto a thumb drive to see how well each electronic picture frame displayed each type of photo.","We also looked for such things as the amount of glare from the frame, the overall functionality of each frame, how easily photos can be accessed, and the amount of internal storage in frames that do not use Wi-Fi. We also evaluated how difficult it is to set up the frames right out of the box, how easy they were to use, how long you could display a <a href=\"/best-photo-slideshow-software\">photo slideshow</a>, and the effectiveness of such things as remote controls, among other metrics.","<strong>How Much Do Digital Photo Frames Cost?</strong>","Digital photo frames usually range between $40 and $200, with more expensive devices having larger screens – 10 inches or more – and Wi-Fi connectivity. The most expensive devices will give you additional internet options and allow you to send and receive images using your smartphone. Cheaper units tend to have little or no internal storage, so you might need to purchase an SD card or a USB thumb drive in addition to the frame. 16 GB SD cards are often as cheap as $16 and 16 GB USBs can be bought for as little as $6. These storage sizes are equipped to hold hundreds if not thousands of images.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Testing numerous pictures on nine digital photo frames was a visual treat. Our well-prepared testers all have worked in areas where they had to demonstrate a thorough knowledge of photography and overall image aesthetics.

Luckily, digital photo frames are thoughtful and easy gifts. With a digital frame, your loved one can see pictures of you and your family, even if they live in a different state. Start the gift off right by including either an SD card or small USB loaded with hundreds of carefully chosen photos. If you purchase a Wi-Fi enabled frame, connecting it to your loved one’s network is a must. This is a great gift to go in on with a family member. For instance, you and your siblings can purchase one together for your parents and pull together images from each person&#39;s family.","If you’re on a budget, we recommend looking for a non-Wi-Fi device. The price goes up significantly when HD screens and internet come into play. Plus, devices that don’t use Wi-Fi might be easier for people to maintain, especially if they aren’t comfortable with technology.","<strong>Wi-Fi Enabled Frames</strong>","For the most part, digital photo frames are pretty similar, with the biggest difference being whether or not they allow you to connect to the internet. Not all Wi-Fi frames are the same, however. Usually, the more expensive models resemble tablets and let you access online games or allow you to pull images from Facebook and other social media sites. Some can even be used to play YouTube videos. The best part is most Wi-Fi frames come with an app you can use to send and delete photos remotely, without using a USB drive or SD card. This means you can send a group of new photos to Grandma’s digital photo frame, even if she is a few states away. Just make sure to set up Grandma’s device with her home Wi-Fi first. If she needs to make space for more photos, she can use her own phone or the physical buttons on the device to delete any of the images currently on the frame.","<strong>Why Not Just Buy a Tablet?</strong>","Tablets and digital frames are similar in size and shape, but they certainly differ in price and purpose. Clearly, tablets have more functionality, like the ability to play games, watch streaming services and surf the net. But keep in mind that most people purchase digital photo frames for their parents or grandparents. If Grandma is comfortable with a tablet or small computer, definitely go that route. She&#39;ll get plenty of use out of it. However, if you’re purchasing for someone who isn’t tech savvy, a tablet will be difficult to learn and frustrating to use. A digital photo frame is more straightforward and doesn’t include as many confusing features. Plus, they usually come with a remote, so Grandma can control it from a distance without needing to get fingerprints all over the screen. When it&#39;s time to update images, just send her a new USB or SD card. She can plug it in and have access to the most recent photos.<strong></strong>","<strong>What to Look for in a Digital Photo Frame</strong>","Digital photo frames aren’t as popular as they were 10 years ago, but this device definitely hasn’t bitten the dust. Despite no longer being in the limelight, you can still see them used on office desks or prominently displayed in your grandparents’ house. If you’re planning on purchasing one of these devices either for yourself or as a gift for a family member, there are a few things you should look for.","Ease of Use<br/>If you are purchasing a photo frame for anyone who isn&#39;t super comfortable with technology, you&#39;ll want to find an option that will be easy enough for them to use. The camera and printing service employee we spoke to noted that these devices were once a hot item but that his store no longer sells them. He believes that the decreased popularity is due to how complicated these devices can be, especially for grandparents who aren’t comfortable with technology."]},"id":"d9305426-c9e8-48ef-9e61-560e29cb7e71","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/xDXR2VyxiwMCYYWmTD8agZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":" ","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/digital-photo-frames-home-electronics/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8xLzAvNzg2NzA4L29yaWdpbmFsL0RpZ2l0YWwtUGhvdG8tRnJhbWVzLVRlc3RpbmctMDAzLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xDXR2VyxiwMCYYWmTD8agZ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"xDXR2VyxiwMCYYWmTD8agZ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xDXR2VyxiwMCYYWmTD8agZ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1e1f398e-de14-499e-8d85-5e489d02623b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Setting up a digital photo frame and then using it should be relatively simple tasks, and they generally are with the highest-quality models. Some allow you to play images directly from an inserted USB while others require you to upload images from your computer. Many digital photo frames include apps so you can easily send photos from your phone. Some frames, like the <a href=\"https://www.nixplay.com/nix-lux-frames/\">Nixplay Lux line</a>, are even integrated with Amazon Alexa, which allows you to control your frames with Echo devices. If you’re purchasing one of these devices for someone who isn’t comfortable with technology, it might just be easier to upload images onto a USB or SD card for them so all they have to do is plug it into the frame instead of wrestling with a computer.","Many of the newer digital photo frames come with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can upload images directly from your phone. Some models even come with simple video games and apps making them a little more tablet-like. It isn’t uncommon for them to even be equipped with a remote control, which can be quite helpful for anyone who has mobility issues or if the frame is displayed high on a wall where it&#39;s awkward to reach. The best digital photo frames should make it easy to add new photos.","Photo Clarity<br/>The very purpose of a digital photo frame is to constantly show pictures of people, places and things you love, so you naturally will want the sharpest, clearest images possible. Even lower-priced digital photo frames can offer impressive images if they are well designed. It&#39;s best to look for a frame with a high resolution, since this will provide the best photo display. As the printing service and camera sales employee told us, most smartphones and simple digital cameras have the ability to take pictures that have the perfect resolution for 5 x 7 photo frames. Even the images you can pull from social media sites like Facebook should be high enough resolution to look good on one of these screens so you shouldn&#39;t worry about needing an expensive camera."]},"id":"c7c74d71-3c81-42f8-b615-cf1ecd9ed471","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/FdDRHMpyd7y6woVUgNcRc8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"You&#39;ll definitely want to consider the appearance of your digital photo frame before buying one.

Some devices have no built-in memory and instead include USB and SD card slots. With these frames, you can decide how many images display based on the size of the storage device you use. A 4GB to 8GB SD card or USB thumb drive is a good starting point for showing off a large number of photos. Images typically don’t take up much space, while videos and music files take up a bit more.","If you plan to store image files directly on your frame, you’ll likely run out of room pretty quickly. Most digital photo frames have buttons on the back that allow you to delete images, which is convenient in certain instances – for example, if your son breaks up with his girlfriend and you think it would be better if her face didn’t show up on the slideshow any more. However, the process of erasing photos differs from one device to the next. You must plug some frames into a computer to do so, while others let you select photos in the menu. If you solely use a USB drive or SD card, you need to plug it into a computer and erase the photos there.  "]},"id":"4d99c8d8-7da2-422e-ad17-8ae19167cada","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/3wPTsciTugJTnPFs3nVasC.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Some frames have extra functionality and let you include videos, a calendar or music.

Its 10-inch screen is the perfect size for showcasing family photos. The frame comes with a stand and is designed to sit on a flat surface, such as a desk or table, rather than be mounted to a wall.","At 1024 x 600 pixels, this frame has good resolution.

Many digital art frame companies let you pay for a monthly or annual subscription to access billions of art pieces you can display on the screen. This is also a great gift for artists who want to display their own work.","Meural&#39;s Canvas frames include swivel mounts that make them easy to hang. Also, the frames&#39; motion activation feature lets you swipe through artwork and photos simply by waving your arm in front of them. We especially like that you can interact with the art on the frames to learn more about each specific piece – this info includes the artist’s name and the date of creation.","Meural’s frames are available in two types of wood and three finishes: black or white poplar and a walnut brown, all very chic. You adjust settings and displayed images using the accompanying app on your phone. Amazon Alexa also works with these frames, which makes them truly modern, smart devices.","Digital art frames are much larger and much more expensive than regular-size frames. In fact, some digital canvas companies require you get a quote. On average, expect to pay about $500 for the least expensive art frames, but prices can go higher than $1,000. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X98OMKE?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">EO1</a> makes a digital art frame you can either place on a shelf or mount to a wall, so you have a few displaying options.","<strong>Interactive Magic Mirrors &amp; the World of Tomorrow</strong>","Even seemingly non-technical objects, such as pens, can access the internet these days. And whether it’s the device of a bright future or simply a physical manifestation of society’s dystopian destiny, magic mirrors are coming. In many ways, they are the digital photo frames of tomorrow. These smart mirror platforms allow you to access the weather, your calendar and photos, all while gazing at your reflection. Some, like the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2E2geEi\">Loft Mirror</a>, can even play videos.","Beauty and clothing companies are currently making smart mirror devices to help you apply makeup, get beauty and fashion suggestions, and make purchases.

There are also wall-mounted smart mirrors you can install in place of your bathroom vanity or on your living room walls.","Since these are relatively new inventions, their capabilities and features have not been standardized. As such, there is a variety of options on the market. However, their newness means smart mirrors haven’t saturated the market yet, so they are usually very expensive. ","<strong>DIY Smart Mirror/Digital Photo Frame</strong>","If you’re comfortable with technology, you can make one of these devices using a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Raspberry Pi 3</a>, a monitor and a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/12-Acrylic-See-Through-Mirror/dp/B017ONH3EG/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">two-way glass mirror</a> among other things.

There are plenty of forums and online groups like <a href=\"https://www.magicmirrorcentral.com/category/blog/raspberry-pi/\">Magic Mirror Central</a> that specialize in building smart mirrors. Share ideas with other builders and get tips for how to spice up your own project. The Raspberry Pi 3 allows you to connect your creation to Wi-Fi.

Some people are even making magic mirrors that respond to voice commands via Amazon Alexa and Google Home. As long as you have the idea and the drive, you can make the magic mirror of your dreams.","<strong>The Instacube Scandal</strong>","Back in 2012, avid social media users were very interested in a digital frame known as the Instacube. However, the product has a shaky history and still hasn’t made its way onto store shelves, leaving thousands of Kickstarter backers angry. Some have even responded vindictively.","According to an article on <a href=\"https://consumerist.com/2014/03/11/the-instacube-kickstarter-success-real-world-disaster/\">Consumerist</a>, even though Design to Matter (D2M) – the company behind the Instacube – raised three times the money it asked for on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1084349160/instacube-a-living-canvas-for-your-instagram-photo\">Kickstarter</a>, it ran into numerous manufacturing issues. These hold ups included software changes, hardware changes and D2M underestimating the cost of manufacturing the hardware in China. All together, these complications brought Instacube production to an indefinite standstill. Angry backers responded by sending hate emails to D2M employees. Some backers even tracked down specific employees and posted their personal information online.","So why were people so interested in the Instacube? The idea was that photos from your Instagram and Facebook accounts would connect wirelessly to the frame. D2M stated that Instagram photos would display at three times their size. The frame would run on the Android OS, so it would be somewhat familiar to use for people with smartphones. In addition, it was planned to run on an internal lithium ion battery, making it wireless. This meant two things: One, you wouldn’t have to worry about hiding cables when it was on display, and two, you could pick it up and take it anywhere you wanted without having to set it back up. You can see why this was such a hot item in 2012.","Will the Instacube ever be realized? After its rocky start and D2M’s five-year silence, it’s unlikely the Instacube will ever become a household item. But stranger things have happened. At the time of this article, you could still see over 3,400 backers with more than $620,000 pledged to the project on its Kickstarter page.","<strong>More Guides for Sharing Photos:</strong>"]},"id":"117721d6-e076-49db-9170-ad5a76c546e1","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-photo-organizing-software\">The Best Photo Organizing Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">The Best Photo Management Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-books\">The Best Photo Book Creation Sites</a>","<a href=\"/best-digital-photo-printing-services\">The Best Digital Photo Printing</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-only-printers\">The Best Photo-Only Printers</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-scanning-services\">The Best Photo Scanning Services</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-slideshow-software\">The Best Photo Slideshow Software</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8a09b464-cc7a-4bdd-a19a-0681ee1125c0","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a4257119-d040-42c0-aa0a-f109831721f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/nix-advance-review\">NIX Advance</a>","<a href=\"/aluratek-review\">Aluratek ADMPF108F</a>","<a href=\"/pix-star-review\">Pix-Star FotoConnect</a>","<a href=\"/nixplay-iris-review\">Nixplay Iris</a>","<a href=\"/micca-review\">Micca NEO</a>","<a href=\"/aluratek-digital-photo-frame-review\">Aluratek ADMPF310F</a>","<a href=\"/digital-foci-review\">Digital Foci</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3bb8ab4e-92ba-4775-9f21-439031af4481","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_41","url":"/best-digital-photo-frames","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-08T11:30:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-08T11:30:00Z","name":"Best Digital Photo Frames of 2019","synopsis":"We lined up 10 digital photo frames in the same lighting and compared pictured quality, as well as features and ease of use.
