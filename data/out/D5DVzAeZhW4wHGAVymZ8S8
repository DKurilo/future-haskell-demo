The tank has a mist output of 3 gallons every 24 hours, but it only holds 1.2 gallons, so you will need to refill it several times each day. The unit provides good levels of humidification for a medium size room."," This <a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">air humidifier</a> comes with a built-in humidistat that measures moisture levels in the air. The digital screen displays the current humidity level just like a thermostat displays temperature.","This is an evaporative humidifier. Evaporative units operate by pushing air through a wick that is submerged in water. The wick is made out of a sponge-like material that absorbs water from the tank providing a wide surface area so the humidifier can distribute a lot of moisture into the air.","If you use this machine’s automatic setting, the humidifier will turn itself off and on to maintain desired humidity levels. You can choose how must mist you want to disperse by selecting from three output settings. Unfortunately, the fan on the unit is louder than most, so if you are sensitive to noise, you will not want to use it while you are trying to sleep.","The Sunbeam Cool Mist Tower is equipped with a triple layer filter that has antimicrobial properties to impede bacterial growth. This helps ensure that the mist dispersed throughout your home is germ free.<br/>It also comes with an automatic shut-off feature. This turns the unit off when the tank runs out of water and lessens the risk of overheating the motor and damaging the unit.","The 25.7-inch tall Sunbeam Cool Mist Tower is designed to sit on the floor rather than on a table or counter and needs be filled several times a day. The water tank is slippery when it’s being refilled and is too tall to fit under the taps of a small sink. Removing the tank from the unit on the floor and placing it in the bathtub for frequent refillings could be difficult for those who struggle with bending or lifting. Support and service is divided between Sunbeam proper and the company that makes this humidifier for Sunbeam, Kaz. While email, phone and chat support are available, along with downloadable manuals, it takes a bit of detective work to find everything."]},"id":"3779deb8-a4a3-42e3-be2f-832f313e6b88","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4d2ff47c-5307-4aca-87d1-0103cd9e299a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This home humidifier produces a cool mist that is beneficial if you live in a dry climate or are suffering from cold and allergy symptoms.
