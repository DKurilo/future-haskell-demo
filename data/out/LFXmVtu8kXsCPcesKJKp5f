Though it ranked high in our audio tests, it struggled a bit in other areas.","The Motorola MBP36S ranked with the <a href=\"/best-baby-video-monitors\">best video baby monitors</a> in our audio tests. While there was a minor crackle through the baby unit, the connection was strong. We could hear clearly through the parent and baby units. The high-sensitivity microphone produces a lot of noise, though. Even on low volume settings, the parent unit can be a little loud.","You can pan and tilt the camera remotely with the video monitor. The directional buttons on the side of the monitor are slightly confusing in their vertical layout. You may need some practice remembering where the directional controls are, but moving the camera is easy as pressing a button. The monitor didn&#39;t activate immediately when we turned it on, though. This lag carried over to the monitor and caused a slight image delay from the camera&#39;s feed. You may also notice motion trails when you move the camera horizontally or vertically, but the image remains clear. The infrared LEDs allow you to see your baby in low-light conditions, and the camera switches to night vision automatically.","The screen on the Motorola MBP36S is the smallest in our comparison at only 2.4 inches, but you can still see everything. You can view feeds from up to four cameras at once. This lets you keep an eye on your whole family in the most popular rooms in your house, but you&#39;ll have to buy the additional cameras individually. Without the power-saving mode on, the battery in this video baby monitor lasts about 6.5 hours. Once it needs juice, the low-battery indicator illuminates.","The monitor uses a 2.4GHz frequency to boost the signal strength between the camera and the parent unit. In our test, the parent unit functioned 150 feet away from the camera, and it can work up to 1,000 feet away outdoors. The baby monitor alerts you once it&#39;s out of range of the camera. This earns the baby monitor a 70 percent connectivity score. We tested connectivity by positioning one unit upstairs with the monitor on the floor directly below. There was a noticeable delay on the monitor between video and audio feeds.","This video baby monitor is under warranty for one year. In case you have questions about setup, the warranty or general use, customer support from Motorola comes in several forms. The website has a product-specific FAQs page along with email and social media support so you can connect with a customer service rep. If you lose your printed manual, you can find a downloadable PDF on Motorola&#39;s website as well."]},"id":"36ec2d9d-97a7-4a8a-b3ea-aa74e77252ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"70e8e5ce-ff2f-410d-9146-1fc99ae4a940","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola MBP36S has a powerful microphone that keeps you alert to what&#39;s going on in your baby&#39;s room.
