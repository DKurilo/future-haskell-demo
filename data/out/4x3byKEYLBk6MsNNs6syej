Also, unlike <a href=\"/ticketmaster-review\">Ticketmaster,</a> it has a clean search interface. You can search by category or with the free text search bar, and it groups playoff tickets together so it’s easy to find seats at the biggest games of the year. Once you select a game, there is a dropdown tab that lets you choose to display ticket prices before or after fees. This transparency is wonderful, especially considering most websites don’t tell you how much they charge in fees until you start checking out.","The site’s search filters are also very useful. You can filter by quantity, ticket type and price. SeatGeek also assigns a deal score to each ticket, marking it with a color and number on a scale of zero to 10. Good deals are assigned higher numbers and are in green, moderate deals are orange and tickets you should probably avoid are red. This system is similar to the one <a href=\"/vivid-seats-review\">Vivid Seats</a> uses and is a great way to avoid expensive tickets that don’t give you a great view of the action. All the deal scores are shown on an interactive map of the stadium or arena, so it’s easy to see where the best tickets are. You can even see photos of the view from available seats at most venues. Further, you can sign up for email alerts to find out when a ticket’s price changes.","SeatGeek didn’t score well when we compared the base price of tickets to three sporting events. It earned a D because it had some of the most expensive tickets on the market. That said, it only charged $8 in fees on a $25 ticket. While fees vary by ticket, this was really impressive considering some websites, such as <a href=\"/ticket-liquidator-review\">Ticket Liquidator,</a> tacked on fees nearly as high as the cost of the ticket itself. You can also shop for tickets on the SeatGeek app.","One major downside to SeatGeek is its ticket resale policies. When you sell a ticket you no longer need or want, the website takes a 20 percent commission. This is among the highest ticket resale fees we found, and most websites take half that. This might not matter a lot if you’re selling a high-dollar ticket, but it could be a deterrent for some users. We also couldn’t find any kind of rewards program, so you don’t get perks for shopping on the site – for example, you don’t receive discounts for buying several tickets at once. Aside from all this, ticket buyers will really like SeatGeek’s transparent and easy-to-use interface."]},"id":"c876cb8e-2fa3-4f9c-be5d-1498b12dac34","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69535","url":"/seatgeek-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-18T16:28:11Z","datePublished":"2017-07-18T16:28:11Z","name":"SeatGeek","synopsis":"SeatGeek's homepage has a \"Track My Order\" button, and while most sports ticket websites offer some sort of order tracking, SeatGeek's is easy to find upfront.","review":{"rating":58,"verdict":"SeatGeek&#8217;s transparent pricing and unique search categories make it an appealing place to shop for sports tickets.","pros":["You can view ticket prices with or without fees as you peruse."],"cons":["The website takes a 20-percent ticket resale commission."]},"strapline":"SeatGeek's homepage has a \"Track My Order\" button, and while most sports ticket websites offer some sort of order tracking, SeatGeek's is easy to find upfront.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-09-13T00:00:00Z","id":"4x3byKEYLBk6MsNNs6syej","meta":{"title":"SeatGeek Sports Ticket Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"SeatGeek will show you the total price of tickets before you enter your payment info.
