It also has other important convenience features like LED lighting, which allows you to see the contents of your freezer regardless of the lighting in the room.","You won’t have to empty out the freezer to defrost it or attempt to chip the ice away with a pick. It has powerful and efficient LED lighting that will let you see the entire contents of the freezer regardless of how dark the room is.","In terms of capacity, this Frigidaire freezer is below average with 13.8 cubic feet of space. However, it can still hold a lot of food and is well-designed, making good use of its space. It also has a convenient fast-freeze feature if your food has been sitting out a while and you want to give it a shot of extra cold air.","The power on indicator light below the door will let you know the freezer is up and running. As long as the light is illuminated, your food should be safe. However, the power on light will not let you know if the temperature is too high. Fortunately, this freezer also has an alarm to let to notify you if the temperature is off. It is energy-efficient and will help you save money on utility bills.","There are also three adjustable shelves and a pull-out basket. The basket is a nice convenience that lets you organize your food placement and perhaps separate bulky items. The drawer slides in and out so you can easily access the items in the basket. The door bins also have plenty of space for small items. You will have to be selective about where you place this freezer in your available space since the door is not reversible.","The temperature control dial is on the interior of the freezer. This means you will need to keep the door open while adjusting the temperature, and will therefore lose cold air. The temperature control is awkwardly positioned at the back of the freezer between the second and third shelves."]},"id":"d9be0943-d125-4e81-ac93-85919463c8d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7d99841-fb6c-4af5-b55c-718209ccf06b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Frigidaire FFFU14F2QW is a frost-free freezer with a lot of great features including auto-defrost and fast-freeze capabilities.
