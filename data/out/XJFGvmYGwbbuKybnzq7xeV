People tend to spend larger amounts when they use their credit cards because they have greater spending power at their fingertips. This translates into more sales for your company.","Using flea markets is a solid business strategy whether your business is just starting out or is well established. Either way, giving customers multiple payment options helps make your business more professional. It also sets you apart from the other booths. Thankfully, there are cost-effective ways to perform credit card processing for on-site transactions.","<strong>By Phone</strong>","You can sign up for a limited merchant account that allows you to check on available funds by phone. This is not a full contract, so you should not be subject to many of the processing fees associated with a full account provider. Rather than taking the payment on the spot, you verify the customers&#39; funds and potential buying power and then record their credit card information. You then commit the sale once you have finished your business at the flea markets.","The way phone processing works is that the provider gives you a toll free number you can call. The provider also gives you an identifying number for your company. You call the service, dial in your company&#39;s number and enter the buyers&#39; payment information. The service will then verify if the customer has enough funds to complete the transaction. If so, you record the customer&#39;s information on an order form and process the payment sometime in the future.","This can be beneficial at flea markets, but your customers might be leery of giving out their information. In this case, it is wise to retain a carbon-copy scanner that will keep the information without hand writing it. It also looks more professional.","<strong>Online</strong>","To process payments online, you first will want to sign up with an online service provider that interfaces with a payment gateway. Your best options for this are Flagship Merchant Services, Merchant Warehouse or National Bankcard. They all give you a virtual terminal that allows you to process payments from your booths at flea markets.","This method is often better than using the phone for making sales at flea markets. You can set up your computer just like a cash register at your booth. You can even purchase Point of Sale (POS) machines that plug right into your laptop. It adds an air of professionalism and increases the likelihood that someone will buy from you. The more professional your business appears to be, the more confident and comfortable your customers will feel about giving you their money. You can compound this effect by promising a secure transaction for every purchase.","The only downside to this method is that it requires an active internet connection. Many flea markets will have a Wi-Fi hotspot you can use, but that might not always be the case. To combat this, you would be wise to sign up for a mobile hotspot plan with your cell phone company so you have connectivity wherever you have cellular service. It might be costly, but you&#39;ll typically recoup your expenses in sales very quickly.","Flea markets are equally good for growing and established business alike. They are prime opportunities to unload some extra stock that would otherwise be collecting dust in the back of a warehouse. They also give a chance to build or expand your customer base. Just be sure you are prepared to take advantage of the golden opportunity flea markets provide by being prepared to accept credit card payments."]},"id":"a1cef299-f22d-45a9-ac90-e15b01852231","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6447","url":"/how-to-process-credit-cards-from-a-booth-or-flea-market","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"m-w-byrne","url":"/author/m-w-byrne","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"M.
