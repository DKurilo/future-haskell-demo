This purifier is very quiet, even at its highest settings, and it uses a four-stage filtration system to clean indoor air. First, the carbon filter captures large particles and helps reduce odors. This filter prevents the growth of mold and bacteria. Next, the HEPA filter removes dust, pollen and other potential allergens. Finally, the ionizer electromagnetically charges particles as they leave the system. Charged particles attract neutral particles to form a larger particle that will get caught in the filters on the next pass through the purifier.","It is important to note that charged particles can actually harm lungs with prolonged exposure. Usually, when an air purification system utilizes an ionizer, it also has an operation scheduler or timer so you can set it to run at times of the day when you are not home. The Fellowes AP-300H does not have either of these features, meaning you will breathe charged particles when it is turned on and you have to manually turn it on and off.","When you turn on the Fellowes AP-300H, it defaults to its auto mode. This home air purifier uses an air-quality sensor to determine the level of pollutants in the air and adjusts the fan accordingly. You can manually adjust the fan speed if you&#39;d rather adjust settings yourself. The air filter monitor helps you figure out when it&#39;s time to install a new filter.","On the Fellowes website, you can read through the FAQs section and download a user manual. If you need personal help, customer support representatives are available by email and phone. The AP-300H also comes with an impressive five-year warranty."]},"id":"9da3c8dc-a377-4072-9b35-278a372f0aef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"44c9cbbc-fbd0-4b70-869e-ccd5da575ddc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Fellowes AP-300H is a quiet air purifier that works best in mid-size rooms.
