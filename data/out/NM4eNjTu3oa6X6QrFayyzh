The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-handheld-vacuums\">Handheld Vacuums</a> </em><em>here</em><em>.</em>","The Dirt Devil Gator 18V cordless hand vacuum is an excellent choice to supplement your upright or canister vacuum. This handheld vacuum delivers 18 volts of powerful suction and gets glowing reviews for its cleaning performance.","Most handheld vacuums have 15 or fewer volts; the fact that this Dirt Devil model has 18 is remarkable. The voltage enables a strong and lasting suction that can pick up a large array of debris, from fine dust to bits of food.","Beyond its high voltage, this small vacuum cleaner has such excellent cleaning capabilities because of its attachments, one of which is a rotating brush roll. When the vacuum is turned on, the brush spins at a rapid pace to deeply penetrate fabric fibers and loosen dirt and dust for more extensive cleaning. The brush also enables you to conveniently move from carpet and upholstery to hardwood floors.","This small vacuum cleaner also comes with a built-in crevice tool. The tool is long and narrow so it can easily reach into tight spaces such as between couch cushions and along windowsills.","A transparent dirt bin collects dirt as the vacuum sucks up debris. The bin is more hygienic than a filter bag, which can trap and leave dust and debris in the machine. You can see when the bin is full and it flips open for easy emptying.","Customer reviews for this hand vacuum praise its design – specifically its D-shaped handle. This shape allows you to comfortably grip the vacuum and use it for several minutes without experiencing hand fatigue. The cordless design allows you to use it anywhere in the house or in your car without plugging into an outlet.","This Dirt Devil Gator is unfortunately not a wall-mountable device, but this doesn’t seem to be an issue for most customers since it is so compact and stores easily.","With its high voltage and strong suction, the Dirt Devil Gator 18V is an outstanding handheld vacuum to have around the house. From vacuuming your stair risers to cleaning the couch cushions, this handheld vacuum can tackle any job with power and efficiency."]},"id":"9396da50-9712-4e11-85da-92cae45f7a35","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58602","url":"/dirt-devil-gator-18v-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-12T15:09:37Z","datePublished":"2014-01-12T15:09:37Z","name":"Dirt Devil Gator 18V","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
