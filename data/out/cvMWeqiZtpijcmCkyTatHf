This is one of the most lightweight trail running shoe at 9.7 oz, utilizing eVent venting fabric technology for a waterproof yet breathable upper.","The three-layer eVent upper employs Direct Venting Technology, which the company developed and patented, is construct of waterproof membranes that lets moisture and vapor escape out through the fabric rather than keeping it trapped, in the case of Hydroventure, inside the shoe. With equal protection the other direction, puddles, rain and other water sources are unable to penetrate the fabric from the outside, putting this up there with the best waterproof trail running shoes.","The low 3 mm drop allows your foot to land in a natural position, natural movement being a key target for Topo Athletic. Active Junky testers gave high marks for its all-day comfort with its TPU rock plates, EVA midsole and anatomic footbed. The Topo Athletic Hydroventure includes a roomy and anatomic toe box that allows extra room for toes to naturally splay out.","This lightweight trail running shoe cruised on flats and ripped uphill with its minimal drop coupled with its 4.5 mm rubber outsole lined with multi-directional lugs. The claim of waterproof running shoe proved true when splashing through puddles and squishing through mud.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments: </strong>The lightweight design crushes through most imaginable trail conditions and terrain with enough midsole stability and outsole width to keep on track. The easy-walking stack height and design offer a casual look off the trail when paired with shorts or jeans while still remaining a top performer on trail.","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Performance","<strong>Best For: </strong>Daily wear to travel and training while giving even beginner runners confidence to hit the trails","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"807f0853-bcc4-45ac-bca4-5c1458089ddc","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 9.7 oz","Drop: 3 mm","Stack Height: 23 mm heel, 20 mm forefoot","Upper: eVent Direct","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber-Vibram"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1a1fc801-f0c6-4bdf-8747-cfc440922858","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background: </strong>Fueled by a passion for running and decades of shoemaking experience, Tony Post and team launched Topo Athletic in 2013.
