You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","AfterShot Pro 2 serves as good <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo manager software</a> for beginner and advanced users. The program has advanced editing and organization tools suitable for professional photographers but still maintains its usability. With a clean interface, you can easily navigate the software and find the tools you need to organize and edit your photos.","This photo organizer allows you to import photos from multiple sources. It is compatible with RAW files from most major cameras. After you edit your photos, you can convert them to JPEG and TIFF files. The software uses nondestructive editing, so you can create multiple versions of the same image with different edits. This feature allows you to experiment with edits without permanently altering your original image.","Whether you save multiple copies of the same RAW file or you are working with several photos, strong sorting tools can help you organize and later find your photos. AfterShot Pro automatically sorts your photos based on standard markers, such as name, date and tags, or you can manually sort your photos using advanced data like ISO, shutter speed and aperture. You can take your sorting one step further by employing flags, star ratings and color-coding to designate favorites and rejects, as well as group themed photos together.","You can also organize your photos by location. Unlike most photo management software, this program does not tag pictures on a map. Instead, you can fill in fields about image location in metadata tabs.","While tagging your photos takes a significant amount of time, it reduces how much time you spend searching for your photos later. This photo manager has sets of premade keywords, including topics, genres and subjects, you can use. You can use a variety of different tags that include genres like portraits and underwater, as well as tags that mark project status like retouched, in progress, archived or finished. The software even branches off into subcategories to further organize your images.","This photo manager software lacks sharing capabilities. You cannot directly connect to social media, email or burn your photos to a disc with this software. While you can create customizable slideshows, you can’t add music or customize transitions between slides.","AfterShot Pro has several standard and advanced editing tools. You can use the cosmetic tools to touch up your pictures or the clone and heal tool to remove unwanted objects. The advanced editing tools are located on the right side of the interface in tabs. Those tabs include Color, Tone, Detail and Metadata. The Color tab has an adjustable histogram, color balance tools and white balance controls. With the Tone tab, you can adjust the photo’s exposure, contrast and radius. The Detail tab has the tools to adjust the sharpness, noise and correct your photo’s lens distortion if it has one.","Corel offers several different support options. You can access tutorials and FAQs on its website, as well as contact information for technical support’s phone and email address. The website also has a live chat option."]},"id":"27fa67c0-1f5e-4b3b-bf08-3a56cb526f11","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"07320798-f358-44b9-91cf-d04ea4b4873a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pros can learn a lot from Corel AfterShot Pro’s advanced editing, metadata and tagging tools.
