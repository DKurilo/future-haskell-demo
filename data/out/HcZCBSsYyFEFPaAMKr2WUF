Cuisinart Juice Extractor CJE-1000 provides everything you need to commit to a cup of fresh juice every day or for a full-on juice fast. Its extra-large 3-inch chute means you can drop in whole apples, pears and oranges without having to remove seeds, which saves time. ","We tested the same recipes in each juicer to see how well each machine performed with various types of fruits and vegetables: soft produce, leafy greens and hard foods. The Cuisinart <a href=\"/best-juicers\">Juice Extractor</a> yielded a high percentage of juice for each recipe. Most of the juice extracted had little to no froth, so it was easier to drink straight from the machine. Most juicers struggle when it comes to juicing leafy greens, but it was an easy task for this juicer. Most of the other machines were unable to effectively process almonds, but this juicer was able to create a decent amount of almond milk with the almonds finely shredded and collected in the pulp container.","This is also a relatively powerful machine that doesn&#39;t require you to make a ton of cuts to your produce. We dropped two halves of a red delicious apple down the chute, and the machine easily juiced it. When it came time for us to test the hard produce, we were able to drop full beets into the tube and they were juiced with little to no pressing needed on the food pusher. Some of the juicers sprayed juice, froth or pulp from the back of the machine, getting the counter and walls dirty. This juicer had no difficulty maintaining the waste and was easy to clean.","Assembling this machine is relatively straightforward, as most of the parts go in a logical location and are easy to click in and out of place. The Cuisinart does have an extra piece beneath the filter bowl – a black ring, which Cuisinart&#39;s manual refers to as the &#34;foam management filter disk.&#34; Considering that this machine produces little froth, we can assume this part does its job well. Some grater baskets are difficult to insert or remove, but this one goes on and off easily while still feeling secure.","Since there are nine parts that need to be disassembled and cleaned after each juicing session, it can take a little longer to hand wash this juicer. While Cuisinart states that these parts can be washed on the top rack of a dishwasher, they recommend hand washing to prevent warping. It can be really difficult cleaning the mesh cylinder that surrounds the grater, but fortunately this juicer comes with a cleaning brush, which works effectively to unplug those holes fast. If you’d prefer fewer parts to take apart and wash, you might want to look at the <a href=\"/kuvings-centrifugal-juicer-review\">Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer NJ-9500UB</a>, which works well and has only five parts to clean.","This machine has a very pleasant look to it and offers a more sophisticated spout than most of the electric juicers we considered. You can adjust it for the speed of juice flow. You remove the lid by pressing your thumb down on a spring-loaded button. This design is different from any of the other juicers and gives it a sophisticated look. The juicer lid is the only one that operates on a hinge. We like this feature as it allows you to keep the lid open, hands-free, when cleaning or leave it open to air-dry after washing.","When the device is plugged in, a blue ring of light will blink around the On/Off button. There are five different settings to choose from when in use. In general, to get the best juicing yield softer produce should be juiced at lower settings while harder produce should be juiced at higher settings. ","When in use e measured the noise level at 85 dB, which is average for our lineup. It also has rubber non-slip feet and doesn&#39;t vibrate excessively when juicing.","The biggest failing of this juicer would have to be the short cord. While some other juicer cords are as long as 5 feet, this machine&#39;s cord is just over 3 feet. This short reach can severely limit your counterspace options. This is a larger vegetable and fruit juicer, so you will need plenty of room on your countertop to operate it.","This machine does come with a 1000 mL pitcher, which means it could hold roughly three 12-ounce sodas. Fresh juice does not keep for long, so you typically wouldn’t make lots of it in advance; however, if you are making juice for your family or for the next day or two, it is nice not to have to stop and empty the pulp. You can get through a lot of produce before you need to pause.","The juicer&#39;s side has an indent that molds perfectly to the shape of the pitcher so you always know where to place it. The pitcher lid has an opening at the top that allows juice to drain from the juicer&#39;s nozzle directly into the pitcher. There is also a nifty piece of plastic that prevents any froth from making its way from the pitcher to your cup. In our testing, we found that this separator worked well to keep our juice froth-free so you could enjoy it right away. If you prefer froth in your juice, you can remove the separator.","Cuisinart backs this fruit and vegetable juicer with a three-year warranty so you can feel confident in your juicer purchase. Most of the other juicers&#39; warranties only cover two years or less. ","The Cuisinart Juice Extractor CJE-1000 is one of the best juicers in our review. It is a powerful machine that produces a lot of juice with very little froth output. It comes with a 1000 mL pitcher and includes a long three-year warranty. "]},"id":"6b885eba-ada8-4b06-b78c-8671685adee8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56842","url":"/cuisinart-juice-extractor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-25T01:08:59Z","datePublished":"2013-06-25T01:08:59Z","name":"Cuisinart Juice Extractor CJE-1000","synopsis":"The Cuisinart Juice Extractor CJE-1000 provides everything you need to commit to a cup of fresh juice every day or for a full-on juice fast.","review":{"rating":96,"verdict":"With its 1000 mL pitcher, 3-inch-wide chute and high juicing yield, the Cuisinart CJE-1000 is the best juicer in our review and has a chic design to boot.","pros":["The Cuisinart produces very little froth in its juice compared to other machines we tested."],"cons":["It has a short extension cord."]},"strapline":"The Cuisinart Juice Extractor CJE-1000 provides everything you need to commit to a cup of fresh juice every day or for a full-on juice fast.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-06-25T01:08:59Z","id":"HcZCBSsYyFEFPaAMKr2WUF","meta":{"title":"Cuisinart Juice Extractor CJE-1000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Cuisinart CJE-1000 allows you to drop in whole fruits and veggies without cutting out seeds and cores first.
