Its safety features allow it to stay cool to the touch, and it automatically shuts off when the unit over heats or tips over. It is a simple unit so it doesn&#39;t come with a lot of convenience features, but it has all the basic heating elements you need.","This mini fireplace has a maximum heat range of 200 square feet, which is half as big as most of the other <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplaces</a> we evaluated. If you&#39;re looking for a portable fireplace with a stronger heating capacity, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/vonhaus-review\">VonHaus Portable Fireplace</a>. Comfor Zone doesn&#39;t come with a remote, but there are two heat settings to choose between. If you simply want to use it for ambience, you can have the flames turned on while the heat is turned off. Its small size makes it easy to move from room to room, and itâ€™s even easy to travel with. It is 9.5 inches deep, 6.25 inches wide and 12.75 inches tall, making it one of the smallest electric fireplaces we&#39;ve ever seen. The power cord reaches 6 feet to give the unit better range within a room.","Since it is so small, there is a fear of it tipping over and causing damage to your home. Fortunately, the device only works when standing upright on level ground, so should it tip over the heater will turn off. The unit stays cool to the touch except for the heat vent situated below the fake flames. The manufacturer warns against putting this unit directly on carpet since it can cause damage, so you&#39;ll want to put it on something with a higher heat tolerance like a desk, dresser, counter or a concrete floor.","It only comes in red but the color is pleasant and doesn&#39;t distract from the flames. Comfort Zone backs this mini electric fireplace with a one-year warranty, which is just as good as the larger electric fireplaces we evaluated. On its low setting it uses 700 watts, while on its high setting it uses 1,200 watts. Basically, this means that you will save more money on your power bill if you have it operating in a small room."]},"id":"ebfb3511-d0a0-4d55-ac2c-5420ad6f010a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69550","url":"/comfort-zone-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-26T15:21:04Z","datePublished":"2017-07-26T15:21:04Z","name":"Comfort Zone CZFP1","synopsis":"The Comfort Zone CZFP1 is perfect for college dorms, one-car garages or other tight spaces since it is inexpensive and works best to heat small rooms.
