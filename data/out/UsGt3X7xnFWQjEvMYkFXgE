You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Brother is another big name in the world of printers. It didn&#39;t start out that way though. Brother began about a century ago with sewing machines and over the years has expanded its production lineup to a variety of machinery. Printers have become one of their major product lines because they are well made and do a good job. Currently the Brother MFC-6490CW is one of their best <a href=\"/best-all-in-one-printers\">all-in-one printers</a> for a small business or home office. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t quite measure up to its competition, at least not for the price of this multifunction machine.","It seems that in the last few years Brother has focused on other areas, like perhaps their large office all-in-one printers. Just to be clear, the Brother MFC-6490CW does a good job, it just needs an upgrade. The slower speeds, semi-low resolutions and sheer weight are lacking. Improved speed performance, quality output and a lighter design would make this machine a little friendlier to the average small business.","The printing speed for standard text documents is 4.3 ppm (pages-per-minute). From there, printing in color drops to 2.9 ppm. The time it takes to print a photo varies depending on the complexity of the image but you pretty much plan on a few minutes for each print. The resolution for those prints tops out at 6000 x 1200, which will give you pretty decent prints. The monthly duty cycle for this Brother multifunction printer is 5000 pages. That isn&#39;t as high as some, but for home or small business, it&#39;ll probably be more than enough.","The optical scan resolution for the Brother MFC-6490CW is 2400 x 1200 dpi (dots-per-inch). AS long as you don&#39;t have plans to enlarge documents much, that should be enough. If you want you can do an interpolated scan, which will do 19200 x 19200 dpi. With interpolation this all-in-one printer can scan as well as any of its competition.","As a copier the Brother MFC-6490CW does fine. The initial copies always take the longest and they average about 36 seconds each. The copies that follow should speed up to more than double, reaching speeds of around 4.3 cpm (copies-per-minute). This particular all-in-one printer doesn&#39;t allow for duplex coping, so if you want to do two side documents you&#39;ll have to manually flip the sheets.","As we mentioned before, this all-in-one printer is a bit heavier than most others. At 34.4 pounds it&#39;s roughly about 10 pounds more. The good thing is that the Brother MFC-6490CW allows for Wi-Fi connections. So, once you get this beast where you want it, you should have to move it to accommodate any devices that you wish to printer from. The issue of weight will only crop up again if you decided to move or rearrange your office."]},"id":"be0d2901-742c-4bb4-ad7d-489f29c3187f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"260f45ad-899f-4857-9f9f-292dcbab1bd1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The flaws that the<strong> </strong>Brother MFC-6490CW<strong> </strong>has aren&#39;t super significant to the average user in a home.
