In most cases, quality bass is better than more bass, and that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ll get from the Bowers &amp; Wilkins P5 headphones. The bass might not be as prominent, but the overall soundscape is well balanced and very sharp.","Designed for superior sound quality, the Bowers &amp; Wilkins P5 headphones produce incredibly textured sound. The impedance of 26 ohms keep them from draining your music device&#39;s battery. A 40 mm driver helps create those deep bass lows, and you&#39;ll catch every note of your music with 115dB of sound sensitivity – a higher range than many other solid bass headphones. Frequency response ranges from a super low 10Hz to a high 20,000Hz, which is well below human hearing and will give you all the vibrations of deep bass.","The 50 megawatts of power from these on-ear headphones doesn&#39;t exactly say &#34;intense,&#34; but in our experience, the quality of sound nearly makes up for this shortcoming. The on-ear design also points to lack of noise isolation, less comfort and weaker bass. Nevertheless, in our listening experience, the bass is sufficient and highly textured. Vocals are terrifically crisp as well, specifically for good bass headphones.","Headphones with good bass should also provide great features, and the P5s are up to the task. The inline remote is really polished, refined and easy to use with iOS or other devices. Noise isolation is not battery powered, which means these are lighter headphones but they produce a lot of sound leakage. Typing, talking and traffic all seep in, even though the closed earcups try their best to keep noises out. Yet, sound refuses to leak out of these bass headphones, so you don&#39;t have to worry about disturbing anyone with your music. The carrying case, although not a hard shell, is well made and thick enough for adequate protection of the best bass headphones.","The P5s are some of the most sophisticated and elegantly designed bass headphones. Sliding the headband to adjust to your head size is a breeze, and they stay put much better than other models do. They are also some of the lightest headphones for good bass – they only weigh 6.8 ounces. Although these leather headphones are light and sit well, the on-ear design does feel a bit tight on your lobes after an extended time.","Bowers &amp; Wilkins makes it easy to find information about your bass headphones. You only find pertinent information because support is customized and narrowed according to headphone model. Read FAQs, ask your own questions or read online manuals to find solutions and answers. Bowers &amp; Wilkins provides first-rate product brochures, quick-start guides and technical specifications for all of its products. Even though you can&#39;t contact representatives via live chat, you can email or call for quick support. A two-year warranty protects your headphones as well."]},"id":"e93920e5-e139-4289-bb03-fa0740bcccfe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e8b7dddd-e466-4ad3-b2fd-0a9114d685c5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With the Bowers &amp; Wilkins P5 headphones, the cover matches the book.
