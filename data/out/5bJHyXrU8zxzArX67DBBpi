You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The ProCinema 600 is a 5.1 compact surround sound speaker system that comes with six components: four satellite speakers small enough to hide on a table or bookshelf, a center channel speaker that keeps action tied to the TV and pumps out the dialogue, and a subwoofer. We like this <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker system</a> because it is well engineered and produces admirable sound.","This home theater speaker system has all the specs we like to see. The bass scrapes down as low as 22 Hz and the satellites can chirp at frequencies up to 30,000 Hz. This provides excellent coverage of the audible spectrum. Here is a quick glance at some of the other important performance indicators:"]},"id":"f6b4e76f-0882-4c00-9dec-321679b07b09","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Power Range: 10-175 watts","Impedance: 8 Ohms","Sensitivity: 88-89 dB","Low-pass Crossover: 40-150 Hz"],"type":"ul"},"id":"aac18f86-b05d-40cd-b86b-ed2b090ab462","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All cabinets are resonant-resistant and come with removable grilles to aid in cleaning or for cosmetic appeal. Each satellite packs a 1&#34; pure aluminum dome tweeter and a 3.25&#34; midrange driver coupled with a 3.25&#34; passive radiator. The radiator looks like a driver but doesn&#39;t actually produce sound. Instead, it flexes with subtle changes in the cabinet pressure. This aids low-pitch performance and allows the main drivers to blend better with the bass.","The center channel speaker is a double-dose compared with the satellites; it comes with a tweeter and two midrange drivers coupled with two passive radiators. This double power will keep all the sound in the room tied to the TV screen while producing rich mid-range tones like dialogue. Speaker systems that lack a center channel will not be able to match this speaker set for volume simply because they are short one mid-range driver.","It is important to note that only the center channel speaker is magnetically shielded. Keep the satellite speakers a safe distance away from your television.","The ProCinema speaker system produces a nice, full sound. The broad frequency range allows for clear highs and a tight bass. The sound quality isn&#39;t perfect, but it is very good for speakers of this size and price. For best results, place these speakers in a small to mid-sized room. If you want to fill a big room with hi-fi surround sound, you will probably need to buy larger speakers.","The speakers come with keyholes for easy wall mounting and the highest-quality binding posts for easy wiring, but be prepared to do twice the number of hookups. The speakers require many inconvenient connections with the subwoofer. If that sounds overly intimidating, don&#39;t worry: the package comes with instructions.","Definitive Technology offers an excellent warranty that covers manufacturing and workmanship defects for five years on speakers and three years for electrical components.
