The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about Wireless Earbuds <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">here</a>.</em>","The LG Tone HBS-900 wireless earbuds are easy to use, but the wearing style is unusual and impractical for wireless in-ear headphones. They aren&#39;t for running or workouts. You wear them around your neck like a collar, pulling them up to your ears with extremely thin, retractable wires. They&#39;re only good for casual listening. However, since the audio quality doesn&#39;t match cheaper traditional wired headphones, the only value is the fact that you won&#39;t have to untangle headphone wires every time you want to listen to Pandora on the bus.","The audio quality is good for wireless earbuds. The earbud tips create a good seal that isolates the audio. However, only two sizes are available, which means you have less of a chance to find the best fit.","The best feature is the long battery life. The bulky collar design allows for 17 hours of talk time and 14 hours of streaming on just two hours of recharging. For comparison, the best wireless earphones have a battery life of eight hours.","Another advantage it has over many wireless Bluetooth earbuds is the call quality. The microphone is a lot more substantial than those of most wireless earbuds, which sacrifice call quality in favor of durability. A vibration alerts you to incoming calls. While this is a convenient feature, it may make you jump the first couple of times. The vibration works well if you don&#39;t have the earbuds in your ears.","These earbuds have more controls than other wireless earbuds we&#39;ve tested. In addition to the answer, reject and end call buttons, you can also redial and reconnect to other devices using the buttons on the LG Tone. You can pair these wireless earbuds to two devices at once with multipoint pairing mode. However, you can&#39;t stream music when paired to two phones at the same time.","Since the HBS-900 fits around your neck like a collar, it&#39;s not made for workouts or running. Even a brisk walk will cause it to move around more than you&#39;d like. It isn&#39;t sweatproof, water resistant, impact resistant or sandproof.","The LG website has a plethora of ways for you to get help with the device. You can speak with a representative via live chat, which is the quickest method. You can also send an email or make a phone call to contact them. These earbuds come with a one-year warranty and a user manual."]},"id":"e04e7bd4-f4e0-47fe-81f0-ccf46c801821","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f0592303-d683-4c56-8ada-e52663d7d530","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG Tone HBS-900&#39;s collar design is what stands out most.
