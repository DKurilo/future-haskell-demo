However, it lacks the durability we like to see in the best HDMI cables. Cmple doesn&#39;t offer as many support options as we&#39;d like either, and the cable&#39;s warranty looks stingy compared to those from other manufacturers.","Let&#39;s get the negative stuff out of the way. This cable doesn&#39;t have any braiding, which would help it deal with wear and tear over time. You don&#39;t get high-purity copper conductors to reduce corrosion with this Cmple HDMI cable either. Also, Cmple&#39;s warranty and support options are lacking, but we&#39;ll talk more about that further down.","Cmple&#39;s cable is certified by HDMI Licensing, LLC in the High Speed with Ethernet category. High Speed means that the cable maintains a bandwidth of 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second) and supports high-definition screen resolutions of 1080p and higher. Cmple&#39;s cable supports 3D and advanced color spaces, including sYCC601 and Adobe YCC601.","The Cmple cable includes an Ethernet channel that provides an internet connection. An Ethernet channel within the HDMI cable eliminates the need for a separate Ethernet cable. The signal is also stronger than a wireless connection, but it only works with devices that are equipped to use the technology â€“ of which there are few at the time of writing. The cable supports compressed digital audio formats, including Dolby Digital and DTS (Digital Theater System), as well as the newer uncompressed formats, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.","The cable is available in lengths of 1.5, 3, 6, 10 and 15 feet. It is not CL3 safety certified for in-wall installation. CL3 certification is required for cables over 15 feet, but the Cmple cable is not safety certified for shorter cables either. The cable is not available in lengths higher than 15 feet, because it is not able to maintain a 10.2 Gbps signal in longer distances. Better cable design would allow for longer runs, as is the case with the <a href=\"/audioquest-high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable-review\">AudioQuest Pearl</a>.","Cmple offers a 30-day warranty on its products. This is abysmal compared to the lifetime warranties that are offered on other HDMI cables like the <a href=\"/monoprice-review\">Monoprice Select</a>. The company provides customer support by email and phone, but you won&#39;t find a FAQs page on its website.","The Cmple Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable supports the latest HDMI technologies. It provides a bandwidth of at least 10.2 Gbps in order to support 3D and advanced color spaces. However, the support options and durability of this cable aren&#39;t as good as those of competing cables."]},"id":"e5e0aa62-d246-47da-abba-87a00efba85e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49176","url":"/cmple-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-05T13:30:38Z","datePublished":"2010-04-05T13:30:38Z","name":"Cmple Ultra High Speed","synopsis":"The Cmple Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is affordable and can handle just about any video signal you throw at it.
