The less time a piece of meat is on the grill, the more flavors it retains. The Ultra Chef is equipped with two stainless-steel bottom tube burners and one ceramic infrared bottom burner. The main burners draw 22,500 BTUs that power the grill’s infrared element, which heats up quickly and sears your meat in short order so you can move your food from the grill to your plate before its juicy goodness evaporates.","The grill also includes a standard gas side burner that draws 10,500BTUs. You can use the side burner to boil corn or potatoes while you wait for your meat to cook. Additionally, you get a stainless-steel, infrared rear rotisserie burner.
