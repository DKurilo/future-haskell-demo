The Napoleon Ultra Chef is no different. The reputation is solidified when they offer a lifetime warranties the main burners. While the cooking area on this gas grill could be better, but it will still complement your backyard ensemble well with some nice features to recommend it, such as a rotisserie burner.","The three primary burners on the Napoleon Ultra Chef gas BBQ grill can generate up to 59,000 BTUs. This grill also features a 14,000 BTU stainless steel rear rotisserie burner with infrared technology. This burner alone provides a big bonus for the Napoleon Ultra Chef gas grill. Rotisserie burners are a rare find in gas grills, and infrared technology helps to spread heat evenly across the burner. You can also purchase an optional side burner for this gas grill, but it does not come standard.","The Napoleon Ultra Chef gas grill has a good amount of cooking space, but when compared to the higher-end Napoleon grills, it appears limited. The primary cooking area is 405 square inches with 102 square inches of warming rack space. This grill has enough room to cook several items at once, but if you&#39;re looking for a gas grill with space to spare, the Ultra Chef may fall short of your expectations. However, additional features on this gas grill make it a competitor, including a built-in heat gauge, side shelf space, and a natural gas option. Much like the rotisserie burners, natural gas hookups are a rare find in gas grills. We were impressed with the natural gas option on the Ultra Chef.","The cooking grates on the Napoleon Ultra Chef gas grill are made of porcelain-coated cast iron. The porcelain coating on these grids helps prevent food from sticking to the grill, and the cast iron material retains heat exceptionally well. The housing material on this gas grill is stainless steel, which helps prevent rust and wear on the outside and inside of the grill. The stainless steel shelves contain integrated tool hooks, which provide convenient access to your grilling tools.","Napoleon grills come with a lifetime burner warranty, so you can be assured that the primary grilling capabilities will remain vital throughout the life of the grill. Parts are covered for two years, which is common for gas grills. Napoleon has an excellent presence online. The website contains a helpful FAQs section along with videos for several of their gas grills. There is a manual available online, and if you need direct assistance, you can contact the company by email or telephone."]},"id":"b68302b0-7c05-458f-8bf8-3d650fd9f1d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ff5bd2a5-cacb-4224-b89e-df4e56caa990","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Napoleon Ultra Chef gas grill has several features that make it a standout option for your barbecuing needs.
