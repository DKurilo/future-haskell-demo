However, it is able to measure up to the wireless range and connectivity of its competitors. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and in its ability to get the basic typing job done, and therefore merits one of the last positions on our lineup.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>The Logitech Wireless Keyboard K270 plays the wireless game as well as any other keyboard on our lineup, incorporating the same reliable 2.4 GHz connectivity with a 30-foot range of motion. It likewise connects to your computer using Logitech&#39;s device-networking receiver, which allows you to sync your keyboard and up to five additional compatible peripherals at once. With the Unifying receiver, your computer instantly recognizes the keyboard without software installation.","The K270 has a row of eight designated hotkeys along the top edge of the keyboard frame that give you one-touch access to your calculator, media applications, internet functions and powering your PC. Unfortunately, this keyboard is not equipped with preprogrammed F keys like some of its competitors.","This keyboard is powered by two AAA batteries that are estimated to last up to 24 months. It also has an on/off switch to help you conserve energy.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>The K270 is a full-size keyboard with a standard layout. Its keys are concave-shaped and, while they are not as responsive as some of Logitech&#39;s other higher-ranked keyboards, they should feel immediately familiar to the experienced typist. The K270 has a relatively slim profile and comes in matte black with a gray undercarriage. Although this keyboard is equipped with flip-out adjustable feet to allow for more comfortable typing, it lacks proper wrist support and can leave you feeling a bit strained after a long typing session.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>We once again sing praises to Logitech for making it easy to access online support options specifically for this keyboard. The product page contains links to a FAQs list and troubleshooting guide, a user manual in PDF format, a user community, and email and phone access to technical representatives. There is also a link to available software downloads and updates. This keyboard comes with a three-year warranty."]},"id":"dac62a28-bb1e-4ae4-9361-00a3503d188d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e06a769b-2b02-48d1-8345-724bcb375689","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Logitech Wireless Keyboard K270 offers a no-frills keyboard with some added functionality to maximize your time at the computer.
