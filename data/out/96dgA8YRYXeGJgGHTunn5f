Rather than supporting a suspended camera underneath the drone, you instead can mount a camera on its top. The drone can still offer you a first-person view of everything that the camera sees while you are soaring the skies in real-time. However, this drone doesn’t include a camera. You’ll have to purchase your own action camera and install it. The drone keeps the camera incredibly steady and free from vibrations.","It has a payload capacity of 8.82 ounces and offers 6 to 8 minutes of flight time, which is shorter than the average flight time of around 15 minutes that most drones have. It has a range of 984 feet.","This personal drone is perfect for beginners. It is quite durable and has carbon-fiber propellers. The RC drone can definitely handle some crashes. It also has bright yellow foam balls that help you land smoothly. It has dimensions of 11.81 x 11.81 x 7.87 inches and weighs just 1.87 pounds, making it quite portable.","It is entirety ready to fly and comes pre-calibrated. You get a 2700mAh LiPo battery, a transmitter and four AA batteries for the transmitter. The drone doesn’t have pre-installed GPS, so it won&#39;t be as stable as other models, and you won&#39;t be able to measure its flying altitude or use an automatic return-to-home function like the one similar drones offer.","If you don’t want to mount the camera at the top of the drone, HeliPal has some tips on its website on how to invert the camera like other drones. You can download the instruction manual online too. It should be noted that this UAV does not come with a warranty of any kind. However, you can still reach out to the manufacturer through email."]},"id":"a4594323-e56b-485b-b415-03f033d70de1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"53a1ca2c-db87-4423-bf12-38dd1f8aa73d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Storm Drone 4 is a decent drone.
