NOD32 Antivirus blocked 99 percent of more than 300 malware samples we used to test <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus software</a>. It also scored above average in other independent lab tests, making it a good solution for protecting your Windows computer or laptop. ESET recognizes viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, rootkits ransomware and phishing schemes, and it blocks you from visiting sites that are known to have malware hidden on them.","In our testing, ESET NOD32 was probably the easiest program to download, install and use. When we pressed the download link, the program installed itself and immediately began scanning our system for any threats. We didn’t have to manually set up anything. It blocked malicious sites and displayed in-browser warning messages without having to enable any browser extensions. When we were ready to schedule scans and set up custom scans, ESET was so well laid out that we were quickly able to find the function tabs and links we needed.","This software scans emails for viruses in messages and their attachments. It also scans USB drives immediately after you plug them in to protect you from external threats. This includes cellphones; it will remove any viruses it finds on your mobile devices that are connected to your computer through the USB port. ESET scans files in real time as they open to ensure malicious files don’t cause any problems. We saw this happen often during our test when viruses attempted to download from the web. ESET was quick to recognize threats, interrupt the downloads and quarantine the threats before they could infect our computer.","This antivirus software connects to an online database to stay up to date on the most recent virus threats. While most programs automatically update themselves, ESET requires you to update the virus signatures database yourself. This is done by simply pressing the Update button, but it does create a vulnerability if you don’t remember to update the program often. The software will alert you when the database needs to be updated.","Other test labs reported that ESET created a little slowdown during performance tests, but we didn’t see any slowing when we tested ESET NOD32 Antivirus. We ran the program while doing normal computer activities including playing games online, watching videos, downloading programs, attaching files to outgoing email messages and surfing the web.","The only setback we saw with ESET NOD32 is, because it’s a basic antivirus program, it doesn’t include some important security features. These include a firewall, spam filters and a password manager, though all of these are included with <a href=\"/eset-review\">ESET Smart Security</a>, a more inclusive internet security program. We’ve tested this program, too, and recommend it as a good computer protection solution. It just costs substantially more than ESET NOD32 Antivirus. There are other antivirus programs, like <a href=\"/vipre-antivirus-antispyware-review\">VIPRE</a>, that include these tools and don’t cost as much as the more advanced ESET program."]},"id":"050835b0-7a74-4152-98ab-b7cf9180ba56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fe604055-912b-4afd-ba6a-e4ffae280d38","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ESET NOD32 Antivirus delivers great protection without slowing down your computer or making it difficult to set up.
