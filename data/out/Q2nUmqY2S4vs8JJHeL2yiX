We researched both national and local truck companies; however, we ultimately chose to focus on national companies that offer local, and in most cases one-way, service.","We talked to Michael Keaton, senior director of communications for the <a href=\"https://www.moving.org/\">American Moving &amp; Storage Association</a>, to learn about all the newest developments in the truck rental industry. One important bit of information we gathered from that conversation is that moving expenses are no longer tax deductible after Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017, “which suspended qualified moving expense deductions along with the exclusion of employer reimbursements as taxable income through 2025.”","We also asked Keaton about the important services and additional equipment to consider adding to a truck rental reservation, and he suggested adding a full-value protection plan. He said, “You can opt for the minimum coverage of 60 cents per pound for an interstate move, which is not recommended. Your 20-pound T.V. is surely worth more than $12 if it is broken.” As you choose additional coverage, it&#39;s important to consider that as a DIY mover, you have little experience packing and stacking boxes, and comprehensive coverage can cover a silly mishap.","<strong>How We Tested<br/></strong>","We obtained quotes from each company, either through its website or by phone, for a small, medium and large box truck. We then compared the prices for a 200-mile, in-town move and a 2,000-mile, one-way move, considering both the daily base rate and the mileage charge for each size vehicle. We also took note of the additional equipment the company offers, including hand trucks, furniture pads and car carriers, because it’s convenient when you can get everything you need to make your move safe and easy in one place.","Further, we compared the number of rental locations each company has in the U.S. and Canada. Some don’t rent trucks in Alaska and Hawaii, and companies like Penske have only a few locations in Canadian provinces. The best companies rent trucks in more states and provinces than lower-rated services.","We also reviewed each company’s terms and services. Some don’t offer one-way truck rentals, and others don’t guarantee reservations. We also compared the prices of and features included in the different supplemental insurance programs. Supplemental insurance and damage waivers cover damage to the truck, your belongings and even yourself. We awarded higher scores to services that can put you in contact with local laborers to help you load and unload your truck.","<strong>How Much Does It Cost to Rent a Moving Truck? </strong>","The cost of renting a truck depends heavily on demand and seasonality. Because summer is the most popular moving time, demand for trucks goes up and so does the price. College students often move home in the summer, and families tend to move when children are out of school, so if you can schedule your move in the fall, spring or winter, you could save money.","Rental truck prices include a set number of days of use and mileage. Truck availability, size and return location also affect how much you pay for your rental.","According to the American Moving &amp; Storage Association, in-state moves cost an average of $1,170 and out-of-state moves can cost over $5,000. Daily rates range from $19 to $74, and mileage rates range between 49 cents and 99 cents per mile. Many companies offer coupons, but try to get bids from multiple places – then ask your preferred moving company if they can beat the lowest offer.","Extra Equipment<br/> Truck rental companies often sell boxes and other packing materials. While gathering your own boxes is a good way to save money, those you purchase from a rental company are usually stronger and all uniform in size, which is helpful as you pack and load the truck.","You can also rent hand trucks and furniture pads to help you load the truck and secure breakable furniture. Furniture pads usually cost $10 to $12 for a dozen, and hand trucks cost around $10 to rent.","<strong>Best Moving Containers </strong>","If you’re moving your belongings and don’t want to deal with the hassle of driving and parking a large vehicle, a moving container is a better option. We spent several days researching prices, shipping times and other considerations, like packing assistance. Here are our favorite moving-container services:","<a href=\"/u-haul-review\">U-Haul U-Box</a><br/>This service has the lowest prices, an easy-to-use online request form and 30 days of storage included with the rental charge. U-Boxes come in only one size: 8 by 5 by 7 feet, which is large enough to fit the contents of a studio apartment. However, if there’s limited space at the drop-off location, it’s easier to pack multiple small boxes instead of one large container, especially if you are moving to a location without a driveway. You can avoid delivery fees by bringing your belongings to one of thousands of U-Haul locations across the country, where you pack them into the container and have it shipped to your final destination.","<a href=\"/pods-review\">PODS</a><br/>PODS has a wide variety of moving-container sizes and serves more than 20,000 cities in the United States and select cities in Canada and Australia. For short-distance moves and smaller containers, this moving-container service offers low prices compared with other companies we evaluated, but for large containers, the prices were a bit above average. (Storage fees start at $130 per month for small containers.) PODS also offers 7-, 12- and 16-foot storage containers for people who are remodeling or changing their living arrangements. "]},"id":"d6527cd0-76bb-4de1-b609-fca76e1d5d95","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_89","url":"/best-truck-rental-services","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-24T21:49:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-24T21:49:00Z","name":"Best Truck Rental Services of 2019","synopsis":"Every truck rental company has pros and cons.
