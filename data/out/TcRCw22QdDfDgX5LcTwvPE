We tried fish, chicken, vegetables and rice in all the <a href=\"/best-food-steamers\">food steamers</a> we tested. The NaturoPure gave us excellent rice, but our taste testers gave chicken, fish and vegetables below-average marks.","All of the electric food steamers we tested were generally intuitive and easy to use; however, the NaturoPure was slightly more difficult than most. The digital display took a little practice to master, and most of our testers had to refer to the manual to operate it correctly. After the initial use, however, it doesn’t take long to master the controls. Most of the other steamers have a simple timer or an on/off switch, but the NaturoPure has eight buttons and a digital display that feels a bit overwhelming considering it&#39;s a simple appliance.","This three-tier steamer has the highest food capacity among those we tested: a full 12 quarts. The water reservoir is about average – 32 oz. – but you can easily fill it without interrupting the cooking process. It also has a water-level window so you can track the water level and fill it as needed. There’s a warming setting, which is great if you need to keep your steamed food at the right temperature while you prepare other food or entertain guests. We measured the exterior temperature, which according to our reading, exceeded 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so you&#39;ll want to keep this appliance away from kids.","The NaturoPure took us longer than average to clean, partially because there are more pieces and more capacity than any of the other steamers we tested. It is dishwasher safe, and the pieces nest together nicely for more compact storage.","The manufacturer website has live chat, email and phone customer service options. They are available from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday. If you need to reach them, the response is almost immediate. You can also find the owner’s manual online in case you’ve misplaced your copy, but you won&#39;t find any additional recipes or tips to go with this food steamer."]},"id":"b7d53384-130a-4743-8a86-dabebe028490","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ddd2da3c-07c3-4e1e-833f-9494d551f0e0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you routinely steam full meals, or cook for a large family, the NaturoPure is one of the best food steamers you can choose.
