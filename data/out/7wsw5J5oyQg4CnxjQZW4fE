The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-free-email-services\">Free Email Services</a> here.</em>","Inbox.com is a free email service with a standard offering of features and tools. The service possesses an intuitive interface, which is arguably the easiest to use of all the email account services we reviewed. This benefit is offset somewhat by the lack of many important features for the modern internet user, though.","Inbox.com provides you with 5GB of email storage, which isn&#39;t much space, especially compared to the top email providers on our lineup. You&#39;ll likely find yourself having to delete emails down the road. Inbox.com also has a number of additional features just for fun, such as custom inbox themes, games, eCards and screensaver downloads.","While Inbox.com&#39;s email functionality is solid, its interface is severely outdated, and we feel that it could improve its standing among the best free email accounts by integrating more Web 2.0 features. Social media sites such as Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter allow apps to be developed for their platforms. If you had the ability to integrate Inbox.com with any of these sites, it would become much more useful, especially in today&#39;s age where social media is such a part of daily life for many people.","Inbox.com&#39;s security features, however, are quite nice. This email service offers five levels of spam protection, from none to exclusive. With the exclusive setting, only mail from senders on your White List reach your inbox. You can keep spam messages in the spam folder or have them deleted immediately. You can also block HTML images and use a challenge-response protection message, which asks the sender a question or gives them a task that proves their legitimacy.","When we tested the spam filter on the middle setting, we found that most legitimate messages made it to our inbox. However, emails from many services we subscribed to were routed to the spam folder. For a while after you first open your account, you should always double-check your spam folder. If spam happens to reach your inbox, you can easily report it to Inbox.com so it doesn&#39;t happen again with that particular sender.","Inbox.com includes some of the best email organization features on the internet. You can create custom folders with specific filters and sorting options. You can also sort incoming mail by various fields, including From, To, Subject, Body and Attachments.","This free email address service does not offer instant messaging like the best services do. You can access your email through a mobile browser, which is a staple of a good email service in today&#39;s age, but Inbox.com doesn&#39;t offer a mobile app for checking your email, which is a significant omission when so many people use the internet primarily through their phones. You can, however, download the Inbox.com toolbar to get alerts when you receive new mail."]},"id":"2cd2823a-cb7a-4b6b-aad0-36338cdb4414","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a76c7df0-1945-4205-a9cb-5b5301b1e23b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Inbox.com&#39;s custom sorting and intuitive interface makes this service great for experts and casual users.
