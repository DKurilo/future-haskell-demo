The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-rewards-credit-cards\">Rewards Credit Cards</a> here.</em>","The BankAmericard Travel Rewards® card is a credit card with rewards that work off a points system. This rewards credit card will earn you points with every purchase you make. You will earn 1.5 points per dollar you spend, and the number of points you can earn isn&#39;t limited. Nor do points expire. They can be redeemed for travel or other items like cash and merchandise.","Along with its multiple redemption options, this card lets new cardholders earn bonus points in the first few months of having the card. In the first 90 days, if you spend $500, you will be awarded 10,000 bonus points, which is equal to $100.","This rewards card&#39;s introductory APR isn&#39;t as generous as many other credit cards with rewards, but it does have one. For the first 12 months, you will enjoy a 0% APR on purchases you make. After the introductory offer, your purchase APR will be 14.99% to 22.99% variable. Any balance transfers you make will also have the same 14.99% to 22.99% variable APR.","This card’s cash advance APR gets a bit tricky, as there are two, depending on the type of cash advance you do. For direct deposits and check cash advances, a 22.99% APR will apply. For bank cash advances, a 24.99% APR will apply. Additionally, this card has a 29.99% penalty APR.","You will enjoy having no annual fee with this rewards card, which is a nice perk. There are no additional surprising fees with this card; however, the cash advance fees get a bit tricky. If you plan to do any cash advances, you will be charged either a $10 fee or a 3% or 5% fee. If you transfer a balance to this card, you can expect the fairly standard $10 or 3% charge. One bonus with this card’s fees is its international purchase fee, which is non-existent, so you won’t be charged for transactions you make overseas.","We were disappointed in Bank of America’s lack of additional services, which generally accompany many credit cards. For instance, travel accident insurance, rental car insurance, lost luggage reimbursement and extended product warranty are only offered to those who are approved. However, Bank of America does offer you its $0 Liability Guarantee against fraudulent charges on its account.","Bank of America can be contacted via phone, email or even live chat on its website. Additionally, you are able to reference a number of frequently asked questions online that may answer many questions or issues you may have with your card."]},"id":"0f0e795e-49b2-47f9-bdb9-945555a37ab2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a090c627-4f29-404b-9269-37df8934f9c9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BankAmericard Travel Rewards® card is a great option for Bank of America members and others who are looking for a rewards credit card that can earn them free travel.
