You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","The Craftsman 1/2-horsepower Belt Drive opener has less power than some of the top <a href=\"/best-garage-door-openers\">garage door openers</a> in our lineup, but there is a lot to like about this opener. The lifting system uses a belt instead of a chain. Many consumers prefer belt garage door openers because they run cleaner and quieter than a chain, and with a belt there is no need to keep everything greased. This belt drive garage door opener is especially impressive because it offers the Motor Vibration Isolation System, designed to eliminate excess movement, which keeps it relatively quiet.","This opener works best with double-wide aluminum doors or single-wide wood doors, but you would not want to use it for heftier doors as the 1/2-horsepower motor has a lifting limit of 300 pounds. The unit offers bright lighting – two 100-watt bulbs that turn on automatically whenever the door opens or closes. Having a well-lit garage helps keep criminals away and helps you to navigate your way through the garage without tripping on any obstacles in your way. If you need a stronger garage door opener, consider our top pick, <a href=\"/chamberlain-premium-whisper-drive-review\">Chamberlain Premium Whisper Drive</a>.","Two 3-button remotes and a control panel are included with this garage opener. The control panel features an oversized button for the door that is easy to press with your hand or elbow if your hands are full of bags, groceries or kids.","The same safety features found in the best garage door openers are included with this Craftsman unit. This includes an infrared beam at the base of the door that stops it from closing if anyone or anything crosses the beam. In addition, the door automatically reverses if it encounters any object as it closes. This is an important feature as kids and pets would otherwise be in danger if they try to run out before the door closes.","This garage door opener has a 10-year motor warranty and a three-year warranty on parts, including the railing and belt. While other Craftsman garage openers offer lifetime motor warranties, a 10-year warranty isn&#39;t bad. It is good to know that you are covered if your opener has any manufacturer&#39;s defects or you run into problems during that time.","Sears customer service representatives answer the phone quickly and are very friendly, although you may find that their knowledge of garage door openers is limited. The product pages on the website include FAQs and download links for the owner&#39;s manual. You can also contact support via an online email form or live chat."]},"id":"94bc41a8-e0be-4a50-9dae-a8e8450d7f65","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e357acf9-ad29-422c-b728-e9ed6ccfd1ec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Craftsman 1/2-horsepower Belt Drive opener runs quietly and cleanly.
