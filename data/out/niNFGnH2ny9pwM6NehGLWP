There is not a ton of detailing on the locomotives or anything else, and there are few accessories. This set really appeals more to the technical side of the hobby with its DCC controller, and that will be great for certain aspiring model railroading hobbyists. The inclusion of the second locomotive is a wise addition. It helps show off the capabilities of a DCC system. This is an ideal model railroad for beginners with lots of potential for expansion."]},"id":"6e616af5-0770-4c52-a7ce-cecf799b359c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55471","url":"/bachmann-digital-commander-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-19T19:51:39Z","datePublished":"2012-11-19T19:51:39Z","name":"Bachmann Digital Commander","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":66,"verdict":"You will have to make your own scenery but this is a nice way to get into the world of DCC model trains.
