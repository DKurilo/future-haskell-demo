The products available from this company feature different designs for wraps, slings and carriers. The baby carriers are best for an active lifestyle, while the slings and wraps provide a variety of options for carrying your baby during everyday activities.","With The Peanut Shell baby slings, you can start wearing your baby as a newborn, provided she meets the weight requirements. The adjustable baby sling is designed for babies who weigh between 8 and 26 pounds. So if your baby is larger at birth or a little older when you start shopping for a sling, you may want to consider models that can accommodate up to 35 pounds, like the <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">Moby Wrap</a> or the <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">Baby K&#39;Tan BREEZE</a>.","The four standard wearing methods – cradle, kangaroo, tummy to tummy, and hip carry – are all possible with some of these slings, though the suggested carry methods vary based on your baby&#39;s age. Newborns can only be carried in the cradle position, while babies 6 months and older, not to mention their parents, will probably be more comfortable with the hip carry. However, not all baby carriers from this company provide all the carry options. You will want to consider the types of carries each product can perform before making your purchase.","The included safety and instruction manual, which is also available on The Peanut Shell&#39;s website, includes illustrations and step-by-step written instructions for each carry position and initial sizing adjustments. The safety precautions, however, are not illustrated. Visual representations of improper placement can be very helpful.","The products from this company feature different type of fabrics. Some are made out of 97 percent cotton and 3 percent spandex, which has just the right amount of stretch and is machine washable. Other products are made from organic fabric. All the models offer color and pattern options, but the color options vary by product.","If you have any issues or concerns with the product, you can return and exchange your unused baby sling within 30 days of the original purchase. However, sale items are not eligible for returns or exchanges, and gifts may only exchanged."]},"id":"53a5d46f-3a82-47e9-8682-c00b7225ef94","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58775","url":"/the-peanut-shell-adjustable-baby-sling-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-03T23:52:00Z","datePublished":"2014-02-03T23:52:00Z","name":"The Peanut Shell Adjustable Baby Sling","synopsis":"The Peanut Shell provides a handful of baby carriers, including the Peanut Shell Adjustable Baby Sling, for moms and dads on the go.
