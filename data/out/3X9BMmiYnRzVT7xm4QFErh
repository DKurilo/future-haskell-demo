Smart businesses keep up with the trends, adapting their processes and technologies not only to keep up, but to take advantage of the changes in order to make their businesses run more smoothly so they can surge ahead. No area of business is untouched, but here are the five trends that affect how you handle accounting.","<strong>eCommerce and international sales.</strong> It&#39;s no surprise that the internet has let even small, focused businesses transcend national borders. Businesses are finding new markets in places they could never have considered. Size of the business does not matter â€“ 90 percent of eBay businesses sell their products to an average of 30 different countries each. However, new markets, especially foreign markets, bring new challenges for accounting. Fortunately, many accounting programs recognize this trend. The best accounting software integrates with shopping carts or eCommerce platforms, handles multiple currencies and can even calculate the appropriate taxes.","<strong>All-in-one solutions. </strong>In the past, you needed separate programs to handle payroll, inventory, billing and eCommerce sales, with a human having to work between them to get all the pertinent data or download it all into a CMS file to transfer between programs. Now, accounting software is increasingly integrated, either natively supplying all the tools you need or interfacing with other programs that fill the gaps. The interface capability may be built in, or may be possible through an API app.","<strong>Cloud accounting. </strong>Companies are increasingly turning to the cloud to store information and to access programs across multiple platforms and from any location. Many accounting software applications are now cloud-based and not only offer you the ability to log in from any computer, but also to download mobile apps that let you input information, create invoices or collect payments that are recorded directly to your accounting program. If you do business off-site or need to access your records while on the road, cloud-based accounting software can now work with you wherever you are and on whatever device is most convenient.","<strong>Virtual accountants.</strong> It used to be that you had a choice of doing your accounts in-house or working with a local accountant. However, now, it&#39;s possible to outsource your accounting anywhere in the world. <a href=\"/best-billing-and-invoice-software\">Virtual accounting firms</a>  can do more than manage the books. Some offer part-time CFO services and business advisors, while others concentrate on specific industries. Therefore, with a virtual accounting service, you might find you get an accountant more familiar with your company&#39;s needs, and one that can meet your future needs so you don&#39;t need to switch accountants later.","<strong>Online security threats.</strong> With the move to all-in-one solutions, cloud accounting, virtual accounts, and sharing financial information across borders, online security is vital. It&#39;s even more important to consider because hackers are increasingly looking at small businesses as targets, according to a study by the online security company Symantec. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) will <a href=\"https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/pci-ssc-data-security-standard-3-1-guidelines/\">upgrade its standards</a>  to Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 by July 2018. However, the conversion has begun and as more companies upgrade, those that wait become greater targets. Talk with your accounting software service, credit card processors and any other service that handles sensitive information and find out their plans for converting to the new standard.","Small businesses have the advantage of being more flexible, easily able to adapt to new environments. On the flip side, it also means that if they don&#39;t keep up, they risk getting outpaced by larger companies with more resources. Accounting is a vital area for any business, and the trends in general can simplify your bookkeeping chores, so taking advantage of these helps you now and in the long run."]},"id":"de308ac5-2b22-4b28-a936-74488b5d1533","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10213","url":"/accounting-trends","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-27T20:02:59Z","datePublished":"2016-10-27T20:02:59Z","name":"Five Accounting Trends of the Future - Are You Being Passed Up?","synopsis":"As technology improves, it's changing how we do business.","review":{},"strapline":"As technology improves, it's changing how we do business.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-27T21:41:51Z","id":"3X9BMmiYnRzVT7xm4QFErh","meta":{"title":"Five Accounting Trends of the Future - Are You Being Passed Up?","description":"The world of accounting is changing and even if you aren&#039;t an accountant, these changes could affect how you do business.
