Accu-Chek Aviva <a href=\"/best-glucometers\">glucometer</a> line has three models: Connect, Expert and the basic model. The best of these is the Connect because it uses Bluetooth to wirelessly sync your readings to the Accu-Chek data management app. The high-contrast display is easy to read, and the controls make it easy to navigate through all the glucometer&#39;s features. While the test strips are available in almost every brick-and-mortar pharmacy and online store, they are also some of the most expensive.","In my tests, the Accu-Chek Aviva Connect received an A for accuracy because it only produced two readings that were likely inaccurate. To arrive at this score, I tested my blood multiple times a day. During each testing session, I used the same blood sample – drawn from my own fingers – with all 11 meters.","To be sold in the U.S., the FDA requires glucometers be within 15 percent of true glucose 95 percent of the time. However, finding true glucose requires tests in a medical lab. Since that wasn’t feasible, I instead created an accuracy range based on the average of the 11 readings during each testing session. To mimic FDA requirements, I set the acceptable range with the minimum at 15 percent below the average and the maximum at 15 percent above it. Any readings that fell outside this acceptable range were considered outliers that were less likely to be accurate than the others. That said, this test is an anecdotal comparison and certainly not a replacement for the rigorous tests each glucometer must go through before receiving FDA approval.","One of the best things about the Accu-Chek Aviva Connect is how available its test strips are – I found them in every online store and local pharmacy I visited. Because of their wide distribution, you&#39;re never more than a few minutes from a refill, so you can quickly find a store that carries them when you run out. Only the <a href=\"/contour-next-review\">Contour Next</a> test strips were as available as the Aviva strips.","However, the test strips are expensive. In fact, at an average of $1.06 each, these strips are the second most expensive ones on the market – only the <a href=\"/onetouch-verio-iq-review\">OneTouch Verio</a> strips are more expensive. That said, Accu-Chek is one of the first glucometer brands to offer a subscription service. It provides 100 strips per month for $50, which lowers the cost significantly, bringing the price per strip down to the market average of 50 cents. (It&#39;s important to note that this evaluation didn&#39;t take insurance coverage into account. This is based on prices before insurance co-pays.)","The Connect’s main selling point is its Bluetooth, which syncs your readings to the Accu-Chek Connect app. A few years ago, the Connect was one of the few glucometers to feature Bluetooth and an app, but now it&#39;s common, even among meters that cost less than $30. Like other apps, the Connect app helps you manage your diabetes more effectively by making it easier to add notes, and it can help you spot trends in your glucose levels over time with its graphs and charts. The app also makes it easy to share information with your physician so you can get the treatment you need to slow the progression of your symptoms.","The Accu-Chek Aviva Connect is an accurate glucometer with excellent features, including a high-contrast display, an easy-to-use interface and a wireless connection to an app on your smartphone. However, while the test strips are easy to find in stores, they are also some of the most expensive, unless you take advantage of Accu-Chek’s subscription service."]},"id":"9b053565-c472-4cdd-8588-afbf0407de34","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60907","url":"/accu-chek-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:52:08Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:52:08Z","name":"Accu-Chek Aviva Connect","synopsis":"The Accu-Chek Aviva glucometer line has three models: Connect, Expert and the basic model.
