Both medical alert companies were trying to position themselves as the first medical alert services to offer <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-smartwatches\">medical alert smartwatches</a>. MobileHelp beat Medical Guardian to market by several months, but both smartwatches are considerable steps forward. While the Freedom Guardian caters to a broader audience of seniors, the Smart is the more versatile and cost-effective option in the long term.","<strong>Price</strong>","The MobileHelp Smart costs $350 upfront and $25 per month. It&#39;s easy to let the sticker shock of the up-front cost turn you away, especially compared to the Freedom Guardian, which costs just $99 up-front and $45 per month. However, the $25 per month subscription is more affordable than even the most basic landline medical alert systems, which average $30 per month. One advantage over the Freedom Guardian is the $350 up-front fee purchases the watch, so when you cancel the account, you still have a smartwatch you can use. With the other watch, you must return the watch when you cancel.","Be that as it may, the <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-smartwatchesapple-review/\">Apple Watch 4</a> is the most affordable option, even at a price point of $400. Since there is no subscription, the long-term costs don&#39;t add-up. For example, it only takes the Smart two months for it to become more expensive than the Apple Watch 4. And it only takes about 13 months for the Freedom Guardian to become the more expensive option. Medical alert systems aren’t meant to be short-term devices, so the Apple Watch 4 is worth considering if your loved one uses an iPhone.","<strong>Medical Alert Performance</strong>","The Smart&#39;s biggest downside is the learning curve. The interface is more complex than the <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-smartwatchesmedical-guardian-review/\">Freedom Guardian</a>, in part because there are a lot more features, like heart monitoring and fitness tracking. But the text is also smaller, as are the buttons. Overall, while it&#39;s undoubtedly a powerful smartwatch, it&#39;s probably not the best option if your senior loved one doesn&#39;t already use a smartphone. If they&#39;re comfortable with a smartphone, then it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. It really depends on the person. My 92-year old grandmother uses a smartphone, but I know people in their late 50&#39;s who still use flip-phones.","One of the best reasons to get a medical alert smartwatch is the speaker quality. The Smart&#39;s speaker is very good. The audio from emergency responders comes out clear and loud. The quality rivals the best mobile alert systems I&#39;ve tested, which is surprising considering the diminutive size of the speaker. But it&#39;s a critical feature for helping your loved one better communicate with emergency operators.","Another great feature of the Smart is the style. Since the phone is made by Samsung, it looks exactly like the latest Samsung Galaxy smartwatches. It has a large round watch-face with a diver&#39;s bevel, which doubles as a wheel-like control to navigate the many pages within the interface. To put it simply, this doesn&#39;t look like a medical alert device. Unfortunately, many seniors resist wearing medical alert devices because of the stigma of wearing something that seemingly advertises that they&#39;re old and may need help. It&#39;s such a common issue, these companies and senior care publications have articles devoted to helping convince your loved one to wear one. With this kind of discreet style, the stigma is gone. It&#39;s just a stylish watch that can call for help.","<strong>Functional Value</strong>","The most exciting part of a medical alert smartwatch is the functional value. Most medical alert systems do nothing more than call for help. You don&#39;t see the value of it until you need to use the safety-net. But with smartwatches, you get more. For example, the Smart has heart monitoring and an extensive fitness tracker app. It helps you stay motivated to exercise, to monitor your health and to maintain your fitness – all critical for helping your loved one to potentially live longer with greater independence and a higher quality of life. It&#39;s a functional value they can use and see every day, making the cost feel much more valuable in comparison to traditional medical alert systems.","That said, the heart monitor on the Smart was not as effective as I would like. It certainly didn&#39;t compare to the Apple Watch 4. Most of the time, it failed to measure my heart rate. And when it was successful, it wasn&#39;t very accurate. I suspect it was an issue with the specific watch I tested, as it wasn&#39;t reflective of user-reviews of <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-smartwatchessamsung-review/\">Samsung smartwatches</a>, and it&#39;s possible I was using it incorrectly. However, unlike the Apple Watch 4, it doesn’t have an ECG sensor to measure the hearts actual electrical patterns. It also doesn&#39;t have alerts for times when the heart rate is dangerously low or high.","The MobileHelp Smart is an impressively versatile medical alert smartwatch with an excellent speaker, fitness tracking capabilities and a heart monitor. It&#39;s more complicated to use than the Freedom Guardian, but more powerful in terms of additional features. If your elderly loved one is comfortable using a smartphone, the Smart is an excellent option."]},"id":"e5bc9f2f-838f-402f-b5a0-2dd327368a27","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70315","url":"/mobilehelp-smart-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-26T12:35:02Z","datePublished":"2018-10-26T12:35:02Z","name":"MobileHelp Smart","synopsis":"The MobileHelp Smart was announced at the same 2018 CES as the Medical Guardian Freedom Guardian.
