You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LG LMHM2017SW is an <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">over-the-range microwave</a> with ample power and convenient features. Although it does not have convection cooking, it does offer sensor cooking and an impressive ventilation system, all wrapped up in a very attractive design.","Instead of you having to stop the microwave and guess how much more time your food needs, sensors automatically do that for you on this LG model. By detecting the amount of moisture in your food, the sensors determine how much more time your food needs to reach the ideal temperature. The options include baked potatoes, vegetables, casseroles, rice and frozen entrees.","The multi-stage cooking cycles are useful if you have dishes that require different power levels throughout the cooking process. You can program two regular cycles, or three cycles if the first one is defrost. This microwave offers 10 different power levels and runs at 1,100 watts, which are characteristics of the best microwave ovens.","This over-the-stove microwave has a standard-sized exterior, so it fits in most kitchens. At 2 cubic feet, the interior is larger than many over-range microwaves, and the one included cooking rack essentially doubles your cooking surface. If you use a large dish, you can turn off the turntable to avoid straining it.","The warm hold keeps your food at the right temperature even if you aren&#39;t ready to eat right at the sound of the &#34;ding.&#34; And if you don&#39;t like that sound, you can shut off the end-of-cycle signal. The child lock comes in handy if you want to avoid unapproved use and burn risks for little ones, or if you simply want to wipe the keypad clean without pressing a bunch of buttons.","The ventilation system stands out because of the slide-out vent. The vent slides out and extends over your range, covering more of your stovetop. The fan itself has a high capacity and runs at three different speeds. If it gets too hot or smoky on your range, the fan automatically starts venting to move polluted air to the outside of your home. If your kitchen isn&#39;t designed for exterior venting, the fan can still filter and recirculate the air in your kitchen.","The LG LMHM2017SW has a modern design with three color options – black, white and stainless steel – and the keypad is located at the bottom. The keypad is flat, which makes cleaning easy.","This over-the-range microwave has the standard one-year warranty on parts and labor and a 10-year warranty on the magnetron, the main component in your microwave. The magnetron&#39;s warranty is quite long for the industry, and it speaks volumes to the confidence the manufacturer has in its product.","The website looks good and is easy to navigate. LG offers live chat, which is an excellent resource if you run into difficulties. You also get phone and email support."]},"id":"091477d2-b470-4fad-9e90-0011b245793f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6b4efb42-1124-4817-9f55-3b1e345be89e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG LMHM2017SW is an over-the-range microwave with noteworthy features.
