Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You can do more than just print with the Dell 2155cn. This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> offers multifunctional tools that help you get the job done with high quality and strong performance. This printing device features several standout features such as a large paper tray, adequate printing speeds and 256MB of installed memory. However, there are a few drawbacks to this printing device, such as no automatic duplex features and its large and hefty design.","The Dell 2155cn features a maximum print resolution of 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch). This isn’t the highest resolution we have seen on a laser printer, particularly multifunctional printers, but it still produces clear and bright images with excellent color quality. There is a 40,000-page monthly duty cycle available on this laser printer. This means you can print up to 40,000 pages each month without causing any serious wear and tear or damage to the printer.","The printing speeds available on this laser printer are nothing extraordinary, but they are what you would expect to find on a basic printer. This device prints black-and-white and color images at a speed of 24 pages per minute. Unfortunately, there is no automatic duplex feature available on the Dell 2155cn. This feature would allow you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper without manually turning the paper over.","There are several features available that enhance the Dell 2155cn’s overall performance. There are several connectivity and networking options available with this printer, such as an Ethernet port for networking several computers to the printer. There are no built-in wireless printing capabilities, but a wireless port is located on the device for an optional dongle – or external device. In addition, it has a USB 2.0 port for direct printing from a flash drive or camera.","A 250-page paper tray is available on this laser printer. Storing this large amount of paper will eliminate the hassle of restocking your paper tray on too frequent a basis. The 2155cn can print on a variety of paper types, including normal, thick or coated paper, labels, postcards and envelopes. It will print on paper as large as 8.5 x 14 inches. This laser printer offers 256MB of installed memory, but it is not an ENERGY STAR qualified device.","The Dell 2155cn is a large and heavy laser printer. This device will take up an abundant amount of space on a desk or table. It is 17.1 inches wide, 22.81 inches tall and 21 inches thick. These are some of the largest dimensions we have seen on any laser printer. In addition, it weighs 66 pounds, making it not only large but also heavy.","The control pad is located on the top of the device. The control pad features a small display screen to assist you as you navigate through the device’s features and settings. There are several buttons on the device, but unfortunately, its large display pad makes the interface confusing and hard to use."]},"id":"773f21f3-cf4e-4029-8632-4566d367ea24","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5205d4bd-5145-4a8e-a2fa-295b89f2a1d0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dell 2155cn is a laser printer that has a lot to offer.
