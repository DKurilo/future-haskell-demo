It is one of the most basic, low-cost running headlamps available. The streamlined form makes it easy to get on and off, and the lack of oversized components keeps this <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-running-headlamps\">running headlight</a> from being too bulky for comfort. While this model isn&#39;t designed for heavy use, it is a great alternative for casual or beginning runners who are starting to experiment with exercising at night.","Because it is a basic model, the Energizer Micro Sport LED Headlight isn&#39;t as powerful as many other running headlamps. The three LED lights provide 37 lumens of illumination, enough to brighten up your immediate area with a diffuse glow. The beam reaches about 8 meters, giving you room to maneuver around road hazards when you&#39;re running, walking or jogging at a slow or moderate pace. However, if you are achieving higher speeds or tackling challenging, rugged terrain, a brighter light would serve you better.","This running headlamp has only two power settings, high and low, so you can&#39;t dim the light or make fine adjustments. Because the light is fixed in place, you can&#39;t tilt it to adjust where the beam is aimed, which can be frustrating when you&#39;re running quickly because you have to move your whole head to point the light in a particular direction. A separate removable red light on the back flashes to keep you visible while you&#39;re running late at night.","This running headlamp uses three AAA batteries, so replacements are easy. At high power, the light lasts about 3.5 hours, or you can switch to low power and get 18 lumens of light for about 9 hours.","Because the adjustable headband is stretchy, it fits snugly and won&#39;t come off during a run. However, there is no padding to make this running headlight more comfortable, so it can chafe or rub if you are wearing it for long periods of time without a hat to act as a cushion between the elastic and your head. The Energizer Micro Sport LED Headlight is weather rated at IPX-4, so it can handle light rain and occasional splashes.","As a starter running headlamp, the Energizer Micro Sport LED Headlight is a good choice. It is bright enough to light your path if you&#39;re running at a moderate pace, and the battery will last through a decent run. However, the diffuse beam and lack of customization options can be frustrating for a more experienced runner."]},"id":"f1d57fd6-1b71-4131-9cc4-8266e57ea441","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62537","url":"/energizer-micro-sport-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:42:57Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:42:57Z","name":"Energizer Micro Sport LED","synopsis":"The Energizer Micro Sport LED Headlight delivers basic, no-frills illumination to make your night runs easier.
