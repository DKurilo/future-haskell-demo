Some of those uncommon features include a temperature sensor and an SD card slot, enabling you to record video of your child for your personal files or to post on Facebook, Twitter or other social media sites.","Another feature you don&#39;t often see is Skype and MSN connection capability. If you travel a lot or spend time away from your baby, this is a nice option, allowing you to have live face-to-face interaction with your baby long distance. There is also a remote-activated nightlight and a camera that supports both rechargeable and regular AA batteries.

A nice, though somewhat common, feature is that the unit is expandable for up to four cameras, which will help your monitoring capacity to grow along with your family. This unit also delivers lullabies with a sound system that is soothing not tinny, therefore actually having the desired effect of helping your baby to sleep.","The other product in the Samsung SEW-302 series, the SEW-3022, shares all the same features except that the 3022 lacks the Skype and MSN capability.","You can contact the company by phone or an online contact form if you have any questions or issues.

The one-year warranty is fair and will come in handy if you have a serious problem, like the need to replace a defective monitor."]},"id":"70df8e4d-8981-4ab5-b660-c8656ea9be49","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6201e16b-7643-439a-a4b4-83782cb3467f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SEW 3020 is a good device if you&#39;re looking for something a little different, but also with the standard features you expect to find on a baby video monitor.
