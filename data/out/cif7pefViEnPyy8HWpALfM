As such, Top Ten Reviews will no longer update the information for the 610 model.

As we tested it, it never snagged on any foods or struggled to process them, and it produced consistently even slices, whether thick or thin. It&#39;s simple to remove the components after use for cleaning. With its bevy of protective features, it&#39;s also one of the safest slicers to use."]},"id":"e2690aba-3b7d-4465-bc67-6342e546a789","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"843b89e2-229c-42c8-b6a0-6b769f916a96","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This consumer-grade meat slicer is our top performer of those we tested. It easily cut through meats, cheese, vegetables and artisan bread, producing even and appealing slices, both thick and thin. It has a 100-watt gear-driven motor, and even though the industry recommends a motor of at least 130 watts in order to produce quality slices, this motor and blade surpassed all of the higher-powered slicers in our lineup. It smoothly tackles all food types with no strain on the motor or blade. Additionally, the blade and other components are a cinch to disassemble for cleaning, taking only about a second to take apart or reassemble."]},"id":"114c5908-6a99-43af-955d-31f6f6e4098d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/3nF47dHpQTs2ZHXq77gowH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/59383-chef-s-choice6.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3nF47dHpQTs2ZHXq77gowH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"3nF47dHpQTs2ZHXq77gowH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3nF47dHpQTs2ZHXq77gowH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"19f86f80-9688-4b65-9246-38960046b48d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The included blade has a 7-inch diameter and is made of stainless steel. It has serrated edges, making it ideal for tough meats, cheese, bread and most anything else. However, serrated blades can be tougher to sharpen than those with smooth edges. You can adjust the thickness of each slice while the blade is running or even if it is in the off position. You can gauge the thickness by sight, or you can rely on the easy-to-move numeric adjustment knob behind the carriage area. You simply have to move the knob to a small number for a thin slice or a larger number for a thick slice. We found that the thickness options extend well beyond what most people will need, but it is nice to have the option for a thicker slice.","The Chef&#39;s Choice 610 is compact compared to the other units in our lineup. It measures 15 x 10.5 x 10.8 inches and weighs 10.2 pounds. It is light enough to move and lift easily, but it also feels plenty stable. The body is made of cast aluminum and stainless steel, and it feels well-made and looks like it belongs in a professional kitchen.","This meat slicer works quite well, but if you want a high-performing model with a lower price tag, try the <a href=\"/maxi-matic-review\">Maxi-Matic EMT-503B Elite</a>."]},"id":"0641d535-5f15-47c2-b6ed-dee1c615a3bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Safety"},"id":"487565cc-30d2-4a60-b059-fdf0c7af13b0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This food slicer felt safe to use during testing, and it has a solid construction and quality parts that make it durable and reliable.

While running, the motor puts out 64 dB of sound, which is average for the units in our lineup.","It comes with a plastic hand guard and food pusher, which is the barrier between your hand and the sharp blade.
