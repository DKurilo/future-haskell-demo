The entire interface is a single screen that contains all the software&#39;s copy and customization tools. When you launch the software, it provides simple instructions on how to load a disc and begin the copying process. Once it begins, you should have a new copy of your movie in about 40 minutes.","This DVD copier comes with an integrated CSS decrypter. You&#39;ll never see this tool, because it&#39;s automatic. It is nevertheless an important feature, because it allows you to bypass copy encryptions found on almost all commercial discs. These protections are meant to be a bulwark against illegal piracy. The decrypter in this program allows you to make personal copies of the DVDs you already own.","Making new physical discs is only one aspect of this DVD copy software. It also allows you save a disc&#39;s ISO file to your hard drive. An ISO file is the blueprint of a DVD and acts as a virtual disc that you can watch on your computer&#39;s DVD player software.  Storing an ISO file also enables you to burn new copies of your DVD whenever you wish without needing the physical disc.","Another backup feature in this DVD burner is the ability to extract the raw files and folders found on a disc. This is known as a Video_TS folder, and unlike an ISO file, it gives you access to the raw video and audio files found on a DVD. Once this is on your computer, you can use other applications to convert your movies for playback on devices other than a computer or DVD player. And as with the ISO file, you can use the Video_TS folder to burn new copies of a DVD without needing the original disc as a source."]},"id":"133d0934-ea4b-4e55-9274-972798a4d0c7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output"},"id":"de4e8d89-11dc-4a1b-a983-69e382836bd0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This program can make both identical and compressed copies of your DVDs.

Some of the other products on our lineup have the ability to convert your DVD movies into video files that you can sync to smartphones, tablets and gaming systems.
