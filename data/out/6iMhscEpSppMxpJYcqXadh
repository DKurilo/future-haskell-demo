Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","The Type A Series 1 3D printer is an excellent choice for printing large-scale 3D models. With a lengthy warranty, high-quality resolution and Wi-Fi connectivity, the Series 1 is easy to use for any 3D printing project.","With such a large print capacity, you can print almost anything with this 3D printer. A 12 x 12 x 12 inch print size is much larger than any of the other 3D printers we reviewed. Not only is it one of the largest, but it is also one of the fastest. This printer can handle 50 to 250 mm/s print speeds. Print resolution is also superior to many printers and ranges from 0.05 to 0.25 mm, which is thinner than a sheet of paper.","This one-head printer can print 1.75 mm PLA filament in any color. Filament is available from the 3D printer manufacturer, but you can also use any universal cartridge. PLA plastic is compatible with the printer, but you need to upgrade to a heated print plate for ABS printing. The manufacturer also doesnâ€™t provide ABS filament for purchase on its website.","This aluminum and acrylic 3D plastic printer is easy to set up and use. Since it only weighs 30 pounds, the machine is easy to lift and move. One missing feature is an LCD screen. Many 3D printers have an on-board navigation and control system so you can print, maneuver and calibrate from the printer itself without a connected computer. With the Series 1, however, instead of a screen, you go to a designated URL with a Wi-Fi based control panel for all of these features. Once you&#39;re connected though, the controls and interface are easy to use.","The Type A Series 1 is one of only a handful of 3D printers with Wi-Fi printing. Although we couldn&#39;t get the Series 1 to connect to our office Wi-Fi, plugging in an Ethernet cable was just as effective. From the interface you can control all aspects of the printer, including positioning, temperature and pausing prints. Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems are all compatible, so you can run the software from any of your home or office computers.","From the website, you can download all necessary software. To modify, slice and save files, the provided Cura software is one of the best for 3D printing. Also included with your Series 1 is a power supply cord, maintenance tools and an Ethernet cable. Since only a small starter filament roll is included with the printer, you can only print one small item before you run out.","Many of the machines in our 3D printer comparison offer short-term warranties, but the Series 1 has a full one-year warranty to cover any defects. If you need help setting up or using your printer, the support page has tons of helpful information and resources. We found the video tutorials helpful during setup, the forum threads for troubleshooting and the FAQs for everything else."]},"id":"0bff52a9-c3d7-4940-ad4c-76f32d1b4f1b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"48ffee0f-4a4b-4973-b3db-a2868a0591bf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although the Series 1 doesn&#39;t have an LCD screen, it&#39;s still fairly easy to control from the web interface.
