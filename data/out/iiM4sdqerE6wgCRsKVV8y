The 18-35mm focal length makes this lens ideal for shooting landscapes, portraits, still life and close-ups. This lens can receive firmware updates and is customizable via a USB dock connected to your computer.","The minimum focal length of 18mm puts this lens in the range of wide-angle <a href=\"http://dslr-camera-lenses-review.toptenreviews.com/\">DSLR lenses</a>. However, it is constructed with Special Low Dispersion glass to compensate for aberrations and curvature when shooting with such a low focal length. This means you can shoot wide landscapes or capture large areas within a confined space without worrying about a fisheye-like effect.","With a large aperture of F/1.8, the Sigma 18-35mm F/1.8 DC HSM can help you capture unique shots with blur effects in the foreground and background. The pairing of such a large aperture and the wide-angle focal length gives this APS-C camera nearly the same capability of a full-frame camera of similar parameters. Shooting wide-angles in low light shouldn’t be a problem.","Sigma’s Hyper Sonic Motor allows for ultra-quick and silent autofocusing. The focus ring also has an instant manual override, so you can find the perfect focus without ever hitting a switch.","If you want to customize your shots further, this lens is compatible with Sigma’s USB dock (sold separately). Using Sigma Optimization Pro software, you can customize 16 different focus settings, including focal length and shooting distance. You can also download new firmware to keep your lens up to date with the latest fixes and improvements from the manufacturer.","Sigma manufactures this APS-C lens for its cameras as well as Nikon, Canon, Sony and Pentax cameras. Depending on the camera manufacturer, The lens will not work with most full-frame cameras, but there are a few exceptions depending on the camera manufacturer. If you’re considering this lens for your full-frame camera, check with the manufacturer (or your user manual) to make sure your camera scales down to work with APS-C lenses.","The Sigma 18-35mm F/1.8 DC HSM represents a step above most kit lenses, especially if you’re looking to shoot wider angles with lower light sources. The large aperture means most of the time you can leave the flash off."]},"id":"9642bcc3-e072-413e-9bc0-fc3a7fb6d381","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68110","url":"/sigma-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-07-18T16:47:14Z","datePublished":"2016-07-18T16:47:14Z","name":"Sigma 18-35mm F/1.8 DC HSM Lens","synopsis":"The Sigma 18-35mm F/1.8 DC HSM is a DSLR lens that touts a large aperture for fast exposure for shooting with a shallow depth of field and clarity.
