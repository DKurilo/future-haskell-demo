The print plate is solid glass, heated, and very easy to slide out and remove. We printed with painter’s tape and glue stick during our testing, but you can print without them too. The Ultimaker 3 also comes standard with two extruders on the same print head. One is primarily used for support material, while the other is used for finished-product materials such as PLA or ABS. If you need a larger print capacity, the Ultimaker 3 Extended version has almost 3 extra inches of height."]},"id":"669fb1a9-9757-472e-b211-63025eab6e9d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"24abc6b0-8cdc-4204-b912-6cc6036e4f3c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ultimaker 3 comes with a 12-month warranty, which is standard for the best home 3D printers.
