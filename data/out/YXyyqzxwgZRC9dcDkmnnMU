These grilling machines come in many forms and are the best at draining fat, but the top indoor electric grill from the Foreman line is the GRP99. This model comes with a digital display, dishwasher-safe components and a temperature selector that allows you to program it to exact temperatures.","During our test, this indoor grill produced average-tasting hamburgers in 8 minutes and 48 seconds, which was a typical speed for the grills we tested. However, when we cooked chicken in this George Foreman model, it didn&#39;t fare as well as the beef. The chicken tenders we placed in this grill came out rubbery and reminded us of old cafeteria food. Chances are good that the powerful grill drained the chicken of the essential fats and juices that make chicken tenders so tender.","The manual suggests that most food cooks in under 10 minutes on this grill. While the ribbed plates on this device give you even grill marks for burgers, sandwiches or veggies, you won&#39;t be able to use it as a griddle for things like eggs or pancakes.","You can generally expect indoor electric grills to produce some amount of grease spatter, especially if they are clamshell design like the <a href=\"/hamilton-beach-review\">Hamilton Beach 25335</a>. However, this George Foreman model didn&#39;t produce any greasy mess during our testing. In addition, both of the included drip trays and other components are dishwasher safe. It took under four minutes to clean this grill and the area around it after cooking – not bad considering other models took almost 10 minutes to tidy up.","This George Forman model takes under a minute and a half to assemble, which is certainly not true of outdoor grills – and unlike those models, you don&#39;t have to fuss with the propane or charcoal they need to work. With this grill, you may have issues with some blinking and beeping on the display at first, but once you&#39;ve mastered it, the display can help you choose an exact target temperature. This indoor grill also is equipped with a digital timer.","The cooking area measures about 108 square inches, enough to fit six small burgers or three large steaks. The raised surface allows grease and oil to drip down into the collecting tray, and the covered clamshell design keeps spatter and mess off your counter. The manufacturer claims this Foreman model can remove up to 42 percent of fat while cooking.","Despite the few drawbacks, this is a great grill to consider if you plan to use it often, want speedy meals and want to reduce the amount of fat in your diet. The GRP99 has a three-year warranty, which is excellent in the grill industry. If you have questions about this model or lose the original paperwork, you can find the manual online. If you encounter any difficulties, you also can contact company representatives via phone or email for answers."]},"id":"fffe719e-bc69-438d-9cbb-e46a4fa55c77","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59468","url":"/george-foreman-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-08T00:17:44Z","datePublished":"2014-05-08T00:17:44Z","name":"George Foreman GRP99","synopsis":"Two decades after heavyweight champion George Foreman's retirement from boxing, his indoor electric grills have kept him a household name.
