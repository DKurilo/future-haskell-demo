It was moderately easy to use and created ok curls that didn&#39;t hold up all that well over time, but for its low price, it still represents a good value. This is probably not the last curling iron you’ll ever buy, but it works well enough when you can&#39;t afford the best of the best. Also, if you only curl your hair occasionally and don’t need the very best, this Revlon model will suffice.","If there are small children in your home, this curling iron is probably not the best option. The automatic shut-off seemed rather hit and miss when we tested it. Sometimes it turned itself off and sometimes we found it still on, even many hours later. This creates a safety hazard – someone could burn themselves on the still-hot barrel, or a bit of fabric or paper could make contact with the barrel and cause a fire. A safer curling iron and one that performed better in our curling tests is the <a href=\"http://staging.toptenreviews.com/john-frieda-review?status=InProgress\">John Frieda</a>. ","This hair curler has a dial rather than a digital display, which is disappointing, though not surprising, at this low price point. The dial was easier to read than its competitors’, but it lists levels instead of temperature, so there is no way of knowing exactly how hot the iron is. This matters less if you have thick hair, but for the fine-haired folks, it is nice to know the temperature so they don’t burn their hair.","The barrel has a ceramic coating, which is preferred by most experts because it protects against heat damage. Also, the temperature difference between the highest and lowest heat settings is pretty drastic, so you can find a good setting whether you need high heat to curl thick hair in a hurry or a cooler temp for fine hair."]},"id":"a28c8aa0-39ca-4db5-8955-149d69f5a13b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"27ae9c24-3fc0-4f76-bec6-511be5efdbef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Revlon Perfect Heat Long Lasting Curls is a pretty average curling iron in most ways, but that is actually impressive considering its low price. It is competitive with some of the best curling irons, even though it’s flawed in many ways.
