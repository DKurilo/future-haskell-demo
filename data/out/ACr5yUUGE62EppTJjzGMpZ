It comes pre-painted, though it will take around an hour to piece together. It was designed for simple everyday flight, which means it won’t take a great deal of work to repair or maintain. It comes with pre-applied decals as well. The servos, EDF and ESC are all pre-installed, which leaves little more to do.","This remote control plane is hand launched and has no landing gear, which means it lands on its belly. The bottom of the plane is equipped with plastic covers, which protects against hard landings. The wings, which are the more important part of the plane body, are made of reinforced carbon fiber, as is the magnetic canopy hatch, which offers not only improved strength, but also easy access to the battery.","The device works best with a 3S 1600-2200mAh li-po battery to run the ducted fan included within. The ducted fan allows for air cooling, which is an important part of improving the quality of the metal gear servos and prolonging their life. The servos themselves are protected by covers, which means more longstanding performance.<br/>The main downside to this remote control plane is that it doesn’t come with a receiver. While a costly addition, it is probably for the best that you purchase a receiver separately to find something better suited to your needs."]},"id":"c44715d0-ee7e-4c9b-a9be-f9be7a95e59e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/M7iGE9iqsxz6LiZ5VzTHC8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Stinger 64 EDF handles quite well despite its low-profile appearance.
