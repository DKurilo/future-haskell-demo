The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews about <a href=\"/best-dehumidifiers\">Dehumidifiers</a> here.</em>","Aside from the discomfort of icky, sticky air, having excessive amounts of moisture in your home can be bad for your draperies, bedding, carpeting, clothing, and more. Even worse, it can pose health hazards to you and your loved ones&#39; health due to the possible development of mold, bacteria and viruses. With that in mind, a solid and good-quality dehumidifier can be the answer if you live in a moist climate and want a healthier and nicer home.","The Danby DDR50B3WP dehumidifier can be just the answer you are seeking. It extracts 50 pints of water from the air over a 24-hour period. What&#39;s more, it can handle dehumidifying an area of up to 3,000 square feet, which is the second-largest square footage of all the products we reviewed.","The two-fan Danby dehumidifier also operates quietly at 50 decibels, the lowest decibel level of the dehumidifiers we reviewed. This decibel level is equivalent to the sound of the average refrigerator when it&#39;s operating. This unit could work nicely as a basement dehumidifier or one that you use in a garage, storage area or workshop since it can handle temperatures as low as 41 degrees Fahrenheit.","It&#39;s also an easy-to-use dehumidifier with plenty of automatic features. You can adjust it to handle different humidity levels, and the auto restart keeps the device working to tightly control humidity levels in your home. You get an auto shut-off feature that stops this dehumidifier from operating when the room reaches the desired humidity level.","Since it comes with an auto defrost feature, that means you can use the Danby DDR50B3WP in cool areas and this function will turn on if any ice starts building up on the machine&#39;s coils.","The dehumidifier also presents a full-bucket alert so you know when to empty it, a digital display for the various controls, and a removable air filter that you can easily clean either by vacuuming away accumulated dirt or gently washing it with soap and water.","Unfortunately, you do not get a visible water-level window on this appliance nor does it come with its own drain pump. However, you can release water through a continuous drainage approach by attaching a hose to the back of this dehumidifier, which allows water to be released into a nearby floor drain.","Danby offers a generous two-year warranty covering parts and labor, but you do not get special coverage for the sealed system.","Like most dehumidifiers, this is a chunky machine, weighing in at 42.5 pounds. It stands 24.3 inches high, is 16.1 inches wide and has a depth of 11.8 inches. Still, it is portable since it comes with caster wheels that let you move it from one room to the next. In the large area in which it regulates humidity, the Danby humidifier is quite energy efficient since it operates using 515 watts of electricity. That is the lowest electrical usage of any of the products we reviewed, and it will mean lower energy bills for you."]},"id":"3efbb6b1-767f-414f-98d9-1bd47ce44cc8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f6182f3d-f609-4c1a-a50c-6f517e13b41a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This energy efficient and economical dehumidifier is easy to use since it presents so many automatic features and capabilities.
