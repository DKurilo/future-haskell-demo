This is a great service for HBO enthusiasts who want to access their favorite HBO shows on the go from their iPad, iPhone or Android device. It’s also available on internet TV-friendly devices like Roku and Xbox.","Unfortunately, at this point it is only available to HBO subscribers. This, of course, means that the only way to access this app is if you have cable and subscribe to HBO. So, while it is free for that audience, it comes at a price. The other limitation to this app, when compared to other streaming apps on the market, is that it is HBO-specific. You won’t have access to a wealth of classic movies or classic TV shows such as “The Twilight Zone” and “Doctor Who.” Plus, you won’t be able to watch network or cable shows like “The Walking Dead.” To access that kind of content you’ll need apps such as Netflix and Hulu Plus.","With that said, HBO is an entertainment universe unto itself, with original hit TV shows, movies, sports, documentaries, comedy and kids&#39; shows. And while you have full access to all of HBO’s original content, you will only have a limited selection of movies that have aired on HBO. To watch a show from your device, you simply tap on the screen and it will start.","You will, however, have the ability to access episodes from any original HBO series past or present. You also have access to exclusive interviews and other supplementary materials linked to specific episodes of your favorite shows. You can easily set up personalized Watchlists and have new episodes of your favorite shows sent automatically to your list. There are also Facebook and Twitter links that let you interact with friends to discuss shows you are watching together. If you have questions or need help with the app, there are tutorials online, as well as email support and answers to FAQs."]},"id":"9695459a-2ee2-408c-ab22-6cbaa9c4af17","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ed40ba67-0c1f-4f9e-be30-c4b2273e9358","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["HBO GO is a streaming app that is free to HBO subscribers and specifically targets that audience.
