Most recently, our comparison included eight programs and took over 35 hours to complete. We looked for a range of software including clothing-pattern, knitting, embroidery, crochet and filet-crochet programs. The software we chose focused in a few of these areas, but no one piece of software covers everything. We wanted a collection of programs that would be useful both to the established pattern makers and beginners alike. While we did not test these programs ourselves, we did look to user reviews and user ratings to determine which programs offered the best features and customer support. We attempted to keep our evaluation fair by looking for common features and comparing the programs against each other.","<strong>How We Evaluated </strong>","In order to evaluate the best programs on the market, we chose software that had positive user ratings. Once we had compiled a list of eight programs, we took time to list each software&#39;s features and tools to see which ones offered the most creative freedoms within the best user interfaces. We noted programs that offered convenience features, since this increased a program&#39;s ease of use. For instance, clothing-pattern programs that offered yardage calculators scored higher than programs that didn&#39;t offer this feature.","The organization and layout of each program also went into our usability rating. Programs that are easily navigable and intuitive scored higher than clunky, cluttered programs. Since designing is all about using creativity, software that allows you to start from scratch or make adjustments to existing pieces scored higher than programs that offer little creative freedom. Pricing wasn&#39;t taken into account when we compared programs, but we did note whether or not a program was on the expensive or inexpensive side.","We also looked at each company’s support features. Any that offered FAQs pages and user forums scored higher than those that did not offer anything. We also noted whether or not you could contact customer support and gave more points to programs that offered various contact methods.","<strong>Important Things to Consider When Choosing an Embroidery Software </strong>","Type of Patterns<br/>When it comes to embroidery software, programs can vary depending on what kind of fibers they are meant to design for. Some programs simply allow you to create or alter pre-existing patterns for clothes. Others feature a range of charting symbols for crochet, weaving, embroidery, knitting and filet crochet. While some programs offer a range of tools, others work best for one specific project type, so look into the features and reviews before purchasing.","Price<br/>How much you pay for a pattern making program depends a lot on the types of patterns it can make. Generally, embroidery software is the most expensive, with prices reaching up to thousands of dollars. This is especially the case if you purchase software for an industrial embroidery machine. However, most consumer embroidery machines come with software or a limited number of pre-programmed designs. Before investing in software, make sure whatever program you choose is compatible with your machine.","Dressmaking pattern software, used to make sewing patterns, tends to be less expensive, though still somewhat on the high end of the spectrum, costing hundreds of dollars. Knitting and crocheting software tends to be the least expensive, usually costing just $40 to $70.","We reviewed pattern making software ranging in price from under $25 to nearly $2,500. Before investing in pattern making software, make sure whichever program you choose is compatible with your needs and your machine.","Support<br/>Technical support for these kinds of programs can often be on the skimpy side. Some programs offer little support at all while others provide multiple means for contacting customer service, FAQs pages, online tutorials and even user forums. If you want assistance from other users, choose a program that offers a community forum since this gives you the opportunity to learn from experienced pattern makers."]},"id":"cfdf678f-64d7-4c9d-aac6-3df6aeecc10a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_161","url":"/best-embroidery-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-29T22:32:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-29T22:32:00Z","name":"Best Embroidery Software of 2019","synopsis":"Here is a roundup of embroidery software that allows you to design and make your own patterns, use guided templates and plan your stitching.","review":{},"strapline":"Here is a roundup of embroidery software that allows you to design and make your own patterns, use guided templates and plan your stitching.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-15T16:54:50Z","id":"oZb4GjrmXrFRo893HcA4rS","meta":{"title":"Best Embroidery Software 2019 - Design, Plan and Create Knitting Patterns","description":"Here is a roundup of embroidery software that allows you to design and make your own patterns, use guided templates and plan your stitching."},"products":[{"slug":"knitbird","url":"/product/knitbird","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","name":"KnitBird","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"Nq3NKvbuawrHAQM9BbXP3n","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"intwined-pattern-studio","url":"/product/intwined-pattern-studio","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","name":"Intwined Pattern Studio","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"cKPAaGF2W36SFYrvo7q2mh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"dress-shop-quick-start","url":"/product/dress-shop-quick-start","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","name":"Dress Shop Quick Start","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"5iCWvHPQwegB5D6mQwACfj","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"filet-crochet-v14-2","url":"/product/filet-crochet-v14-2","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","name":"Filet Crochet v14.2","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"WMAT4kBtUQdN2PXLKiEc5f","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"bernina-editorplus","url":"/product/bernina-editorplus","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","name":"Bernina EditorPlus","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"upt3NhmMCsCs4yxfepqRbZ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:09:49Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/9GsK2cTqiLaZxuLEbH4BHT.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Embroidery-Software-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/4/W/789440/original/Hero-Embroidery-Software-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"9GsK2cTqiLaZxuLEbH4BHT","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GsK2cTqiLaZxuLEbH4BHT.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Embroidery Software of 2019","description":"Here is a roundup of embroidery software that allows you to design and make your own patterns, use guided templates and plan your stitching."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/9GsK2cTqiLaZxuLEbH4BHT.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Embroidery-Software-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/4/W/789440/original/Hero-Embroidery-Software-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"9GsK2cTqiLaZxuLEbH4BHT","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GsK2cTqiLaZxuLEbH4BHT.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Embroidery Software of 2019","description":"Here is a roundup of embroidery software that allows you to design and make your own patterns, use guided templates and plan your stitching."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"crafts","url":"/hobbies/crafts","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","name":"Crafts","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:48Z","id":"TEqWQPbJNty8BgQqF8w88Z","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
