Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Coolway is an American hair care company that specializes in creating customizable conditioners and shampoos specific to your hair&#39;s needs. Because of this customization, its hair dryers often come with products to help your hair stay healthy while blow drying.  The <a href=\"/best-hair-dryers\">hair blow dryer</a> we ordered came with True Smooth Straight – a hair care aid that protects hair and speeds up drying time.","The Coolway Go Pro ranked well with our testers who said that despite being heavy and loud, it had a strong focused flow and dried hair quickly. Some of our testers mentioned that the nozzle was rather long, which made their arms grow tired faster since they had to hold the hair blow dryer farther from and higher above their heads. Testers also said that the True Smooth Straight drying spray that came with the blow dryer had a pleasant smell, sped up the drying process and made their hair feel smooth when dry.","The highest heat setting reaches 148 degrees Fahrenheit, while its lowest heat setting reaches 75 degrees. This means that since the heat range is lower than most hair dryers, it is better for fine hair than it is for thick hair. It has 1,875 watts making it a decently powerful hair dryer. We measured the air flow and discovered that it is on the more powerful side of the spectrum and therefore more suited for thick hair than it is for fine hair. With the heat settings being better for fine and curly hair while the air speed is better suited for thick hair, this blow dryer isn&#39;t especially well suited for any type of hair but will still give plenty of power and heat to dry any hair type.","We measured the noise level of this hair dryer at 93 decibels, which definitely makes it one of the loudest in our review. To put this noise level in perspective, the best hair blow dryers we tested were just 85 decibels, so at 8 decibels louder this is rather noisy. This Coolway blow dryer uses ionic heating technology, so it will be gentler on hair and will help lock in moisture. This ionic hair dryer also comes with a concentrator to help dry hair fast and keep it smooth, but it lacks a diffuser so it&#39;s not as helpful for curly hair.","We weighed this device at 19.9 ounces, which makes this the third heaviest hair dryer in our review. This means it isn&#39;t a highly portable hair dryer for traveling. It does have a very long cord that measures 9.5 inches, so you will be able to move around when you dry your hair. If you&#39;d prefer a blow dryer that is lighter and quieter, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/centrix-q-zone-lightweight-review\">Centrix Q-Zone Lightweight</a>.","The Coolway Go Pro comes with a three-year warranty, which is better than most of the other hair dryer warranties in this review. The best warranties last for five years or more, but a three-year warranty isn&#39;t bad. If you need to contact Coolway regarding your hair dryer, you can reach a customer representative via email and phone."]},"id":"6421f670-1151-4dd4-86e3-2848ced3b4d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9094f251-0a74-44e5-afcc-3fc0397851bf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This blow dryer provides plenty of power to dry all types of hair.
