It not only allows you to make perfect physical copies of your Blu-ray movies, but you can also digitally archive them on your computer.

Once the disc you want to copy is loaded into the interface, you simply click the Copy button to start the disc-to-disc copy option. This process can take several hours depending on your computer&#39;s processor, the size of the Blu-ray movie and your burner drive. But this is true of all the Blu-ray copy software applications we reviewed when we chose the disc-to-disc copy option.","If you&#39;re making more than one copy of a Blu-ray movie, you&#39;d be better served to extract its disc image (ISO file) to your computer&#39;s hard drive and burn additional copies from that file. An ISO file is the blueprint for your Blu-ray disc. When you burn copies from an ISO file, it saves you hours of waiting time than if you were to burn individual disc-to-disc copies. In our tests, it took Leawo Blu-ray Copy 43 minutes to make a new physical copy of a movie.","Saving disc images to your computer has a number of benefits. You can watch it the same way you would as if you were using a physical disc on your system&#39;s Blu-ray player. And you can use the disc image to make new physical copies without needing the original. This is useful in the event that your source disc is damaged or lost.","Extracted disc images are also great for archiving your Blu-ray library, but if you want to do this, you should know that Blu-ray files are extremely large and will fill up all your computer&#39;s storage space very quickly. You may want to invest in an external hard drive with several terabytes of storage capacity if you plan to archive your entertainment collection.","One of the reasons this Blu-ray copy software application ranked high in our review is because it can bypass the anti-piracy encryptions on almost all commercial Blu-ray movies. This means that you can use this software to copy any Blu-ray movie you own. Lesser programs that omit this feature are limited to copying unprotected and homemade Blu-ray discs."]},"id":"7dd37da1-f62e-4df3-b017-18fedb88146a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output"},"id":"37ae148d-03af-49dc-8451-dcb62adfea5c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Fu7nosW5UPqGwcc3wn5Xt4.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52559-leawo-blu-ray-copy16.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fu7nosW5UPqGwcc3wn5Xt4.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Fu7nosW5UPqGwcc3wn5Xt4","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fu7nosW5UPqGwcc3wn5Xt4.jpg","alt":""},"id":"bc15561f-06f7-4b68-afc1-73148a73aded","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["During our tests, we made several copies of Blu-ray movies using this application.

And they get more expensive with the more capacity they have. Most Blu-ray movies are contained on 50GB discs.
