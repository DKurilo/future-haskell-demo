While devices such as spy cameras can be useful, there are pros and cons to their use. The most common device to be used in the home for both security and family monitoring is the <a href=\"/best-nanny-cams\"><strong>nanny cam</strong></a>. It is a simple device that allows you to record the goings on in your home. However, before taking the step to install and use one, you should thoroughly explore the pros and cons.","<strong>Pros</strong>","Of the pros and cons, the advantages are the most obvious. Below is a list of some of the benefits of implementing a home camera system."]},"id":"1e6eee0f-0e2c-4ab4-aa2f-25677f5eda15","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Child Safety   The premier consideration when deciding whether to install a nanny cam is the security of your children. When employing a new nanny, or if you suspect your nanny of impropriety, it is wise to gather any evidence of wrongdoing. For older children, nanny cams can verify that they are not engaging in harmful, destructive or illegal activities while at home.","Home Security   Even households that do not employ a nanny often have housekeepers or other hired service workers that assist with in-home care, remodeling, plumbing or other repairs. There are times when you must leave strangers unattended in your home. Using spy cameras to ensure that these people behave properly without abusing your property or stealing from you can provide you with peace of mind.","Protection Against Wrongful Accusations   People who have employees in their homes whom they do not explicitly trust can be inclined to make accusations that ultimately turn out to be baseless. A misplaced piece of jewelry or a bruise on a child can cause an uproar, the unjust firing of an honest worker or legal action without grounds."],"type":"ol"},"id":"905d6a46-d202-496a-a7eb-32c3dd70fe65","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Cons</strong>","Between the pros and cons, the cons may be very difficult to see, but you must realistically consider them to make an informed decision."]},"id":"e7d37c24-b162-4d19-90bf-d7c5fb6e8354","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Possible Legal Liability</strong>   The primary risk when instituting any kind of video or audio recording in your home is that people recorded without their permission could bring legal action against the person who used the monitoring device. Possible violation of privacy rights can bring stiff legal penalties if discovered.","<strong>False Feeling of Security</strong>   It is easy to believe that once the camera is in place, there is no further suspicion necessary as long as nothing appears on the recording. Mistreatment of all kinds can occur outside of the home. If perpetrators suspect they are being recorded, they might essentially preen for the camera, making sure to be extremely attentive or well behaved while committing violence or other atrocities away from prying eyes.","<strong>Mistrust</strong>   Hidden cameras are not foolproof, and family or employees alike could feel violated if they discover they have been filmed without their knowledge. This could lead to an employee who is a valuable asset deciding to quit working in your household due to feelings of mistrust."],"type":"ol"},"id":"7708fd56-505b-40f8-a92f-2c754f4d0640","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The pros and cons are simple, but the consequences can be very dire if they are ignored. The pros and cons listed above are only a sample, and your situation probably involves other considerations. Before bringing monitoring equipment into your home, you should formulate your own list of pros and cons to determine what is best for you.","It can be very easy to think of the benefits to your home and family, but unless you consider the entire picture, the repercussions could involve the courts and the loss of valuable employees or the alienation of family members. Making a list of the pros and cons will allow you to ruminate on the situation and avoid a hasty decision that could be costly in the long run.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "," "]},"id":"23dee779-5e8c-4f0f-b213-f66d050e8942","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6304","url":"/the-pros-and-cons-of-nanny-cams","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"m-w-byrne","url":"/author/m-w-byrne","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"M.W.
