The auto-evaporation feature recycles the water the unit absorbs from the air, and its high EER results in a relatively low estimated annual cost; you can likely run this <a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">portable AC unit</a> for less than $100 a year. However, health and safety standard companies like UL and ETL do not certify this Amico air conditioner.","At top speed, this 11,000 Btu air conditioner can cover rooms up to 500 square feet. It churns out airflow speeds of 235 CFM, which is above average among portable AC units. When you need to conserve energy or just circulate air around the room, you can choose between high and low speeds on fan mode. However, the best portable air conditioners have three speeds in case the highest setting is too much and the lowest setting is too weak.","In cooling mode, the Amico AP11000 absorbs 2.5 pints per hour. What doesn&#39;t exit the unit out of the window vent is absorbed by the unit&#39;s auto-evaporation function. This feature allows units like this Amico model to recycle the water collected from the atmosphere to cool its internal hardware.","With an energy efficiency of EER 10.2, this is the third-most efficient portable air conditioner model we looked at; only the <a href=\"/whynter-review\">Whynter ARC-12S</a> and <a href=\"/frigidaire-gallery-review\">Frigidaire Gallery FGPC1244T1</a> are more efficient. That translates to a relatively low operating cost of about $93 a year. However, it lacks common safety ratings from Underwriters Laboratories, ASHRAE, RoHS or ETL.","Because this unit is designed to cool a wider space, the wireless remote is an excellent addition. The air conditioner also has a programmable timer mode. You can set it to start a cooling cycle before you arrive home from work or to shut off before you go to sleep. However, if the power goes off while you&#39;re away you might return to an excessively toasty living space, since it can&#39;t restart itself. It also won&#39;t self-adjust for the right comfort level while you sleep. On the plus side, this is the quietest model we tested, producing only 48 dB while in use. In fact, it&#39;s the only model with a sound output under 50 dB.","This free-standing AC unit comes with a one-year compressor and appliance warranty. This is a standard appliance warranty but a below-average compressor warranty. Amico is the only company in our portable air conditioner comparison that doesn&#39;t provide an online manual for its units. At the time of writing this review, the Amico AP11000 costs $381, which is slightly more affordable than the industry average of $427."]},"id":"de61071f-2378-417f-9989-c1f3f1a9c051","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3abe99dd-4db8-4eb0-bc33-c32a489550b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Amico AP11000 is energy efficient, quiet and low maintenance.
