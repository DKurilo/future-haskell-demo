Decker D6000 iron has average wattage compared to others on our lineup and will work well with many types of garments and fabrics. It is easy to use, thanks to a wide variety of functional and convenient features. Safety features and a warranty give you peace of mind as you use the <a href=\"/best-irons\">iron</a>.","Steaming your clothes can be equally important as ironing them, and this iron offers vertical steam bursts and an adjustable steam gauge that you can customize. The 26 steam holes distribute the steam directly to your fabric whenever you need, and it only takes 10 seconds to regenerate steam between one series of bursts and another.","The stainless steel soleplate has the standard U-shape and can heat up to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. With seven different fabric options, you can find the right setting for your needs, and the 1,500 watts gives you the power to iron or steam most fabrics easily. Additionally, it heats up in 45 seconds and has an anti-drip system, which works to keep water from leaking out of the soleplate.","This iron has an easy-to-fill, transparent reservoir with a large capacity of 10 ounces. However, it doesn&#39;t have a sealed reservoir cover, so it may leak if tipped over. If you are worried about leaks from that source, consider the <a href=\"/rowenta-review\">Rowenta DW2070</a>, which has a sealed reservoir.","The swivel cord measures 8.08 inches, which is short compared to the others on our lineup. It is also one of the largest irons, at 6.3 x 5.1 x 12 inches, and weighing 3.76 pounds, it is the heaviest iron we tested. Despite this, it feels balanced and glides smoothly over fabric. It also has a self-cleaning function to keep it working in better condition longer.","Its soft grip keeps your hand comfortable as you work and makes it easy to maneuver. The interface is easy to use as well. While it has a digital display, it doesn&#39;t have much more function than the standard fabric-temperature dial on most other irons. However, once the iron heats up to your desired temperature, the display tells you it&#39;s ready, and there is also an alert tone.","You can iron with peace of mind, thanks to the device&#39;s three-way automatic shut-off. If you leave the iron in an upright position for eight minutes, it automatically shuts off.  Similarly, if you tip it over or leave it face-down for 30 seconds, it will also automatically shut off. The iron body also stays cool while you use it.","If you ever have a question about the iron, you can contact Black &amp; Decker via phone or email, or you can refer to the online product manual on its website. The product has a two-year warranty."]},"id":"bf537e61-65e2-480b-8882-4d2678ddf3d2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"907b69f5-fe74-4e17-82b8-923ed09d405f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Black &amp; Decker D6000 heats up quickly and has decent wattage, allowing you to iron and steam garments and fabric effectively.
