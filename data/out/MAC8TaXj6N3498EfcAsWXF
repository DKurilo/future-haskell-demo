You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Blue Wave SolarCurve <a href=\"/best-pool-heaters\">pool heater</a> is a compact solar pool heater that is designed for use with above-ground pool systems. Unlike gas and propane heaters that give off emissions, this pool heater is environmentally friendly and can increase the temperature of your pool water in a matter of days.","This solar swimming pool heater does not deliver a specific number of Btu. Instead, this unit uses the power of the sun to increase the temperature of your pool water. Because it is designed for smaller pools and strictly uses solar power, it heats much slower than an electric or a gas unit. It also does not keep your pool water at a specific temperature. Instead, the pool water increases by 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. In the summer, expect the pool water to be much warmer than in the spring when temperatures are beginning to get warm. This unit is ideal if you have a swimming pool that does not get a lot of direct sunlight. You can also pair this pool heater with a solar blanket to prevent heat from escaping at night or on cooler days.","This swimming pool heater features a single solar panel that connects directly to your pool&#39;s pump system. You must set the panel up in a location where it can get a lot of sunlight. You are limited to the length of the installation hoses that come with the unit. This swimming pool heater may not work very well if you are located in an area that does not get a lot of direct sunlight due to trees and shade. The  <a href=\"/solar-sun-rings-review\">Solar Sun Rings</a> are another simple, inexpensive solar-powered option that heat the water by laying on its surface. The only problem with the Sun Rings is you will have to purchase several of them, roughly one for every 50 square feet of water surface area, to heat your pool evenly.","This swimming pool heater also does not have any sort of control panel. The simple installation does not include a digital display or any type of monitoring device. If you want to know the temperature of your above-ground pool, you have to install an external thermometer. There is also no way to adjust the temperature of the water. There is no off switch, and you have to uninstall the swimming pool heater from your pool pump to keep it from heating.","The Blue Wave SolarCurve swimming pool heater works well with above-ground swimming pools that are in direct sunlight. The most of a temperature increase you will experience is around 10 degrees Fahrenheit, which may not be enough to keep your pool water comfortable in cooler climates or in shaded areas."]},"id":"6835e3b2-934b-43fb-ae76-c2230a9c2c8b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66212","url":"/blue-wave-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-14T21:21:54Z","datePublished":"2015-07-14T21:21:54Z","name":"Blue Wave NS6028 SolarCurve","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-14T21:21:54Z","id":"MAC8TaXj6N3498EfcAsWXF","meta":{"title":"Blue Wave SolarCurve Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Blue Wave SolarCurve is an above-ground pool heater that harnesses the power of the sun.
