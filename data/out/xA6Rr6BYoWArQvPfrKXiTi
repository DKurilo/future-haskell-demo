While this industrial space heater is portable, it does not feature any ventilation, meaning that you can only run it in areas with adequate ventilation.","With an output of 125,000 BTUs per hour, this heater can warm up to 3,000 square feet of indoor space, but it also works outdoors. The unit features a built-in adjustable thermostat with large buttons and knobs that you can push and turn even while wearing thick work gloves. A continuous ignition thermostat allows you to leave the diesel space heater running without dangerous fuel or fume buildup, because it continues to ignite fumes as it runs. This industrial space heater runs on multiple types of fuel and has an 8.5-gallon tank that allows this heater to run for an average of 9.5 hours per tank, making it a good heater for full workdays. The included fuel gauge allows you to keep track of how much fuel is left so you can refill it if necessary.","The forced air heating system allows the model to heat air as quickly as possible, allowing you and others to work comfortably. An enclosed motor also makes the model quieter, which is better for long usage over the course of a day. With no built-in fan, this industrial space heater is suitable for both outdoor and indoor use (in a well ventilated area) because it heats one specific area without air circulation. Outdoors, it raises the temperature of air immediately surrounding the unit. Indoors, it takes longer to raise the temperature of a building than an air-circulated heater, and the area surrounding the space heater is the warmest.","A durable steel body and handle ensure this space heater is durable enough to withstand heavy usage, including daily wheeling on and off of trailers and trucks on a daily basis. The pneumatic wheels are flat resistant and you can refill them using an air compressor. The built-in high-limit safety switch, automatic overheating shutdown and CAD cell offer protection by automatically shutting the heater down in unsafe conditions. It also allows you to shut the heater off with the flick of a switch. This makes this space heater a good fit for areas where you might frequently have to turn it off.","Mr. Heater&#39;s MH125KTR industrial space heater is highly portable, offers 9.5 hours of heat on one tank of fuel and works with multiple fuel types, making it versatile and useful for work areas under 3,000 square feet."]},"id":"c5ea0ffe-a130-417c-a41e-26a35336797c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66822","url":"/mr-heater-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-04T20:59:32Z","datePublished":"2015-09-04T20:59:32Z","name":"Mr. Heater MH125KTR","synopsis":"A multifuel engine allows you to run the Mr. Heater MH125KTR industrial space heater on kerosene, diesel, heating oil and JP-8 fuel with a heating capacity of up to 3,000 square feet.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"A multifuel engine allows you to run the Mr. Heater MH125KTR industrial space heater on kerosene, diesel, heating oil and JP-8 fuel with a heating capacity of up to 3,000 square feet.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-04T20:59:32Z","id":"xA6Rr6BYoWArQvPfrKXiTi","meta":{"title":"Mr. Heater MH125KTR Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Mr. Heater MH125KTR is a forced-air kerosene or diesel space heater for heating up to 3,000 square feet.
