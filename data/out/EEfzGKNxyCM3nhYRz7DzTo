This allows you to adjust the speed so that no matter how hard you press the pedal, you won’t inadvertently sew too quickly into an area of the project you didn’t intend to stitch. This Singer’s stitch patterns are changeable on the machine’s LCD screen and include nine basic stitches, eight stretch stitches, more than 50 decorative ones and six styles of buttonholes. You can use this one inexpensive machine for essentially any kind of sewing project. We did notice you can’t toggle down while changing the individual digits on the LCD screen to match a specific stitch pattern. You must go all the way back through nine if you go too far, or turn the machine off and back on again. Either way, it’s a little annoying.
