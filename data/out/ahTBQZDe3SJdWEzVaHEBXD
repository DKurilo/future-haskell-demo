You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Comfort Line Products EZ Spa2Go was one of the first <a href=\"/best-inflatable-hot-tubs\">inflatable hot tubs</a> to come to market, and it has been popular since its introduction. As one of the first of its kind, the EZ Spa2Go helped to set the template all other inflatable spas are based on, with an inflatable tub and external pump and heater.","The EZ Spa2Go is made of heavy PVC, with a faux leather exterior cover. Uninflated, the tub and all its parts weigh 75 pounds, which isn’t the lightest inflatable hot tub we&#39;ve seen, but is still quite portable. The inflated tub measures 82 inches across, with an interior diameter of 58 inches. The 28-inch deep tub holds up to 250 gallons of water, and it will seat up to four adults. An exterior cover of black faux-leather protects the tub functions as a basic ground mat.","The tub comes with a combined pump and heater unit, which can be powered from any 110- to 120-volt outlet, and it includes a built-in ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) plug. The digital controls on the pump heater let you set the temperature up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, and they also control the 127 built-in bubble jets. The heater will raise the water temperature approximately 2 degrees per hour, meaning that you’ll need to start heating the tub several hours prior to use. The pump heater also contains built-in water filtering, with swappable filter cartridges, which is a much more convenient option than filters mounted inside the tub because these require either getting wet up past the elbow or draining the tub to switch out an old filter.","The portable inflatable hot tub comes with both a fitted top cover, made of the same faux-leather material as the tub’s exterior cover, and an inflatable cover. The inflatable cover helps to trap heat in the tub as the water is brought up to the desired temperature, while the fitted cover has both a heat-retaining foil lining and eight locking clips to secure the cover when the tub is not in use. The locking clips require a key to unlock, providing an additional safety measure for an unobserved tub.","The package comes with a patch kit for repairing leaks and punctures, and is covered by a 12-month manufacturer warranty on both the tub and pump heater unit. The spa also has an inflation hose, which lets you use the pump’s air blower to inflate the tub, but it does not include any of the filters or chemicals needed for regular maintenance.","The Comfort Line Products EZ Spa2Go may be popular, but as inflatable spas go, it’s a mixed bag. The inflatable portion appears to have decent construction, and the overall design looks stable, but the lack of accessories – particularly the lack of any necessary filters or chemicals – means that the inflatable hot tub comes with extra expenses right off the bat."]},"id":"ee2f5939-632e-4bbc-826a-1de1ef0b6fbc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67242","url":"/comfort-line-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-16T14:23:57Z","datePublished":"2015-10-16T14:23:57Z","name":"Comfort Line EZ Spa2Go STG-1BLK110V","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-16T14:23:57Z","id":"ahTBQZDe3SJdWEzVaHEBXD","meta":{"title":"Comfort Line EZ Spa2Go STG-1BLK110V Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Comfort Line Products EZ Spa2Go helped pioneer the inflatable hot tub category.
