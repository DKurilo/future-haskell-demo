This <a href=\"/best-dental-software\">dental management solution</a> offers tools to assist in the front office and clinical areas of your practice. This application is not a cloud-based product but additional web-based capabilities are available that make this product even more advanced and beneficial.","Easy Dental provides all of the basic tools you need in dental software, from scheduling capabilities to payment entry. If you desire assistance with managing insurance claims, the eService eCentral Insurance Manager helps you easily manage and track claims. Some of the application’s additional eServices include processing credit and debit cards directly within the application, managing your company website and sending patient reminders.","A highlight of this software is its charting capabilities. Periodontal charting and other clinical charting options are available. You can enter patient notes within the software as well as plan upcoming treatments for patients.","The interface of Easy Dental is busy and can be overwhelming. There are several icons and menu bars to choose from so you will need to spend time within the application to learn where specific tools are located and how to use them.","Since Easy Dental is not web-based dental software, you will want to ensure this product is compatible with your office’s workstations. It is compatible with Windows 7 and older operating systems but we are disappointed that it does not work with Windows 8 or Mac OS X. This could be a drawback for offices that use those operating systems.","The customer support we received from Easy Dental was also disappointing. The manufacturer of this software offers email, telephone and live chat support for all customers. However, we never received any response from a representative, despite the numerous email inquiries we sent. There are several online training resources including FAQs and support documents to help you with this program."]},"id":"3412987d-279f-4f55-ba88-1cae1a7c006c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ed65eda5-a058-4788-be6d-11bc5da19108","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Easy Dental has many beneficial features to assist in all of the basic functions of running a dentist office.
