The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-home-computers\">Home Computer</a> here.</em>","The Dell Inspiron 3650 has a powerful processor and a lot of memory, making it a good multitasking computer. This home computer comes with a decent graphics card and good audio output capacity, and it has a variety of ports to keep you connected. All of this plus its great warranty options and small design make it a worthwhile investment for your home office.","The computer has a sixth-generation Intel i5-6400 processor, so it is powerful enough to keep up with multitasking, whether in Microsoft Office or online. Although the clocked CPU speed is a mere 2.6GHz, one of the slowest in our review, the i5-6400 four-core processor should prevent slowdown. The NVIDIA GT 730 may not be the most powerful graphics card available, but it can handle video streaming from sites like YouTube and Netflix.","You can store your favorite photos, videos, documents and other files on the desktop PC’s 1TB hard drive – although you can buy a more premium model with a 2TB hard drive. One terabyte should be a sufficient amount of storage for most users, though if you like to save lots of photos and other files, you may want to consider upgrading to a larger storage capacity. The computer has 8GB of memory, which is more than enough for average home computing. This is enough memory to run multiple programs at the same time and stream video.","Whether you have a beloved old keyboard and mouse or sleek new devices, you can connect them to this Dell PC computer using its two USB 3.0 and four USB 2.0 ports. With VGA and HDMI ports, you can also connect a monitor or TV to the machine. In addition, it has Bluetooth connectivity so you can use wireless devices. However, it isn’t Wi-Fi enabled, and you have to depend on an Ethernet connection to access the internet.","It comes preinstalled with Windows 10 Home, so you don’t need to load the operating system yourself. The computer’s space-saving design makes the most of a small workbench; it measures 13.78 inches tall, 6.06 inches wide and 11.13 inches deep.","You can contact Dell’s customer service via telephone, email or live chat if you have any questions or concerns about your computer. While the computer comes with the industry standard one-year warranty, you have the option to purchase a warranty extension up to four years, which is longer than the best home computer manufacturers we reviewed offer."]},"id":"38bd15b2-a621-4223-a492-1d26c90d7134","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dc11dea4-e00c-4602-b781-6d61b04ad41f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dell Inspiron 3650 is a good computer for its price.
