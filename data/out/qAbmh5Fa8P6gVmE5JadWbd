When we first found this software, the 4Media website was up and fully functional. A few days later, the website vanished from the internet. Whether or not you&#39;ll be able to access the 4Media website on any given day is unclear. There are several other places where you can download a free trial of the program. Upgrading and paying for the full application is an option if the 4Media website is functional or not.","When you launch 4Media Blu-Ray to iPad Converter, you&#39;re greeted with a seemingly useful, stable application with a wide array of conversion and customization options.","Loading your Blu-ray disc into the application is simple. Just click the Load Disc option and insert the disc in your Blu-ray drive. The program only takes a few seconds to load and list all the tracks on your Blu-ray disc that you can ostensibly convert for playback on your iPad. It is at this point when the application completely falls apart. In short, nothing works.","The preview and customization tools are simply nonfunctional. In our tests, we were only able to get the audio to play back in any of the Blu-ray converter&#39;s tools. And while this Blu-ray converter has all the video-editing tools we look for, we were unable to get them work properly because the program kept crashing.","Despite these problems, we were able to convert a Blu-ray disc for an iPad. It takes this program a little more than an hour and a half to complete a full conversion. However, when our video experts examined the final result, they found significant pixelation, motion blur and interlacing issues on nearly every frame of the video. These flaws distract from the viewing experience, especially when they&#39;re watched on an iPad equipped with Apple&#39;s Retina display."]},"id":"635692d3-a34b-4951-8a5c-f3398a7fd15a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"13a24c13-930f-4db1-9ab0-faa94fe3d656","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want to download the free trial of the software onto your computer, you can, even if the 4Media website happens to be offline that day.
