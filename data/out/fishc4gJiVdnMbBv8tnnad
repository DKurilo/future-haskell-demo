It has a comfortable design that minimizes bulk while still being roomy enough for sleeping. Active Junky tested sleeping bags on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado and found the REI Flash among the best sleeping bag for car camping and women.","This down sleeping bag offers several features for keeping in warmth. For example, it offers a tube inside the bag along the zipper to help keep cold air from entering the bag. The REI Flash uses a combination of down and synthetic materials for the filling. The bottom of the bag features Primaloft Sport Insulation, a synthetic fill that protects against the damp. Active Junky testers found it more comfortable and warm when paired with an insulated pad.","The top of the bag is filled with 700-pound force of duck down, which holds in warmth while being easily compressible. The down is also water-repellant, as is the nylon shell.","The sleeping bag is rated for 29 degrees Fahrenheit, with an EN comfort rating of 41 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s better suited for milder weather; although with the ultra-light weight and small packing volume, you could pair it with a bag cover for extra warmth when cold-camping.","This bag features vertical baffles along the side walls in order to create a better fit than horizontal-only baffles. The contoured hood and insulated face muffler keep your face cozy.  It also has a separate draw cords for the neck and hood so you can adjust each separately for maximum comfort.","The REI Flash comes in women’s and unisex sizes. If desired, this sleeping bag can zip to other REI backpacking bags for couples camping. It includes a nylon stuff sack and a cotton storage bag.","<strong>Tester Comment:</strong> This bag is so easy to take — and packs so small. While I’d like to take it on every trip, it does get chilly around 32 degrees. Flash fits 8 out of 10 trips I’m planning this year.<br/><strong>Key Feature: </strong>Ultralight<br/><strong>Best For: </strong>Car camping, mild weather, long backpacking trips where weight and volume are vital<br/><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If you need an extremely light but comfortable sleeping bag, the REI Flash provides an excellent choice at barely a pound. Its unique construction keeps you warm in most conditions, but it can get chilly when the temperatures drop below freezing."]},"id":"d9c46bb0-3710-4c6e-900d-4bf8a134765c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68161","url":"/rei-flash-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:57:35Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:57:35Z","name":"REI Flash","synopsis":"The REI Flash is a mummy sleeping bag that packs small and light, making it a great choice for long backpacking trips.
