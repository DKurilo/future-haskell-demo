The bank also offers standard FHA and VA loans for purchase and refinance.","PNC’s upper limit on jumbo loans is higher than that of most other banks. It will finance up to $5 million for borrowers with sufficiently high credit who are seeking loans for primary or secondary homes as well as investment properties.","For those looking to borrow against their equity, PNC has options for a home equity line of credit, home equity loans and rapid refinance. Homebuyers who want to put less money down should also look into a combination loan that allows the borrower to put just 10.1 percent down and then take out a second loan for the remaining 9.9 percent (technically a home equity line of credit) in order to avoid having to pay a private mortgage insurance premium.","<strong>Rates and Fees</strong>","The PNC website will give you an approximate interest rate and annual percentage rate only when you enter your loan amount and zip code, and the results assume one discount point. The bank’s interest rates appear to be lower than other large competitors’, but the APR is about the same. Nowhere on the site does it specify what the fees and closing costs will be, so those charges must vary greatly based on borrowers’ location and circumstances.","<strong>Customer Experience</strong>","For a bank that has been around for 160 years, PNC is certainly trying hard to look like a startup with its colorful online tools. Its Home Insight Planner lets you enter your income, debt and monthly expenses – without requiring you to upload your personal info – in order to see what you can really afford to buy. The tool eventually leads you to real estate listings if you’re ready to take the next step.","For preapproval, you can fill out a simple form online, and a loan officer will get back to you within one to two business days. Once you begin the application process, you can use PNC’s Home Insight Tracker, which lets you fill out most of the forms and upload documents with a computer or mobile device. But you will need to speak to someone on the phone or at a branch in order to complete the application.","Compared with other large banks, PNC has a low volume of complaints against it (as a percentage of its total loan volume) in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau database. In J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction survey for 2017, the bank ranked right in the middle."]},"id":"4f0737d6-e773-4573-91b9-eebd1f94b856","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70252","url":"/pnc-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sabrina-rojas-weiss","url":"/author/sabrina-rojas-weiss","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"Sabrina Rojas Weiss","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"tVZv6ejiouijuHU3n7n49Y","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-25T17:59:51Z","datePublished":"2018-09-25T17:59:51Z","name":"PNC","synopsis":"PNC’s fixed-rate loans for purchase and refinancing are available for 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year terms with as little as 3 percent down, and it offers 1/1, 3/1, 5/1, 7/1, and 10/1 adjustable-rate","review":{"rating":31,"pros":["Through personalized tools and apps, this large, established bank is making a very 21st century effort to educate users about budgeting for a home and applying for a mortgage..
