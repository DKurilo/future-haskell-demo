In fact, it&#39;s one of the few boats in this price range with a brushless motor. However, the handling, speed, run time and overall performance was just average, while the durability was below average. These reasons are why it didn&#39;t rank higher in our review.","We tested each radio-controlled boat on our lineup at the local reservoir. And while we had a blast carving out small wakes, we closely evaluated each boat&#39;s handling, speed, run time and durability. The best RC boats need to respond to your directions effectively without flipping or submarining. And to provide the most fun, they need to be fast, durable and capable of staying on the water for longer than it takes to boil an egg.","One of the major issues we had with the Minimono is the transmitter. As soon as we turned on the transmitter, the propeller would spin at full speed even though the trigger was in the neutral position. This became quite frustrating on the water, as it would often take off when you wanted it to stop or slow down.","When the transmitter was working, the handling was average. It handled left and right turns very sharply. This made it easy to flip and submarine, but it recovers quickly. Using a radar gun, we recorded the top speed at 18 mph, which is well below the 25 mph speed the manufacturer suggests it can reach. However, we were testing on a reservoir with water that was a little rough. So it&#39;s likely we could have reached faster speeds on calmer waters.","The Minimono had a run time of 10 minutes, which was average. However, toward the end of the run time, the propeller stopped spinning effectively. Instead of spinning aggressively, as it had done for most of the testing, it would only twitch, which suggests an issue with the motor or propeller shaft. For these reasons, it received a C grade for durability.","One of the biggest headaches with the Minimono is the fact that Aquacraft doesn&#39;t include the boat&#39;s 11.1-V, 1000-1600-mAh LiPo battery. Instead, you must purchase the battery separately, which we found to be a major hassle. Further, they don&#39;t all use the same connectors, so you have to be careful to buy one with the correct connector.","You also have to purchase a charger, as most of the batteries don&#39;t come with chargers. This added over $50 of additional cost to the boat. So while it&#39;s one of the most affordable brushless RC boats, the additional costs of the battery negate the savings, putting this boat into the same price range as the best RC boats in our review."]},"id":"f9673dc2-ece9-4b90-a410-5611965a230d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cab62658-f815-4c46-bdf2-f38c9e373b0c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Aquacraft Minimono is an all-around average remote control boat.
