The other energy-efficient aspect of this digital frame is its programmable timer which turns the frame on and off at specified times each day.

The remote is very simple but has everything you need to control and operate the digital picture frame. The top button on the remote is a navigation button. It allows you to select up, down, left or right. In the center of the navigation button is a smaller button labeled “OK.” This button allows you to select different functions, modes and choices for customizing the digital frame. Two additional smaller buttons located beneath the navigation button are labeled “Back” and “Mode.” These allow you to go back or exit out of a menu and open a new menu. We found the remote to be a very convenient feature that makes the frame a bit easier to use.","There are plenty of features available in this digital frame, and figuring out how to use them will be the hardest part. We found that this Kodak digital photo frame is not the most intuitive frame on the market, and our research showed that several users were frustrated with the instructions at some point during use. However, once they contacted customer support, accessed additional resources or played around with it for a bit, they were able to do exactly what they had wanted to. This digital picture frame won’t fit everyone’s needs, especially if you want to play videos; however, it does an excellent job of displaying digital images.

The section offers three options: Online Support, Downloads and Upgrades, as well as a search bar to search the Kodak FAQs and knowledgebase. The Online Support link takes you to a page where you can access resources on downloads and drivers, installation and setup, how-to manuals and guides, and a plethora of additional categories. Although some of the categories come up with empty results, others are very beneficial and provide a great deal of information.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52085-sony-8-inch-digital-photo-frame15.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZbqEYfEVUWB63Vv3M5DoLN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ZbqEYfEVUWB63Vv3M5DoLN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZbqEYfEVUWB63Vv3M5DoLN.jpg","alt":""},"id":"6fcc613b-be38-4ea4-843b-e3ec20829856","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although you can find a &#34;Support&#34; link at the top of every page on the site, we recommend going through the link on the side of the product page.

The 7-inch screen of the digital frame is obviously smaller than the 8-inch screens we reviewed, but it provides excellent screen resolution and image clarity. We highly recommend digital photo frames with plenty of internal memory, and the 2GB of internal memory that this Kodak digital picture frame offers is absolutely fabulous!  Despite the fact that the digital photo frame doesn’t play video files, it’s obvious that we were pleased with this digital frame. We recommend it as one of the top choices of our digital picture frame review."]},"id":"2fc38016-ea46-4366-a9cc-fbf59a80d158","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52113","url":"/kodak-digital-photo-frame-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-02-09T15:51:35Z","datePublished":"2011-02-09T15:51:35Z","name":"Kodak EASYSHARE P750 Digital Frame","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":90,"verdict":"It provides an excellent display, awesome quality and a lot of internal memory and features like an activity sensor and a programmable timer.","pros":["This digital photo frame has 2GB of internal memory which can store approximately 16,000 photos."],"cons":["This digital photo frame doesn&#8217;t have the ability to play audio or video files."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-02-09T15:51:35Z","id":"sjk9XjgsKFWT2rhokwDQRB","meta":{"title":"Kodak EASYSHARE P750 Digital Frame Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
