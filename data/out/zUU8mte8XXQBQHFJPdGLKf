You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Life-Like Rail Master is an HO-scale <a href=\"/best-train-sets\">model train set</a> that has a 38-inch by 45-inch oval track. This train set comes with many additional accessories to make the train set more enjoyable. It is also an affordable train, suitable for beginner model train enthusiasts.","The track features an attached roadbed so your track will stay firmly connected to hardwood floors, tabletops and carpeted areas. The train track features a side-locking mechanism that is different from all other tracks we pieced together. We were able to piece the track together in only a couple of minutes, but not without some of the plastic connectors breaking off. The connecting pieces are thin pieces of plastic and seemed to break without much force.","The manufacturer recommends that this train set be used by children 8 years of age and older. It comes with many accessories, such as 38 railroad signs, 24 street and highway signs, as well as utility poles, street lamps and call boxes. The additional accessories are one of the major draws to this electric model train set.","This model train set includes a locomotive, hopper, refrigerator car and caboose. The locomotive has Santa Fe painted on both sides of the train, but the Santa Fe across the front of the train is a sticker. Stickers tend to peel off and wear out faster than paint.","The refrigerator car and caboose are painted in all red with yellow lettering. The paint looks good and doesn’t show any paint chips or smudges. The refrigerator car has some writing painted on it, but it isn&#39;t overly detailed. Even the small writing in the bottom corners of the boxcar doesn&#39;t show any signs of paint chipping or smudging. The hopper is all blue with yellow lettering. The hopper has fake plastic coal atop it, but it doesn&#39;t look as detailed as some other trains do.","The train cars are made of light plastic and are not as durable as what you will find with other train sets. The HO-scale is a popular train size, and you can always expand your train with more train cars if desired."]},"id":"e47ae72f-b723-4ca3-b05d-a80beadd5e31","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b4c82f1f-331d-4281-ad83-2b9277a3ccea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This budget-friendly train set offers the basics you need to get started.
