For instance, while Acuvue has a multitude of different contact lines, it was only counted once. In total, LensDirect.com only had 18 brands of contacts available, the least of any website we reviewed. During our price comparison test, however, it did earn a middling grade of C+, so at least the small selection is relatively affordable.","LensDirect.com offers price matching. If you find your prescription and brand cheaper anywhere else, it will match that price. While this is a great way of doing business, websites like <a href=\"/1800contacts-review\">1-800-Contacts</a> and <a href=\"/aclens-review\">AC Lens</a> will even give you an additional discount on top of the price match. You also have to spend $49 to get free shipping on LensDirect.com while some other websites, like <a href=\"/coastal-contacts-review\">Coastal</a>, offer free shipping on all orders.","You can take a vision test at LensDirect.com, which our reviewers found to be a convenient feature. You simply follow the online prompts and an eye doctor will review the results. The $40 test comes with a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee too, so if for some reason you aren’t happy with the results, you’ll get a refund. The website does note that the online test is not a replacement for a full eye exam; it should be limited to people who are in good health between ages 18 and 55.","When it comes to eye accessories, LensDirect.com is lacking. Besides contacts, it only sells sunglasses. And when we evaluated the website, there were only 14 pairs to pick from. If you want contact solution or eye drops you need to shop elsewhere. There is a convenient live chat option though. You can get the answers to any questions you have immediately. While there aren’t any glasses to pick from, LensDirect.com does sell Halloween-themed lenses. With names like Banshee/White Wizard and Black Wolf, these lenses will definitely make your costume scarier and more interesting.","Shipping takes up to five days with this company. Like most contact lens websites, LensDirect.com also has a discounted auto refill option you can select so you never run out of contacts. You can return damaged or unopened boxes of contacts for up to 1 year, which is a generous return policy. <a href=\"/best-contact-lenses\">Eyeconic</a>, for example, only lets you return your purchase within 30 days while <a href=\"/walgreens-review\">Walgreens</a> doesn’t put any time restriction on a return. Even with its impressive return policy and shipping timeline, the limited selection at LensDirect.com puts it toward the bottom of our lineup."]},"id":"e02a06e8-38c9-46f1-9dc2-9197d0c624e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"57d82d7c-7c2b-479c-a486-f348c50c32a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["LenDirect.com  is a good option if you are looking for one of the more popular brands of contact lenses, but otherwise it&#39;s possible you won&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for.
