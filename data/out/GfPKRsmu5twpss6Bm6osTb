Sony&#39;s DVPFX810 <a href=\"/electronics\">portable DVD player</a> is one of the lightest, smallest portable DVD players on the market.","The Sony Dvpfx810 features an 8 inch color LCD swivel screen, almost 5 hours of play time and progressive scan. It supports all major disc formats including DVDR and DVDRW and plays JPEGs and MP3s. The Dvpfx810 also has an A/V composite input for additional accessories like video game consoles. The unit ships with a remote control and car connection kit.  It does not support PAL discs.","Critics like the sleek and easy design with dual headphone jacks, but found the screen to have some glare. Users liked the swivel screen and found the battery, while a bit bulky, sufficient for long trips. Many claimed more than 5 hours of continual use. Sound quality was also questionable.","Nothing is better than keeping the kids busy on a long flight or car trip. The Sony DVPFX810 with swiveling screen is perfect for the frequent traveler or the kids."]},"id":"a10e43de-8955-4dac-b0bb-34d5a666f931","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_6222","url":"/sony-dvpfx810-2918-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-06-06T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-06-06T06:00:00Z","name":"Sony DVPFX810 DVPFX810","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
