It is when you plug your <a href=\"/best-webcams\">webcam</a> into the computer you will find the deficiencies  with this product.","LifeCam Cinema&#39;s image quality suffers due to the hyperactive autofocus. The Cinema just doesn’t seem to be able to grasp its focal points very well. Even though this webcam runs at 720p HD video quality, it doesn’t seem like it with the blurry image quality from the autofocus.","The design of the LifeCam Cinema is where Microsoft excels. This HD webcam allows you to rotate it a full 360 degrees and tilt up and down, so there isn’t a spot in your room that you will not be able to film when your webcam is connected to your screen. The bottom of the webcam mount is flexible sticky rubber, so there is little unwanted movement while in use.","Both the web camera and the microphone connect to your computer through a single USB cable. It&#39;s often hard to find a free USB port, so having a USB web camera that connects the microphone and webcam through the same port is fantastic. If you have plenty of free ports and would like to use a separate microphone for recording purposes, just change the settings and you are ready to go. This USB web camera provides better quality and faster speed in a 2.0 port.","This unit is easy to use, even for beginners. After installing the Microsoft LifeCam Cinema Webcam application to your computer, you&#39;ll have full reign over the unique features and editing capabilities. We had no trouble getting it to work with online video chat applications and found it compatible with everything we tested it on: Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, Skype and Google Video Chat. We found that even after we dimmed the lights or shut them off altogether and only used the light of the computer screen, the Microsoft LifeCam Studio Webcam gave good results – it slowed the capture rate but we were still impressed with the quality and appearance of the images at such low lighting.","All Microsoft webcam users get a three-year limited hardware warranty, which is one of the longest warranties available that we reviewed. The Microsoft website has a large variety of helpful resources. There are links to demos and tutorials, as well as instructions to help you use your webcam and fully understand your warranty. With the email support option, we received a response within 24 hours of contacting the company. The toll-free phone number connected us to a representative in less than two minutes. Both of the customer service representatives that we made contact with were polite, efficient and knowledgeable."]},"id":"e4ac53d3-16b7-4646-9d2f-ec6f69270d11","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"903f9f84-75a6-4fb4-806b-265dacf5adb2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Notwithstanding a few glitches with the autofocus, this webcam is enjoyable to use.
