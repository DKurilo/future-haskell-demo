The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-mixers\"><em>mixers here</em></a><em>.</em>","KitchenAid mixers are common in kitchens across the country. Each KitchenAid <a href=\"/best-mixers\">stand mixer</a> possesses its own unique qualities. The Professional Series by KitchenAid is the heavy-duty stand mixer out of the bunch, and is designed to mix larger quantities.","The Professional line by KitchenAid mixes up to 6 quarts. Due to the heavier workload that this KitchenAid can handle, it also eats up far more power and is noisier than the best stand mixers we reviewed.","This stand mixer features a 67-point planetary mixing system. This allows the whisk to touch 67 different points within the mixing bowl for comprehensive mixing. Combine the comprehensive mixing power of this stand mixer with its heavy work capacity and it would seem this mixer has the makings of a kitchen-mixing workhorse. Unfortunately, the Professional Series has its share of problems.","The KitchenAid Professional Series mixer has metal gears with plastic gear casings. Due to the nature of the mixer, it works harder than smaller mixers. This causes the plastic casings to break and the gears to stop working. This is a common complaint about this mixer.","Right out of the box, this mixer comes with some great attachments. There is a stainless steel wire whip, a spiral dough hook and a flat beater. Like other KitchenAid products, there are up to 12 additional attachments for this stand mixer. If you feel like having homemade pasta or shredding a block of cheese, there are multiple attachments available for you to do so, which puts the versatility of this kitchen stand mixer on display.","The 6-quart, stainless steel bowl has a handle on it, which allows for easy detachment from the mixer. The bowl is also dishwasher safe making for the easiest possible cleanup. To reduce cleanup time even further, the mixer has a slow start feature. When beginning, the mixer starts at a slower speed, and then gradually proceeds to the selected speed setting. This is to ensure that when the mixer starts, it doesn’t splash the contents of the bowl everywhere.","If you encounter any problems with your mixer, the KitchenAid website has plenty of support options to help resolve your problem.  By entering the model number of your stand mixer, you are granted access to warranty information, service help and online manuals. You can also call or live chat with the service department."]},"id":"9200315b-6fe7-4416-8a75-8b3699031d6a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"07940bed-af93-44a5-a90e-8f3f1f67973e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In this case, bigger isn’t better.
