For the extra $15 a month the fall detection sensor costs, It is a bit on the sensitive side, which is still better than not being sensitive enough. It doesn't take much of a bump to the device to cause it to detect a fall, but it's not nearly as over-sensitive as some other sensors. In addition, there were some simulated falls where the sensitivity was lacking, perhaps due to a low battery. Still, the fall detection was closer to the sweet spot than other sensors we tested. The Lively Mobile starts out at about $25 per month, making it one of the most affordable medical alert systems, but to activate the fall detection, you must upgrade to the Ultimate package. This increases the monthly cost to $40 per month. However, this package still offers excellent value beyond the fall detection feature. It includes compatibility with the caretaker tracking app, mobile urgent care service that provides 24/7 access to nurses and doctors for minor health issues and product replacement if the Lively Mobile is damaged or stops working. In our main review of medical alert systems, GreatCall also earned my pick for the best medical alert system overall because it performed the best in all the important areas. The call response time was twice as fast as the second fastest medical alert services.

Studies even suggest seniors often won't push the help button as a result. But the emergency responders with Medical Guardian do an excellent job at easing this anxiety. <br />\n<br />\nThey speak clearly with a calm and patient tone. They never seemed annoyed when we told them we were just testing the device, or accidentally activated the fall detection. On every call, they asked at least twice if our tester was okay and always reminded us to press the button if we need help. <br />\n<br />\nThis goes a long way towards keeping your loved one calm while also alleviating any future anxiety they may have at calling for help. The fall detection received a C grade in our test. It detected about 10 per cent of the falls. But, at least it detected something. <br />\n<br />\nMany of the fall detection pendants we tested only detected falls when our tester spiked them on the ground like a football. In addition, it's not overly sensitive to the point where it calls for help at the slightest bump. If having some fall detection protection provides peace of mind, the additional $10 per month is worth it. <br />\n<br />\nOn a positive note, the fall detection pendant's quality, lanyard quality and style are far superior to the standard pendants included with the landline system. This could make the additional cost worth it on those characteristics alone. <br />\n<br />\nMedical Guardian also performed well in the other tests we performed for medical alerts. The average call response time was under 30 seconds and tied for the second fastest. In addition, both the mobile system and the in-home systems have above-average speakers. <br />\n<br />\nFinally, Medical Guardian is one of only a few medical alert services to offer a medical alert smartwatch, the Freedom Guardian. This is a smartwatch, fitness tracker and medical alert all rolled into one.

Our focus with senior care technology is in finding the best products that help your senior loved one maintain independence and a high quality of life on a budget.","<strong>How do fall detection sensors work?</strong>","Fall detection sensors work by using an accelerometer and a gyroscope to measure the sudden G-Force shifts experienced in a fall. When a fall is detected, it automatically activates a call for help from your medical alert system. It’s ideal for situations where you may not be conscious when you’ve fallen or too injured by the fall to press the help button, such as a stroke, heart attack, fainting or other condition.<strong><br/></strong>","A medical alert system is a safety net for your senior loved one. As long as they’re wearing the medical alert system, they can get help when they need, and this allows them to stay at home longer and have greater independence. But how do fall detection sensors play into these systems? ","For starters, there are two kinds of medical alert systems: an in-home system and a mobile system. The former is a pendant and base-unit system that only works in the home while the latter goes wherever you go. In both cases, however, the purpose is the same – you press a button and it calls an emergency call center so you can receive help. However, in almost every case, the fall detection sensor is an optional add-on.","<strong>How much do fall detection sensors cost?</strong><br/>","Fall detection sensors aren&#39;t purchased as an individual product. These are add-on options to a medical alert system. On average, a fall detection pendant costs between $10 and $15 per month, though some services offer the option as low as $5 per month. The same price differential applies to mobile systems with fall detection, as these systems are about $10 to $15 per month more than the same device without the sensor activated."]},"id":"04f4603d-3fb6-43e3-8477-87912579d3c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/thtbn7V45exNxMMe9BtyaP.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/best-mobile-systems-gps-alert-medical-alert-reviews/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9ELzYvNzk3NTE0L29yaWdpbmFsL01lZGljYWwtQWxlcnQtU3lzdGVtcy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMy5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/thtbn7V45exNxMMe9BtyaP.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"thtbn7V45exNxMMe9BtyaP","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/thtbn7V45exNxMMe9BtyaP.jpg","alt":""},"id":"036a165f-a2b6-4756-a453-f37d42de4adc","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Are Fall Detection Sensors Worth the Extra Cost?</strong>","At $10 per month for a fall detection add-on, you&#39;re looking at an additional expense of $120 per year on top of your medical alert system costs.

Since the systems and services are more important than the fall detection sensor, we encourage you to also read our guide to the <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-systems\">best medical alert systems</a>.","Every fall detection sensor relies on an accelerometer to measure gravitational force. When you fall, the g-force accelerates until you hit the ground. By using carefully tuned algorithms to account for the expected g-forces experienced in a fall, the fall detection sensor is designed to differentiate between a fall and accidentally being bumped into the refrigerator door. This is the sweet-spot – the point at which a fall detection sensor accurately detects falls but doesn&#39;t cause false alerts for all the little bumps and movements it inevitably experiences in day-to-day activities.","To find the sweet spot, our tester made sure to wear the fall detection sensor as described in the instructions provided. Typically, this meant right over the heart or just above the heart and over the clothing. Then he fell from various angles onto a mattress – face first, backwards, sideways and more. He simulated falls where he tried catching myself, falls where he rolled a little after hitting the ground and falls from a seated position onto a hard floor. Many sensors detected every fall. This was very encouraging. Many others failed to detect anything.","To gauge the sensitivity of the sensors, he dropped the sensors from various heights, starting from four feet and ending at 3 inches. He also swung the devices gently in his hand. Only the most sensitive sensors detected falls in this test. In addition, throughout testing, he noted every time a pendant or mobile device accidentally detected a fall while testing other things and while moving around equipment. These false alerts happened often. In a few instances, one of the mobile device&#39;s fall detection was so sensitive, it detected falls while resting in the charging cradle on the table.","On the other side of the spectrum, four of the ten services had fall detection sensors with failing grades. Our tester rarely gives failing grades to products he tests, but these sensors detected none of the falls.

In addition, falls are often symptomatic of greater medical issues. In essence, a fall experienced after 65 years old is serious. The AAFP argues that “elderly persons who fall are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and eight times more likely to die as a result of the fall.”","Below are the common injuries to look out for and reasons to consider a fall detection sensor:"]},"id":"3fe5e3ee-c19e-4ada-98b0-8fd4af3af3d5","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Hip Fractures: </strong>A hip fracture is the most serious injury from a fall. This is because the femur, the long leg bone that moves within the hip socket, is among the strongest and most difficult bones to break. This means it&#39;s also one of the most difficult bones to heal, especially for anyone over the age of 65. However, a fractured hip is often far more serious than other fractured bones because the fractures occur within a joint and can include ligament damage. The resulting injury and difficult recovery often leads to a fast decline in overall health, a loss of independence and even death.","<strong>Other Fractures:</strong> According to the <a href=\"http://www.iofbonehealth.org/facts-statistics\">Institute of Bone Health</a>, only about 2 percent of fractures experienced in a fall are hips. In fact, 8.9 million fractures are the result of age-related osteoporosis. One in three women and one in five men over 50 experience these kinds of fractures in a fall, with the most resulting in forearm and vertebrae fractures.","<strong>Brain Injuries:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/concussions-increase-dementia-risk-in-older-adults-102914#1\">JAMA Neurology and UC San Franscisco</a> studied 164,661 older patients treated in California&#39;s emergency rooms and inpatient visits. They found that 66 percent had suffered concussions due to falls, and this increased their chance of dementia by 26 percent. In addition, the study found traumatic brain injuries seem to increase the aging process in the brain. Of the seniors with a moderate to severe brain injury sustained in a fall, 20 percent died within two to five years. ","<strong>Psychological Injuries:</strong> Perhaps the most dangerous injury, the psychological impact of a fall can have much bigger implications for seniors. They are more likely to become more cautious and less active, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The fear of sustaining another fall often leads to isolation, depression and loneliness, which actually doubles the chances of a second fall."],"type":"ul"},"id":"c0d0247b-077d-4de6-b251-608e7c507cef","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Fall prevention tips for caregivers</strong>","In “<a href=\"https://www.caregiving.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FallsPrevention_FINAL.pdf\">Fall Prevention Conversation Guide for Caregivers</a>” published by the National Council of Aging, falls in seniors impacts caretakers almost as much as it does for seniors because it requires increased financial burden, support requirements and even increase your risk of depression and anxiety.

Look for shoes with a low heel with a tapered, slip-resistant sole and good ankle support.","<strong>Home modification: </strong>Make sure walkways are clear. Ensure power cords for lamps, phones and other electronic devices are tucked away. Keep regularly used items within easy reach. Install non-slip mats and handrails in the bathtub or shower.","<strong>Encourage use of assistive devices: </strong>There are many assistive devices available to help elderly people – canes, walkers, wheelchairs, power scooters and even recliners that tilt forward to help them out of the chair.","<strong>Visit a falls clinic: </strong>Visit a falls clinic to evaluate the risk factors for your loved one.

When the features were announced in September 2018, Apple claimed the sensor could save lives by alerting people to heart issues. At the time, many people viewed the feature with excitement for the potential, but with a healthy degree of skepticism, in part because hospitals use expensive EKG machines to achieve the same purpose.","When I tested the Apple Watch 4 in late September, the app for the ECG sensor had yet to be released, so I wasn’t able to test it. The app was finally released on December 6, 2018, and by the next day, it may have already saved a life.","According to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/apple-watch-told-46-year-man-irregular-heartbeat/story?id=59726093\">ABCNews</a>, a 45-year-old man from Richmond, Virginia, was alerted to an irregular heartbeat shortly after the app was released. At first, he thought it was defective, so he turned it off. But when it repeatedly alerted him to the irregular heartbeat and after it failed to provide similar readings on his wife and daughter, he went to the hospital to get checked out and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat caused by a weakening of the heart that can result in strokes and heart attacks if left untreated.","It’s situations like this that got people excited about the ECG sensor in the Apple Watch 4. While it’s certainly not a replacement for a proper diagnosis by a doctor, the sensor provides seniors with a tool for catching those early warnings of heart conditions so they can get help before the condition worsens. It’s simply another layer of protection added to the safety net of a medical alert system. And when you combine it with the watch’s excellent fall detection sensor, the Apple Watch 4 is an option worth considering for protecting your senior loved one.","Starting at about $400, the Apple Watch 4 is not cheap, but without a monthly subscription, the long-term costs are actually more affordable.
