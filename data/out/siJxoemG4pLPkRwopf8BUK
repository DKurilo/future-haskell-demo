You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Electrolux EI26SS55GS is attractive, designed for convenience and employs extra features not typically found in a <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a>.","The freezer in this fridge, at first glance, would seem to fit your storage needs. If you study the left side of this side-by-side refrigerator, however, you realize that this freezer is oddly designed. The ice maker is located near the top in the freezer but has an ice cream shelf perched above it and a tiny, tiny shelf to its right for boxed pizzas.","The inside of the door is taken up mostly by the ice dispenser, with three wire racks below and one glass shelf suspended above. This freezer is, in our opinion, designed for a bachelor, not a family of four to six. The wire baskets are shallow and can realistically hold only one or two items. The full-freezer baskets, like the crisper and bins in the refrigerator, are made of Luxury-Glide glass, which is very nice.","As a family of four to six, you purchase a lot of food, both fresh and frozen. The Electrolux unit has a total capacity of 26 cubic feet, with 16.48 cubic feet in the refrigerator and 9.45 cubic feet in the freezer. This side-by-side refrigerator is spacious, with room to hold enough food for a family of six. We do wish, however, that some of that space could have been given to the freezer, which, at 9.45 cubic feet, is not very much room.","This Electrolux side-by-side refrigerator has the following interior storage:"]},"id":"4487654f-ad40-4865-a05a-e3a2175c0a08","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["One can rack","Three crispers, one being a Luxury-Glide, humidity-controlled crisper","One dairy compartment","Two adjustable door bins with a two-liter capacity","Three removable door bins with a one-gallon capacity","Three SpillProof sliding shelves"],"type":"ul"},"id":"be3feabe-84a5-474d-b822-ef359e7adfa6","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The freezer has the following interior storage:"]},"id":"2a55e755-bc97-4d57-933d-c0d7833fbd0c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["One ice cream shelf","One fixed door bin","One glass shelf","Three tilt-out door bins","One small basket with cover","One large glide-out basket","One fixed large basket"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2dba56d3-b76c-4581-9cbf-399ddc2d07a5","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This side-by-side refrigerator is sleek and stylish, made from materials seen in the best refrigerators and used by other top-rated appliance companies. The drawers, shelves, wire bins and door bins are well built and sturdy; they are perfect for holding gallons of milk, ice cream, frozen entrees and much more. These shelves are protected from spills by SpillSafe technology, which will trap liquid and stop it from dripping to other places in your Electrolux refrigerator.","The best side-by-side refrigerators have extra features that make them stand out. This fridge has some of those features too, including:","<strong>Fast freeze</strong> – Just as it sounds, this feature freezes food faster than your freezer typically will. This is a great feature for quickly cooling an item down, such as pop or wine before you serve it to your guests. If you like to bottle your own food, this feature will ensure that bacteria does not grow in your newly canned items.","<strong>Vacation mode</strong> – When you leave on a vacation, you&#39;re obviously not going to unplug your refrigerator, but it would be nice to conserve power somehow. This mode, according to the user manual: &#34;Conserves energy by increasing the time between automatic defrost. This feature is automatically activated during long periods between door openings.&#34;","<strong>Alerts</strong> – If the door has been left ajar on the refrigerator for a certain allotted time, an alarm will sound; if the temperature in your fridge becomes too warm, an alert icon will illuminate, and if your power goes out, the power fail alert will illuminate on the main console and an alarm will sound.","The Electrolux side-by-side refrigerator has an electronic IQ-Touch control panel that has all the standard controls as well as some unique commands. The standard features include the temperature adjustment, child lock, filter-replacement reminder and door alarm.","The water dispenser uses a PureAdvantage water filtration system that makes the water cool, refreshing and delicious. Like several other top-rated refrigerators, the Electrolux features a 9-inch water dispenser, so even a 16-ounce water bottle or pitcher can fit underneath.","Like the best side-by-side refrigerators, the Electrolux EI26SS55GS is Energy Star certified. For 26 cubic feet, this fridge is estimated to use 582 kilowatts of energy yearly, which will cost you around $62 per year in operating costs.","The Electrolux refrigerator has a one-year limited warranty. You should carefully read your user manual and understand the warranty information. According to the user manual, &#34;Electrolux will pay all costs for repairing or replacing any parts of [the] appliance that prove to be defective in materials or workmanship when such appliance is installed, used and maintained in accordance with the provided instructions.&#34;","To obtain support, you can fill out an online form complete with your questions and comments on the Electrolux website. For more direct contact, you can contact the appliance company via telephone. We are disappointed that there is not a live chat support option, and the website&#39;s FAQs section is a little weak. We are pleased, however, with the product videos that are available. The videos are only a few minutes long, but they go over basic features and functions, like how to change the air filter, set the fridge to vacation mode and more."]},"id":"0500257f-6931-46a8-a892-d4183e275242","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"64d44bea-f4ce-4368-b38e-e6d130617916","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Electrolux will look at home in any kitchen, complementing already existing counters and appliances.
