This page, for example, has over 1,600 words, and I typed every single one. Then my editor took a stab at it, which meant more even more typing. Basically, it’s a miracle our fingers haven’t all fallen off yet. We know the value of learning to type quickly and accurately. We’ve also been reviewing typing software since 2005, so we’ve watched the lessons, graphics and learning methods change over the years, becoming much more effective.","Each time we update our typing software recommendations, we gather the most popular and highly rated options to test. We check out the functionality, evaluate the effectiveness of the lessons and keep track of how each program tracks progress. We know learning styles differ – some of our reviewers think games and success-based training are fun and while others prefer a straight-forward approach to improve efficiency at work. We call on a wide range of typists to help test typing software so our recommendations are well-rounded and accurate.","<strong>How Much Does Typing Software Cost?</strong>","Some of the best typing programs are free, though their reporting features are usually limited unless you create an account. Still, their activities can help you improve your speed with practice. You can also purchase and download programs, usually for less than $50. These for-pay applications usually provide more specific recommendations for improvement in their reports. Nowadays, many programs are offered as subscriptions. We recommend choosing a subscription software because you only need to pay for it as long as you need it, which keeps costs low. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent 25 hours tested typing applications, taking note of the number and types of lessons each has. We found that the most effective typing software uses a variety of teaching methods, including timed exercises that promote quick typing and dictation practices that teach the skills you need to transcribe. The more exercises there are, the more useful the software, and having lots lessons to choose from keeps you from getting bored. Some programs allow you to create custom lessons so the software can grow with you as your typing improves.","We also evaluated how intuitive each program’s interface is. The best typing software makes content easy to find so you can customize your learning path to suit your needs. A well-organized user interface also allows you to spend more time polishing your typing skills and less time learning how to use the software.","Feedback is crucial when learning how to type, and the best programs let you know which specific keys and fingers you struggle with. Detailed reporting provides insight into which lessons you need to revisit and can identify lessons you may not need to complete to advance your skills.","<strong>What Is Important When Shopping for Typing Software?</strong>","Ease of Use<br/>It can be stressful mastering a new skill. While you’re learning, you don’t need the added stress of dealing with a less-than-intuitive interface, so it’s crucial to find a typing program with a simple, clear-cut layout. We found that the best programs have a clean, modern interface that is well organized, with tabs, buttons and other functions clearly labeled. You should be able to find lessons, quizzes, games and reports quickly, and mid-lesson instructions should be clear and easy to follow.","Occupation-Relevant Content<br/>Being able to type quickly and accurately makes you more valuable in the workforce and looks great on your resume. Knowing how to use all parts of the keyboard, including the number and symbol keys, can help you type more efficiently while you’re at work. It also makes search engine  and social media use go a little more smoothly, as well.","Most beginner and intermediate courses don’t let you practice with the types of content the average adult would encounter in a professional setting, but Typesy and KeyBlaze both have exercises that can teach you how to type materials such as legal documents and marketing content, and they even have 10-key exercises to improve your data entry skills.","Alternative Keyboards<br/>The vast majority of people learn to type on the standard English  QWERTY keyboard. However, there are a few alternatives out there that claim to be more ergonomic or efficient. Type Fu and Master Key both include lessons for the Dvorak keyboard layout, which is the second most popular type of English keyboard.","Licensing &amp; Installs<br/>If you plan to use your typing software on a single computer, there’s no need to stress over licences and installs. However, if you think you may need to use it on multiple computers, double check that the program you want to purchase allows for that. Some offer two or three installs with a single license, while others lock it down to one. A few have no limitations, allowing you to access the program as you please. Bulk licenses for schools or businesses may also be available at a discount if you talk with the manufacturer.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Learning to type is relatively straightforward, but sometimes the program you are using may not be. And should you have a question or concern, it’s nice to know that there are tutorials, FAQs and other helpful resources available to you whenever you need them.
