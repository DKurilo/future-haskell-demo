It can be programmed for hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. This <a href=\"/best-hearing-aids\">hearing aid</a> is designed to help improve hearing quality for everyday situations so you can understand and participate in conversations.","This digital hearing aid uses the AutoSense OS, an operating system that intuitively adapts to your sound environment. It switches between eight channels that adjust automatically to your background. This hearing aid comes in 11 colors so you can choose the one that best matches your hair or complexion color, or your personality.","With its tinnitus balance feature, the hearing aid generates a signal that can help combat the ringing in your ears. The SoundRecover feature works to restore high-frequency sounds around you while the auto acclimatization feature increases the amplification automatically. It also has a QuickSync feature that is beneficial if you wear two hearing aids. With just one touch, you can control the settings of both hearing aids. To block out annoyances, such as a humming sound that comes from an appliance or noise in traffic, the V-30 has a NoiseBlock feature that eliminates these sounds without affecting your ability to hear conversations.","This hearing aid is Bluetooth-ready to sync with your devices. With additional accessories, you can enjoy full wireless connectivity. For instance, the Easy Call II accessory lets you connect to any wireless phone. Phonak offers a RemoteControl app so you can adjust the settings discreetly from your smartphone or tablet.","The Audeo V-30 hearing aid uses a size 13 battery and offers reduced battery consumption. It comes in three power levels including xS, xP and xSP plus for varying degrees of hearing loss. While the manufacturer states it is water-resistant and protected against dust, there&#39;s no IP rating listed. With the purchase of this hearing aid, you&#39;ll have a three-year warranty with a two-year warranty against loss or damage.","The Phonak Audeo V-30 is a digital hearing aid aimed at improving the quality of hearing you experience during conversations. It is designed to eliminate background noise automatically so you can focus on those you are talking to. With its numerous features, including the ability to connect via Bluetooth and to wireless devices, it can be a good overall solution for those with mild to moderate hearing loss who simply need a boost."]},"id":"ee7f0854-0813-4718-aedc-dd82fe8cbd45","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66643","url":"/phonak-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-21T20:45:57Z","datePublished":"2015-08-21T20:45:57Z","name":"Phonak Audeo V-30","synopsis":"The Phonak Audeo V-30 is a receiver-in-canal hearing aid similar to Audicus Uno and Ovation.
