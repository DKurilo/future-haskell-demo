The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-car-battery-chargers\">Car Battery Chargers</a> here.</em>","The Duracell Powerpack 300 is larger than most car battery boosters, and for good reason. It not only jump-starts your vehicle battery but also has two power outlets and two USB ports to provide power to your work tools, lights and mobile devices. This is a great multifunctional charger for automobile owners, campers, emergency preparedness kits and remote construction workers. Unfortunately, with only 120 cold cranking amps (CCA), its jump-starting power is limited.","Only 120 CCA is at the low end of power. The best car battery chargers have a CCA ranking of 500 or more. The Powerpack will likely struggle to turn over large engines, which can leave you in a bind.","Really, though, jump-starting is this device&#39;s secondary role. It&#39;s designed as an alternative power source, providing juice for all of your electronic devices. It has two AC power outlets. Yes, that&#39;s AC outlets, just like the wall outlets in your home. The Powerpack 300 has a built-in inverter, which means you can plug just about anything into it.","This auto battery booster has many safety features, including spark-resistant clamps, insulated cables and overload protection. All of these safety features protect you and the battery from the large amount of current running through the jump-starter to your vehicle&#39;s battery. It also has an automatic shut-off feature that stops the unit from overcharging. This is not the same as overload protection, which prevents dangerous electrical feedback that results from connecting to the wrong terminals during a jump-start. Overcharge protection allows you to leave the Powerpack 300 plugged into a wall socket without the worry of overheating and overcharging.","This battery booster is large, weighing 32 pounds. It&#39;s the least portable car battery charger on our lineup, but it has so many built-in tools and features that the payoff may be worth it. In addition to the two AC outlets, there are two USB ports. It also has a built-in LED flashlight, battery tester and air compressor. If you were to be stranded, the Powerpack would ensure that all of your power needs are taken care of for quite a while.","In addition to its many features, the Powerpack comes with a one-year warranty. That&#39;s not as long as you get with some car battery chargers, but it&#39;s not terrible either. Some manufacturers offer up to five-year warranties, while others only have 90-day warranties."]},"id":"652c365a-882d-490e-bd9f-e633be9c8bd2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ab8949e7-7840-4edb-9668-58c70faf7b21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While it lacks the charging strength of our top-ranked battery chargers, the versatility of the Duracell Powerpack 300 makes it a great portable power supply.
