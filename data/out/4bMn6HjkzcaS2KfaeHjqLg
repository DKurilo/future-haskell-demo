Parents of young children will often use a <a href=\"/best-nanny-cams\">nanny cam</a> to protect those children, and the newest effective trend in protecting teen drivers is with car cameras. While a nanny cam is a hidden device, a car camera is a small black device about the size of a deck of cards that you place on the rearview mirror, in visible sight of your teen driver. Part of the car cameras  effectiveness is that your teen knows it s there.","<strong>Why Your Teen Needs a Car Camera</strong>","The statistics on teen drivers&#39; death rates from motor vehicle crashes are terrifying. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among 15 to 20 year olds, with 16 year olds being three times more likely to die in a car crash than the average of all other drivers. In 2008, 81 percent of teen deaths in car crashes were passenger deaths.","Studies also found that death rates for 16- and 17-year-old drivers increase exponentially with each additional teenage passenger in the car. These statistics are scary for every parent with a child anywhere near getting his or her license. Far too many teens have died in motor vehicle crashes, and prominent researchers have determined that car cameras are highly effective at preventing teen mortality in car crashes.","<strong>How Car Cameras Work</strong>","The small camera placed on the rearview mirror can record footage from both inside and outside the vehicle. However, the footage is only saved when a teen driver has a safety event that is characterized by abrupt stops, bumps or other physical triggers. That footage is then wirelessly uploaded to a website where parents are notified of the event and can log in to view what happened.","<strong>Why Car Cameras Work</strong>","Car cameras are proven effective at drastically improving the behavior of even the most distracted, unruly teens. A research study from the University of Iowa found that teens who were aware of the presence of a car camera had 88 percent fewer safety events than another group of recorded teens who did not know they were the subjects of video surveillance did.","It s the same principle behind why 16 year olds get in so many more accidents compared to 15 year olds. Fifteen year olds are only able to hold a learner s permit, which stipulates that a qualified driver must be in the car with them at all times. They are being watched at all times, usually by a parent. Once teens turn 16, they can get their full license, drive without any supervision and are far more likely to be distracted, exercise poor judgment or drive irresponsibly. In a way, the cameras take the place of a parent, ensuring that teens drive to the best of their abilities at all times, which hopefully will protect them from dangerous accidents.","<strong>How Much Do Car Cameras Cost?</strong>","Car cameras cost several hundred dollars and there is a small monthly subscription fee to use the websites where parents can log in to view recorded safety-event footage. However, legislation in some states requires auto insurance companies to offer discounts to any parent who buys and installs a car camera for their teen since these cameras are so effective at preventing crashes.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"076dfdb0-87c7-4165-9204-96fa1b389d3f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6200","url":"/car-cameras-for-teen-drivers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-drew","url":"/author/jessica-drew","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Drew","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"rhh7ib7xwNCRKbyjPJTKmB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-29T16:50:16Z","datePublished":"2011-06-29T16:50:16Z","name":"Car Cameras for Teen Drivers","synopsis":"You may have never heard of car cameras for teenage drivers, but they are certainly a great idea by all accounts.","review":{},"strapline":"You may have never heard of car cameras for teenage drivers, but they are certainly a great idea by all accounts.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-06-29T16:52:03Z","id":"4bMn6HjkzcaS2KfaeHjqLg","meta":{"title":"Car Cameras for Teen Drivers","description":"It&rsquo;s a fact that car cameras save the lives of teens and they are a good idea for any new teenage driver."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:57:51Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/W7mUPf5qpf4Zov8FbGdWR8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:51Z","mimeType":"","name":"6200-car-cameras-for-teen-drivers.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6200-car-cameras-for-teen-drivers.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:51Z","id":"W7mUPf5qpf4Zov8FbGdWR8","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7mUPf5qpf4Zov8FbGdWR8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Car Cameras for Teen Drivers","description":"It&rsquo;s a fact that car cameras save the lives of teens and they are a good idea for any new teenage driver."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/W7mUPf5qpf4Zov8FbGdWR8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:51Z","mimeType":"","name":"6200-car-cameras-for-teen-drivers.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6200-car-cameras-for-teen-drivers.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:51Z","id":"W7mUPf5qpf4Zov8FbGdWR8","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7mUPf5qpf4Zov8FbGdWR8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Car Cameras for Teen Drivers","description":"It&rsquo;s a fact that car cameras save the lives of teens and they are a good idea for any new teenage driver."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/car-cameras-for-teen-drivers","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:51Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:51Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
