The DeVilbiss iGo has an informative interface makes it easy to check on things like your flow rate, the machine’s battery level, its status level and various other alerts. The device provides enough detail that you’ll always know whether you’re getting the right level of oxygen or even if the machine needs to be serviced, instead of having an issue pop up out of the blue.","Unlike the <a href=\"/inogen-review\">Inogen One G4</a> and the <a href=\"/caire-medical-review\">Caire Medical Airsep Focus</a>, which weight only a few pounds, the 3-liter iGO concentrator is heavier than many others out there. It weighs 19 pounds, so it won’t be as easy to carry around. However, you can opt for a rolling carry case so you can still you take it with you wherever you go.","Three handles in various convenient locations make it simple pick up or turn over the device whenever you need. There are openings in the carrying case that let you attach a cannula of up to 50 feet, as well as change settings on the interface. It’s also simple to change the filter with the easy-access filter compartment door.","You have great control over oxygen output levels with this device, as you can change the flow rate from 1 liter per minute (LPM) all the way up to 6 LPM in 1 LPM increments. Furthermore, the oxygen concentrator has an oxygen-sensing device that helps regulate the quantity of oxygen that goes out with each breath on a regular basis.","Another impressive feature of the iGo is that it can automatically switch from one power source to another in case of a power failure or if your battery dies. When you use your entire battery, you can expect it to fully recharge in about three hours, which is a fairly quick time in comparison with other units.","With such a detailed interface, the DeVilbiss iGo portable oxygen concentrator gives you extended control over the device and lets you know the instant any sort of problem arises. Its built-in handles and optional rolling case give you options when you need to leave the house, and its ability to automatically switch power sources provides peace of mind in case of an emergency."]},"id":"ee1a39ba-2916-41c5-b713-4fdbbb9a58de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68647","url":"/devilbiss-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alexander-eriksen","url":"/author/alexander-eriksen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Alexander Eriksen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"hwemruvZsTXWMqRixKJ49","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T20:45:25Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T20:45:25Z","name":"DeVilbiss iGo","synopsis":"Using a portable oxygen concentrator shouldn’t make your life more complicated.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Using a portable oxygen concentrator shouldn’t make your life more complicated.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-28T20:45:25Z","id":"JpXQEAiHaCe7HrVsbEToCR","meta":{"title":"DeVilbiss iGo Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"With the DeVilbiss iGo portable oxygen concentrator, you can enjoy pulse or continuous oxygen flow as well as a variety of power and alert options.
