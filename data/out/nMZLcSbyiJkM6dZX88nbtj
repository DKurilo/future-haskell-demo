It’s a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1247-best-cheap-tvs.html\">cheap TV</a> compared to other 50-inch models. Pairing the Roku interface with the TCL flat panel makes this one of the most enjoyable inexpensive smart TVs to navigate. Even the least tech savvy users can feel confident finding their way through the uncomplicated menu.","There are other TVs in our lineup with better picture quality, as we found through extensive image quality testing. Looking at the scores from our blind testing group, the image quality is best described as average. During &#34;Gravity&#34; many of our panelists felt the TCL was a little dull, but they were impressed with the smooth picture during action scenes. This is one of the few TVs in our lineup that has a 120Hz refresh rate, where the majority of them refresh at 60Hz.","Other cheap smart TVs are more vivid than the TCL. Also, the movie mode on the TCL is more dim than others in our comparison. We also noticed some fairly prominent haloing during moments with extreme light-dark contrast in the movie &#34;Gravity,&#34; despite the TV&#39;s  local-dimming technology.","Our observations during the image quality testing were confirmed with Calman software. The contrast ratio doesn&#39;t compare well with some of the best TVs under $500 in our review. In fact, it ranked near the bottom of our lineup in both contrast and color accuracy.","Along with the Roku smart interface that is easy to navigate, the remote is equally comfortable to hold and use. It is small and easy to control with one hand. There are few buttons so the layout is clutter free. Near the bottom of the remote are quick access buttons to popular streaming applications like Netflix and Pandora Radio.","On the back of the TV panel you&#39;ll find three HDMI ports along with one USB port. Having three HDMI ports is standard practice on smart TVs today. This provides enough inputs to connect all of your media devices to your TV at once.","You can find this model of TCL in 50-inch, 40-inch model and a 32-inch versions. As you&#39;d expect, the smaller models are less expensive. The 32-inch screen is perfect when space is limited in a bedroom or on a kitchen countertop."]},"id":"2a3d7bca-1a56-4ee9-b92f-9918c6b9dea8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ec3f8373-0de2-4ca1-b26d-771f72847ae8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are a handful of other TVs in our lineup that tested better for image quality, but not many have an interface that is as convenient and simple to use as the Roku interface.
