The washtub has a capacity of 3.4 cubic feet, a standard size for smaller machines. However, it&#39;s made of porcelain, which is less durable than stainless steel and prone to damage that might cause rusting.","You get a choice of 11 wash cycles to wash your laundry. The cycles include four casual cycles, two normal cycles and two delicate cycles in addition to a hand wash cycle. Although it doesn&#39;t have an automatic load sensor, you have the option of three water levels. The range of options means you can find a combination that will save energy and water as well as keep your clothing from wearing out too quickly over multiple washes.","Other wash options include four temperature settings and three soil levels. The unit has a sensor that will adjust the temperature to keep it consistent according to what option you&#39;ve selected.","The console also has a cycle status bar that tells you where your laundry is in its cycle. This top loader uses a dual action agitator, which uses a two-part agitator to give your laundry a good even wash. If you like to use fabric softener in your loads, the Amana has an automatic dispensing option that will put in the softener at the right time.","This top-loading washing machine is not Energy Star qualified. Both the yearly $50 operating cost and 470 kilowatt-hours of electricity use are on the high end for top loaders.","The Amana also lacks a great warranty. You can only count on the warranty for one year, which covers both parts and labor for any part of the machine that fails during the period. However, we would have liked to see a longer warranty for the motor and the wash drum, the two most-used parts of the washer.","To contact Amana, you have the option of calling, filling out an email form or using live chat. The company also has the user manual and other documents like installation instructions and the warranty description online for you to download."]},"id":"28a14623-fbb7-4a5b-9522-bb7f0ea128b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"87ec5a33-ca53-4616-917d-839fadf00338","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Amana NTW4700YQ doesn&#39;t offer as many cycle options as the best top-load washers, but it does have a fair enough range of 11 cycle options to cover your basic household laundry needs."]},"id":"4c702e82-a5d8-47bb-9091-d7e65b2c4eff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56285","url":"/amana-traditional-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-04-27T01:21:12Z","datePublished":"2013-04-27T01:21:12Z","name":"Amana Traditional","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
