We want you to have the knowledge necessary to make an informed purchase no matter how much you know about HDMI cables. With 15 hours of research and years of experience to compile what you need to know, we’re here to help you buy the right cable for your needs.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We spent 15 hours researching product descriptions, manufacturer sites, HDMI.org, user reviews and anything else that you might run into on your search for an HDMI cable. Then we took our wealth of information and compiled need-to-know content for your purchase decision along with technical information not particularly helpful in your HDMI search. We only present you with the pertinent information so you can make a buying decision with confidence. We found that the best quality of an HDMI cable is its reliability. With the all-or-nothing nature of HDMI cables, the trustworthiness of the manufacturer and distributor is important. We chose the most reliable and trustworthy products to recommend so you can find the best fit for your needs at the best price.","<strong>Buying an HDMI Cable</strong>","If you recently invested in a shiny new 4K TV you may not need to buy new HDMI cables for 4K content. If you think you need new cables just because you’ve upgraded other aspects of your home entertainment system, we encourage you to try your cables first with the new tech. There’s a good chance that they work. If your data needs are a little more intensive or if you need brand-new cables for another reason, here’s a breakdown of HDMI cable specifications.","<strong>Types of HDMI Cables</strong><br/>According to HDMI.org, there are several different classifications and certifications for HDMI cables. The main difference between cable types is how much data they are proven to handle. A standard HDMI cable is rated to support 1080i or 720p. A high-speed cable can handle that plus 1080p to 4K content. Some high-speed HDMI cables carry the Premium label, which is an additional certification that ensures the cable was tested for reliability with 4K content up to 60Hz. Finally, the Ultra High Speed HDMI cable supports bandwidths up to 48 Gbps, making it suitable for 8K video with HDR. Most people need a high-speed HDMI cable to cover their needs, but there are definitely options available for every type of media connection.","Standard, high-speed, premium high-speed and ultra high speed cables can all also carry a dedicated HDMI Ethernet channel, which allows the cable to make network connections with compatible devices. This is rare, though, as most devices use other ways of connecting to networks.","<strong>Price</strong><br/>Any HDMI cable within a certain category is tested and performs at the exact same standard as every other HDMI cable in the same category. Any high-speed HDMI gives you the exact same quality as another high-speed HDMI cable. Our best advice when choosing an HDMI cable is to find the cheapest one that fits your needs. We found great high-speed HDMI cables available for less than $4 each. Thinner cables, active cables and cables with higher certifications cost much more. ","<strong>Build Quality</strong><br/>Though cables that work will not deliver better sound or video than any other cable that works, some cables are built better than others. The build quality, we found, is the most important factor determining whether a cable will work and how long it will work. This is especially true for longer cables; a better build quality in longer cables can make a difference. We find it important to delineate here that not all expensive cables are built better than inexpensive ones. The HDMI cables we recommend are all from trusted brands that produce reliable cables. Basically, look for products with a lot of positive reviews and avoid products that cost substantially more than similar items for no apparent reason.","If you’re planning on running HDMI cables through your walls, it’s important that you check the fire-safety rating of your chosen cables. CL2 and CL3 ratings are usually recommended for in-wall use, but you should check with your insurance company or local building codes to be sure.","<strong>Active vs. Passive Cables</strong><br/>All of the HDMI cables we reviewed are passive cables, meaning they are bi-directional and act simply as a pipeline to transfer data between devices. Some HDMI cables are active cables, meaning they include extra tech to ensure high-speed quality over longer distances or with thinner cables. They are directional cables that boost signals and usually require some sort of power source.
