USB cable and SD card printing are both easy connection options for your home or office. MakerBot also has many different support options, including tutorial videos and FAQs for you to peruse.","The size of the objects you can print with the Replicator 2 can reach up to 6 x 6 x 11 inches. There are different 3D printing speeds you can choose from, and the resolution, or layer height, is about 0.1 mm. So no matter what print speed you select, your prints will turn out great.","When you buy a 3D printer, be sure you know beforehand what you&#39;ll be printing. The Replicator 2 only prints with PLA filament, which is better for the environment than its alternatives and doesn&#39;t require a heated platform. ABS is not supported by the Replicator 2, which is problematic if you want to use a higher-quality, more durable plastic. Only one print head also means you can only print with one color at a time.","The steel design of the Replicator 2 keeps it from shaking and vibrating while your 3D designs are printing. An LCD screen is also mounted on the front of the chassis so you can print from a SD card and quickly change settings or choose prints.","If you have any problems with the Replicator 2, you can reach MakerBot via email, telephone or through the blog. There are also FAQs, tutorials and a manual you can reference for extra help. A six month warranty is avaliable for the Replicator 2 as well.","This home 3D printer connects to your Windows, Mac or Linux home computer via a USB cable. You&#39;ll need to have a dedicated computer, however, as you can&#39;t unplug your computer until the print is finished. For added connectivity, it also has an SD card slot that you can use to transfer files between the printing device and your computer.","The Replicator 2 includes all of the mechanical components you need to start creating right away. It comes with a power supply, USB cable and the software you will need in order to print objects. To actually print, though, you&#39;ll need to purchase filament; the Replicator 2 does not come with a starter cartridge."]},"id":"3a2bbf49-d7e2-4616-9de8-48f565e43dd2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e1ae840a-a63d-4310-ba3d-ab3517415419","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Replicator 2 will add luster to your workspace with its powder-coated steel and polished good looks.
