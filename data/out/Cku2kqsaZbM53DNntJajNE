You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool Duet is another solid entry in Whirlpool’s line of  <a href=\"/best-dryers\">clothes dryers</a>, While it’s not as pricey as some of smart dryers on the market, it’s also not cheap. This dryer lacks smart technology, Whirlpool’s own Smart Front Load, but has just about everything else. If you are in that camp of consumers who feels that smart technology is overrated, but still like a dryer with some extras, this is the dryer for you.","It has a great ultra-modern look, offset by a traditional cycle dial in front. With 10 cycles to choose from, this device should do anything you need it to. The steam cycle is one of several uncommon features, seen mostly in high end machines. This laundry dryer’s steam cycle functions nicely. In several cases, we found that wrinkling to be minimal and this electric dryer largely eliminated the need for ironing.","This dryer has a Wrinkle Shield feature which means your clothes will receive an occasional toss for up to 150 minutes after the cycle ends to reduce wrinkling, if you happen to be away when your clothes are done drying. This dryer has a steam option along with the Wrinkle Shield to further guard against wrinkling. While it doesn’t completely prevent wrinkling, it will minimize it and the steam will keep your clothes fresh and help remove unwanted odors. An option that allows you to spray mist over your clothes, along with the steam and tumble, will guard against static.","The noise reduction system effectively minimizes noise so the dryer won’t vibrate throughout the house as dryers can tend to do. This one will operate at a low hum. Unless you want a dryer you can control from your smartphone, this should meet or exceed all of your drying needs.","Like other high-end dryers from Whirlpool this electric dryer has advanced energy-efficient features that go beyond the average for dryers. The EcoBoost option and Eco Monitor will display the energy use and overall eco performance, letting you extend the cycle time to conserve on energy. Not only does this protect the environment, but it will let you save some money on utility bills. The advanced moisture sensor will immediately stop the clothing cycles when the clothes are dry, so you don’t waste energy over-drying.","Whirlpool customer service options include live chat, email and an online form for questions and comments. They have a one-year warranty for parts and labor, including any issues you have along the way. You can download user manuals from their main website, which will answer many of your questions."]},"id":"91d9f4ae-fb48-4689-9010-c48972a854ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e90ac7d-129c-4216-bd18-a881494c586e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Duet is a nice looking, modern dryer that has all the features most people will want with the possible exception of smart functionality.
