It&#39;s not perfect, but no speaker is. Its midrange was more accurate than that of nine other speakers we tested, which means it&#39;s balanced and detailed. When you pair this with the excellent high-range accuracy, it makes for a good balance of shape and detail in the music you listen to.","The Infinity 9623ix’s low-frequency accuracy wasn’t as impressive, receiving a B-.
