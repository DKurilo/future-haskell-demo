When we tested circular saws, we judged the tools by comparing their design, cutting features, power features and support options. Each product was subjected to a battery of tests, and results were combined with the subjective experiences of our team of reviewers.","We also reached out to the maker community. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture\">maker culture</a> combines do-it-yourselfers with technology enthusiasts to create original items for themselves, family, friends and clients. Vincent Ferrari of Suffern, New York has a maker studio with an exhaustive array of tools “literally every [woodworking] tool under the sun with the exception of a jointer.” He creates everything from game and TV show props to unique picture frames, bookshelves and much more.","When we discussed circular saws, he told us that he mainly uses them to cut down sheet goods like plywood and media density fireboard. He said he bought his DeWalt model because it fit well with the other tools he had from that brand. However, he mentioned that he would probably pick differently now. He expressed a preference for models with a brushless motor, a larger blade and more power.","When asked about how much he would pay for a quality circular saw, he said he doesn’t buy tools on price. “If a good tool is a good tool, I don’t care how much it costs, and I think a lot of people are that way,” but followed up with “it’s not a non-factor, but I care more about value than I do about price.”","He emphasized that you’ll need to invest in a high-quality blade. In his experience, the blades that come included with most circular saws are inadequate. Spending the money to get a high-quality blade means that it will wear out less quickly and deliver a better-quality cut.","We also looked into the best safety practices while using a circular saw. Circular saws are dangerous and can cause major injuries, especially to your hands. If you misuse your tool, you can end up slicing off a finger or cutting into your palm, which can disable you or require surgery to repair.","A <a href=\"https://traumamanagement.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-2897-4-11\">2010 study published in the Journal of Trauma Management and Outcomes</a> stated that circular saw injuries cause an average of 8.8 days of in-house treatment and an average of 52 months of follow up. Additionally, subjects of the study missed an average of 14.8 weeks of work. So, it’s financial blow as well as a physical one.","According to the <a href=\"https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/power_tools/saw_circ.html\">Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety</a>, you should wear safety glasses, a face shield, dust mask and hearing protection when you operate a circular saw. Make sure you take every precaution to protect yourself when using a circular saw.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We subjected each circular saw we reviewed to a battery of hands-on tests. Our team of reviewers verified the accuracy of the manufacturer&#39;s specifications and tested the circular saws for accuracy, power and ease of use.","Testing involved cutting 2-by-4s and plywood, similar to what a typical consumer would be working with, at various angles and depths. We assessed the sawdust/dust chute effectiveness, laser guide visibility, accuracy and wood splintering.","These tests gave us a feel for each tool and firsthand knowledge of the advanced features that make them easier, safer and more effective than their counterparts. Part of testing was evaluating the subjective aspects of these tools, such as using the electric brake and checking the blade stability to make sure it does not need tightening frequently.","We also recorded decibel readings to compare the volume of each tool. We compared the splintering on each tool using a high, medium and low standard. We also cut plywood, allowing longer cuts to check for laser and LED light accuracy, sawdust collection and general handling.","As a control test, we exchanged the blades that came with the saws for generic store-bought blades, verifying that the cuts were no different using other blades and that the saw itself performed consistently. Our testing also looked at how easy each tool was to assemble.","<strong>Key Features to Look for in the Best Circular Saws</strong>","Design<br/>It’s easy to think that sheer power makes the best circular saw. In fact, it’s the smaller things, such as dust chutes, cord length, spindle locks, rip fences and electric brakes, that make all the difference. A saw can cut at 6,200 rpm, but if it doesn’t include any of these features, it’s going to be a pain to use in the long run. These features enhance the durability and versatility of the tool in a profound way. An accessory as simple as an included carrying case makes the saw more portable, and therefore more useful.","Cutting Features<br/>The most important test we conducted was for handling efficiency. Our reviewers used each saw for several hours and compared their experiences to come up with a percentage score. Additionally, they looked at how deeply you can cut at 90- and 45-degree angles. They verified the bevel capacity, the wider the better, so you can cut at whatever degree you want. Positive bevel stops are also an important consideration, since they allow you to quickly adjust the shoe for common angles.","Power Features<br/>Our reviewers verified the maximum rpm produced by each saw, which ranged from 5,000 rpms to 6,200 rpms. A higher rpm simply means that the blades turn faster, and while that’s great for making smooth, fast cuts, it’s not absolutely essential; for general practice, 5,000 rpms will do for most around-the-house jobs. Higher rpms should be reserved for heavy-duty tasks.","How Much Does a Circular Saw Cost?<br/>Based on our research, the average price for a circular saw is about $118 dollars. The units we compared range from $170 to $47. While the most impressive machine we reviewed, the Makita 5007MGA, was also the most expensive at $170, we found great value and good performance in models that are below the average price, such as the SKIL 5280-01 priced at around $63.","<strong>How Thick Can a Circular Saw Cut?</strong>","Circular saw blades range from about 6 1/4 inches to 10 1/2 inches in diameter. Generally speaking, the most common blade diameter is 7 1/4 inches, which can cut wood up to 2 inches thick. You can also cut materials up to 2 inches thick with a 6 1/2-inch blade, but 7 1/4 inches is still the most popular.","&#34;They&#39;re just more common. It&#39;s the de facto standard,&#34; said Paul Mayer, a Minnesota-based woodworker and tool reviewer you can see in action on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ToolMetrix?fbclid=IwAR01RKI1FRWxwtEvl4DWg44k1ymh4bIlBkBdYreVey1N14ZNhjrnfj11nZY\">Tool Metrix</a> channel on YouTube.","Still, less common, larger blades may come in handy if you work on projects that involve larger wood beams. Mayer mentioned the thick slabs needed for building tables and benches specifically.","Beyond size, there are other factors to consider as you choose the right blade for the job. Look for masonry blades when you need to cut brick or cinder block and tile-cutting blades for your flooring project. Also, you may need blades made of specialized, durable materials for certain projects. There are high-speed steel blades, which stay sharper longer than normal blades, as well as carbide-tipped blades that stay sharp even longer. Diamond tips can improve the quality of cuts on tiles.  ","<strong>Can I Use a Circular Saw Instead of a Miter Saw?</strong>","The answer is yes, but beginners beware. Novices are probably not the best candidate for a solely circular saw project. Circular saws are much more versatile than miter saws, but they also require a bit more skill, at least for certain jobs. Some of the other differences between these two saws are obvious but still worth pointing out, especially if you are buying your first saw of any kind.
