This model has a lot to offer, including the Fresh Spin option, which keeps clothing from matting and mildewing by tossing it around between the time the cycle ends and the time you can move it to the dryer. It can do that for up to six hours, which is really great for someone who is trying to do several chores at once. Not everyone has time to wait for the exciting conclusion of each load before living life.","Though not quite as energy efficient as some of the other front-loading washers in our lineup, there is a lot to like about this Maytag washing machine."]},"id":"11e87a6c-fedf-42a2-8b50-d2ed1fb1bcc0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Efficiency"},"id":"07b53e92-1891-4d8c-a6c7-3b8c0fe53752","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Maytag front-load washer will automatically dispense detergent, bleach and fabric softener at the right times during each cycle.

There are 10 of them – everything from a silk cycle to a setting for comforters.  Adding a second rinse is a cinch, which will be great for those sensitive to detergent. A simple toggle switch controls the addition of a second rinse that will be the same temperature as the normal rinse.","With the Maytag MaxExtract feature, you will see clothing come out extra dry after a maximum-speed spin. That will mean less time in the dryer and less energy use."]},"id":"edf597c5-a293-448a-82c7-1a5b8c80a8e2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"9a3daddb-ac86-42b8-85eb-b500e3ef5667","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Maytag front load washer is manufactured not only with an optional pedestal, but with a couple of different pedestals to choose from.
