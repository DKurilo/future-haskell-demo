You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Both models of the T-KJr2U are identical except for venting needs and front vent placement. The outdoor model does not require venting attachments because it sits outside the house. The T-KJr2U complies with ultra-low nitrogen oxide regulations and can use both natural gas and propane. It is 9.5 inches thick, 20.25 inches wide and weighs 37 pounds. The heater is compact enough to mount on the wall and has a solid metal construction with 0.75-inch water connections located at the bottom.","Takagi includes a remote control with the T-KJr2U. The remote not only switches the heater on and off and controls water temperature, but also has a display that shows error codes. You can quickly troubleshoot the heater with the diagnostic code generated. The T-KJr2U is a noncondensing gas <a href=\"/best-tankless-water-heaters\">tankless water heater</a> with a copper heat exchanger and modulating gas burner. It has an air-to-fuel sensor that optimizes the mixture of air and gas burned; this improves the efficiency of the unit while reducing emissions.","Safety features of the Takagi tankless water heater include an overheat cutoff fuse, a freeze protection system, a water temperature control and a high-limit switch exhaust. The T-KJr2U has a maximum heat requirement of 140,000 Btu and a minimum of 15,000 Btu. It has an energy factor of 0.82, which is average for a natural gas-powered water heater. It requires 120 volts and consumes 138 watts of electricity. However, it does not carry Energy Star certification.","With the included remote, you can set the T-KJr2U to any one of nine different temperature settings, ranging from 100 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The unit has an activation flow rate of 0.4 gpm and a minimum of 0.5 gpm. Its peak flow rate is 6.6 gpm, and it hits this speed when the temperature difference between the cold water supplied and hot water it produces is no more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit.","This water heater is only powerful enough to supply hot water to two bathrooms in warm climates. In cold climates, it can only serve one bathroom. In addition, to use the Takagi T-KJr2U as a propane tankless water heater, you need to pay more for the right conversion kit that delivers the appropriate gas pressure. Although this is a gas-powered water heater, it also needs electricity for ignition and for powering its sensors.","The Takagi T-KJr2U is a small, well-featured gas tankless water heater with a space-saving design. However, as a gas heater that also uses electricity, it can be expensive to maintain, and it is only powerful enough for small apartments."]},"id":"4c23e925-3472-45dd-a4ea-5b508a0c40e9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65898","url":"/takagi-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-25T15:18:55Z","datePublished":"2015-06-25T15:18:55Z","name":"Takagi T-KJr2U","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-06-25T15:18:55Z","id":"ZHpUCV6sHajX9iyUSxa5wj","meta":{"title":"Takagi T-KJr2U Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Takagi T-KJr2U runs on natural gas, comes in two models and has a peak flow rate of 6.6 gpm.
