The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\"><em>top-load washing machines</em></a><em> here.</em>","The LG Ultra Large Capacity High Efficiency WT5070CW is a top-loading washing machine that&#39;s both large and energy-efficient like its name implies. It has a tub capacity of 4.7 cubic feet, which should be more than enough to handle large loads.","This top-load washer is Energy Star qualified. It has a yearly operating cost of approximately $18 and an estimated energy usage of 170 kilowatt-hours. You can also use the cold wash option, which saves more energy by running cycles with cold water.","The other 12 wash options on this machine offer convenient settings like delay wash, which lets you set the cycle start for up to 19 hours later. This top loader has vibration control, so if you&#39;d rather set it to run at night when energy rates might be cheaper, you can do so without disturbing anyone&#39;s sleep. There is also a custom program option. You can save a combination of your most frequently used settings for easy reuse. Strangely, though, there isn&#39;t a delicate cycle, but the variety of options let you make do without it.","There are also 12 wash cycles. There are separate cycles for colors and whites, as well as some specialty cycles for sportswear, baby items and towels. You also have the option for a convenient speed wash cycle, in case you need a laundry load done quickly, and a tub clean cycle to keep your washer, and subsequently your laundry, clean and fresh. If you have any laundry with particularly tough stains, there&#39;s also a stain treatment option. You have three soil levels and five temperature settings to customize your wash loads further.","LG offers a one-year warranty on the overall machine, a 10-year warranty on the motor and a lifetime warranty for the stainless steel wash drum. That&#39;s the best warranty you&#39;ll find on any top-load washing machine we reviewed.","This top-load washer includes LG&#39;s SmartDiagnosis feature. If you run into any issues with your machine, you can follow a few simple steps to transmit information from your machine, through your smartphone to LGâ€™s help and support. You don&#39;t have to struggle to explain what&#39;s going on or run through numerous troubleshooting options.","You can contact LG for help and support through phone, email or a live chat option on their website. You can also download the owner&#39;s manual and tutorials on the LG website."]},"id":"cc63f47a-131a-47a0-ad0f-52eef7d39798","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ebaf6b68-dc30-4f3d-ab7d-51f5c95611c1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG Ultra Large Capacity High Efficiency WT5070CW is a well-balanced top-load washer.
