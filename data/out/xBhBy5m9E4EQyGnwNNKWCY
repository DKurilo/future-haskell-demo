You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you capture and upload photos on a regular basis, you want to look for a <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo manager software</a> that can handle a big database and help you make sense of your collection. A well-managed photo collection makes editing and sharing easy. Media Pro 1 helps you manage, sort and organize your photos quickly. Navigating through this software is easy with its wide-open interface and easy drag-and-drop features.","Media Pro imports images quickly and automatically from a folder, camera or hard drive after setup. This software uses albums divided into subcategories to sort images. The auto-sort feature is one of the photo organizer tools, and it uses metadata annotations to sort photos. Some of the categories include camera settings, date created, and even longitude and latitude. Whether or not Media Pro has access to this information depends on your camera. The program can also auto sort images based on file properties outside the metadata like file name or size. After auto sorting, reorganizing a collection only requires dragging and dropping photos into subcategories.","It can take a long time to rename a batch of photos individually. This is why the batch-renaming feature in Media Pro 1 is so useful. This tool lets you select a group of photos and rename all of them at once. To keep your library organized, try renaming batches with a chronological tag like listing the month and year. From there, you can add new batch names to subsections or photos with similar features.","Extra sorting and moving is completed by dragging and dropping. Album themes, such as birthday parties or vacations, are a good starting point for custom organization because you can divide these large collections into chronological subcategories. While there are a lot of ways to customize your organization, you can&#39;t add metadata in batches.","If you upload images from your camera, RAW files convert to TIFF, BMP, JPEG or PNG. RAW files aren&#39;t usually compatible with uploading tools on social networking or photo sharing sites. In addition to file conversion, you can add watermarks or choose the color depth of your photos.","This photo management software lacks sharing features that similar programs have. You can&#39;t send any photos or collections to social media, photo sharing sites or YouTube directly from the software. However, you can open and export your images to other programs like Adobe Audition, Internet Explorer, iTunes and Windows Media Player. You can also burn discs and create slideshows.","Like the sharing features in Media Pro, its editing tools are also quite basic. The program covers editing essentials like cropping, rotation, and color and light adjustment. Its lack of advanced editing tools isn’t a deal breaker, especially if you&#39;re new to photo editing or only want to make small adjustments to your photos. If you don&#39;t like the edits you make to an image, you can quickly revert back to the original."]},"id":"0b8979fd-715c-424e-8ce1-dec6d38230c5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5f27cf83-ad96-435a-be50-d2df8647619e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Media Pro&#39;s strength lies with organizing and filing rather than editing images.
