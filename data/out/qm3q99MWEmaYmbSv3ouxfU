With water resistance, six ear tips and noise isolation, these sports earbuds offer flexibility. However, with no over-ear hooks, they may not stay in place for high-impact sports, and the long wire might get in the way of your activities.","A built-in microphone allows you to talk, use voice control functions, and make or accept calls while you are working out. There is also a built-in control on the 36-inch headphone wire that allows you to easily accept calls and adjust volume without digging your phone out of your pocket. The control also features a remote button for answering calls and playing or pausing music. It comes with a shirt clip you can use to pin the control down for easy access. These features do help make up for the fact that the sport earbuds are wired, but the cord may still inconvenience you.","Noise isolating technology ensures that you mostly hear your music or audio playback while working out. This can be a disadvantage around cars and on streets where you want to be aware of your surroundings.","These sweat-resistant sport earbuds are IPX5 certified, so you can take them running or cycling in the rain or accidentally get them wet without causing damage. However, they are not submersible.","Firm memory control wire allows you to fit the sport earbuds easily over the tops of your ears to keep them in place during most activities. This offers more comfort than a standard over-ear model, but is less secure for high impact sports. The low form factor also allows you to wear a helmet over the earbuds without causing discomfort. Six sets of ear tips allow you to adjust the headphones to a comfortable size that stays in place. Enhanced bass offers dynamic, energetic sound but is a disadvantage if you prefer less bass.","With a built-in microphone, in-line remote and memory wire to keep the sport earbuds in place, the MEElectronics Sport-Fi M6P are a good choice for most types of sports, such as running or cycling. While not submersible, the earbuds are also sweat resistant."]},"id":"e3ec0f28-d2d1-4678-b6f0-0c4261947da2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63396","url":"/meelectronics-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T21:48:23Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T21:48:23Z","name":"MEElectronics Sport-Fi M6 Memory Wire In-Ear","synopsis":"The MEElectronics Sport-Fi M6P are noise isolating in-ear sport headphones that include an in-line microphone, volume control and memory wire to keep them in place.
