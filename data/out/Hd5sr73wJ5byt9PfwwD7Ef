Its compatibility with a variety of media files makes it a versatile organizer; however, the program lacks editing and sharing features.","You can easily import files to the <a href=\"/best-photo-organizing-software\">photo organizing software</a> by either dragging and dropping or using the feature that pops up when you start the software. You can organize files by keyword, date and category. A toolbar on the right has icons that show you EXIF information, ratings and keywords, a calendar view and a map view.","You can view where your photos were taken using the map feature and Google Maps. Whether the photo already has GPS information or you manually enter a location, you can view thumbnails of your photos displayed on a map.","You can also use the photo organizer to make wallpaper for your desktop or phone. When creating wallpaper out of your photo, the software displays the original photo and how it will appear on specific phone models to help you optimize the image for your phone.","The photo organizing software does not offer very many editing tools. You can perform the standard edits like rotate, zoom, crop and resize. There are some color management tools. You can adjust the brightness, color and contrast of your photos, but that is the extent of the functions the tools perform.","JetPhoto Studio doesn’t come with filters you can add to your photos, besides the standard black and white and sepia tone ones. The program does have a batch editor, so you can apply some standard edits to multiple photos at once. The program does not have any makeover or cloning tools to help you correct imperfections in your photos.","The photo organizer software provides different ways to share your photos. You can upload your photos to online galleries or create a Flash-based slideshow with them. You can also create wallpaper to use as your phone’s background. The software allows you to directly share to Flickr as well.","This program is the only one we reviewed that does not allow you to send emails of your photos to friends directly from the application. It also lacks printing templates, so if you plan on printing hard copies of your photos, you cannot adjust their layout.","JetPhoto Studio offers some support with its software. The application gives you access to the company’s support webpage. On the website, you can view tutorials for common tasks. The software does not have a FAQs page or user forum. You can find the manufacturer’s support phone number and email address on the website; however, we never received responses to our inquiries."]},"id":"2f480836-86ac-4a15-95d9-4522666a6f15","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7823b920-77f7-46ed-b802-6cf4da495099","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["JetPhoto Studio Pro 5 helps you organize photos, videos and music.
