According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 95 percent of an office employee&#39;s day is spent working on a computer. Did you know that all that time spent in front of a computer could actually be harmful to your health? Working at a computer can contribute to back, neck and should pain, as well as eyestrain and injuries to the hands and wrists, collectively known as repetitive strain injuries (RSIs). These injuries can cause severe, prolonged pain and can lead to muscle weakness and movement impairment. Such a high risk of painful RSIs among computer users has made typing ergonomics more important than ever.","Ergonomics is defined as the science of work and one&#39;s physical relationship to that work. In simpler terms, ergonomics is the science of unifying workplace demands with personal comfort. When we talk about ergonomics in reference to typing, this word takes on an even more precise definition; it refers to correct positioning while typing to achieve optimal comfort and avoid RSIs and bodily stress.","Individuals who have never had formal typing training or used <a href=\"/best-typing-software\">typing software</a> are generally at the greatest risk for developing typing-related injuries. Following the &#34;three P&#39;s&#34; of typing ergonomics will help you prevent painful RSIs.","<strong>Position</strong><br/>Awkward hand movements can lead to muscle strain and damage, so it&#39;s important to properly position your hands and arms over the keyboard. Your forearms should be level with your keyboard and your elbows supported and resting comfortably at your side while you type. Position your keyboard at a height that enables this (you may need to adjust your sitting height as well). Additionally, keep the backs of your hands parallel to the keyboard to prevent wrist strain.","<strong>Posture</strong><br/>To avoid back pain and injuries, avoid slouching while using a computer. Keep your spine neutral, with the three natural curves of the spine present and not overly arched. Your feet should be planted firmly on the floor; use a footstool or adjust your chair height if necessary. You should also keep your shoulders relaxed and your head positioned directly above your pelvis.","<strong>Place</strong><br/>Set up an ergonomic workstation that is both comfortable and functional. Your monitor should be placed at either eye level or slightly lower. One positioned higher than eye level will force you to strain your neck. Switch to an ergonomic chair that provides lumbar support. This can help your spine to naturally hold its curve while you sit. Also, make sure your desktop offers ample room for your keyboard and mouse; a cramped space doesn&#39;t give you enough room to type and causes awkward and incorrect positioning.","Daily typing doesn&#39;t have to cause prolonged pain and physical stressÂ  and shouldn&#39;t. Abiding by these simple ergonomic principles will help you create and maintain a safe and comfortable environment while you use your computer."]},"id":"640f21ac-4e02-43fa-9a8c-d7d9b1b82ac2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7761","url":"/the-ergonomics-of-typing-position-posture-and-place","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"katie-nielsen","url":"/author/katie-nielsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Katie Nielsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"YmLdvmc8SsWJaWuhhXXYSW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-07T17:53:54Z","datePublished":"2013-02-07T17:53:54Z","name":"The Ergonomics of Typing: Position, Posture and Place","synopsis":"Daily computer use has become ubiquitous across schools, homes and businesses.","review":{},"strapline":"Daily computer use has become ubiquitous across schools, homes and businesses.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-26T13:56:34Z","id":"XUhX86C2AngCwjUMbEao9G","meta":{"title":"The Ergonomics of Typing: Position, Posture and Place","description":"Is your improper typing posture causing painful injuries?
