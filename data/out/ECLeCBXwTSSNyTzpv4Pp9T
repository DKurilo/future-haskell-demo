The Olympus TG 830 iHS stands out because of its 16-megapixel resolution, its excellent low-light performance, and its ability to deliver well-defined action shots. It is waterproof up to 33 feet, freeze proof down to 14 degrees and crushproof.","The Olympus TG 830 iHS, has a dual image stabilizer which suppresses blurring while it’s shooting a moving subject. The 5X wide angle optical zoom lens magnifies your subject while still maintaining a crisp image, and this camera offers an impressive continuous shooting mode of 2.5 frames per second.","We are impressed with its four automatic underwater settings. When you are shooting underwater in dim lighting, the camera’s sensors determine what adjustments need to be made to improve the color and lighting of your photos. It includes a CMOS sensor and built-in flash to ensure that you get good lighting performance. The LED light located on the front of the camera enhances lighting by acting as a mini headlight.","The Olympus TG 830 iHS has plenty of modes to satisfy your creative needs, including portrait, landscape, sunset and fireworks modes. Filters like Pop Art and Reflection allow you to add extra artistic touches. Additionally, you will get red-eye reduction, white balance adjustment, shadow adjustment and a self-timer.","The included GPS and compass show your location on the display screen. You can track your route, and your location is recorded on your images, so you will always remember where your photos were taken.","With built in HD video, you can capture action shots at 120 frames per second. There is a high speed mode, so if you want to photograph a racing motorcycle, you can capture it easily. It even includes a multi-recording feature that allows you to take stills and moving videos at the same time.","The Olympus is powered by a lithium-ion rechargeable battery. You will get 300 shots per charge or 80 minutes of continuous video shooting. Since the camera does not have internal memory, you will need to purchase an SD, SDHC or SDXC memory card for storage.","Olympus has a long history of manufacturing underwater housing for cameras. The sealing and locking system are advanced compared to the competition, so you can expect a water tight seal that rivals even the best waterproof cameras. It is equipped with a multi-directional double lock mechanism that prevents accidental underwater openings.","You don’t always see a crushproof feature with waterproof cameras, and this one excels with its ability to withstand up to 220 pounds of pressure. The casing of the camera is made out of a durable but slippery casing. It is hard to grip and is heavier than other waterproof cameras, weighing 7.5 ounces. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"1a11009f-b5e4-4246-b67e-3c78e1fddef5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bb566bd2-d075-4ff2-afdf-045454421ccc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This underwater camera has features that ensure it will endure being submerged under water without leaking.
