It has some shortcomings, but we found it produces the most comfortable and effective brushing experience of the toothbrushes we tested. The brush head is elongated with soft bristles and is the smallest elongated head in our review. A smaller head allows for a greater range of motion in constricted spaces.","The brush is also very lightweight. It measured only 4.5 ounces, which makes it the third lightest brush we tested, the lighest brush we tested is the <a href=\"/oral-b-deep-sweep-review\">Oral-B Deep Sweep 1000</a>, weighing only 4.25 ounces. Lighter brushes don’t cause as much fatigue, which is important if you have strength or mobility issues. The handle isn’t as comfortable as some of the alternatives. Most of the handle is glossy white plastic with some rubber contouring along the edges. More comfortable handles are seamless and narrow.","The Sonicare FlexCare Plus leaves your mouth with a clean feeling and brushes gently. Often, electric toothbrushes can feel quite rough, especially if you’re used to manual brushes. We found the FlexCare to be a good introduction to electric toothbrushes, even after the first uses that are programmed to be lighter."]},"id":"731455db-5253-4e58-9454-5fdf0d550ff4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"a478c595-1551-4fe9-a8cc-f49fdc53e4dc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/mMQLP5Kh6c4ddXq8NN9ic9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/66637-philips-sonicare-flexcare1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMQLP5Kh6c4ddXq8NN9ic9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"mMQLP5Kh6c4ddXq8NN9ic9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMQLP5Kh6c4ddXq8NN9ic9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"6f54bc4c-8edb-40e4-86af-3c2eff9bde76","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The FlexCare has an illuminated panel below the power button which shows battery status and a list of the brush modes. You can cycle through the separate modes by pressing the button once the brush is on; the modes are Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive and Massage.","You get a standard set of features and accessories with the FlexCare Plus. Although there is a separate mode for sensitive teeth, there isn’t a shutoff if you apply too much pressure. One of the most common concerns with electric toothbrushes is that mechanical action can be too rough on teeth and cause gums to recede, so it’s surprising to see this feature missing in a high-end brush.","The FlexCare comes with a two-minute timer, which alerts you to change mouth quadrants every 30 seconds for even brushing. The included travel case is molded white plastic and holds the brush and head securely to prevent damage in a suitcase. Like the other Sonicare brushes, the battery life is about three weeks, so you can easily leave the charger at home for short trips.","Unlike some of the other high-end brushes, this one doesn’t have a separate notification screen or Bluetooth-enabled app to track your brushing. You may benefit from this kind of tracking, particularly if you want to improve your brushing habits. Sonicare brushes use the first 14 brushings to ease you in to the vibration they create. The first brushing is so light that it feels almost like tickling, and it then gradually gets more intense.","There isn’t a flossing alternative included with this brush. Dentists recommend that even if you’re using an electric toothbrush, you should still floss. If you place your sonic brush head under water, you can see a stream of water emanating from the brush head; this same force drives water and toothpaste between your teeth when using the brush. While it doesn’t replace flossing, it’s beneficial if you’re an otherwise poor flosser. The FlexCare Plus only comes with one brush head."]},"id":"05af87ad-710f-4242-bebd-2971d7619135","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"dd496ef2-f804-4714-af79-3c645963abf0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/gJhd4XMLdcDGqHGAQR5tic.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/66637-philips-sonicare-flexcare10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJhd4XMLdcDGqHGAQR5tic.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"gJhd4XMLdcDGqHGAQR5tic","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJhd4XMLdcDGqHGAQR5tic.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c06ffb4c-4849-4bf9-904a-7787a621ff89","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus has a two-year warranty, which is the same as the other Philips brushes and the industry standard, and covers defects in build.
