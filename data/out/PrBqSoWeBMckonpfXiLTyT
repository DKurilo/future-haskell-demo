If you position the camera well, it can be a good value at the manufacturer&#39;s price point.","The camera&#39;s image quality is below average. It features a 40-foot flash range and 3-megapixel resolution. This means that your image quality will be much better if the animal is within 10 to 40 feet of the camera. The low resolution means you won&#39;t be able to zoom in on the image on your computer, because it will appear grainy.","This camera&#39;s detection circuit is quick. The 1.5-second trigger time is excellent for a trail camera at this price point. The recovery time is a surprisingly good seven seconds, which means you can get multiple shots of the same animal in front of the camera. The Truth Cam 35 also has a multi-shot mode, which can capture up to five images after a single trigger.","The Truth Cam 35 has a detection range of 50 feet, which is comparable to more expensive trail cams. However, its detection angle is only 42 degrees, which is a bit disappointing. It&#39;s possible this narrow angle, which is about 15 percent narrower than the best trail cams we reviewed, could cause the camera to miss animal movement on the fringe of the detection zone.","It also has a time-lapse mode, so you can set the camera to capture images at set intervals regardless of motion triggers. This feature is especially useful during the day, when the vision of the camera will extend far beyond its 40-foot flash range. Because time-lapse photos don&#39;t depend on the camera&#39;s detection range, you&#39;ll be able to capture animal movement farther away than the 50-foot detection range.","Our interactions with the Primos customer service team were excellent. The friendly and knowledgeable representatives were a pleasure to speak with over the phone, and our emails were returned within one business day."]},"id":"aa9b8552-99d2-43a1-b9db-ff51a990a17a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"14800ed3-839b-4e6a-b63a-3d4951a63208","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When buying any product, you have to consider its functionality in relation to its price.
