The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-home-automation-systems\">Home Automation Systems</a> here.</em>","The Iris home automation system was created by Lowe&#39;s, which is known for its chain of home improvement stores. This system comes with a good feature set, easy controls and great software compatibility. Though Iris lacks entertainment integration, it has great technical support, and you can always go to the nearest Lowe&#39;s store if you need face-to-face assistance. Rather than buying online, Iris is one of few smart home systems you can find in a retail store and install without professional help.","The features included with the Iris home automation system give you full control over most of the devices in your smart home. Unlike many other smart home systems, Iris doesn&#39;t natively support Wi-Fi; instead, it connects to the internet via an Ethernet connection to your router. You can also purchase a Verizon USB Modem if you prefer a cellular internet connection.","Iris has a nice remote access feature, which complements the software compatibility of this smart house system. For example, not only can you access Iris remotely using the Iris app if you have an Android or iOS smartphone, but also if you have an internet connected computer with a web browser. Remote access gives you a way to see the status of your home while you&#39;re at work.","You can adapt Iris to your personal preferences with a variety of programs that can be activated manually as well as automatically. You can program it to react to doors opening or movement in your home to help prevent the theft of your valuables. If you&#39;re using a smartphone, you can take advantage of voice control software to control Iris.","There are three different starter kits if you are new to Iris: Safe &amp; Secure, Comfort &amp; Control and Smart. The Safe &amp; Secure kit comes with contact sensors, a motion sensor, a keypad and a window decal. The Comfort &amp; Control kit comes with a smart plug and a smart thermostat. Finally, the Smart kit comes with the contents of the two other kits as well as a range extender. Iris only works with the Iris hub, which comes included in each of the three starter kits.","Iris can work with security systems and even offers a variety of service plans that help you monitor your home while you&#39;re away. These service plans are not as thorough as a typical home security system, but they add an extra measure of safety that many other systems lack. Iris doesn&#39;t support media players such as iTunes and Windows Media Center.","In the category of device compatibility, Iris is compatible with the Z-Wave and ZigBee home control technologies and it supports HVAC and security systems. This intelligent home system would be more flexible with additional support for Bluetooth, Insteon, KNX, UPB and X10 protocols, but Lowe&#39;s appears to prefer simplicity to avoid compatibility issues.","Lowe&#39;s offers great technical support for Iris such as email and a toll-free telephone number. If you prefer to find solutions on your own, there are FAQs, product guides and a user forum. You can even find video tutorials within the FAQs topics. Lowe&#39;s does not provide live-chat support."]},"id":"1e6a22c7-0bc7-4444-8af7-2b0cea30e390","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6ba1284c-77ad-4a79-9f34-ef7a7451e15c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Iris has one advantage over most of the home automation systems in our review â€“ you can buy it in a physical store.
