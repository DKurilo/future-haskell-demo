During our research, we combed through user ratings, which helped us determine which devices work the best and deliver on their claims. We compared features and capabilities and read user reviews to ferret out any known problems or perks that come with each product. The laminators we chose vary in size and price, and they laminate in a variety of thicknesses.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","To narrow our search to the top products, we found laminators that had the most positive consumer reviews. We made a list of each machine&#39;s features and capabilities so we could compare them. Then, we whittled down that list to 10 devices.","As we compared, we considered which models are easiest to use by looking for helpful features. For instance, some laminators included jam release buttons or motorized reverse buttons to make it easy to resolve jamming. Laminators with built-in jam prevention scored high.","For all laminators that use heat to seal, we looked at how long it takes the heating element to warm up. We also checked to see which machine laminates the fastest. We combined the warm-up time and the laminating speed, and the fastest models scored the highest.","The size of the device determines which types of documents you can laminate. Machines that can laminate larger documents ranked higher because they accommodate a wider variety of projects. We also preferred machines that accommodate a variety of pouch thicknesses because they are more versatile.<br/><strong><br/>How Much Do Laminators Cost?</strong>","An industrial laminator, like those at schools, cost thousands of dollars. We evaluated some during testing, like the GBC Pinnacle 27 EZload Thermal Roll Laminator, which is priced at $1,547 on sale. These giants also come with high maintenance costs and are impossible to store due to their large size. However, when we did our testing, we found plenty of laminators that can handle standard sheet sizes for less than $500. Our best value pick, the AmazonBasics Thermal costs just over $20. At that price, you forego the best features, like an auto sensor that picks up on the laminating pouch size that you’re using or cool touch that keeps your laminator getting too warm. But Laminators between $100 and $200 often come with a handful of these fancy features, and we recommend this price point.","<strong>Things to Consider Before Choosing a Laminator<br/></strong><br/>Type<br/>You can find both thermal and cold laminators on the market, and some devices offer both sealing methods. Thermal laminators use heat to seal film and documents together. Cold lamination, also called pressure lamination, applies pressure to sticky transparent sheets to laminate papers, not unlike using clear tape. Both are commonly used, but thermal laminating is more popular. All our top picks are thermal laminators because we think they create better results with less hassle than cold laminators. Thermal machines are typically more expensive, but the film costs less. Even though cold laminators are less expensive upfront, the film costs more, so you could end up spending more over time.","The type of machine you need partially depends on the items you’re laminating. If a document is temperature-sensitive, like carbon paper, it is a good idea to use a cold laminator.<br/><br/>Warm-Up Time &amp; Laminating Speed<br/>Thermal machines need time to warm their rollers to do their job. Depending on the machine, this warm-up period can range from one to 20 minutes. Once the machine is ready, the actual laminating speed varies. Some can laminate as much as 18 inches per minute. If you think you&#39;ll typically need to make laminations in a hurry, consider purchasing a machine that warms up quickly and laminates at a faster speed.","Laminating Thickness<br/>Laminators are built to be compatible with specific film and pouch thicknesses. A 10-millimeter film or pouch is the most protective and is difficult to bend. On the other hand, a 3-millimeter film gives the document a protective coating but allows it to bend easily. The thickness you need depends on the project. Most laminators are compatible with a maximum of three film thicknesses.","Number of Rollers<br/>The number of rollers and their functions in the machine determine the quality of laminated documents. In the most basic machines, two rollers press your document and the film together to seal them. It is best to feed documents slowly into these machines.","In more complex machines, two rollers heat or apply pressure to the film, while an additional pair seal the film and the document together. This second pair of rollers typically remove any wrinkles and imperfections. Documents should be fed slowly into these machines.","<strong>How to Clean a Laminator </strong>","Cleaning a thermal laminator for home use is simple: <a href=\"https://www.fellowes.com/us/en/products/product-details.aspx?prod=US-5320603\">Buy a pack of laminator cleaning sheets</a>, which are designed to remove lamination residue. You run these cleaning sheets through the machine just as you would a document. A 10-pack costs less than $10, and with a normal workload, thermal laminators need to be cleaned only about once a year. If you frequently notice wrinkles or unwanted residue on documents, it’s probably time to clean the rollers.","Cleaning a roll laminator, like the <a href=\"/gbc-review\">GBC Pinnacle 27</a>, is a bit more involved. Every time you laminate a document with a roll laminator, a small bit of adhesive leaks out and sticks to the rollers. Most service technicians suggest cleaning the adhesive off the roller every three to six months, depending on how frequently it’s used. To remove the adhesive from the roller, close the rollers and heat the glue without a document threaded through the laminator. Then, use mineral spirits and a clean cloth to remove the adhesive from the top roller, and repeat the process for the bottom roller.","If paper is stuck to the roller, use a sponge and water to soak the paper. Then, gently rub the roller with a scrub pad (such as Scotch-Brite) to remove the wet paper. The most important tip we gleaned from laminator service technicians was to avoid using sharp objects, such as X-ACTO knives or razor blades, to clean paper, adhesive and film off the rollers.","<br/>More Storage and Organization Guides: "]},"id":"571e76b0-14d9-426e-8342-6894d11843d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-organizer-software\">The Best Organizer Software<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-document-scanners\">The Best Document Scanners<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-vacuum-sealer-bags\">The Best Vacuum Storage Bags</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3350fd5d-ab0b-4848-a183-df26c6f9c26c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_80","url":"/best-laminators","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-14T20:05:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-14T20:05:00Z","name":"Best Laminators of 2019","synopsis":"A laminating machine is used to cover and preserve paper materials, like certificates, photographs and leaflets, in a thin vinyl or plastic film.","review":{},"strapline":"A laminating machine is used to cover and preserve paper materials, like certificates, photographs and leaflets, in a thin vinyl or plastic film.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-25T23:25:07Z","id":"c3HJhWNJ3acfiz2HWaodCb","meta":{"title":"Best Laminators of 2019 -
