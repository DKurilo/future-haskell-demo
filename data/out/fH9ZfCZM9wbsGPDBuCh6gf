You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Next on our lineup is a <a href=\"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters\">VHS to DVD converter</a> with a clever – if deceptively incorrect – name: the No Geek Needed Video Grabber. The name would lead one to believe that the product is easy to use, intuitive and user friendly. However, such is not the case. The manufacturer takes a hands-off approach to its product, providing little to no customer support and a minimal amount of documentation. The company may say that you won’t need a geek, but this VHS to DVD converter is complex and undocumented enough to confuse a well-schooled computer programmer. We were quite disappointed with this product.","When we received the product for testing, no software or driver CDs were included. We checked for drivers on the manufacturer’s website, but to no avail. We eventually found the right drivers for the device, but it wasn’t on the company&#39;s site. Since no software is included, we were forced to use another application, so we can’t comment on the quality of the – presumably included – software.","We attempted to contact support about the missing software, but it took us a full two days to find a representative who could help us. They agreed to send us a driver installation CD and the correct software; we received neither. Despite our best efforts, we never received a copy of the software or the drivers.","The No Geek Needed Video Grabber was able to expertly sync with all the different Windows operating systems we tested on. We were also able to use the VHS to DVD converters to capture copyrighted material. Using Windows Movie Maker, we copied video directly from our VCR to DVDs.","When we realized that the software did not include any installation CDs, we went to the No Geek Needed Video Grabber website. However, we were unable to find any driver downloads. We contacted customer support by phone and were told they would try to find a driver and send us the link via email. We never received a link for the drivers from the support team; only by contacting company management directly were we able to finally receive the drivers and software.","Using other driver-download websites, we were able to find the necessary downloads to help the No Geek Needed Video Grabber sync with our computers. This process was time consuming and not as easy as many other products.","From the No Geek Needed website, you will be able to gather very limited information about the converter. There is no product information, feature set or any detailed information. The website lists a phone number for help. After being put on hold for more than 15 minutes, we were connected to a representative who was unable to answer our questions. When we asked to be transferred to someone who could help us, we were given a reference number and told to expect an email, which we never received.","There are no online tutorials, live chats, FAQs or user&#39;s manuals. There is no area to download necessary drivers, and the email address provides slow responses to questions."]},"id":"dea2e1ff-0c25-4705-9ebb-628227a5e2a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"68e1f989-18d7-4d88-9fe4-078b8165bd0b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Our experience with No Geek Needed Video Grabber was extremely negative.
