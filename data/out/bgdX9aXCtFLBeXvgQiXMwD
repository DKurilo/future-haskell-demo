It looks like any other media streaming box on the market and many of its features, on the surface, seem standard as well. However, as you dig deeper, you see it is multifunctional and has quite a bit to offer for a home media server.","The WD TV Play can play back video and audio files streamed from a computer on a home network. It can also directly access content on popular internet websites, such as YouTube, Pandora and Flickr.","The WD TV Play is very easy to set up and use. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. In terms of available apps, WD is somewhat lacking, but most of the essentials are there: Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus and Spotify. One nice feature of the interface is the ability to customize it and create shortcuts to the 30 apps you use most.","WD offers cloud streaming combined with <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-streaming-players,review-2140.html\">home media</a> access, which is a big plus. You can easily connect the device to your TV via an HDMI cable, or with component or composite (RCA) cables. And if you plug an Ethernet cable into your home network or use one of the USB ports, you can access your personal digital content stored on your computer. The USB ports allow hard drives to be plugged in so you can access more content or store additional files. Also, these ports make it easy to connect a USB-enabled video camera to view your home movies. The WD TV Play has no internal storage.","The WD TV Play home server supports the most popular video formats, including QuickTime, Windows Media, MKV, H.264 and more. The media player is also compatible with MP3, WAV, AAC and other audio formats.","If you need technical support, you can contact a technician via phone or email to get help. Other support options include the WD Community (a user forum), a FAQs page, a knowledgebase, a quick start-guide and a user manual. Online, there are downloadable drivers to keep the device up to date.","The WD TV Play offers many of the advantages you&#39;d expect from home media servers. Since it doesn&#39;t have a built-in hard drive, it relies on computers on your home network for content and a USB external hard drive to store media, but it can directly access content from websites like YouTube and Netflix. While the availability of apps is somewhat lacking, the WD TV Play provides access to home media files on your computer and other devices."]},"id":"abfbe5a4-dfc2-493a-99b6-e73443903442","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49781","url":"/wd-tv-live-plus-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-14T19:34:08Z","datePublished":"2010-06-14T19:34:08Z","name":"WD TV Play","synopsis":"At first glance, the WD TV Play won't exactly blow you away.
