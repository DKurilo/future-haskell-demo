You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Cyberlink Director Suite is more than just pro video editing software; it’s an entire creative suite that spans video, image, audio and color editing. It includes four programs: PowerDirector, PhotoDirector, AudioDirector and ColorDirector. Each one is specifically designed for every aspect of your project, whether you’re making a wedding video or a feature film. When used together, these programs provide a seamlessly comprehensive editing experience. They allow you to craft exactly what you want at a fraction of the price of comparable media suites.","PowerDirector is the wheel around which this entire pro video editing suite turns. This program is where you’ll spend the most time when crafting your projects. It comes equipped with a 100-track timeline which allows you to make your project as simple or as complex as you want. PowerDirector also has the same advanced editing tools found in mainstream <a href=\"/best-professional-video-editing-software\">professional video editing software</a>, such as the chroma key (green-screen), video stabilizer, mask designer, titles, multi-cam editing and much more. And these tools are much more accessible and learnable than their name-brand counterparts.","PhotoDirector is where you’ll enhance the still images of your projects to perfection. Like its mainstream counterparts, it offers layer-based editing as well as powerful tools like noise reduction, auto lens correction, white balancing, content-aware removal and many more. It will take you a while to get to know all the photo editing tools this program has to offer. Fortunately, Cyberlink offers an extensive learning center that shows you exactly how to use many of the tools and features found in PhotoDirector. So, if you’re willing to put in the time, the still images in your video project will be as vibrant and beautiful as possible.","The visual aspect of your video is only half the story. Equally important is the sound, and that’s where AudioDirector comes into play. The first thing that makes it so useful is its ability to round-trip edit with PowerDirector. Round-trip editing means that AudioDirector automatically syncs with PowerDirector and extracts the sound from your timeline so you can edit and enhance it without the need to manually export and reimport it between the two programs. This saves a lot of time and effort getting the exact sound you want into your finalized video project.","AudioDirector also has several powerful tools that enhance the sound of your video. You can reduce or remove unwanted sound with the noise reduction tool, the hiss and hum removal tools and the click/clip removal tool. You can even set up noise profiles that you can apply to multiple clips so you don’t have to manually remove unwanted sound clip-by-clip. This ensures that you get smooth, great-sounding audio for your audience to enjoy.","ColorDirector is the final component of Director’s Suite. It’s Cyberlink’s color grading program that allows you to enrich your video’s color. You can make colors pop, sharpen or denoise imperfect footage, and generally manipulate things like hue, saturation and tone of all the colors in your video. ColorDirector is a great inclusion in Director’s Suite because it gives you much more control over the look and feel of your video. It is a rather advanced tool, so expect to spend some time in the tutorials before you’ve mastered everything this application can do.","Cyberlink Director’s Suite provides all the tools and features you need to create professional-level video projects. You can use it to make feature films, commercials, music videos and more. The combination of the tools found in these applications rival those found in industry-standard suites. It is a great, less expensive alternative to the big names in the professional video editing market."]},"id":"8eab08c4-e52a-4f4b-a6df-a37c78a00209","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69058","url":"/director-suite-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
