Espresso that is made with bar pump pressure rather than steam pressure has a more authentic flavor. The Melitta 40791 espresso maker is a compact bar pump unit that uses 1,350 watts of power to prepare perfect espresso in minutes. It can also provide on-demand hot water for other drinks such as tea and cocoa.","The removable water tank makes filling up quick and effortless. However, the machine seems to stop drawing water from the tank when it becomes half-empty. This means you have to refill the tank more often compared to other machines. The drip tray and portafilter are also removable so you can easily clean and sanitize your entire espresso maker.","The Melitta 40971 cappuccino maker doesn&#39;t come with its own carafe, but you can purchase one separately. Since it can only brew a couple of shots at a time, a single espresso cup is all that you need. The steam wand froths milk into a tasty treat to top your espresso and turn it into a cappuccino or latte.","Measuring the right amount of coffee grounds and tamping firmly are necessary skills for creating perfect espresso. You will have to purchase separate measuring and tamping tools since they don&#39;t come with the Melitta espresso maker. This unit is able to brew espresso pods if you want to skip tamping or are in an extra rush in the morning.","Help is available for your Melitta espresso machine whether you are in the United State or in Europe. The Melitta website is easy to navigate and contact information is listed on every page. We were impressed with the quick, knowledgeable and polite response that we received to our questions.","Telephone support is also available, though only for a few hours each day. You can get great support from Melitta personnel through their Facebook page. There is also FAQs section on the Melitta website. We are disappointed to see that it only covers basic customer service questions rather than product troubleshooting."]},"id":"0163d4ec-8ddf-4db9-a9af-22b72a296d50","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ba4b451d-acae-49e2-8321-933723d01657","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The bar pump Melitta is a good espresso machine that is able to brew both coffee grounds and espresso pods.
