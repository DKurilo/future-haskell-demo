You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This is best if you also have a Kodak digital camera, but the Kodak Easyshare Printer Dock will work as a standalone photo printer. With its useful features, recognized printing quality and good value, Kodak’s Easyshare Printer Dock is worth a look.","With a Kodak camera, the Easyshare Printer Dock works as a charging cradle, a PC dock and photo printer. No Kodak camera? The Easyshare will accept images from a PictBridge camera, memory cards (an optional accessory, not built into the printer) or from a computer. Designed for both looks and portability, the Kodak Easyshare Printer Dock weighs in at less than 2.5 pounds and can easily be held on one hand. Photos print at 300 dpi and you can expect about one 4x6 print per minute, an average speed for a compact photo printer. The Easyshare will hold 25 sheets of photo paper.","Perhaps the biggest objection to the Easyshare Printer Dock is the high cost of prints, but there are few complaints about the quality. In fact, users report no difference between the Easyshare’s digital prints and prints from a professional photo lab. The lack of a built-in memory slot may pose an inconvenience to some.","If you are a Kodak digital camera owner and enjoy printing the photos you take, the Kodak Easyshare Printer Dock is a multi-tasking addition to your photography equipment. Note: This <a href=\"/best-compact-printers\">compact photo printer</a> is compatible with other cameras. Its small size and Kodak quality may make it the perfect companion to your camera."]},"id":"d829cb79-6ea0-49a2-b803-f11ca91f9061","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_6956","url":"/kodak-1684190-3673-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-04-22T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-04-22T06:00:00Z","name":"Kodak Easyshare Printer Dock Plus Thermal Photo 1684190","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":30,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-06-16T20:56:58Z","id":"9RtCjnSE3FQ64mBMDP6keb","meta":{"title":"Kodak Easyshare Printer Dock Plus Thermal Photo Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
