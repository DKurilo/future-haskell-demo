We search the marketplace for the most popular and best-reviewed machines and then compile and report our findings. ","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","We&#39;ve spent hours looking at product manuals and reading customer and professional reviews to find the best options on the market. We also visited the appliance sections at popular department stores and spoke with customer service representatives about what to look for in a quality bread machine. We specifically sought out bread makers in a wide price range and found good options even at the lower price points. Whether you are replacing, upgrading or buying your first bread maker, we’ve evaluated one that should work for you. ","<strong>How Much Does a Bread Maker Cost?</strong>","You can expect to pay under $100 for a decent bread machine that will fit your needs for making good homemade bread. There are bread makers that cost $250 or more that come with specialty features, higher quality outer housing and more settings and options. You can expect to pay more for commercial grade machines.","<strong>Is It Cheaper to Make Your Own Bread?</strong>","We did the math based on our favorite <a href=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234898/soft-dinner-rolls/?lnkid=usspnt\">Allrecipes.com</a> white bread recipe made in a bread machine. Based on current market prices of the ingredients, making your own bread will cost about $3.34 per loaf. Depending on where you live, this is comparable to a quality loaf of bread you can pick up at the grocery store, though there are cheaper, lower quality breads available. However, you won’t get a fresh and hot loaf for this price at a store, and if you’re using your bread machine, you can set it to start cooking so it’s ready right when you are.","<strong>How Long Does Homemade BreadLlast?</strong>","Because it doesn’t have the same preservatives as store-bought bread, homemade loaves won’t last very long, maybe two or three days. To help it keep well, make sure your bread cools completely before you store it in a bag, plastic wrap, foil or breadbox. This will cut down on moisture and keep it from molding too quickly.","<strong>How Do Bread Making Machines Work?</strong>","Making bread from scratch takes effort, and although many people find it therapeutic, our busy lives often don’t allow enough time. The basic steps are to measure and mix the ingredients, knead the dough, allow it to rise, punch it down and allow it to rise again in the baking pan, and then bake it in the oven. The beauty of a bread machine is it does these tasks for you. You simply put the ingredients into the removable metal container, slide it into the machine, close it, input settings and press start. From the control panel, you can set such things as the weight of the loaf and how dark you want the crust.","In older machines, the mixing paddle remained inside, and loaves came out with a hole in them. However, newer machines tell you when to remove it, so you get a standard-shaped loaf. In addition, many machines have a delayed-start feature, so you can wake up to fresh bread in the morning, or a quick-baking feature, so you can have fresh bread relatively fast.","Bread machines have become increasingly versatile in recent years, and many can now make gluten-free loaves, cakes, jam, and pizza and pasta doughs. In addition, some bread makers let you do the prep work yourself – a great help if you want to release stress by kneading heavy dough – and simply bake the bread.","<strong>Things to Consider When Choosing a Bread Maker</strong>","Design<br/>Vertical-loaf machines affect texture, though not overall quality or flavor – they can leave a denser texture at one end of the loaf. If that would bother you, it is worth noting whether the bread machine cooks a vertical loaf or a horizontal loaf. Horizontal loaves are more like the ones you buy in the store, and most people prefer them. They generally have lighter, fluffier bread at the top of the loaf with a more dense section on the bottom half.","Size<br/>Bread makers can vary drastically when it comes to the size of loaves they produce. Since fresh bread does not have the preservatives found in store-bought bread, it goes bad more quickly. Make sure the machine makes the size of loaf appropriate for your household.","Settings<br/>Bread machines have specific settings for different types of breads, including French, wheat, fruit, pizza dough and others. You should make sure the one you purchase can produce your favorites. It could be worth finding out whether it has a gluten-free setting, for instance.","<br/><strong><br/>More Specialty Appliance Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"65c41149-8b4e-4eda-88bb-ab34342cef79","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-cotton-candy-machines\">The Best Cotton Candy Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-donut-makers\">The Best Donut Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">The Best Egg Cookers</a>","<a href=\"/best-ice-cream-makers\">The Best Ice Cream Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-pasta-makers\">The Best Pasta Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-popcorn-makers\">The Best Popcorn Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-rice-cookers\">The Best Rice Cookers</a>","<a href=\"/best-sandwich-makers\">The Best Sandwich Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-sous-vide-machine-review\">The Best Sous Vide Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\">The Best Turkey Fryers</a>","<a href=\"/best-waffle-makers\">The Best Waffle Makers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8b691729-8088-4546-b535-2714afd33202","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_86","url":"/best-bread-makers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angela-parkinson","url":"/author/angela-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Angela Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4mNVTVXMirWtTXf6QMhCjd","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-10T11:52:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-10T11:52:00Z","name":"Best Bread Makers of 2019","synopsis":"Bread makers vary in price, from $50 to more than $300.
