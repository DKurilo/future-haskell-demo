This means that a business recognizes expenses only when it has to pay the expense off. Likewise, a business recognizes revenue only when it receives cash for goods or services provided.","However, this is not all when it comes to expenses and revenue in accounting. Sometimes, a business  incurs expenses but may not pay them off immediately. The expense occurs in one accounting period, but the business pays it off in the next. Since the accountant has to record the transaction, he or she files it as an accrued expense. The same goes for accrued revenue. The business records revenue earned in one accounting period before it receives the actual cash in the next accounting period.","It is important to note that a business records accrued expenses when it is completely sure it can pay them. Examples of such guaranteed expenses are salaries and interests.","If the accountant fails to record an accrued expense, the result is that the financial statement for that specific accounting period shows understated liabilities and overstated income. The results of this error can be serious.","<strong>Examples </strong><br/>Let&#39;s suppose that a company pays its casual laborers on a biweekly basis. The total amount of wages for each payment period is $20,500. The next payment date occurs April 19. However, the first financial period of the year ends April 4. Since the business fully expects to pay the wages on the payment date, it has to recognize that expense in the current period.","Thus, the journal entry for accrued expenses will be $20,500. This is the amount of money that the business has incurred but is yet to pay.","Another example is a supplier who has already delivered goods but whose payment date falls in the next financial quarter.","These are two of the most common examples of accrued expenses you can encounter in business. The first is salaries or wages payable, which you can see in the previous example. The second is interest payable. When a business takes out a loan, interest on the loan continues to accumulate, but the business does not pay it immediately. Accrued expenses are the expected future payments to pay off that interest.","<strong>Types of Accrued Expenses</strong><br/>One categorization of accrued expenses consists of routine/recurring expenses and non-routine/infrequent expenses. As the terms suggest, routine expenses are those that occur on a frequent basis. Good examples are wages and loan interest. On the other hand, non-routine expenses are those that infrequently arise, such as when a business has to conduct repairs to its physical premises. If payment for those services occurs in the future, you may consider it a non-routine accrued expense.","The opposite of accrued expenses are prepaid expenses. These are expenses that the business pays for before receiving the goods or services. A commonly used example of a prepaid expense is insurance. The business pays a premium for compensation the insurer will provide in the future.","There can be a lot of complexity to recording certain business transactions, specifically accrued expenses.
