You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Boston Acoustic Classic Series II CS 2300 is composed of four CS 23 bookshelf speakers and a CS 223CII center speaker. The four bookshelf speakers have a wider frequency range and more power in the satellite speaker category than other <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker systems</a> that have tiny satellite speakers. You can buy a matching subwoofer to complement the Classic Series II, but it is not packaged with one. Without a dedicated subwoofer, low bass frequencies are almost nonexistent.","The woofers on the four bookshelf speakers are made from a graphite-injected polymer blend that makes the woofers rugged and durable. They cover a frequency range of 120Hz to 20kHz, a respectable range for bookshelf speakers. These speakers are fairly efficient as well with a sensitivity rating of 89 decibels. It doesn’t take much power to drive these speakers, which means that you can pair them with just about any receiver and get optimal performance.","These small home theater speakers can lose audio stability when the volume is turned up during action films. Without a subwoofer to handle the low tones, the satellite speakers tend to struggle with prominent bottom end. At lower volumes, the speakers have a nice timbre with one another and produce matching clean audio.","The matching center speaker has an efficiency rating of 89dB. Since the center speaker handles far more of the overall audio duty than the satellite speakers, it has a wider frequency range of 100Hz to 20kHz. The center speaker does its best to handle more of the bottom-end load but still struggles without a dedicated subwoofer. Having drivers made up of the same composites as the satellite speakers, the center speaker projects clear movie dialogue. The center speaker and satellite speakers match well together.","These home theater speakers are covered by a five-year warranty. Boston Acoustic also has excellent customer service, responding to emails and concerns via telephone promptly and efficiently."]},"id":"170aee57-750e-41ec-ba3e-b86a1eaa2efc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3bf5a21d-aa50-4444-9a3b-024d435b70be","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Boston Acoustic Classic Series II CS 2300 finds a home in our speaker list but is far from the best home theater system we reviewed.
