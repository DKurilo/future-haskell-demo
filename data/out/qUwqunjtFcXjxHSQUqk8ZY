Whatever you need to store, sheds keep the harshest weather   including wind, rain and ice   from damaging your items. Sheds allow you to lock tools and equipment away when you aren&#39;t using them. Some shed options include <a href=\"/rubbermaid-review\">Rubbermaid&#39;s Roughneck Gable Storage Shed</a>, <a href=\"/duramax-review\">Duramax&#39;s Sidemate Storage Shed</a>, and <a href=\"/suncast-review\">Suncast&#39;s Tremont Gable Storage Shed</a>.","In addition to safeguarding tools and other belongings, outdoor sheds also keep your yard, patio and other areas free of clutter. You can move some items from your house to the shed to free up interior space too, though it&#39;s generally not recommended to keep items sensitive to temperature or humidity in an outdoor space without climate control.","<strong>Storage Sheds: What to Look For</strong>","When purchasing a shed, you&#39;ll likely want four walls and a roof, but things such as flooring, doors and windows are optional. Some important considerations when browsing sheds include size, features and how much work is required for assembly.","<strong>Capacity</strong><br/>Probably the most important consideration for shed shoppers is capacity. A vast difference exists between a simple garden shed for basic tools and a building large enough to house a riding lawn mower and other items. Manufacturers provide capacity measurements in several ways: cubic feet, square feet and interior dimensions.","Cubic feet measures the entire interior space, and is only particularly helpful if you plan to stack the shed full with something such as bags of potting soil. Square footage measures the floor space you have to work with, letting you know whether you have room for large items and shelving. Interior dimensions are also helpful; if you want to put a 4-foot mower in the shed, you want an interior length over 4 feet.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>Storage shed features can include floor framing, windows and shelves, but not all sheds come with these amenities. Some sheds are made to sit directly on the ground or a concrete foundation, and many don&#39;t offer windows or lighting options. If storage options are important to you, you should look for sheds with built-in shelving or adapters for pegboards and cabinet units. You&#39;ll also want to consider the type of door   sheds may come with sliding doors or single- or double-hinged doors. Double doors offer the widest access point, which might be important if you intend to store large items or equipment.","<strong>Assembly Requirements</strong><br/>Whether you purchase a plastic, metal or wood storage shed, you&#39;ll probably have to do some work to put it up. Review specifications and manuals to see how much assembly work is required. Metal storage sheds, for example, often come in sheets that you connect together. Resin-based sheds could come in wall units, and some sheds may even come completely or mostly assembled.","Selecting a shed that meets your needs and matches your assembly skills is important. The right shed offers flexible storage options for use in backyards, small farming operations or near recreational settings, such as a pool."]},"id":"f504a460-851c-4c01-b04c-acc83d953860","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9b3cc6ee-c7f9-4112-a2e1-aa4c57267415","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7903650-10926682-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_274588-25-LW108FB_0__%3FproductId%3D3125499&cjsku=274588-25-LW108FB\">Arrow</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7903650-10926682-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_63472-51401-EASTON1216DF_0__%3FproductId%3D50156106&cjsku=63472-51401-EASTON1216DF\">Best Barns</a>","<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7903650-10926682-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_125467-28572-00614_0__%3FproductId%3D3247426&cjsku=125467-28572-00614\">DuraMax</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7903650-10368321-1398432624000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FHandy-Home-Products-Princeton-10-ft-x-10-ft-Wood-Storage-Shed-18250-1%2F100350323&cjsku=100350323\">Handy Home Products</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7903650-10935405-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_437509-57658-182938_0__\">Heartland</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CA36ZKY/?&tag=ttr_storage-sheds-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1732[art|NA[pid|66868[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Keter</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015MDRSO/?tag=ttr_storage-sheds-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|760[art|NA[pid|66869[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Lifetime</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026SPYNM/?&tag=ttr_storage-sheds-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1732[art|NA[pid|66864[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Outdoor Living Today</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7903650-10935405-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_551125-1217-1887153_0__\">Rubbermaid</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7903650-10935405-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_538397-50741-BMS8712_0__\">Suncast</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"15c9c1e2-1374-44c4-91f4-df57a2fb4a1c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1732","url":"/best-storage-sheds","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:07:00Z","datePublished":"2016-03-23T21:18:37Z","name":"Storage Sheds Review","synopsis":"Storage sheds offer a place to store pool and garden supplies, outdoor equipment and personal belongings that no longer fit in your home.
