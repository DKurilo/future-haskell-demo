The technology behind the boost EVA midsole provides springy cushioning that doesn&#39;t compact or lose its ability to rebound as quickly as traditional EVA midsoles. The Pro-Moderator medial device provides additional support for those with flatter feet that can help avoid rolling an ankle.","The upper textile is lightweight and lined with breathable yet waterproof Gore-Tex technology, the GTX in the name. GTX trail running shoes benefit from the waterproof laminate membrane designed to keep your foot dry and comfortable by keeping external moisture from puddles, slushy trails and rain out while letting internal moisture, like sweat and vapor, escape.","The outsoles of these trail running shoes is the same rubber used in Continental high-performance tires for improved traction on all types of terrain, including grass, asphalt and even snow ice, making them an option for winter trail running shoes. The 6 mm drop adds to the boost technology to help propel your forward momentum. The speed lacing system of these men&#39;s Adidas trail running shoes allows you to tighten and tuck away the laces quickly and securely.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments: </strong>Alpine running is just the start with Adidas Boost. Active Junky has been trail testing them on platform pedals, fastpacking these trail running shoes with moderate weight to approach hiking, counting on freedom and worry-free foot protection. This all-rounder outdoor shoe earns its place on the trails and off alike.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Value","<strong>Best For:</strong> Hard pushes in sketchy terrain, three-season running and multisport use, adventure travel","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"6aa7c776-a651-4658-b787-8e506cfeb6c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 12.5 oz","Drop: 6 mm","Stack Height: 23.5 mm heel, 17.5 mm forefoot","Upper: Gore-Tex","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber-Continental"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d2945af4-098a-4480-99fb-9bb2315a4089","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background: </strong>A household name, Adidas is popular in the world of organized sports gear and running footwear.
