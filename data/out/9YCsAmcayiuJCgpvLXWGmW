Available from a variety of retailers including Amazon, these bags protect curling irons from unnecessary wear and tear while you travel. They also protect other items from your still-warm curling iron. Just make sure you&#39;ve purchased a bag that is heat and water resistant. That way you can toss it in the bag while it&#39;s still warm and head out the door without having to wait for your curling iron to cool down."]},"id":"205a7e2e-0241-4d08-9267-7139e8dff9cb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_78","url":"/best-curling-irons","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angela-parkinson","url":"/author/angela-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Angela Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4mNVTVXMirWtTXf6QMhCjd","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-07T17:47:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-07T17:47:00Z","name":"Best Curling Irons of 2019","synopsis":"We gathered seven testers in our office with completely different hair types and had them use 11 of the best curling irons on the market today.","review":{},"strapline":"We gathered seven testers in our office with completely different hair types and had them use 11 of the best curling irons on the market today.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-05T19:45:14Z","id":"9YCsAmcayiuJCgpvLXWGmW","meta":{"title":"Best Curling Irons 2019 - Reviews, Comparison and Test Results","description":"We gathered seven testers in our office with completely different hair types and had them use 11 of the best curling irons on the market today."},"products":[{"slug":"john-frieda","url":"/product/john-frieda","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","name":"John Frieda","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"YS5dzSPbmehLtLpdtGBW7d","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"conair-cd107tp","url":"/product/conair-cd107tp","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","name":"Conair CD107TP","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"EQTZXUXRDoDkaUpWcGNfUk","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"farouk-arc-chi","url":"/product/farouk-arc-chi","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","name":"Farouk Arc Chi","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"kYxaDmm8iTZv9gxq5FYJcP","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"xtava-satin-wave","url":"/product/xtava-satin-wave","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","name":"Xtava Satin Wave","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"tooVuYrmGVVhcmHNEQ5wfg","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"remington-ci91x","url":"/product/remington-ci91x","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","name":"Remington CI91X","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"cmGofqA2Vame3ucaLpsXNC","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/H99N2CgMwN9peRBYHEB3JL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Curling-Irons-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/3/O/817908/original/_Hero-Curling-Irons-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"H99N2CgMwN9peRBYHEB3JL","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H99N2CgMwN9peRBYHEB3JL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Curling Irons of 2019","description":"We gathered seven testers in our office with completely different hair types and had them use 11 of the best curling irons on the market today."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/H99N2CgMwN9peRBYHEB3JL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Curling-Irons-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/3/O/817908/original/_Hero-Curling-Irons-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"H99N2CgMwN9peRBYHEB3JL","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H99N2CgMwN9peRBYHEB3JL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Curling Irons of 2019","description":"We gathered seven testers in our office with completely different hair types and had them use 11 of the best curling irons on the market today."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"hair-care","url":"/health-and-beauty/hair-care","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","name":"Hair Care","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:41Z","id":"iPK3oHStMacB6mfFYRm8gn","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
