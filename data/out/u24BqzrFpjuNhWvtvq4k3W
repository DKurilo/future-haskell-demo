The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Amana NFW5700BW front-loading washer doesn’t have a lot of flashy features and functions, but it does include seven wash cycles and five options, which gives you a good variety for cleaning laundry.","Its 4.1-cubic-foot washtub, which is more than enough room for a large size load of laundry, allows you to do more laundry at once and cut down the amount of loads you may be doing with your current washer.","Although it falls short on advanced and attractive features, we were impressed with a couple of features on this appliance. The most impressive feature we found on this front-load washing machine is the efficiency monitor. This feature will provide you with feedback regarding how energy efficient your washer is based on the wash cycles and options you use.","We were also happy to see that this front-load washer included a delay wash option, which lets you delay a wash cycle from running for up to eight hours. This feature can be both convenient for you and can help you be more energy conscious by waiting to run your laundry during off-peak hours when utility rates may be reduced, which is available in some areas.","It does fall short in quite a few areas, though. For instance, we are disappointed that there is no sanitize wash cycle or option available on this front-loader washer.","This front-load washing machine is only available in the one color and does not come in any other color variety. Additionally, this Amana washer is the only front-loader washer in the Amana line. It is 38 inches in height, 27 inches in width and 32-3/4 inches in depth.","You only get a one-year warranty with this front-load washer, which isn’t impressive at all. Many manufacturers will tack on an additional warranty for the appliance motor and washtub, but this Amana front-load washer is only backed all-around by the one-year warranty, which is disappointing.","You can, however, get a hold of Amana easily enough if you need any help or support. You can contact the manufacturer by phone or by filling out and submitting an online contact form for them to contact you via email for support. Additionally, you can view the product user manual online and reference a handful of FAQs on the Amana website."]},"id":"79eee122-6242-4c08-90d4-5911f21a69d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1ae140fe-4663-485c-bb94-3b441d5e7c99","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Amana NFW5700BW front-loader washer may be more on the basic side, but it does include a nice variety of wash cycles and options.
