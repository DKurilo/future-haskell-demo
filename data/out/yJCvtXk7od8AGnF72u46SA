Attractive, especially in the relatively new world of electronic book readers that gives consumers few options to personalize their devices. From the striking Sangria red, dark blue and silver, the PRS 505 has a couple options that will be sure to get you noticed wherever you decide to read. Sony also offers several limited time offers with this electronic reader. From the annual Valentine’s edition in bright red and preloaded with Harlequin novels to the current Ian Fleming limited edition that comes with a leather case embossed with 007 on the front.","Where this device really loses its appeal when compared to other electronic digital readers is its internal storage capacity. The Sony 505 can only hold 160 titles. This is really disappointing, especially for avid readers. Unless, of course, people buy it as a supplement to their physical book library. They still keep their books, but they can use the digital reader for traveling.","The battery can last for about 2 weeks, or 7,500 continuous page turns. That helps, especially if you want to travel with the book.","For how few features the Sony PRS 505 offers compared to its competitors and even Sony’s newer model, we were really disappointed to see that it was still so expensive. Sure it comes in a variety of colors, but we don’t think it’s worth $300. Especially since this would be a good device for those who would use it to supplement their physical library. We would like to see $100 or so knocked off before we could really think this device would win out over its main competitors.<br/> "]},"id":"8d2ef2cd-ad4d-43c0-951b-f53d3b71a653","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Portability"},"id":"3bfead64-a41f-4f48-99b3-18871479c773","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We liked the fact that, although this is an older model from Sony, it is still compatible with the Sony eBook Store.
