Sennheiser has been making high-quality audio equipment since 1945. The <strong>Sennheiser PXC 350</strong> headphones, originally released in 2007, are ideal for people who want uninterrupted sound quality. The physical design of the PXC 350s in addition to their outstanding range of sound frequencies and prolonged battery life are the reasons we found this product to be among the best<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-3.html\"> noise-canceling headphones</a>  we reviewed. We liked them so much, in fact, that we gave them our <strong>TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award</strong>.","This headset uses NoiseGard technology to identify surrounding noise and create a signal that will cancel it out. In addition to active noise cancellation, the physical design of the headset helps block unwanted exterior sound. The Sennheiser PXC 350s can also play in passive mode, when it isn&#39;t using the active noise-canceling function. Because of the superb sound isolation and cancellation, you will be able to keep your decibel levels low while still enjoying your music."]},"id":"b3c4be84-a617-4b50-a4c1-1451665c8c10","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Noise Cancelling &amp; Bluetooth"},"id":"76225a78-491e-4970-a5e6-0c505eac5d2e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Prd3DHALBCYHwyjC7FM3b6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Some noise-canceling headphones require batteries in order to function at all.
