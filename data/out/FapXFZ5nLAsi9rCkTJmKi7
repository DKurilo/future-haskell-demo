You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","DUP-DVD is <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a> that takes content from a DVD and converts it to CD format. This is of limited use because it can only be viewed in a VCD-compatible DVD player or hard drive. Features to burn copied content onto another DVD are effectively nonexistent. Save for foreign-language support, we could find no tools or features that make it stand out from the crowd of the best DVD copy software available.","The DVD copy process for this application is a simple one. The software&#39;s interface is not as easy to use as the other DVD cloner applications we have reviewed, which is just another strike against this application. However, if you do take the time to work with this product and figure out exactly how to begin the DVD burning process, the burn process itself is straightforward. There is not much help available, and only a little information about the product is available on the website.","This DVD copy software application supports Windows XP, but it doesn&#39;t have support for Windows 7. This application is very easy to install; however, we had difficulties getting the application to work. We frequently got error messages when launching the software. After receiving several error messages, we decided to contact the company and figure out the issue. After more than a week of waiting for a response to our question, we finally got an answer. We were not happy with the customer service for this application at all.","Because this DVD burning software only converts to a VCD or SVCD format, the quality of the copy is not comparable to the original DVD. It&#39;s not intended to copy to DVDs, and DVD players can&#39;t access the created files, which limits where and how you can use this particular application.","This is the second time we have evaluated this DVD copy software application. In our previous review, several years ago, using an older version, we experienced difficulties when copying to SVCD format. Currently, after trying the most recent upgraded version of DUP-DVD, we still found the software to be difficult to work with and extremely unstable, frequently giving us error messages upon launch and throughout the copy process."]},"id":"c966fe50-ae86-4912-9c29-0cefc3d4f3a8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8b5c032a-7d96-42ac-8198-8567b4b6b8e2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["DUP-DVD limits your use to burning DVDs to CDs, thus significantly decreasing each copy&#39;s quality.
