the Body-Solid Powerline BSG10X as our best value because it saves you money without compromising functionality. Often priced under $800, it’s the second least expensive home gym we reviewed. Only the Marcy Club 200 is cheaper, but it provides fewer workout options and lacks important features and accessories. For example, the <a href=\"/marcy-club-review\">Marcy Club 200</a> doesn’t come with an ab strap or harness, and its frame warranty is only two years. Neither machine has upgradeable resistance capacity. If this feature is important to you, look at the <a href=\"/bowflex-xtreme-2-se-review\">Bowflex Xtreme 2SE</a>, the <a href=\"/life-fitness-g2-review\">Life Fitness G2</a> and the <a href=\"/powertec-workbench-multi-system-review\">Powertec Workbench</a>.","Much like the <a href=\"/body-solid-g1s-review\">Body-Solid G1S</a>, which is our top pick in home gyms, the BSG10X has a 160-pound weight stack centered on a durable steel frame. It provides 40-plus workouts that target your upper body, lower body and abs, and it comes with a 48-inch lat bar, a low row bar and an ab crunch harness. Like nine of the 10 home gyms we reviewed, it’s designed with a pulley and cable system. Only the Powertec Workbench is different, using weight plates instead of weight stacks, power rods or nitrogen-charged cylinders for resistance. Another difference between the two machines is the BSG10X is designed for one user at a time, while the Powertec Workbench can accommodate three users simultaneously.","As we learned about resistance technologies, Scott McDonald, Body-Solid’s CEO, taught us that another name for home gyms with weight stacks is “selectorized machines.” He said he prefers either weight stacks or weight plates over other resistance types.","“Actual weights as opposed to alternative resistance machines that use bands or some other resistance technology give a better overall experience and better replicate the actual lifting of weights you may do in your normal life,” he said.  “Alternative resistance generally has a problem with varying levels of resistance as you cycle through an exercise.  Envision a rubber band or spring that gets harder to pull as you pull more on it versus a hand weight that is consistent across the profile of the exercise.”","The Body-Solid BSG10X has a base footprint of 70 x 42 x 80 inches (length, width and height). In addition to being sure you have enough room for the machine itself, you’ll  want to allow space for a full range of motion as you work out. Also, while it weighs 280 pounds less than the heaviest machine we reviewed, the <a href=\"/yukon-wolverine-multi-station-review\">Yukon Wolverine</a>, the BSG10X still weighs 328 pounds and isn’t easy to move once assembled.","First-time assembly is much simpler than most home gyms, as it comes out of the box 90 percent pre-assembled. There are only nine bolts to fasten before your machine is ready for use. Optional attachments include a leg press, weight shrouds and a triceps rope. Unlike the G1S, it doesn’t come with instructional videos.","Body-Solid provides customer support for its equipment by phone and email. While the best home gyms have a lifetime warranty, the BSG10X comes with a 10-year warranty on its frame and only one year on parts. This guarantee is valid for in-home use only."]},"id":"70d5df6f-c2b2-4506-b2ac-04a362c60365","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"35d8ae32-7e1c-4c70-8496-681d01e9febd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" We selected the Body-Solid Powerline BSG10X as our best value because it saves you money without compromising functionality.
