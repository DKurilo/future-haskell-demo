In addition to helping you create professional-looking discs, this <a href=\"/best-dvd-authoring-software\">DVD maker software</a> has powerful editing tools that allow you to transform your uncut home video footage into something truly remarkable.","Creating a DVD using MAGIX Movie Edit Pro is a simple affair. Once you’ve built your video project in the program’s video editing module, click the DVD icon in the top right corner of the interface.  This launches the program’s menu creator where you pick a template, customize it and begin burning a new disc in about half an hour. Once you begin the burning process, it takes the program another 30 minutes. So, once you have your project in the video editing module, it takes about an hour to fully author a new disc.","One of the major drawbacks of this DVD authoring software is that you can only burn video content that&#39;s contained in the editing module. There are no options to add bonus features, alternate audio tracks or other content. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro is the only award winner in our review to have this restriction.","Another omission that separates this product from the category&#39;s top two award winners is the application&#39;s inability to save a disc&#39;s ISO file (or ISO image) to your computer&#39;s hard drive. An ISO file is the blueprint of a disc, and when you save it to your hard drive, you have the ability to burn new copies whenever you want. Because you can&#39;t save the ISO files you build with this software, you’ll have to save your video&#39;s raw project files if you ever want to make a new copy of your disc.","The most basic and essential function of any non-linear editing application is the timeline. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro provides this tool and allows you to work with up to 99 tracks for video, audio and images. While most people will never use that many tracks, it&#39;s important that you have as much workspace available as possible for any complicated projects you work on.","The timeline can be somewhat complicated to learn and use. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro provides an alternative called the storyboard. This is a more user-friendly interface for editing your videos. It&#39;s not as versatile as the timeline because you only have a single track to work with. What MAGIX Movie Edit Pro does wonderfully is integrate the timeline edits with the storyboard and allow you to switch back and forth with your changes intact. So, you can make broad-stroke edits in storyboard mode and fine-tune the project in timeline mode.","A healthy library of transitions and effects is critical for any DVD authoring software application. Out of the box, you get more than 500 effects, transitions, titles and other objects to enhance your video footage. You can download many more transitions and effects from MAGIX&#39;s website. So, no matter what you want to do to your footage, it&#39;s likely you can find a way to do it with this program.","Another video editing feature we enjoyed in this DVD creator is its professional movie templates. This is essentially a paint-by-numbers approach to video editing. You plug in scenes, music and sounds for fast results. This has three benefits: First, you have a finished product quickly. Second, you&#39;re learning how the software works. Finally, and most important, you&#39;re honing your storytelling skills so that you&#39;ll have the confidence to take off the training wheels in future projects and make a DVD that is truly your own artistic expression.","All of the DVD authoring applications on our lineup take some time to learn and use. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro is no exception. If you&#39;ve never used DVD making or video editing software before, you&#39;ll be well served to take a look at the free, step-by-step tutorials offered on MAGIX&#39;s website. Once you’ve learned your way around the software&#39;s interface, you should have few problems using the software to its highest potential.","MAGIX is committed to providing excellent customer and technical support. If you run into a problem, you can usually find a solution in MAGIX’s online knowledgebase and FAQ section. If you can’t get your question answered there, you can reach out to the company through email or their various social media profiles on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. MAGIX is quick to help customers, usually responding within 48 hours."]},"id":"3cca16c9-c20a-44e9-98f6-89a0907980f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f0f61e77-050b-43ec-a015-c40e659f5447","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2016 is a great choice for DVD maker software.
