The oversized Foot Frame creates an all-over wide trail running shoe and wider toe box for your toes to spread out and relax. The TPU toe guard protects against lose and sharp debris on rockier trails and across lose scree while still weighing in at a reasonable 12.2 oz and minimal 4 mm drop with a total stack height of 35 mm at the heel and 31 mm at the forefoot.","Mafate 4 outshines many other trail running shoes with posture-promoting stability while navigating sketchier trails. The EVA midsole design gently rolls the foot forward while still maintaining a stable and supported base in the forefoot for smooth transition. Testers found the result to be confident trail handling allowing for maintained form and maximized oxygen intake on those steep pitches.","Active Junky found that the shoe performed best under drier conditions. While the deep-grooved treads provide added stability on the trails, they are prone to build up mud and debris in wetter conditions, which can detract from the overall performance and quality of a run.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments:</strong> Focusing less on traction and foot protection lead to more attention on pace, output and navigation with stability in a trail running shoe. The overarching result was increased endurance and shorter recovery time.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Performance","<strong>Best For: </strong>Mountain training to build stamina and power, joint injury mitigation and mid-length to long runs in drier conditions","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"cb1c8cd2-cf3e-44f7-8087-8b8347ceb89d","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 12.2 oz","Drop: 4 mm","Stack Height: 35 mm heel, 31 mm forefoot","Upper: TPU","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber"],"type":"ul"},"id":"38e20700-2ad2-4b14-ad56-c757dafe30c8","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background:</strong> Hoka One One is comprised of committed and enthusiastic runners.
