Fortunately, all-in-one PCs take up very little space while offering maximum computing power. The Acer VZ4620G-Ui3322X proves this by offering a wide range of professional tools, a large monitor and easy setup. Although this Veriton Z computer will fit well in a home office, it lacks the entertainment options that would make it good for the whole family.","The Acer VZ4620G-Ui3322X is a bare-bones computer. However, what it lacks in graphics and processing power, it makes up for with its ability to help you get your work done. As a home office all-in-one PC, the Veriton Z line of computers offers huge advantages, especially with their clear display and professional tools. In particular, the VZ4620G-Ui3322X ships with Windows 7 Professional and a starter version of Word and Excel. Unfortunately, the Office programs are ad-supported, and if you want access to other programs, you&#39;ll have to buy them separately.","The Acer VZ4620G-Ui3322X offers very little superfluous equipment. Out of the box, you get the computer, a power cord, and a wired keyboard and mouse. The computer does not have speakers built in, but it does have a webcam and microphone. You&#39;ll have to plug in headphones or speakers to use video communication. If you want to distract yourself with streaming video, the 21.5-inch monitor offers full 1080p resolution, even if the computer itself is not designed for that function.<br/>Acer offers good support and information from its website, and you&#39;ll find downloads and troubleshooting easily. If you cannot fix the problem yourself, customer service representatives are able to help through telephone, email or live chat, and they&#39;ll help with most problems. We would have liked for the VZ4620G-Ui3322X to include support software in its computers, like many of the other computers we reviewed."]},"id":"d35c40ca-5996-4779-900e-c8fdfcdbfda0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3ae0ce18-28aa-4d75-aee4-fc7555ffba3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you need a computer for your home office, the Acer VZ4620G-Ui3322X offers all of the equipment you need without any extra features that you don&#39;t need.
