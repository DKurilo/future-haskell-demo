It offers a variety of useful features that you&#39;d expect to see on high-end models.","Boasting a 208 cc four-cycle engine, this power tiller from Cub Cadet offers 125 tine rotations per minute, delivering enough power and speed to till even heavily compacted soil and virgin ground. As a midrange garden tiller, the Cub Cadet FT24 is a popular choice because of its reliability and versatility. It offers some surprising features for the price point, the most noticeable of which is the adjustable tilling width. It has three settings of 13 inches, 22 inches and 24 inches, allowing you to plow over large swathes of earth of small, narrow rows between plants.","The adjustable width is combined with sturdy vegetable guards, which allows you to till very close to plants without disturbing the plants or throwing soil and debris over them. The guards also act as a safety feature, preventing you from getting too close to the tines while they are in motion. These protective discs are easy to remove, making cleaning and maintaining the tines a simple process.","You can also take advantage of the six depth adjustments, allowing you to till to a maximum depth of 6.5 inches. The small 8-inch tires may need wheel weights or a counterbalance to provide more traction and stability for heavy-duty tasks and slick or uneven surfaces.","This rototiller lacks counter-rotating tines, offering forward-rotating tines instead. However, it does feature a power reverse mode, allowing you to till over the row again, but backward, helping you achieve a very fine soil structure without the need for lifting the machine out of the bed, turning and restarting.","Although this garden tiller has front-facing tines, it&#39;s still capable of handling most garden and general maintenance tasks, and it&#39;s light and easy to use. Weighing in at 100 pounds and featuring plow-style handles, the Cub Cadet FT24 offers exceptional maneuverability and requires little effort from you for effective operation. However, because of the lack of weight and small tires, the tiller can produce excessive bounce and vibration when working very heavy or stony soil. It has a three-year limited residential warranty, which only covers you for personal use.","In spite of the lack of accessories and frills, this midrange gas tiller is a good option for those looking for a lightweight, versatile tiller for use around the garden. It is easy to use and maintain and is suitable for the majority of tilling tasks."]},"id":"cd2f1b9e-bb6e-479b-82fd-13b82ae51003","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62704","url":"/cub-cadet-ft24-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T17:02:52Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T17:02:52Z","name":"Cub Cadet FT24","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
