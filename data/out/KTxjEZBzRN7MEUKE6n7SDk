Some offer basic ergonomic features to improve comfort, and others feature programmable keys.","Most Microsoft Desktop keyboards use 2.4GHz radio frequency wireless connections via a small RF dongle to connect to your computer. This makes them plug-and-play devices, and they have reliable, lag-free connections. Some models come with one or more USB pass-throughs, so you can connect additional peripherals easily. However, most models don&#39;t have AV ports, so users with 3.5mm jacks on their headsets still need to connect them directly to their PCs.","Some lower-budget Microsoft keyboards use silicone or rubber dome switches, but most feature scissor switches for reliable, long-lasting use. The company’s low-profile wireless keyboards often use scissor switches to evenly distribute weight with each keystroke, as well as limit key travel and noise, all while creating ample tactile response. These keyboards boast advanced standard encryption, or AES, so your keystrokes cannot be logged, which enhances data security.","If you stream a lot of media, choosing a keyboard with dedicated media keys is a smart choice, and many models in the Wireless Desktop series come equipped with an array of media and Windows hotkeys. Some of these Microsoft wireless keyboards feature a few programmable keys so you can set macros for frequently used key sequences. Some also allow you to reprogram the media and Windows hotkeys. While many of these keyboards are standalone devices, some come bundled with a compatible full-size wireless mouse.","There are a few Microsoft Desktop keyboards with slight ergonomic features, including wrist rests, and some have a curved-board design that increases comfort and promotes good wrist health. They also come with tilt legs you can engage to increase the typing gradient. Because these keyboards aren&#39;t geared toward serious gamers, they don&#39;t feature anti-ghosting. They are also missing backlighting and profiles, and they have comparatively low polling rates of between 125 and 500Hz, all of which also make them unsuitable for gamers."]},"id":"139fec8c-7816-4d7a-bae6-462e3860c9ea","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68437","url":"/microsoft-wireless-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-21T18:31:16Z","datePublished":"2016-09-21T18:31:16Z","name":"Microsoft Desktop Wireless","synopsis":"Microsoft’s wireless keyboards cater to all kinds of users, including those who need simple, no-frills devices for light, everyday tasks and power users who want to optimize their workstations w","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Microsoft’s wireless keyboards cater to all kinds of users, including those who need simple, no-frills devices for light, everyday tasks and power users who want to optimize their workstations w","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-21T18:31:16Z","id":"KTxjEZBzRN7MEUKE6n7SDk","meta":{"title":"Microsoft Desktop Wireless Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Microsoft Desktop wireless keyboards help maximize your productivity.
