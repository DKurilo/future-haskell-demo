The fees charged by AccountNow are typical of <a href=\"/best-prepaid-credit-cards\">prepaid credit card</a> companies. AccountNow&#39;s are neither particularly high nor particularly low.","Traditionally, having a prepaid card, and your demonstrated payment history, isn&#39;t reported to the credit bureaus. AccountNow has partnered with a credit bureau (Pay Rent Build Credit Inc.) to help consumers with no or poor credit either establish credit or rebuild a low score.","Membership comes with an activation fee but is waived if you opt to regularly have funds loaded to your card via direct deposit. There is a monthly service fee, but with that fee, you&#39;re not charged additional charges for purchases, whether signature or PIN transactions, so users are free to choose Credit or Debit at the register without any financial impact.","Withdrawals can be made from domestic ATMs for a low fee, but withdrawals from a cashier are rather steep. If you use an international ATM, the charge is also high, and AccountNow adds a currency conversion fee. Conducting a balance inquiry at an ATM also comes with a fee.","Your monthly statement is available online for free, but if you&#39;d like to get a printed one from AccountNow, there&#39;s a charge. Replacing a lost or stolen card incurs a charge as well. These fees can change at any time, so be sure to check the fine print on AccountNow&#39;s website.","Daily cash withdrawals using AccountNow cards are limited to several hundred dollars, and for users not participating in direct deposit, the daily withdrawal limit is lower. When using the card as a credit card, known as a signature transaction, the daily maximum is higher than a cash withdrawal. Spending limitations don&#39;t apply to online bill transactions.","Direct deposit is the most advantageous way to add funds to your AccountNow card. There are, however, numerous other ways to recharge the cards. Deposits can also be made via wire services. AccountNow doesn&#39;t charge directly for these deposits, but you can expect the retailer to charge for the service. Money can also be transferred from bank accounts and other financial institutions. Money can also be moved from one AccountNow card to another free of charge.","AccountNow&#39;s web site is informative and thorough. Telephone support, both for automated service and to speak with a live agent, may incur a charge, depending on the plan you choose.","You can choose between a Visa or MasterCard prepaid credit card through AccountNow, and you can pick whichever plan works best for you. AccountNow offers a broad range of services, many are accompanied by a fee."]},"id":"59057cb6-44e4-4001-a9cb-7cff22f207a1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3371","url":"/accountnow-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-07-14T16:06:53Z","datePublished":"2009-07-14T16:06:53Z","name":"AccountNow","synopsis":"Although most prepaid cards don't generally help you build up your credit score or history, AccountNow offers a couple of features with its Visa and MasterCard cards that can help you with this.
