Its maximum payouts are below average for most of the common conditions, but it offers reimbursement for cancellations due to financial default. It offers concierge and other services over the phone, but the online interface and website are outdated and difficult to use. If this is an important feature for you, <a href=\"/seven-corners-review\">Seven Corners</a> is a company with a user-friendly online interface.","AIG&#39;s website lists insurance plans for a wide variety of trip types, but we found that some of the specialty plans were just the regular plans renamed. You can use the online quote system from the home page to get the plan information you need. However, the quote request interface was difficult to navigate, and you&#39;ll need to drill down to get to a download of the policy itself. There is no online method for filing claims, nor is there information on the type of paperwork you need to supply. Overall, we found the online interface of this agency the worst of those we evaluated.","Pricing varied not only by age of insured and plan, but also by your state of residence. It was the only trip insurance company with such a large state variation; with other agencies, only age had an effect on prices. On average, the prices were slightly below average, even with state variation.","The insurance coverage itself is at or just below average compared to the other top agencies we considered. The maximum payouts are smaller - $25,000 for medical expenses as opposed to $100,000 for most of the carriers, for example. However, they are still adequate for most situations. In addition, this agency can cover you if your carrier or tour company goes into financial default; not all trip insurance agencies do this.","AIG can advance you hospital fees to ensure you get care, assists, but does not pay for, replacing lost prescriptions, and can arrange medical evacuation in emergencies. This insurance offers a rental policy for vehicles.","A useful extra benefit is identity theft assistance to help you obtain credit report records so you can keep track of issues with your credit rating that may result from your ID or credit cards being stolen on vacation. The agents can also help you replace lost or stolen medications, but the insurance does not reimburse you for the costs.","AIG has 24/7 assistance from translators and concierge services that can help with sending flowers to someone, lining up tickets to events, arranging for tee time at golf courses and more."]},"id":"2bf21e35-6e2c-4b10-a9ec-e38f38d0ee91","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9a1c0030-ae0a-41d3-8e74-4b8747898e4e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["AIG&#39;s travel insurance premiums were among the cheapest we priced, but the amount of coverage was also somewhat lower.
