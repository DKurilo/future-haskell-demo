The rectangular shape is unique among under-seat <a href=\"/best-car-subwoofers\">car subwoofers</a>, but it allows the subwoofer to fit in a much smaller enclosure. While the performance was above average, the size of the bass isn&#39;t great, even for an under-seat subwoofer.","The KSC-SW11 has an MSRP of $249.95, but the market price is around $134, making this one of the most affordable car subwoofer on the market. By comparison, the <a href=\"/pioneer-ts-wx1210a-review\">Pioneer TS-WX1210A</a> has the same market price, but these subwoofers couldn&#39;t be more different in terms of size and performance. The Kenwood is exceptionally small and fits under your car&#39;s seat while the TS-WX1210A is a beast of a subwoofer, requiring a trunk installation.","In the performance tests, the KSC-SW11 earned a B+ grade. It can sound very good within a mix. You won&#39;t have diminished mids and highs as it fills out the low-end. However, when I isolated the bass by disconnecting the speakers, the bass wasn&#39;t nearly as tight as it seemed. Perhaps it&#39;s the almost rectangular shape of the woofer, but the bass sounds a little more aggressive than other under-seat subwoofers. At high levels, there is noticeable distortion and clipping â€“ something not heard in the <a href=\"/infinity-basslink-sm-review\">Infinity BassLink SM</a>.","The size of the bass earned a C grade, the lowest of the powered car subwoofers in my test. It&#39;s not surprising considering both its size and the relatively weak 75-watt amplifier. It&#39;s certainly capable of rattling the teeth between your ears if you turn the bass up all the way, but the performance quickly deteriorates and doesn&#39;t justify it. Rather, the sweet spot of the sub&#39;s performance is only a hair above 50-percent volume. This is disappointing because it sounds great in the sweet spot but isn&#39;t nearly as big as other subwoofers. The under-seat installation makes up for much of the size issues because you&#39;re closer to the bass frequencies, but there are bigger sounding under-seat subs available.","The controls are disappointing, receiving a C+ grade. It only has three controls: two dials for the volume and crossover frequency and a switch for the phase control. It simply doesn&#39;t provide as much control over the tuning as other subwoofers. That said, each of these controls are on the wired remote, providing better access from the driver&#39;s seat.","The Kenwood KSC-SW11 is an affordable under-seat subwoofer with good, though not great performance. It doesn&#39;t have the power to knock your socks off, but it may not need it since it&#39;s small enough to fit under your seat."]},"id":"1f1be56f-d45d-437d-a2e7-d9dd9464ef45","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70028","url":"/kenwood-ksc-sw11-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-12T15:06:30Z","datePublished":"2018-06-12T15:06:30Z","name":"Kenwood KSC-SW11","synopsis":"The Kenwood KSC-SW11 features an 8.25 x 5.15-inch woofer.
