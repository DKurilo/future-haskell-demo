It&#39;s not a strong fan and won&#39;t make a huge difference in laptop temperature, nor is the fan well protected. It does lift some of the burden from your laptop&#39;s internal fans, but not much. The fan is quiet, but it doesn&#39;t offer adjustable speeds.","The Belkin&#39;s curved design creates a lot of space for your laptop to breathe. That space is also supposed to  make it good to use on your lap or other soft surface, but the pad has plastic feet that will put pressure on your legs, making it uncomfortable to use on your lap for a long period of time. The fan location is also inconvenient for lap use. When it&#39;s on your lap, you have a fan whirring and trying to ventilate air on your knees.","This notebook cooler has one of the best grips to keep your laptop in place of all the devices we reviewed. There are two long rubber strips along the top of the cooling pad, so your laptop will stay secure.   However, t he placement of the grips means that this cooler won&#39;t work with a laptop bigger than 15 inches.","There is a dedicated space to store the USB cord when you&#39;re not using it. Be aware that this is not a laptop cooler you take on the go. This is a cooler that you buy and you leave at home. Its design makes it tough to squeeze it into a laptop bag or backpack.","This laptop cooling pad has a lifetime warranty. Belkin&#39;s customer support webpages are difficult to navigate, but you can contact the company by phone, email and fax. However, we really would have liked to see a live chat option."]},"id":"5d36a56f-32d6-4ec5-adb6-72fcb409bdec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"037d026a-ecfc-412a-bd26-3c380dc8dd47","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Belkin laptop cooler offers good ventilation and will keep your laptop stable, but it lacks a lot of the fan power and portable design of the best laptop coolers.
