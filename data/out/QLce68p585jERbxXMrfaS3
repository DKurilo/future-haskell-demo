You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Alarm Zone offers a system where you get a free set of security equipment with a home security monitoring contract. Alarm Zone offers several options for <a href=\"/best-home-security-monitoring\">home security monitoring</a> through a landline phone, cellular line or broadband internet connection. In addition to the basic packages, this site offers a few other types of custom security devices, but not everything that other companies offer. Although it carries the latest GE equipment, the company hasn&#39;t brought on Alarm.com for interactive access or home automation, nor has it designed its own system for those two features. This puts them behind the times for what has all but become the standard in the industry.","This home security monitoring company uses the GE Simon XT and Simon 3 panels. Which one you get will depend on how you want to connect to the monitoring station. Alarm Zone gives you the option to connecting via a landline, cellular or broadband. Since most cities in America have cell towers now, cellular monitoring has become the most popular, due to its reliability. Plus, it is easy to set up.","Besides home security monitoring, Alarm Zone is a dealer of GE wireless security systems. These systems are designed to be installed by the customer and no wiring or electrical knowledge is required to install them. Alarm Zone packages are designed for burglary protection and include motion detectors, window and door sensors, internal sirens, control panels and keypads. They may also include key fob controllers that allow you to arm your system, disarm your system or call for immediate help with the click of just one button.","In addition to the equipment included in the packages, Alarm Zone sells other devices like freeze sensors, panic buttons, door sensors and other items, but the company offers no heat or carbon monoxide detectors. It did not used to offer monitored smoke detectors, but thankfully, the company has remedied that. It has also added security cameras to its repertoire, which especially appeals to commercial systems.","Alarm Zone offers customer support by phone only. You can use the contact form on the website to receive a home security quote, but Alarm Zone does not visit your home in person. Rather, it will call you at the number you provide, and based on some basic information about your home, it will recommend an alarm package or combination of equipment for your situation.","Alarm Zone only offers self-install systems, which means that the company doesn&#39;t have repair teams either. If your system is not working, Alarm Zone will help you by phone with resetting your devices. If a piece of equipment goes bad due to defects or other conditions outside of the owner&#39;s control, it is covered by a lifetime warranty while you are under contract, and you can replace the device in question with no charge. If you break any equipment, though, you will have to pay for a replacement."]},"id":"228a6762-17e0-46d6-945f-1a2a5a1147e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"761bd76e-a79d-4b0f-8cdb-6dcfd20e13c9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Alarm Zone lost many points in our ratings because the company does not offer much information, which is pretty necessary for self-install systems.
