The M3D550KD offers a very unique and quite handy feature known as the VIA (Vizio Internet Apps system) which includes Netflix, videos on demand, Vudu and a handful of other apps. There is also a Wikipedia search, Facebook, eBay and many other online features. All of these new apps and features can be accessed on an easy-to-use navigation bar that will appear on the bottom of the LED TV screen.

The 240Hz refresh rate is about par for LED TVs, but that is all you need for a clear, crisp picture with virtually no blurring.
