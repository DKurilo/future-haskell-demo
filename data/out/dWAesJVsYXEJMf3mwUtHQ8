You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Better Homes and Gardens BH12 is manufactured by Blue Rhino for Walmart and is also sold as the UniFlame GBC1273SP. This budget <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared grill</a> performs surprisingly well against the best infrared grills. Its heat consistency, power and grilling experience rival the best infrared barbecue, which makes it a good value for the price. However, this grill lacks the durability and warranty protection that usually accompanies the best grills. This grill includes a ceramic sear burner along the right side of the main cooking area as well as a rear rotisserie burner. The sear burner quickly produces extreme heat over a large surface area, better than many burners in our review, which require longer for preheating.","Our heat consistency tests revealed that this grill distributes its heat really well. Across the primary cooking area, the grill has few hot spots to compromise the grilling experience. Likewise, the grill maintained a stable temperature of around 470 degrees Fahrenheit in our long test on low heat. This is the type of performance you find on premium grills, and it&#39;s exactly what you want for cooking large cuts of meat at low temperatures for long periods. The grill offers a lot of power; it preheats in two minutes, which is faster than over half of the grills in our review.","The BH12&#39;s grilling experience is quite good. Its 500-square-inch cooking area is large enough to fit food for most families. The warming rack, which keeps your food hot after it cooks, is 212 square inches, making it the second largest in our review. As with most grills in our review, you can purchase a conversion kit to make this grill run on natural gas instead of propane. This infrared gas grill also offers a built-in temperature gauge to help you with slow-roasting projects. It doesn&#39;t offer a self-cleaning function, but it is easy to clean.","The build quality is this grill&#39;s main drawback. The material in its design is rather flexible and feels flimsy. This grill probably wouldn&#39;t stand up to repeated use for more than a few years. With regular maintenance, it might last longer. The stainless steel cooking grates are solidly constructed and easy to clean. The built-in storage cabinet has plenty of room for your grilling accessories. This infrared barbecue grill is the only one in our review that comes with a rotisserie motor kit, which adds to its value.","Ferrellgas, Blue Rhino&#39;s parent company, offers a one-year warranty on this grill. This warranty matches the quality of the construction but doesn&#39;t hold up against the coverage of other infrared gas grills. The technical support for this grill is available by email and phone. You can look up FAQs and user manuals on the Blue Rhino website."]},"id":"2f169266-870b-4bdf-9ba0-a1e653a0a9d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b0891975-5fa1-4d13-ac95-44cee54af82f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Better Homes and Gardens BH12 does a great job with infrared barbecue cooking.
