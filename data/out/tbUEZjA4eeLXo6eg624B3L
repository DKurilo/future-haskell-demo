The V-MODA Crossfade series stereo headphones have overall excellent sound quality with deep, resonant base; crisp highs; and clear mid tones.","Every pair of headphones has a frequency range, which indicates how well they can reproduce low, mid and high frequencies. Frequency is expressed in Hertz (Hz), which is a measure of the speed of vibration. The frequency range determines the lowest and highest tones a pair of headphones can reproduce. Tones lower than 20Hz or higher than 20kHz are generally inaudible to humans.","The V-MODA Crossfade series stereo headphones have very wide frequency response ranges of around 5 to 30,000Hz. While they produce sound outside of the normal human hearing range, those outside tones still affect your listening experience. In general, the larger the range, the better the speakers are at delivering sound, and the headphones in the series make it feel like the musicians are right next to you performing.","Another measure to consider is headphone sensitivity, which is how efficient the headphones are at converting an electrical signal. This is recorded in decibels (dB). Headphones with low sensitivity struggle playing music from higher-decibel devices, which causes distortion and rough vibrations. When audio gear is taxed to the max, the audio is less clear and the music may have an artificial tone. If you’ve ever had an aching feeling in your ears after wearing headphones for an extended period, it may have been caused by low-range sensitivity. The V-MODA headphones in this series work well with low-power portable devices and in studios with high-power equipment."]},"id":"f6ec349a-b6e8-4aab-bfb7-f50f4d94aef2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Sa6FmS59iq4RFLeL8EyuFH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/prod/large/55765-v-moda-crossfade-lp2-box.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sa6FmS59iq4RFLeL8EyuFH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Sa6FmS59iq4RFLeL8EyuFH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sa6FmS59iq4RFLeL8EyuFH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4b980dbc-4c5a-4d10-a055-e769486009c0","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"V-Moda Crossfade\", \"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"Visit Site","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A39PPDK/?&tag=ttr_stereo_headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|606[art|NA[pid|55765[tid|NA[bbc|NA","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"button","review":{"rating":0,"url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html","name":"V-Moda Crossfade","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">V-Moda Crossfade</a>","pros":["Empty List"],"cons":["Empty List"]},"id":"8dc22526-b689-4fbb-a2e4-5d4b8a630370","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The most important feature of any set of headphones is its sound performance.
