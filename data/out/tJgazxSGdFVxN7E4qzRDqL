The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">Slide to Digital Image Converters</a> Reviews here.</em>","The Pacific Image ImageBox PLUS converts slides, film and prints to digital. This unit uses a fixed digital camera to transfer slides, outputting images with a 5 MP resolution. This is the lowest resolution of any device we reviewed during our comparisons.","This converter is not a stand-alone device, and it must be plugged into a computer to work. However, the ability to save images directly to your computer without transferring them to and from an SD card conveniently eliminates a step from the process that is required when using the ImageBox PLUS’s untethered counterparts. Use of the device does require installation of software onto your computer.","ImageBox PLUS includes Pacific Image&#39;s proprietary Magic Touch feature for removing scratches and dust. If you have damaged slides, this comes in handy. The downside is that while it is running, your conversion speed slows down.","Although there is no TV-out jack for viewing your images on a television, you are able to preview the images on your computer screen, rather than a 2-inch display. Since your images are transferred straight to your PC, the converter does not have a built-in viewing screen.","Included with the ImageBox PLUS is an easy-to-use quick installation guide. We found it simple to follow the instructions, and the process of installing the software is intuitive. The device includes an instruction book, USB cable, scanner driver CD, filmstrip holder, slide holder and photograph tray.","Pacific Image converters come with a one-year warranty. The support page on the company website provides troubleshooting tips, and there is a dropdown menu that directs you to an online manual for help; the FAQs page works the same way. You can also contact technical support directly through email. Overall, we were impressed with technical support representatives’ knowledge when we made contact."]},"id":"69156acc-a226-4f49-b215-cc99d6768e81","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"31ff15d3-afb6-45a0-bb0a-6e3641613713","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This converter is unique among the slide converters we reviewed because it requires the use of a computer and software to operate.
