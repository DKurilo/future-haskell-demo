It has by far the smallest capacity of the fridges we reviewed – just .14 cubic feet. That’s enough room to chill a handful of soda cans, which is exactly what it is made for. This Koolatron mini fridge is red, and the door is marked with the Coca-Cola name and the company’s signature polar bear.","Its door has a self-locking handle with a latch that turns, and inside, the plastic-lined compartment is big enough to hold six soft drink cans. It has one removable shelf, but given its size, there isn’t a freezer compartment. If this Koolatron model is too small or missing too many features, consider the <a href=\"/midea-review\">Midea WHS-87LW1</a>.","This small fridge plugs into a standard 110-volt AC outlet. However, you can also power it with the 12-volt DC outlet in your car.","Rather than using a compressor, the KWC4 has a thermoelectric cooling system – it uses a fan to pull heat from the fridge and out through a set of grilles on the back too keep its contents cool. With this cooling system, the fridge can keep drinks 32 degrees Fahrenheit below the ambient temperature. Its motorized fan keeps the fridge from getting hot, too. The fan makes a whirring sound, but it is quieter than a compressor cooling system.","Another benefit of the fridge’s thermoelectric system is it doesn’t vibrate like a compressor system. As such, the KWC4 is stable and can be used in moving vehicles, and it doesn’t require leveling feet or a stability bar to keep its balance."]},"id":"ddf27447-bc38-4aee-acd2-2275f3885505","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62349","url":"/koolatron-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-01-27T22:12:41Z","datePublished":"2015-01-27T22:12:41Z","name":"Koolatron KWC4","synopsis":"The Koolatron KWC4 Coca-Cola Personal Fridge is a fun, retro-style mini fridge that is small enough to fit in a car or on a desk – it is only 12 inches tall and weighs a mere 4.7 pounds.","review":{"rating":60,"verdict":"If you just want to keep a few soft drinks chilled while traveling or sitting in your den, the tiny Koolatron KWC4 Coca-Cola Personal Fridge can do the job.","pros":["You can power it with a wall outlet or the DC outlet in your car."],"cons":["It can only be used to chill cans of soda."]},"strapline":"The Koolatron KWC4 Coca-Cola Personal Fridge is a fun, retro-style mini fridge that is small enough to fit in a car or on a desk – it is only 12 inches tall and weighs a mere 4.7 pounds.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-02T00:00:00Z","id":"s2VGr9io2WvBpkcBSbj5Nh","meta":{"title":"Koolatron KWC-4 Coca-Cola Personal Mini Fridge Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you just want to keep a few soft drinks chilled while traveling or sitting in your den, the tiny Koolatron KWC4 Coca-Cola Personal Fridge can do the job."},"products":[{"slug":"koolatron-kwc4","url":"/product/koolatron-kwc4","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","name":"Koolatron KWC4","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","id":"TroceMEieyys8MMHUeNU6G","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/3ctsc6SRpyJMimAXKrnMqb.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"8df9382425d59a07f71d45e1f11ea520.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8df9382425d59a07f71d45e1f11ea520.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","id":"3ctsc6SRpyJMimAXKrnMqb","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ctsc6SRpyJMimAXKrnMqb.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Koolatron KWC-4 Coca-Cola Personal Mini Fridge Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you just want to keep a few soft drinks chilled while traveling or sitting in your den, the tiny Koolatron KWC4 Coca-Cola Personal Fridge can do the job."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/3ctsc6SRpyJMimAXKrnMqb.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"8df9382425d59a07f71d45e1f11ea520.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8df9382425d59a07f71d45e1f11ea520.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","id":"3ctsc6SRpyJMimAXKrnMqb","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ctsc6SRpyJMimAXKrnMqb.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Koolatron KWC-4 Coca-Cola Personal Mini Fridge Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you just want to keep a few soft drinks chilled while traveling or sitting in your den, the tiny Koolatron KWC4 Coca-Cola Personal Fridge can do the job."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/koolatron-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"refrigerators","url":"/kitchen/refrigerators","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","name":"Refrigerators","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:08:13Z","id":"hGnCzHoUh2aAKgnXsQGcFg","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
