This scale can seem a little quirky if you are not used to using a Bluetooth or wireless connection. For example, you must set up the wireless connection between the digital scale and your smartphone before you step on the scale for the first time. If you do not make this initial connection, your readings will not be recorded and synced with your device. If you change the batteries, you must go through the connection process again.","The iHealth MyVitals app is free to download and also comes with free access to the iHealth cloud service. It is in the cloud that all of your historical weight and BMI data is stored for easy recall. The MyVitals app takes your weight and BMI readings and enters them into easy-to-read charts and graphs. You can share your results with anyone. iHealth suggests you may even share it with your doctor. We love this idea. The app also allows you to track your daily caloric intake and input your activity level."]},"id":"163666e8-53cd-452e-9e44-7546ac5f5f95","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Tu98xzn2r2mEpeFhpd2xab.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56534-ihealth-wireless-scale1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tu98xzn2r2mEpeFhpd2xab.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Tu98xzn2r2mEpeFhpd2xab","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tu98xzn2r2mEpeFhpd2xab.jpg","alt":""},"id":"82d15742-60b3-480d-b82d-c3be8fb4b017","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The design of the iHealth HS3 Wireless Scale is ho-hum.
