The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">Side-by-Side Refrigerator</a> here.</em>","The LG LSC22991ST is a stylish and modern kitchen appliance that looks good in any home. This stainless steel side-by-side fridge gives you a number of appealing features, one of the better warranties for compressors and the benefit of door-in-door capability.","This relatively small refrigerator has a total capacity of 21.5 cubic feet, which is the smallest of any of the fridges we reviewed. The refrigerator compartment gives you 14.3 cubic feet of space, while the freezer presents 7.2 cubic feet, both of which are smaller than average.","This fridge is not Energy Star compliant, which means it uses more electricity than many other models on the market. Our checking showed it costs you an estimated $80 per year to run this refrigerator, which is higher than the best side-by-side refrigerators.","For items you store in the main refrigerator area, you get five shelves, three of which are full-sized shelves of spill-proof tempered glass, so cleaning any spills will be a breeze. Four of the shelves are adjustable to handle different sizes and heights of containers.","The refrigerator compartment also is equipped with two humidity-controlled crispers so you can keep fruits and vegetables cool and fresh. You also get a small dairy compartment that has a clear cover, so you can store butter secure in the knowledge that it will not absorb any other odors.","Perhaps best of all, you can enjoy the convenience of the door-in-door function that lets you open a section of the right-hand door for quick access to often-eaten foods, snack items, frequently consumed beverages and more. Besides convenience, this feature also protects the cool interior of the main part of the refrigerator since it can cut air loss by as much as 47 percent.","In all, the door areas of the refrigerator, including the door-in-door section, are equipped with a total seven bins. Two of these are gallon-sized, which are handy if your family drinks a lot of milk or juice.","The internal machinery for making ice is located in the left-hand door, which frees space in the frozen foods compartment. Outside, you have quick access to ice and filtered water for drinking or cooking.","The freezer compartment, although it is small, contains four shelves, two freezer drawers and three bins to organize the various frozen foods you stock.","In addition, this side-by-side refrigerator comes with a child lock, digital controls and a door alarm that lets you know if you have absent-mindedly left the door open, so you can quickly shut it again and avoid any food spoilage.","If you should run into trouble with your LG LSC22991ST, you are covered by a one-year warranty for parts, which is standard in the industry. However, this fridge does come with an impressive seven-year warranty on the sealed system and a warranty of 10 years on the linear compressor, which are exceptional values.","For customer support, you can ask questions of company representatives through email, phone and live chat support. The LG website also offers a &#34;help library,&#34; and you can watch video tutorials."]},"id":"d7605a99-0954-449e-9864-ffaec501117d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e097f9bc-c95b-47c3-8b9b-ec4614d24dc2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This handsome refrigerator offers a door-in-door capability, an in-the-door icemaker and good warranties on the sealed system and compressor.
