You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Garmin&#39;s Essential series consists of navigation GPS units that are pre-loaded with the basic functions Garmin finds necessary for a complete basic GPS navigation system. The Garmin Nuvi 54LM is no exception. While this unit is a basic model, it does come with a few advanced features that you&#39;ll find in car GPS units that are more expensive. Unfortunately, the Nuvi 54LM lacks a few basic features that would help it really stand out.","The Nuvi 54LM GPS system has a 5-inch touchscreen that is small enough to slip in and out of your purse or briefcase, but is large enough for you to clearly see the display. The screen resolution is 480 x 272 pixels, which is common in GPS units of this size; however, more advanced units have twice this resolution. In addition, the screen is only horizontal, with no option to change the orientation to vertical.","While this GPS unit does come with map updates for the life of the unit, it doesn&#39;t have traffic information. You can update your maps four times a year, for free, for the lifetime of your Nuvi 54LM, but you have to pay extra if you want to update more frequently than that. The Nuvi 54LM can&#39;t help you with traffic. This GPS unit doesn&#39;t have a receiver for traffic information and can&#39;t re-route you if traffic gets bad on your way home. The lithium-ion battery is rechargeable and will yield up to two hours of battery life, but you can keep the GPS unit plugged into the car to keep it running indefinitely. The unit also has expandable memory so you can store extra maps, optional automobile avatars and navigator voices.","The Nuvi 54LM comes preloaded with five million points of interest. These include landmarks, whether natural or manmade, restaurants and stores. You can also save a thousand waypoints, which are your favorite restaurants or the location of your favorite fishing spot. You are not able to save any routes, however, and the Nuvi 54LM can&#39;t predict your route based on your previous driving history.","Garmin vehicle GPS units come with a limited one-year warranty. This warranty guarantees that your unit will be free from defects in programming and manufacturing. These GPS units also come with a guarantee that the preloaded maps will be the most current. You can connect the Nuvi 54LM to your computer and check to see if it is up to date; if it is not, then you can load the latest map. Should you encounter any problems, you can contact Garmin support by phone or email."]},"id":"06247d5e-fb6f-46a0-b57c-cd752a45da2e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f377d694-49c3-447c-8642-ea85e201d225","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nuvi 54LM is a good addition to the Essential series and provides you with most of the basic features you will find on car GPS units.
