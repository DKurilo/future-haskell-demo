These small <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">wireless earbuds</a> offer a great bass sound, which is a great perk. Even though the design is very functional, the earbud pipes extend out from the speakers and twisting them to fit comfortably requires constant attention.","Phillips gives the SHB6000’s a great sound, and unlike some Bluetooth earbuds, these don&#39;t require you to turn the volume way up to get the best sound.","The SHB6000 earbuds can travel up to 33 feet from the audio source, but even with a direct line of sight, the quality of music or phone calls decreases dramatically with increasing distance.","The earbuds also have SwitchStream, which quiets music and emits a ringtone when you get a call. All the buttons are located on the back of the earbuds and are easy to use. They have the standard skip, volume and pause/play buttons. You can also use voice dial and redial if it’s supported by your mobile phone.","While it is easy to adjust the earbuds, high-impact activities will cause them to slip out of your ears. If you are a jogger, be aware that you may find yourself adjusting the earbuds often.","Charging them is one thing you won&#39;t have to do often, as they last seven to eight hours on one charge. They only take two hours to charge using the micro USB port located under a flap on the earbuds.","Philips provides three PDF files that give detailed instructions on using the SHB6000 Bluetooth earbuds. You can also chat live with a representative or give them a call. There is a standard one-year warranty plus lifetime coverage against sweat damage."]},"id":"fb1a0565-1f05-4a49-8ab8-9a6b8c35e7d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6730f623-cd28-4762-a608-cd5be3a47dae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for earbuds to wear around the house or during casual activities, the Philips SHB6000 earbuds are a great choice.
