Unfortunately, you normally have to spend over a grand to get the experience. The Vizio M Series offers excellent value if you’re looking for a LED TV with smart features without blowing your savings. You can find the Vizio M for under $1,000 from most retailers. It has 4K picture; an easy platform for downloading apps and streaming; and knowledgeable, friendly customer service.","Every model in the M-series features 4K ultra high definition. Spelled out, 4K results in a 2160p resolution that adds detail and clarity to whatever you’re watching. The contrast ratio creates deep black tones for movies and has a low input lag for video games.","The refresh rate on the Vizio M is 120Hz, which is on par with LED TVs that cost hundreds of dollars more. However, the refresh rate doesn’t always catch up with the clear picture. You may experience motion trails during transitions in videos, but nothing noticeable enough to be distracting. The trade-off suits gamers who are more concerned with a responsive TV than sports fans wanting a crystal-clear picture at all times.","This smart TV uses VIA Plus as its software platform. Similar to the OS on your phone, VIA Plus is a layout and operating system for your TV. Using this system, you can download apps and access streaming services like Netflix and Hulu directly from your TV. The Vizio M doesn’t have any special user interface elements like gesture or voice control, but its apps are functional and the remote is simple and easy to understand.","Most of the sports and weather apps available on VIA link to Yahoo’s various feeds. Streaming music from your TV is awesome for background noise at a party or during the day, and you can stream music from iHeartRadio, Spotify and Pandora directly from the LED TV. The Vizio M also has Plex, a service that casts your personal library of movies, TV shows, videos, music and pictures from your laptop or desktop’s library to the Vizio M TV.","The Vizio M has the greatest number of HDMI ports on our lineup. The number of inputs is a little lopsided, with five HDMI ports and one USB port, but you can connect several gaming consoles, laptops or other devices to this TV. The double-sided remote has a QWERTY keyboard on the back to make searching for content easy.","This LED TV comes in a wider variety of sizes than any other series we reviewed. If you want a huge home theater TV, you can find this model in sizes over 70 inches wide. The M also comes in 65-, 60-, 55-, 50-, 49- and 43-inch models. Whatever the size, it is hard to view the screen from off-angles without suffering color loss.","The support representatives we talked to at Vizio were friendly and knowledgeable. The Vizio M is under warranty for one year, which is standard for smart TVs. If you have questions about the TV, you can contact customer support through phone, live chat and email. You can also check Vizio’s FAQs section for quick answers."]},"id":"6c5401b8-d98b-47bf-b282-bf2b57914939","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"510c821f-1efa-4a3c-b63a-028569a72204","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want bang for your buck, the Vizio M gives you the best value for your money.
