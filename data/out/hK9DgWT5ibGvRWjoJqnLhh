The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\"><em>Meat Grinders here</em></a><em>.</em>","The Norpro Meat Grinder appeals largely to individuals very conscious about the types of things they cook in their home. In addition, if you enjoy exploring new recipes or knowing about the types of ingredients that go into the food you’re creating, owning a <a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\">meat grinder</a> will immediately become appealing. Further, this device expands its range of use beyond just the grinding of meat by  allowing you to grind, mince and create fresh pasta.","The Norpro Meat Grinder is a non-electric food grinder, and one of the few worthy of mentioning due to its three-in-one nature. The device comes with a standard fine and mincing plate for creating things like baby food, hamburger and sausage paste. The grinder is also capable of handling things like nuts, vegetables and stale bread, giving you even greater control over the types of recipes you try out.","The device also markets itself as a pasta and spice maker. To accomplish this, it comes with three pasta attachments for creating rigatoni, spaghetti or linguine. If you’ve got some pasta recipes that you’ve been just dying to try out, this device enables you to begin on that culinary career of self-exploration.","Due to the absence of a motor, the Norpro Meat Grinder utilizes a handle crank. You may view this as a downside due to the potential for inconsistent grinding results, but this type of meat grinder for home use is much easier to disassemble, clean and store. Each part easily comes off and the device as a whole can be put in the sink for quick cleaning. In comparison, a larger electric stainless steel meat grinder only offers a few parts that disassemble and the device, as a whole, is quite bulky.","The Norpro Meat Grinder sets itself apart from other devices due to its non-electrical nature. While you might view the best meat grinders as only those with electric motors, there is also something to be gained by hand-crank models like this one. It is not only easier to clean, but it also allows you to create pasta or simply grind up spices for experimental recipes."]},"id":"62080c73-0d22-4121-ae94-f46a8c2bae8b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59261","url":"/norpro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-31T14:01:29Z","datePublished":"2014-03-31T14:01:29Z","name":"Norpro Meat Grinder","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
