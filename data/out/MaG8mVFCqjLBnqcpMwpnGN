The wireless n standard used with the RangeMax WNDA 3100 resolves those shortfalls well and makes wireless networking far more attractive to most consumers.","Wi-Fi’s n standard makes two frequency bands available - 2.4GHz and 5GHz. This device can be set to operate using either band to achieve the best results for a given circumstance. The 2.4GHz range makes the adapter backward compatible for use with devices that use the Wi-Fi g or b standards. It’s great for surfing the web, checking email and other network uses that don’t require tremendous amounts of data transfer. This frequency band, however, is rather crowded with other products including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless devices, remote controlled toys and even microwave ovens.","Opting for the 5GHz band allows for optimum performance when connecting to routers that comply with the Wi-Fi n standard in the higher band. There are two distinct advantages. First, there are very few products that operate in this extremely high frequency range, so interference is far less common. Second, much greater bandwidth is available, making it a better option for applications that require loads of data throughput like streaming HD video content, playing graphics-intensive games or placing internet phone calls (VoIP).","The range covered by n standard Wi-Fi connections is much greater than before owing to technology called MIMO, or Multiple-Input/Multiple Output. It’s the same attribute that reduces dead spots that were common previously. Finally, network traffic can be prioritized by the user with WMM, Wi-Fi Multimedia. It is a critical feature in allowing the streaming of high definition audio/content without interruption from competing applications."]},"id":"74c4199d-3423-4894-880f-2b4da2893025","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Security"},"id":"47d2dcfb-3862-4c26-8565-dd46ce124fdf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Any network has some risk of attack by hackers who seek to compromise sensitive information or exploit the network internet connection for their own use. The WNDA 3100 employs several layers of encryption that greatly reduce the threat. The least effective but still important level is called WEP, for Wired Equivalent Privacy. It’s first generation wireless protection and shouldn’t be used by itself to safeguard critical data. The second generation WPA, Wireless Protected Access, is much more effective at protecting data and network access. State-of-the-art WPA2 is also used. It features Advanced Encryption Standard or AES, a technology that governments and industry use to guard against unauthorized access to sensitive information.","Making a secure connection is simplified using the Wi-Fi Protected Setup feature, WPS, that Netgear has renamed Push ‘N Connect. Hooking up is merely a matter of pushing the Push ‘N Connect button on the adapter then pushing the corresponding button on a WPS compliant router."]},"id":"3c29615d-e859-4d5e-8305-dee497ab4c94","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"eb90b84b-33d8-4b9d-902f-fae704ff00f6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Netgear RangeMax comes with an installation CD that includes the Easy Smart Wizard for setting up the device.
