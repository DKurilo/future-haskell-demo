You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","RichOrPoor is a good product if you want to manually enter all your financial information. This <a href=\"/best-personal-finance-software\">personal finance software</a> covers a broad spectrum of personal finance and includes almost every module to regulate your money, except taxes. The software allows you to track investments, accounts, bills, transactions and run reports.","The only problem with the different modules is they don&#39;t encompass all of the features that make money management effective such as calculators, financial planning, help with taxes and online current information.","RichOrPoor doesn&#39;t have a setup wizard to guide you through the setup process.  RichOrPoor doesn&#39;t import any of the standard formats that most banks use, such as QIF or CSV. You have to locate where the information goes and then type it in.  This becomes tiresome, considering some personal finance software packages connect directly to your bank accounts, and most import a standard set of file types.","Once you have entered all of your information, accounts, balances and transactions, the program is fairly easy to navigate.  It&#39;s getting there that&#39;s a chore.","RichOrPoor includes a page where you can enter your bank&#39;s name, create accounts and input your balances. However, there is no way to download data from the Internet. So this feature is more or less just a way to keep track of your accounts like balancing a check book.","RichOrPoor personal finance software has an extensive reporting section. The software includes reports with categories: spending habits, what I have, what I owe, investments, budgets, and basic reports and charts.","RichOrPoor does not have financial planning available in their software.","The only tax option available with RichOrPoor would be if you categorized some of your spending as a charitable contribution, then ran a report detailing all the charitable contributions made.","The publisher offers an online manual, email support and a FAQ section.","The only investing option that RichOrPoor includes is a portfolio manager. There is no way to download stock quotes, view the history of your stock or manage your 401K and mutual funds.","RichOrPoor has no tax options—you will not be able to export your data into tax software. If you are looking for a personal finance software that does include tax options, check out some of the other products in this category."]},"id":"7392934c-dbfc-4755-b316-b9143bce8125","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"46245328-03d6-47a9-b70c-3b0499f7dfc5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Once you get past the fact you have to enter all of your financial information manually, RichOrPoor is acceptable personal finance software.
