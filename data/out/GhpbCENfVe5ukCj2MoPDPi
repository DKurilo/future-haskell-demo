This product is a multimedia suite of sorts, with a video converter tacked on as one of its features, so you get a lot of functionality with just one purchase. We looked specifically at its video-converting tool for our purposes, though, and in that category; Roxio&#39;s entry is quite good, though not great.","This software supports a good number of file formats, including AVI, MPEG, DVD-Video and MOV. Supported output file formats include MPEG, WMV, MP4 and AAC. We would have liked to see even more options available for output file types.","Roxio Easy Video Copy and Convert can reformat video files for a long list of portable devices, including the popular iOS and Android devices. Roxio even threw in Xbox and PlayStation game systems for good measure.","With this software, you can batch-convert, split output file, set video dimensions, set start and stop time, adjust video bitrate and frame rate, preview, multi-trim edit and more. That&#39;s a decent selection, though we found products with more customization settings.","Problems you may encounter while using Roxio Easy Video Copy and Convert will come from the confusing nature of what the software asks you to do at times. If you need help to figure it out, you may find the Roxio customer support process a bit convoluted as well.","You can consult an informative knowledgebase to see if that has an answer to your question, but once you get to a point where you need to talk to a human being, you have to sign up for a Roxio account. We always prefer a live chat or telephone technical assistance option. You don&#39;t get that with Roxio."]},"id":"61b56ab8-1bb1-438d-9308-17c45e01f93f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"da933eaf-be01-4769-912a-68b184866f5b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" ","Roxio Easy Video Copy and Convert is solid video converter software that lacks some of the tools and file-format compatibility we found in other products, and it is more difficult to use than others we tried.
