With these useful devices, you can document a family scuba diving trip, fun with friends in the pool and kids playing in the rain and snow.","Panasonic’s Lumix DMC-TS4 is our top pick for waterproof cameras. It features a 12.1 megapixel resolution, a 28 mm lens and several useful shutter speed and ISO settings. It also has easy photo sharing tools as well as a GPS tracking and tagging feature. The Lumix DMC-TS4 has a rugged design and extra-tight water protection seals.","This waterproof digital camera has some useful and relevant features such as GPS geotagging, quick photo and video uploading and a wide range of shutter speeds.

The photographs it produces are high quality and vivid. This digital waterproof camera has a 28 mm lens, which is wider than the standard 35 mm lens that most compact digital cameras use.
