These tips tell you more about each aspect of online marketing.","<strong>Email Marketing</strong><br/>Studies show that email marketing is still the primary converter of sales. With email marketing, you can reach customers individually and segment your email list into groups so your leads get the specific message that&#39;s most likely to influence them to buy your product.","Several services we reviewed offer spam filters, which help your emails reach customers&#39; inboxes instead of their spam folders. In addition, the best online marketing services include personalization fields, where the program automatically includes things like the lead&#39;s name or other information, and automated emails, which let you set up automatic email campaigns.","Trigger emails are another feature found with the best online marketing services. These messages can be scheduled to be sent out after your customer acts on previous emails or meets other criteria to prompt a specific message. For example, if a lead clicked a link in your email for a particular product but didn&#39;t purchase it at the time, you can automatically send a follow-up email about that product to persuade your customer to buy it.","<strong>Social Media Marketing</strong><br/>These days, your business can&#39;t afford not to connect with customers via social media. Channels like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+ are great resources for engaging with leads and learning more about what customers want and expect from your company.","We sought out marketing platforms that allow you to reach out to customers and interact with them through social media. Each of the services on our lineup has a platform that lets you schedule posts ahead of time across several of your channels to foster interaction with your clients.","<strong>SEO Marketing</strong><br/>Despite the best online marketing efforts, your hard work could very well be wasted if your website is impossible to find. For this reason, we looked what each company offered in regards to SEO. Search engine optimization isn&#39;t something all of the companies on our lineup offer. In some cases, a different product from the same company might offer this service. For example, Salesforce only offers SEO services through Pardot, its B2B marketing solution.","SEO makes it easier for your customers to find your website when they enter keywords into search engines. The best internet marketing services provide you with insight into the terms consumers are using to find your business or service. You can then use these same keywords on your website so potential clients can more easily find you.","The online marketing service&#39;s platform should have the ability to perform an audit on your website so you know where you can improve your SEO to, in turn, boost your rankings in searches. Many services also offer pay-per-click services and link building, both of which can help you get more traffic to your site.","<strong>Web Design</strong><br/>Once customers find your website, you want them to stay there and purchase your products. Your website&#39;s design, or at least that of your landing page, can heavily impact customers&#39; buying decisions.","A poorly designed site could drive a potential lead to click out of your site quickly, increasing your bounce rate and lowering your sales. Online marketing services with web design capabilities can help solve this problem and increase click rates and purchases.","<strong>Analytics</strong><br/>Having the capability to market your business through email, social media, SEO and your website is a great start, but unless you can gather data and continuously improve your marketing campaigns, these tools aren&#39;t necessarily going to grow your business.","An important feature of internet marketing services is reporting and analytics. Each company on our lineup offers detailed reports through proprietary analytics or Google Analytics. These reports can include many things, from information on the interaction occurring on your social media pages to your website&#39;s traffic – even whether or not your emails are being opened and who clicks on what inside your emails. Some companies analyze competitors&#39; websites so you know where you stand in the market.","Analytics help you see what your company is doing well and where you need to improve your marketing efforts. Additionally, you can easily see which segment of your customers is ready to buy and what other behaviors they are exhibiting so you can target them more effectively.","Each of the companies on our lineup offer solid web marketing services.","Act-On and Oracle Marketing Cloud have the most comprehensive features: email and social-media marketing, SEO, web design and analytics. HubSpot and Salesfusion are designed to be easy to use, whereas other services may require the efforts of an entire marketing team.
