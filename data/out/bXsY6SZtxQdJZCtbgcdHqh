We looked for durability, ease of use, the types of pasta you can make with the machine, how easy it is to clean and its overall size.","In addition, we checked the material the machine is made of, the extras you can buy separately and the attractiveness of the appliance since some larger models might be left out on the kitchen counter.","We also looked for good value – how a pasta maker performed in relation to its price. Most people who love to cook are willing to spend a reasonable amount on good-quality kitchen tools, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re willing to overpay, even for a name brand.","We found that well-made, but modestly priced pasta makers can yield excellent pasta. The multi-faceted, electrically powered Philips Avance Collection Pasta Maker is 10 times more expensive than the HomeStart HST5018 Pasta Maker. The Philips does more things and works faster, but the HomeStart nonetheless is a sturdy machine that makes excellent pasta using a hand crank.","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","To learn as much as possible about pasta makers during our 80 hours of research, we scoured the internet for information and watched user videos. We also read food blogs and magazine articles and watched television cooking shows.","We looked at each manufacturer&#39;s website, read and evaluated their claims, and examined consumer reviews. Afterward, we scored each machine based on overall performance, durability, ease of operation, how much of a mess it makes during operation, and how easy it is to clean.","<strong>How Much Do Pasta Makers Cost?</strong>","Hand-crank pasta makers range in price from $30 to around $100, while motorized pasta makers can cost anywhere from $70 to $300, depending on the style.","Another style of &#34;pasta&#34; maker that has recently become popular is the veggie pasta spiralizer. These machines, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spiralizer-Ultimate-Vegetable-Slicer-Gluten-Free/dp/B075SLJ42S?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Spiralizer Ultimate 7-blade</a>, convert zucchini, summer squash, potatoes, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, carrots and more into &#34;noodles&#34; you can use much like traditional pasta in many dishes. This is a great option for gluten-free eating and dieting or just to change up your pasta routine.","Another way to make homemade pasta is to use an attachment for your KitchenAid stand mixer. Individually, these can cost anywhere from $60 to $125. However, you can often find a three-pack, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DBGQR1K/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">KitchenAid KSMPRA 3-Piece Pasta Roller &amp; Cutter Attachment Set</a>, on sale, which makes it a bit more affordable.","<br/><strong>What to Look For in a Pasta Maker </strong>","Hand-Crank or Electric<br/>Depending on your cooking style, an old-fashioned hand-crank pasta maker might appeal to you, since these often cost somewhat less and make fine pasta. However, if you have any mobility issues and don&#39;t want to turn a crank, or you simply want to spend more time creating the perfect sauce, the automatic electric models do all the mixing, kneading and extruding for you.","Attachments<br/>Most basic pasta makers let you make flattened sheets of dough that you can use for lasagna, or you can run them through slicers on the machine to create spaghetti and fettuccine noodles. If you want to make other shapes, it&#39;s smart to buy a brand that lets you purchase extra attachments so you can make the specialty pastas that you love.","If you are the owner of a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid%C2%AE-Quart-Artisan-Stand-KSM150PSGD/dp/B01MG5GH5R?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">KitchenAid stand mixer</a>, there are two sets of attachments that we recommend looking into if you are serious about making your own fresh pasta. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ENK4UV2/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">KSMPEXTA Gourmet Pasta Press Attachment</a> comes with six different pasta plates, allowing you to make spaghetti, bucatini, rigatoni, fusilli, large or small macaroni. If flat noodles are more your thing, then the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DBGQR1K/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">KitchenAid KSMPRA 3-Piece Pasta Roller &amp; Cutter Attachment Set</a> is the way to go. With this wide attachment, your KitchenAid mixer can create fettuccine, and spaghetti while the pasta roller can roll 6-inch wide sheets of pasta with eight different thickness settings. Lasagna, anyone? ","Durability<br/>Many pasta makers, even those that are modestly priced, are made of metal and will last a long time. Generally, people find stainless steel works well and lasts a long time. However, the partly plastic, partly metal electric pasta makers hold up quite well and are highly popular with consumers because of their fine performance and lasting power. In essence, it comes down to personal preference.<br/><br/>Price<br/>Pasta makers range in price from as low as $45 to as much as $259. Price depends a lot on whether the machine is automatic or hand-cranked as well as the materials it’s made of. However, you don’t need to spend a lot to get a good-quality machine.","<strong>More Specialty Appliance Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"05b1e40c-b078-4b34-b342-e7f1bce96d3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-bread-makers\">The Best Bread Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-cotton-candy-machines\">The Best Cotton Candy Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-donut-makers\">The Best Donut Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">The Best Egg Cookers</a>","<a href=\"/best-ice-cream-makers\">The Best Ice Cream Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-popcorn-makers\">The Best Popcorn Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-rice-cookers\">The Best Rice Cookers</a>","<a href=\"/best-sandwich-makers\">The Best Sandwich Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-sous-vide-machine-review\">The Best Sous Vide Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\">The Best Turkey Fryers</a>","<a href=\"/best-waffle-makers\">The Best Waffle Makers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d6313de8-e9c6-475d-9fe6-18e66cf87786","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_133","url":"/best-pasta-makers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T14:32:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T14:32:00Z","name":"Best Pasta Makers of 2019","synopsis":"Most pasta makers have thickness adjustments, rollers and slicer attachments to make standard spaghetti, fettuccine or lasagna noodles.","review":{},"strapline":"Most pasta makers have thickness adjustments, rollers and slicer attachments to make standard spaghetti, fettuccine or lasagna noodles.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-14T20:51:19Z","id":"bXsY6SZtxQdJZCtbgcdHqh","meta":{"title":"Best Pasta Makers of 2019 -
