We spent 40 hours testing, researching, analyzing data and talking to industry experts and shower enthusiasts to pinpoint the perfect handheld shower head.","David Malcom, founder of High Sierra Showerheads in California, told us, “Every shower is a little different, from the fixture height to the water pressure to the size of the stall…there are a lot of variables.” With this in mind, we put our shower head prospects through a variety of benchmark and performance tests to make sure that our recommendations will give you a wonderful shower, whether you’re looking for drenching rain, a high-pressure massage, the best design or something super eco-friendly.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We started our evaluation process by doing a little online shopping. After compiling a list of shower heads that we might buy for ourselves, we made a really big spreadsheet with a dozen qualifiers to track each shower head’s features and attributes, and that helped us narrow down the selection. We decided to focus on handheld showers with multiple spray settings.","Once we arrived at our top 10 picks, we acquired them for testing. In order to test these shower heads for our side-by-side comparison, we figured that we would need to be able to test them side by side. We built a contraption, affectionately named the Multi-Shower, out of PVC pipe. It has 10 shower arms and flow diverters that lets us install all 10 shower heads simultaneously. A series of volunteer testers showered, using each of the shower heads at least once, rating each on their performance (including water pressure, coverage, ease of use, setting variation and overall effectiveness), as well as noting the best and worst qualities of each. We also tested the showers for their advertised vs. actual flow rates at 48 psi and other metrics.","Our overall evaluations are heavily based on the products’ performance in testing, though we used our prior research to inform our scoring. We included important information such as color and finish options, product warranties and whether or not the shower head was available in a WaterSense-certified option (required for some states).","<strong>Choosing a Shower Head</strong>","For many people, an invigorating shower is the best way to start the day. Since shower heads see so much use, it is important to find one that not only provides a satisfactory shower but also looks nice, is easy to upkeep and maybe even helps you save some money on your water bill.","Price<br/>The shower heads we tested cost between $30 and $65. Within this price range, we found a variety of features, spray modes and finishes, but most of the products we tested are made of plastic, not metal. If you want more premium materials, expect to pay $100 or more. Nicer accessories such as a flexible metal hose or sliding bar mount cost extra as well.","Water Pressure<br/>We found that the combination of water pressure and water coverage was the most important part of a good shower, much more so than the actual amount of water used. In fact, some of our favorite shower heads ended up using a gallon less water per minute than their advertised maximums. The actual amount of water each hand shower used did not seem to affect testers’ opinions on the product’s performance.","The best shower did not necessarily come from the largest shower heads, though our top pick is on that end. Other large products we reviewed scored far lower because of lackluster pressure, even though they had a wide coverage area. These products also tended to be on the high end of water use (though still lower than the advertised maximum).","Low water pressure can be caused by a number of things, including old plumbing or clogged equipment. Sometimes a good cleaning or replacing old pipes can fix your problem, but even with relatively low water pressure, you can still get a good shower. Some of the products we tested, like the <a href=\"/yoo.mee-review\">YOO.MEE High Pressure Handheld</a>, were designed specifically to work under low-pressure conditions to give you a high-pressure shower.","Design<br/>Shower heads all tend to follow a similar form factor, but there definitely are choices and details that make some shower head designs stand out. Look for beautiful finishes that coordinate with your existing bathroom hardware. All the products we reviewed are available in a chrome finish, with some having one or two additional colors (one product we tested came to us in a bronze finish instead).","Apart from a product’s appearance, the design of the product can also affect its ease of use. You want to look for a shower head that is easy to maneuver, so an adjustable bracket and a long, flexible hose are great additions. Easy-to-clean or anti-clog nozzles can help prevent lime buildup and keep the water flowing. And because nothing ruins your groove like dropping your shower head and accidentally getting water everywhere, hand contouring or grip is important. Also consider the quality of the product’s construction and what it’s made of; it’ll probably get dropped at some point, and you want to make sure it’s durable enough to survive.","WaterSense<br/>WaterSense is an EPA certification that guarantees a shower head is designed to perform well with a maximum flow rate of 2.0 gallons per minute. This is a lower flow rate than the current maximum (2.5 gpm) allowed throughout most of the U.S., but the 2.0 gpm rate is required for some areas like California and Colorado, which have passed stricter statewide regulations.","For consistency, we tested product models with a max flow of 2.5 gpm, but all of our recommendations are available in both flow rates, and since the WaterSense certification process requires that products perform as well or better than non-certified, higher flow rate options, we’re confident you’ll get the same quality shower power we experienced throughout our tests with either option.","“But wait,” you might think, “Won’t low-flow fixtures actually waste water since I’ll have to take longer showers to get clean?” Not necessarily. Low-flow water fixtures got a pretty bad rap in the early days for not being effective or efficient, largely because companies often kept the same product designs and just used less water to comply with regulations. However, these shower heads are now specifically designed to make the best use out of lower flow rates so you still get a satisfactory shower. Jackie Kossoff, a California resident who recently replaced all the bathroom fixtures in her house with WaterSense-compliant ones told us, “I don’t feel a noticeable change. I think my shower head is perfect, and I actually prefer it over my old one. And if a shower is great and you can also say it’s helping the environment, that’s cool.”","<strong>Quirky Showerheads </strong>","We focused our testing on handheld showerheads that cost less than $70. But while conducting our research, we found a big selection of products with fun, innovative features. If you want to impress houseguests with a kitschy and technologically advanced shower accessory, check out some of our favorite unique showerheads:","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/K-9245-CP-Showerhead-Wireless-Speaker-Polished/dp/B00A46X48A/\">Kohler Moxie</a><br/>This showerhead isn’t handheld, and it has only one spray setting. However, it has a built-in Bluetooth speaker capable of good volume for singing in the shower. You sync your phone or tablet with the showerhead and play music, podcasts or audiobooks while you shower from up to 32 feet away. The speaker is removable, enabling you to charge the device and use it as a portable speaker in other rooms in the house. Because the speaker is water-resistant, it&#39;s a perfect companion for outdoor barbecues or pool lounging. The 7-hour battery life isn’t great, but it should be sufficient for multiple days of singing in the shower before the device needs to be recharged. It’s available in four finishes to complement other bathroom fixtures.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerSpa-24-Setting-Pressure-Boost-Technology-automatically/dp/B013X9IFPG/\">PowerSpa LED Shower Head Combo</a><br/>This combo showerhead has four settings: rain, rain massage, massage and a water-saving pause mode. Both 4-inch showerheads also have color-changing LEDs that are powered by running water, so you never have to charge a battery. The colors gradually change every few seconds, and the air-jet design injects oxygen into the water flow to prevent clogs. This fun upgrade for your shower is easy to install, costs less than $40 and comes with a one-year warranty, including live customer support in the United States."]},"id":"50ae8def-9e35-4280-b93a-535a3d19e672","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_203","url":"/best-handheld-showerheads","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-25T19:48:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-25T19:48:00Z","name":"Best Handheld Shower Heads of 2019","synopsis":"Handheld shower heads allow for freedom of motion and are a good solution for those with limited mobility or for washing pets.","review":{},"strapline":"Handheld shower heads allow for freedom of motion and are a good solution for those with limited mobility or for washing pets.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-04T23:29:36Z","id":"ekkSSjDF4fRq2waJJgPoeD","meta":{"title":"Best Handheld Shower Heads 2019 - Reviews of Shower Wands","description":"Handheld shower heads allow for freedom of motion and are a good solution for those with limited mobility or for washing pets."},"products":[{"slug":"speakman-rio-vs-1240","url":"/product/speakman-rio-vs-1240","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","name":"Speakman Rio VS 1240","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"eHZB4h5umh8CcU9N7kWsab","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"waterpik-powerspray-twin-turbo","url":"/product/waterpik-powerspray-twin-turbo","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","name":"Waterpik PowerSpray+ Twin Turbo","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"6fsT4u6Jaea2EQgeWuQ4fn","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"moen-engage-with-magnetix","url":"/product/moen-engage-with-magnetix","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","name":"Moen Engage with Magnetix","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"eGKonKHeYYRZiRjDnoFQX5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"yoo-mee-high-pressure","url":"/product/yoo-mee-high-pressure","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","name":"YOO.MEE High Pressure","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"c3hxoW7nbmR6C3s4Zrxhj5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"delta-in2ition-75445","url":"/product/delta-in2ition-75445","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","name":"Delta In2ition 75445","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"kyY3DKpvdUfRntKLBEx2rQ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/akPcHr8vxeUMTA2Hum7HAe.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Handheld-Showerheads-001.JPG","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/7/X/745485/original/Hero-Handheld-Showerheads-001.JPG","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"akPcHr8vxeUMTA2Hum7HAe","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akPcHr8vxeUMTA2Hum7HAe.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Handheld Shower Heads of 2019","description":"Handheld shower heads allow for freedom of motion and are a good solution for those with limited mobility or for washing pets."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/akPcHr8vxeUMTA2Hum7HAe.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Handheld-Showerheads-001.JPG","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/7/X/745485/original/Hero-Handheld-Showerheads-001.JPG","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"akPcHr8vxeUMTA2Hum7HAe","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akPcHr8vxeUMTA2Hum7HAe.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Handheld Shower Heads of 2019","description":"Handheld shower heads allow for freedom of motion and are a good solution for those with limited mobility or for washing pets."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"personal-care","url":"/health-and-beauty/personal-care","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","name":"Personal Care","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:52Z","id":"N6Vr7FEXykAcbcKQHGXUJ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
