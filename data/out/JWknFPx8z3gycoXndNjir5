The Samsung WF330ANW does feature diamonds, after all. Ok maybe not actual diamonds, but this <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-load washer</a> offers a drum covered with diamond-shaped depressions, designed to protect fabrics by keeping them from snagging during the cycle.","We’re not convinced it is worth going to the higher price point for this machine for everyone, partly because we’re not convinced most consumers will ever have a need to wash 31 bath towels at one time. This front-load washer is pretty massive. Even the door is massive, so you can load a giant comforter and watch it come clean before your very eyes.","For all of its mass, Samsung WF330ANW still manages to clean clothing with very little energy and water. According to its EnergyGuide, this unit will cost only $12 a year to run when used with an electric water heater and $7 with a natural gas heater. That’s less water and energy than both of the front-loading washers we ranked above it. "]},"id":"0a95a559-a895-4029-90a3-66b89f762d44","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Efficiency"},"id":"e59885c4-a4eb-4dfb-a678-9b54ef76f0e5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/7PXZ7QvZ7nznqUfU9wDx4B.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This front-load washer offers all of the creature comforts that most do, including an automatic dispenser that will add the ideal amount of detergent, bleach and softener at the right times so you do not have to.
