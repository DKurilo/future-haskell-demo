In fact, it’s small enough to fit in a purse. The pop-out blade display makes it easy to see weight readouts, and our testing showed it is accurate and consistent. For example, it performed perfectly when we weighed a single egg, a half-dozen eggs, a can of chili and a half-gallon of milk. However, we noted some discrepancies when weighing a block of cheese, although these were quite small.","However, its small stature also limits what it can weigh. The Blade has a maximum weight capacity of 2.2 pounds, or 1,000 grams – that’s lower than any other food scale we reviewed. Additionally, the platform’s total weighing area is a scant 5.4 square inches. For comparison, the larger scales we tested can handle items that weigh between 18 and 22 pounds, and one model has a 65-square-inch weighing platform.","On the other end, the Blade can show weights down to 0.01 grams, which is granular accuracy. However, to get an accurate reading, the item you’re weighing must fit on the scale’s platform – if it’s too big, the number you see won’t be accurate. As such, this kitchen scale isn’t meant for regular cooking. Instead, it’s a portion-control tool for an individual or couple.","This food scale runs on two AAA batteries. A single pair of batteries lasts for months, even if you use the Blade multiple times a day. It automatically shuts off after one minute of inactivity to help preserve battery life. The scale also automatically shuts off if you overload it, which prevents damage to its sensitive precision parts.","Although it is exceptionally small compared to other models, the Blade is durable. If you need something bigger and with the same level of accuracy and consistency, try the <a href=\"/ozeri-touch-ii-review\">Ozeri Touch II</a>.","The Blade comes with a two-year warranty. However, its performance is guaranteed for much longer: 10 years. That is unusual in the food scale industry but a welcome addition since the Blade is designed for frequent use and travel, so wear and tear may occur."]},"id":"3d6f61c4-f344-4277-b0cd-8bcf860ddeda","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57615","url":"/american-weigh-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-09-25T19:13:26Z","datePublished":"2013-09-25T19:13:26Z","name":"American Weigh Blade BL-1KG-BLK","synopsis":"The American Weigh Blade is the smallest, most portable food scale we evaluated.
