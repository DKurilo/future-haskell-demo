The best orthodontists recommend you use an <a href=\"/best-electric-toothbrushes\">electric toothbrush</a> and floss to remove plaque and buildup on your teeth. That may be easier said than done when you try to floss for the first time. The Waterpik Complete Care system includes a sonic toothbrush and a water flosser to get behind your brackets, crowns or bridges and help clean your teeth thoroughly.","The entire system is composed of the Waterpik water flosser, sonic toothbrush, water reservoir and controls. The Waterpik flosser and brush are recommended for people with braces, implants, crowns, bridges or veneers. If you&#39;ve had any significant dental work done recently, the Waterpik is a way to keep your teeth clean without disrupting any of the fixtures in your mouth.","The Waterpik Complete Care is the only electric toothbrush system we found that comes with a water flosser, which takes center stage to the Sensonic electric toothbrush. The toothbrush itself is simple with only a power button and battery level lights on the handle. It has one speed and a timer that runs for exactly two minutes with beeps between each 30-second interval. This reminds you to clean all four quadrants of your mouth. When you&#39;re on the go, it&#39;s good to know that the Sensonic holds a charge for about a week, has two brush heads and a travel case. While it would be good to see different speeds on the Sensonic, the water flosser steals the show in the Complete Care system.","The Waterpik water flosser is a unique system that uses pressurized water to power wash the crevices between your teeth. The water flosser is similar to the one your dentist uses during cleaning appointments. The Waterpik flosser comes with five different specialized tips that you can change out on the handle. Each tip has a special job for cleaning your teeth. The Orthodontic tip is designed for people with braces and general flossing. If you have issues with periodontal pockets or furcations, the Pik Pocket tip works best. You&#39;ll also find a Plaque Seeker tip, Classic Jet tip and Tongue Cleaner for fresh breath. Each of the water flosser heads rotates 360-degrees to clean your mouth at all angles. On the Waterpik&#39;s tank and stand, there is a dial with 10 pressure settings for the water flosser.","The Waterpik Complete Care system is under warranty for two years, which is good because it comes with so many individual parts. If you lose the user manual and need help operating the water flosser or brush, you can find a PDF of the manual online. The Waterpik site also has a frequently asked questions page, as well as email and phone contact information."]},"id":"3fbd9f24-145c-4066-a216-c7b37936558c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ad4fb924-431c-4ebf-81fa-67f769b7ffd5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Waterpik Complete Care system is composed of a water flosser, tank, electric toothbrush and accessories.
