Among other things, this company created the first paper coffee filter for commercial purposes and its coffee makers can be found in restaurants, hospital dining rooms and just about any place where people eat and want good coffee.","In addition to its commercial coffee machines, the Illinois-headquartered company also manufacturers different lines of home coffee machines, or as it refers to them, &#34;coffee brewers.&#34;","One popular line of home-brewing automatic coffee machines is the BUNN Phase Brew, which heats water and keeps it hot until it is just the right temperature to be sprayed onto coffee grounds, resulting in optimal flavor.","BUNN particularly notes that the Phase Brew line sprays, rather than drips, hot water during the brewing process. Once you push the on button, the device heats water in six minutes and the actual coffee brewing takes four minutes.","Of this line, the BUNN HG Phase Brew coffee maker employs a glass carafe and warming plate, and it uses paper filters. Its sister model, the BUNN HT Phase Brew uses a thermal carafe. Unfortunately, you do not get a brew strength setting, permanent coffee grounds filter or adjustable heater plate with this device.","The BUNN HG Phase Brew model offers the always helpful programmable clock feature that permits you to prepare coffee grounds and water the night before and wake up to that irresistible aroma of fresh coffee.","This automatic coffee machine includes an auto shut-off function after two hours of keeping nice and warm so you will never realize, with a start, that you might have left your coffee maker on when you rushed off to work or school in the morning.","The user manuals for these BUNN products recommend keeping the glass carafe for the HG Phase Brew on the hot plate just 30 minutes to get the very best coffee flavor. Although it can sit longer, the HT Phase Brew coffee makers can keep coffee warm for two hours without damaging the flavor.","This otherwise fairly simple and straightforward coffee maker also includes an indicator that lets you know when it is time to descale and clean the device, unlike a few of the best coffee makers on the market that lack this feature.","Instead of cleaning at set times after so many brewing cycles, which is typically the case, you will learn when to clean the BUNN HG Phase Brew coffee maker when it needs cleaning so you get top-notch performance."]},"id":"e6f7b658-b332-4c22-8642-b2b36b4cb08f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9bcce0fa-1289-4cef-a490-ee0511519a8a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BUNN HG Phase Brew coffee maker presents a fair number of helpful features that can make coffee brewing easy and produce coffee that tastes good.
