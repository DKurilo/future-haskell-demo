Its toothbrushes come with an array of features, and unlike its competitors, offers 12 brush heads with the initial purchase. The S500 is one of the better brushes in Pursonic’s lineup and is a great step up from the cheaper drug-store brushes that require replacement batteries. While it wasn’t one of the best performers in our tests, like the <a href=\"/philips-sonicare-flexcare-platinum-review\">Philips Sonicare FlexCare Platinum</a>, it does have several benefits.","The inclusion of 12 brush heads means you don’t have to purchase new ones any time soon. Other brushes may have smaller upfront costs, but buying four heads per year can add up quickly. The S500 comes with a three-year supply. Alternatively, the brush heads are color-coded to allow multiple people to use the brush base. The countertop case holds several heads, and you can designate a color for each person.","The S500 is a sonic toothbrush, which our testers generally preferred. The brush has a gum massage mode and a mode specifically for sensitive teeth. It also has an internal timer, something we found indispensable and one of the primary reason to buy an electric toothbrush.","The handle is thin, comfortable and lightweight, but this Pursonic brush was rated as having the least comfortable brushing experience. Most electric toothbrushes require a few days to get used to, but the S500 was described as “rough” and “abrasive,” and the vibration was a little too intense.","Many brushes have small chargers, but we found the S500’s to be a bit of an eyesore, and the case for extra heads doesn’t separate. The two-week battery life means you can store the charger when it’s not in use, which keeps the stand from taking up room on your countertop.","With the S500, you get a short warranty period of only one year. Pursonic’s website is less polished than the bigger brands, and we couldn’t locate an online manual or a section with answers to frequently asked questions. You can contact the company by phone or email to ask questions and get support."]},"id":"73cf4675-d08e-42dd-8ef9-dc2d444e7a5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f46adce7-8211-42ce-b3d4-7ebba0424c2e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pursonic S500 is a good option to consider if you want an electric toothbrush with an average up-front cost but don’t want to make additional brush head purchases down the road.
