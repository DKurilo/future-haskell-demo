The strap is canvas with Velcro straps. This makes it so you can fit it as tight or loose as you want, and it fits most wrists. In my tests, it was one of the more comfortable bracelets in both all-day wear and while exercising, though it does tend to absorb more sweat than other bracelets.

After asking a local EMT what information they looked for, I was told to follow the KISS rule: &#34;keep it simple stupid.&#34; For example, if your main health risk is passing out from low or high blood sugar because you&#39;re diabetic, you only need a bracelet that indicates what type of diabetes you have. Medics don&#39;t have time to pull up your entire medical history to realize you have diabetes. A simple medical ID bracelet lets them know how to treat you. In fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.laurenshope.com/who-should-wear-medical-id-bracelet\">Lauren&#39;s Hope</a>, you should wear a medical ID bracelet if you have the following:"]},"id":"6714a6a1-6157-4b24-8e25-0ad52c30da97","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Chronic medical and mental health conditions","Food or drug allergy","Important medications","Any information that would change the way a first responder treats you."],"type":"ul"},"id":"09d9c7ee-f3c5-499c-9d30-505a3918d851","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["However, if you have a lot of health issues or your medical history is complicated, a simple bracelet isn&#39;t the best route.

If you forget to wear an ID bracelet, or you simply want a backup of your medical information on a device that goes almost everywhere with you, a medical ID app is the best option. These free apps display your medical information on your phone’s lock screen.","<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207021\">Apple Health</a><br/>This app is available only for the iPhone and Apple Watch, but it’s free and has an entire tab dedicated to medical ID information. Once the app is open and you select the Medical ID tab, you add medical conditions, medical notes, allergies and reactions, current medications and blood type to the form. Then, you scroll to the bottom of the screen and make sure the Show When Locked button is toggled. Apple Health also has a place to enter emergency contact information, and when you use Emergency SOS to call emergency services, the app notifies your emergency contacts and sends your current location.","<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.medicalid.free&amp;hl=en_US\">Medical ID (Free)</a><br/>This is the best medical ID app for Android phones. It houses all of the same medical information as Apple Health and posts an alert banner on the lock screen for first responders or passersby. Unlike Apple Health, Medical ID has a second lock-screen layer with custom widgets that enable quick access to medical information and a customized alert-button trigger that sends alerts to emergency contacts."]},"id":"a4d11ac9-f6c4-4153-aa99-1e0fea50ab25","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"bdfcf229-a38b-48d7-8996-949d5f78639a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/key-2-life-sport-review\">Key2Life Sport</a>","<a href=\"/qrepublik-med-id-review\">QRepublik Medical &amp; Allergy Alert ID Bracelet | Web-Enabled Multilingual Emergency Contact Alert System</a>","<a href=\"/key-2-life-paracord-review\">Key2Life Paracord</a>","<a href=\"/road-id-sport-review\">ROAD iD Sport</a>","<a href=\"/healthid-review\">Health ID </a>","<a href=\"/elite-plus-usb-review\">Elite PLUS USB </a>","<a href=\"/lynx-usb-review\">Lynx USB Medical ID Bracelet</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2c1932dd-8c43-4f7c-8ad5-7f70e0ecb3c1","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_361","url":"/best-medical-alert-bracelets","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-29T08:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-29T08:00:00Z","name":"Best Medical ID Bracelets of 2019","synopsis":"The best medical ID bracelets are both stylish and comfortable while providing emergency responders with all the necessary information to treat you.
