It was designed specifically for candy making and helps you quickly and easily identify when your candy reaches the proper temperature. This kitchen thermometer also comes in handy for deep-frying, making it a versatile addition to most home kitchens. If you are looking for a thermometer with digital display, consider the <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">Maverick CT-03</a>.","If you are making hard candy, nougat, or even burnt sugar icing, this <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">candy thermometer</a> can help you quickly gauge the proper temperature levels for your recipe. This device features a Fahrenheit reading that ranges from 100 to 400 degrees on the left and a Celsius reading from 40 to 200 degrees on the right. The thermometer also includes markings for various candy stages and a general “deep fry” label at 375 degrees Fahrenheit/190 degrees Celsius. The large arrows next to each stage serve as a quick reference that lets you quickly see if your batch has reached the right temperature: thread, soft ball, hard ball, soft-crack or hard-crack.","The rectangular stainless steel body of this device houses a glass thermometer affixed to the body with bolts. The stainless steel backing keeps the glass thermometer from hitting or touching any metal, which is a nice safety feature and helpful for getting accurate readings. Extra metal at the tail end of the thermometer keeps the bottom of the temperature gauge from hitting the bottom of your pot. A plastic handle at the top of the unit makes it easy for you to safely pull the thermometer out of the pot without getting burnt. This also allows you to safely place the device back in and affix into the pot with a back clip. As with other glass-in-metal thermometer designs, cleaning the Wilton Candy Thermometer thoroughly may take a bit of extra diligence.","The Wilton Candy thermometer is a basic, manual thermometer for home use, but does cost a bit more than some models that offer the same functionality. As an analog thermometer, it also requires frequent calibration to ensure ongoing accuracy. However, if you want a big handle, metal construction and easy-to-read temperature guide that includes candy stages, this kitchen thermometer may be a good choice."]},"id":"a445e124-8367-4a99-9fa6-03dcfc962635","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63293","url":"/wilton-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:09:39Z","datePublished":"2015-03-06T23:09:39Z","name":"Wilton","synopsis":"The Wilton Candy Thermometer features a simple, classic design and an easy-to-read display.
