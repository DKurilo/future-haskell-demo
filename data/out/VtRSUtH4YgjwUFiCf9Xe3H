For this update, we looked at insurance providers with plans you can purchase at any time and that don’t solely provide plans through employers.","According to the Centers for Disease Control, only 4 percent of people without health care have optional vision insurance. Compare this with the fact that 14 million Americans over the age of 12 have some form of vision impairment. ","Even something as minor as an annual eye exam can be costly if you’re uninsured – as much as $250 or more, depending on if you plan on getting fitted for contacts. The cost of one year’s vision insurance premiums end up being less than one exam, making vision insurance one of the more cost-effective types of health insurance available. If you work part time or are a freelancer, vision insurance is still an affordable option and one you should consider, especially if you have a family history of eye disease or work at a job that is visually demanding.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","If you’re paying for an insurance plan, you want benefits that are worth taking advantage. An annual eye exam, which is recommended for most adults, is one of the main benefits, and most insurers offer a copay that covers most of the cost. Many insurers cover all but $10 to $15 of the exam cost, though some offer a discount instead. We prefer insurers who offer copays, since they save you the most money. ","Another common benefit is an allowance for frames or contact lenses. Typically, an insurer covers the cost up to a certain limit, usually around $100, though some premium plans cover up to $200. If your frames or contacts cost more than that amount, you pay the difference. However, some insurers apply a discount to the remaining cost.","Most insurers have a broad network of approved providers. In case your regular ophthalmologist isn’t part of the network, some insurers extend coverage to out-of-network providers, though these benefits are often weaker.","<strong>How Much Does Vision Insurance Cost?</strong>","Premiums are usually paid monthly, though some insurers have you pay the yearly cost upfront. For the most basic plans, we saw premiums as high as $15 a month and as low as $2.50 a month. Most, though not all, insurers offer a premium-tier option with stronger benefits and higher premiums. The average premium for a higher-tier plan is around $20. Adding a spouse or dependents to your plan makes for an average premium of $22.","<strong>Best of the Rest</strong>","<a href=\"/eyebenefits-review\">EyeBenefits:</a> This company is a low cost option with fewer benefits. You get minimal discounts on exams and lenses and but the membership fee is affordable. It can also be used at more than 12,000 providers.","<strong>Is Vision Insurance Worth It?</strong>","The American Optometric Organization recommends adults ages 18 to 64 get a vision exam every two years unless they have a risk of ocular disease or work in a job that is visually demanding. In those cases, annual eye exams are recommended. So, your relative health can determine if vision insurance is worth having, especially if you don’t have insurance through your workplace.","According to FAIR Health, a nonprofit that collects information about healthcare costs, an eye exam can cost between $128 and $200, depending on if you’re a new or established patient. Of the companies we reviewed, the average exam copay is $20 a month. These monthly premiums add up to a yearly cost of $60 to $180, so getting your annual exam pays for the insurance. ","If you wear glasses or contact lenses, vision insurance saves you even more. Typically, an insurer provides an allowance that covers the entire cost of frames, lenses or contacts. You pay anything beyond that cost, though many offer a discount on the remainder. You can also get <a href=\"/best-eyeglasses-online\">glasses online</a>, which are often more affordable than those at the doctor’s office.","Getting a vision policy, whether through your job or on an individual plan, usually pays for itself with just an exam and glasses or contact lenses. If your employer offers vision insurance as part of its benefits package, we recommend taking advantage of that, since the premiums are lower than what you’ll pay when buying an individual plan.<br/><strong><br/>When Is Open Enrollment for 2019 Vision Policies?</strong>","Unlike health insurance, you can enroll in most vision policies anytime during the year. Companies that exclusively offer vision or dental insurance allow you to enroll whenever you want. Some health policies include dental or vision coverage, and you must sign up for those during open enrollment. Open enrollment runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 unless you’re enrolling through your employer, in which case it specifies the open enrollment period.","If you don’t get vision insurance through your employer’s health insurance, it&#39;s a good idea to get it through one of the providers we reviewed rather than include it with your health policy during the open enrollment period. Companies that exclusively offer vision insurance have better benefits than general health insurance companies.","Not every plan is available outside of open enrollment. Some, like the individual plans offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield, are only available during open enrollment. You can also enroll in a plan if you experience a qualifying event such as the birth of a child, marriage or divorce. ","Enrolling in vision insurance is easy – you can sign up through the provider’s online portal. In addition, you can use the insurer’s website to find nearby doctors and clinics who accept your vision insurance. ","If you’re over the age of 20, it&#39;s recommended you get an eye exam at least every five years and more often if you wear glasses or contact lenses. With premiums around $15 a month for individual policies, vision insurance is one of the more affordable types of insurance."]},"id":"901f8b7b-c3a1-4df1-8625-a842050a2ee7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_252","url":"/best-vision-care","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-16T00:43:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-16T00:43:00Z","name":"Best Vision Care Providers of 2019","synopsis":"In addition to emergency benefits, those with vision insurance are more likely to get eye exams and follow through on eye care than those without.","review":{},"strapline":"In addition to emergency benefits, those with vision insurance are more likely to get eye exams and follow through on eye care than those without.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-15T21:06:30Z","id":"VtRSUtH4YgjwUFiCf9Xe3H","meta":{"title":"Best Vision Insurance Companies of 2019 -
