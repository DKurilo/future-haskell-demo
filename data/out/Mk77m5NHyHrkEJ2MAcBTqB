Unlike the traditional piano method that teaches chords and music notation, his piano method involves techniques that teach you to play piano by ear. This learn piano online program&#39;s narrow focus and lack of interactivity may be issues for some people, but if the play-by-ear method is what you want, Michael&#39;s proprietary curriculum may be right for you.","When you become a member of Piano Magic, you gain access to Piano Magic&#39;s entire catalog of materials. This includes reading material, video presentations and audio clips. The instructor also provides interactive contact and feedback with all of his students. The program is structured much like a workshop, and members are encouraged to familiarize themselves with all the resources available on the Piano Magic website. You can print much of the material available, including worksheets and piano music.","Since Piano Magic only teaches you how to play piano by ear, it lacks a comprehensive curriculum and does not include some of the teaching concepts we look for in piano lessons online. For starters, it doesn&#39;t address music notation or teach you how to sight-read. It does not teach the technique and fingering associated with the traditional piano method either.","Piano Magic also lacks a number of features we feel are important, though this is common for a piano program that consists of video tutorials that require you to simply follow along. The program is not MIDI compatible, so you don&#39;t receive feedback or progress tracking in real time. Additionally, since you have to practice on your own keyboard or acoustic piano, Piano Magic doesn&#39;t have any built-in practice tools such as song segmentation, a metronome, accompaniment and section looping of songs."]},"id":"4cf34b5e-1013-43f4-b365-86d48951f135","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c5832c4f-36d6-4b4f-a5d9-60cb98a8ccae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Piano Magic&#39;s singular focus on the play-by-ear method will obviously only appeal to a subset of aspiring pianists.
