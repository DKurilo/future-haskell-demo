It comes with all of the accessories you need to get you started and provides more cooking methods than similar products while still managing to cost less than most of its competitors. However, this machine is not easy to clean and maintain.","This multi-cooker didn’t perform as well as others in our rice test and our pot roast test. The rice cooked well enough, but the time it took to clean out the inside of the pot afterwards made using this pressure cooker a hassle. As for the pot roast test, the meat and vegetables were cooked through but were also a bit on the dry side. That being said, the Cosori was still able to give us decent food in a relatively quick amount of time, though you’ll need to adjust your recipes to get things just right.","This device comes with more preset and cooking buttons than other pressure cookers in our comparison. There is a specific pasta/boil button that we didn’t see on any other device we tested. You can brown/sauté, bake, pressure cook, slow cook, or steam using this device. There is a Hot Pot button, which helps this machine double as a fondue pot, another feature we haven’t seen anywhere else. If you need to stop your device, you can use the cancel button and the quick release valve to depressurize the machine.","The keep warm function automatically turns on when food it’s done cooking and runs for six hours, so you can keep food ready for a very long time when necessary. Remember that foods kept on the warmer setting for too long are prone to getting spoiled. This machine works quietly and does not create disconcerting hisses or other noises while on.","If you lose the instruction manual, you can find a digital version on the company’s website. There is also a small cooking times chart inside the manual that displays the cooking times and pressure levels for specific foods. This device comes with the most accessories of any machine we reviewed, so you probably won’t have to buy any other utensils. The package includes a spoon, ladle, measuring cup, glass lid, steamer rack and recipe book. Cosori only offers this pressure cooker in stainless steel and black, so you cannot choose any other colors that might match your kitchen better.","No other device in our comparison comes with a glass lid, and while some companies sell them separately, others don’t offer this accessory at all. This glass lid can be used when using the slow cook function or can simply be used to keep food warm and look decorative on the dinner table. The inner pot is made of stainless steel as is the steam rack, and the manufacturer states they are dishwasher safe. Unfortunately, in our testing the rice and pot roast stuck to the sides of the pot, so it took longer than normal to clean by hand. If you’d like a pot that is easier to clean, you might be interested in <a href=\"/breville-review\">Breville</a>.","Cosori covers this multi-cooker with an industry-average one-year warranty. The pressure cooker function will not work unless the lid is properly secured. Like most other multi-cookers on the market, this one seals during pressure cooking and cannot be opened until enough pressure has been released. Cosori also offers pressure cookers in 2-quart or 8-quart capacities so you can choose a size that fits your needs best."]},"id":"fc9c8ad8-711e-4bad-84a6-4297f71420e4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69798","url":"/cosori-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-03-19T18:47:55Z","datePublished":"2018-03-19T18:47:55Z","name":"Cosori Premium CP016-PC","synopsis":"This Cosori pressure cooker is a reasonable choice if you plan on cooking for four to six people.
