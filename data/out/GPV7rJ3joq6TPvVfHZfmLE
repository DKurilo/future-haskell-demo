Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP Color LaserJet CP2025n is a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> that is easy to use and offers high-quality printouts. There are no advanced features available on the CP2025n, which makes this laser printer much more user friendly. It is a larger device, which makes it fit more nicely in an office environment than a home. However, its features make it a better fit for in-home use where it is not used as extensively as it would be in an office.","This laser printer has a maximum printing resolution of 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch). This is not the best printing resolution available, especially when compared to many similar printers, but it still provides crisp and clear images, and you will rarely see a blurry image produced by the CP2025n. This printer has a monthly duty cycle of 40,000 pages. This means you can print up to 40,000 pages per month without causing the printer to overheat or causing any other technical issues.","In addition, this laser printer will print color and black-and-white images at a speed of 21 pages per minute. This is not a fast printing speed for a laser printer, but it is close to the average speed you will find on printing devices. Unfortunately, it lacks duplex printing features, which allow you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper automatically. To print on both sides with this printer, you must remove the paper manually from the printer and turn it over. The HP CP2025n does not do this task for you.","You can print on a variety of paper types and paper sizes with the HP Color LaserJet CP2025n. This printer is compatible with labels, envelopes and transparencies. It can print on paper sizes from small envelopes to legal-sized paper at 8.5 x 14 inches.","There is no wireless printing capability on this laser printer, which we were disappointed to see. It does offer an Ethernet port for networking possibilities and a USB 2.0 port for additional connectivity, however. The paper tray located on this device stores up to 250 sheets of paper. This is large enough to eliminate the trouble restocking the paper on a frequent basis. There is a one-year warranty included on the device, and 128MB of installed memory.","This laser printer has large dimensions and consumes a considerable amount of space on a desk or table. The CP2025n is 15.9 inches wide, 12.7 inches tall and 17.9 inches thick. It also weighs 50 pounds, making it a hefty device to move around frequently. There is a small display screen located on the right-hand size of the device, along with a few buttons. The small control pad is ideal because it simplifies the device and makes it more user friendly and easier for you to control the features and settings this device has to offer."]},"id":"82663739-02be-4cb1-bd3c-53f6fe15802b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5e9fb590-1818-4a06-93b9-1089030177df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Color LaserJet CP2025n is a laser printer that will fit nicely in any home environment.
