By connecting the bike GPS to your personal computer you can take advantage of Garmin Connect, on online site that stores all of your workout data so you can view a comprehensive analysis at any time. You can use the Garmin Edge for indoor workouts and outdoor workouts, and it will keep track of your activity, training, goals and progress.
