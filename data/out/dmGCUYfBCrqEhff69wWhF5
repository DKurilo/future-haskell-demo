You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Char-Broil Commercial four-burner <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared grill</a> may look like a traditional grill, but it uses advanced infrared technology to produce succulent steaks and juicy hamburgers. It takes a while to heat up compared to some other infrared grills, though, and it doesn&#39;t maintain the heat as well as the <a href=\"/broilmaster-review\">Broilmaster R3B</a>. ","We tested each infrared gas grill&#39;s ability to preheat quickly with every burner on the main grill turned to high. The Char-Broil Commercial blazed up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit in just under seven minutes, which is slower than several infrared grills we reviewed. Usually the trade-off for longer heat-up times is more even heating, but this infrared barbecue grill didn&#39;t maintain its heat at lower temperatures in our tests. We noted the fluctuation at three time intervals, and the temperature kept rising over the 21-minute test.","The sear plates that heat up the porcelain-coated cast-iron plates are effective, and every steak and burger we cooked had satisfying grill marks. Once our steaks reached an arguably perfect temperature of 128 F, they jumped to 134 F only seconds later (the time it took us to grab the tongs to remove the meat from the grill). After resting, our steak went from our intended medium rare to medium well. That&#39;s the thing with infrared grill cooking: There is a learning curve to get the meat just right. However, the best infrared grills do not have this high a risk of overcooking.","With four burners, this is a midsize infrared grill compared to the others we reviewed, yet it has more grilling space than the five- and six-burner infrared grills we tested. This means you can fit up to 32 average-sized hamburgers on the grill and 16 on the warming rack, which makes this one of the best infrared barbecue grills for feeding a crowd.","Overall, this grill is easy to use and put together, but it produces a lot of smoke because of its searing plates. The meat drippings fall down and vaporize on the sear plates, which is a great effect for flavoring your food, but it also means a cloud of smoke in your face when you lift the lid. Also, be sure you read the instructions carefully – our first go-around with this grill wasn&#39;t as successful as subsequent tests. We misread the user manual and placed the sear plates on top of the grill grates, thinking it was an option.","The burners are protected under warranty for ten years, so if there are any defects, you can get them replaced or repaired for free during that time. The warranties for the grates, cookbox and lid last for three years, while other parts are only covered for a year each."]},"id":"9f0274d4-b65a-49cd-b733-274ee87a79e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b4b394b5-9254-4c19-b116-84f62f979417","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Char-Broil Commercial four-burner infrared grill tested well against the best infrared grills we reviewed, in spite of a couple of drawbacks.
