The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</a> here.</em>","The Bosch 300 series nears the bottom of our lineup because of its limited amount of features, plain design. They also have a relatively high price point. However, these over-the-range microwaves cook with competitive power and will do the work of both a microwave and range hood, saving you valuable counter space by combining two kitchen appliances.","The Bosch HMV3021U over-range microwave does not have convection or sensor cooking options, but it still has all of the features of a basic microwave. Salty snack lovers will appreciate the popcorn button, programmed to pop your treat without burning it. The beverage cycle is great for hot cocoa and tea. And the baked potato option will have your spud fork-tender in a matter of minutes. Auto reheat and auto defrost cycles determine the power level and cooking time needed for commonly microwaved leftovers and frozen meats and veggies. But if your food needs more time, the add-30-seconds button will increase the time in manageable increments.","Although this model has limited features, it does offer programmable cooking cycles. If your food requires more than one power level while cooking, you won&#39;t have to watch the microwave to adjust the power level and cooking time at the right spot. Just program the cycles before you hit start, and the microwave will do the rest.","This over-the-range microwave oven offers a child lock – always a good idea, even if you don’t have kids around the house. Locking the controls can make it easy to clean without inadvertently programming the microwave. Another feature Bosch includes is a kitchen timer that works independently of the over-the-range microwave.","Although this built-in microwave has a less than average interior capacity of 1.6 cubic feet, it is no less expensive than similar models with a greater capacity. Bosch appliances do have a good reputation, but the pricing is a concern.","The fan on this unit will take care of stovetop cooking odors and smoke with two speed settings and an average venting capacity. Sensors in the hood will detect an increase in temperatures on your stovetop and turn on the fan, and the sensors shut it down automatically when they no longer detect too much heat. The microwave hood portion of the unit also includes two 30-watt lights to ensure you can see exactly how the stir-fry is doing.","Most consumers prefer a concealed hood vent, but there is nothing hidden about the vent on this over-the-range microwave. However, a visible hood is not necessarily a deal-breaker for everyone, and the design of this unit prevents the vent from being a dust trap.","The Bosch website has helpful information to answer your questions, but there is no live chat support option. The owner’s manual is also a wealth of information with details about exactly how to prepare common microwave items and suggestions to avoid common microwave cooking pitfalls – like crispy edges mixed in with cold spots. Bosch’s one-year warranty is lackluster for this over-the-range microwave, considering many competitors extend the warranty on the main component, the magnetron, for several years."]},"id":"d7b8b1fa-3c93-420b-a82e-eb5b233a8dfd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d8677b10-5597-4c5f-bf66-28b84711bcb7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch 300 ranks low based on the smaller capacity and limited warranty.
