We compared the theoretical top speeds of each of the routers, the number of ports, the ease of setup and the warranty and service options included with each router. We also read and compared reviews from former CNET editor Don Ngo, an expert in the field of wireless routers.","We researched up and coming technologies to compare future wireless standards like 802.11ad with what is currently on the market. Very few devices or networks support the high speeds of 802.11ad, so we focused our research on 802.11ac routers.","We have reviewed tech products, including wireless routers, for over a decade. We buy most of the products we review independently, and any products that are given to us for review are done so with no expectations. Our reviews are independent and original. I am an experienced writer and reviewer and have tested and written reviews for many digital products and services.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong><br/>We first compared the advertised absolute throughput for each router. Though all routers claim these speeds, we took into account that you will rarely see these actual speeds in real-life scenarios. Though we focused on 802.11ac routers, we also researched cheaper 802.11n routers for our best value pick. Most people looking to save money on a router just want something that works, and speed wasn’t the top consideration for that category.","Beyond the underlying wireless protocols, we compared size and how many ports each router had, as well as the ease of contacting the router manufacturers for help with firmware, warranty issues and troubleshooting.","Wireless routers use similar technology, but each router allows different customization options and has a different set of parental control features. We made sure to look at the parental options for <a href=\"/best-internet-filter-software\">blocking sites</a> and <a href=\"/best-parental-software\">restricting access to certain devices</a> during designated times of the day.","We combined all the information for each router in a spreadsheet and ranked each category according to its importance. We then picked the top routers from each category for our best picks.","<strong>Price<br/></strong>Wireless routers cost $80 to $120 for current-generation technology that isn’t quite cutting-edge. Top-of-the-line products cost about $200 or more, but most users don’t need such a sophisticated router. On the other end of the spectrum, last-generation routers are available for less than $30. We don’t recommend buying products that use the wireless n standard, as they are outdated and don’t give you the same speeds and network quality as wireless ac devices.<strong></strong>","<strong>Wireless Standards</strong><br/>You can easily tell the theoretical max speed of a router you’re purchasing by looking at the wireless standard it uses. The standards you’ll see when shopping for a router include the numbers 802.11 and then a number or a series of numbers separated by slashes. “N” routers have maximum speeds of 300 Mbps, but “AC” routers can achieve much higher speeds – as fast as 1 Gbps, and sometimes higher.","Newer routers may advertise 802.11ad standards, but these superfast routers aren’t compatible with many devices yet and therefore aren’t worth the extra cost.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>It’s vital to secure your wireless network because hackers can access all sorts of personal information if they break into your network. When shopping for a router, be sure it supports WPA2 encryption. This is the newest and most secure level of encryption. Other encryption levels like WPA or WEP may still work, but they’re out of date and aren’t nearly as secure as WPA2.","Stateful Packet Inspection, or SPI, is a <a href=\"/best-personal-firewall-software\">firewall</a> that detects potential hackers. The best routers we researched offer SPI, and it’s something you should look for in your router.","Also be sure to secure your wireless network with a strong password. Don’t use the preconfigured network name and password for more than setting up your router. Pick a password that is unique and change it regularly if people get access to it.","<strong>The Difference Between Modems &amp; Routers</strong>","If you’re replacing your ISP-provided networking equipment, you may need more than just a router. ISPs often supply subscribers with modem/router combination devices, and you need to replace both to set up your network. A modem modulates the internet signal from the provider, whether that comes from a cable, satellite, DSL or fiber optic service. It translates the signal from the original into an Ethernet-friendly version and back and acts as the gate between your home network and the ISP’s larger network.","Though you can plug your computer’s Ethernet connection directly into the modem, we don’t recommend it. That’s where the router comes into play. The router connects to your modem and creates your home network. It manages all the wired and wireless internet connections in your home and adds a layer of security between your home network and the internet at large.","When replacing both pieces of equipment, you can either buy a combination device or two separate devices. A combo takes up less space but is less convenient to replace. With separate devices, it is easier to upgrade your network by simply getting a new router or to replace a single component if only one of the devices stops working. If buying separate devices, check both the modem&#39;s and the router&#39;s wireless standards and advertised speeds. A home network is limited by the slowest piece of equipment, so we advise buying a modem and router that both support speeds at least as high as your internet subscription&#39;s top advertised speeds.","<strong>More Home Networking Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"5e255e50-b6ec-4269-8a60-82cca3ad11f5","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-cable-modems\">The Best Cable Modems</a>","<a href=\"/best-wi-fi-boosters\">The Best Wi-Fi Extenders</a>","<a href=\"/best-ethernet-switches\">The Best Ethernet Switches</a>","<a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">The Best Internet Service Providers</a>","<a href=\"/diy-home-automation-systems\">The Best DIY Home Automation Systems</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c3d02cdf-8a29-46c1-8b72-d6d0caa47515","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_23","url":"/best-wireless-routers","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T00:27:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T00:27:00Z","name":"Best Wireless Routers of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best wireless routers available, including recommendations for parents, Mac owners and non-tech savvy people.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best wireless routers available, including recommendations for parents, Mac owners and non-tech savvy people.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-11T18:01:21Z","id":"kshQitjMussZy5xzwgNGEf","meta":{"title":"Best Wireless Routers 2019 -
