The low tones are tight and deep with a nice punch, and they don’t saturate the mix. The headphones also have a very good midrange that is distinct and clear. On the other hand, the high frequencies don’t extend far enough, though they are still very balanced with the mids and bass. Also, you may find that the highs sound better as you break in the headphones. With a frequency response of around 7 to 26,000Hz, these headphones can reproduce a very nice sound stage, and you can even identify the location of every instrument as the sound echoes in your ears.","The HA-RX series stereo headphones are large and heavy compared to other models, but they fit nearly every ear. Often, closed-ear headsets are uncomfortable for people with larger ears or heads, but these are among the few headphones that fit almost everyone. Also, while 12.38 ounces may not sound that heavy, you might start to notice the weight after a few hours of constant use when wearing some HA-RX headphone models.","Some of these audio headphones are designed for studio work rather than playing music from portable devices. If you choose one of these higher-end models, you can still use them with your iPod, smartphone or tablet, but you need to use an amplifier to get the most from them if you do. If you use HA-RX series headphones with a battery-powered mobile device and no amplifier, expect the volume to be softer than normal.","The earcups are large and nicely padded, and they fit all the way around the ear for comfort. However, the material used in the padding does not breathe very well and can get hot in the summer months. Your ears might start to heat up or sweat during extended use.","The 11.5-foot cables end with a 1/8-inch gold-plated connector. A 1/4-inch gold-plated adapter is also included so you can connect the headphones to your stereo system or mixer. This added adapter is especially useful since the headphones are designed for studio work. The headphones in this series don’t come with a protective carrying case.","The JVC HA-RX series headphones are high quality and perform well. If you don’t mind the extra weight and need a good headset for studio editing and monitoring, or even just to relax at home, then these models are a good option."]},"id":"9359eb70-c03d-4df7-9da4-47baff9e2b14","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50443","url":"/jvc-ha-rx900-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-16T19:14:46Z","datePublished":"2010-08-16T19:14:46Z","name":"JVC HA-RX Series","synopsis":"The JVC HA-RX series stereo headphones have a closed-ear design, which means they completely cover your ears to minimize sound leakage.
