If there&#39;s a particular term that your organization uses a lot, you can simply add that word to Gammarly’s dictionary and it remembers it – and the dictionary function is far better than the Word one.

Grammar check programs are a good place to start when it comes to catching errors and fixing minor problems with the writing, like sentence structure, but they will only catch so much.","Fabian feels there is way too much badly written self-published content out there. Good or even great self-published work, like “The Martian” by Andy Weir, is well edited and had many sets of eyes look at it before publication. “You need outside eyes,” Fabian said. “Take the craft seriously if you want to publish. Otherwise, just write for fun on one of the fan-fic type sites or on a blog.”","Fabian said her books go through a crit group, which is a friendly peer critique group, and beta readers before going to a publisher, who then sends them to an editor and a copy editor. Having all these eyes looking at your work is very helpful, but Fabian has found that new errors are often introduced during this extensive editing process, so it’s important to re-read edits that come back to you. With social media and reliance on software that catches common errors for us, there is a tendency to get lazy and too casual. Fabian suggests the best way to catch your own errors is to slow down and really read what you have written.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong><br/>We all want our writing to be professional and free from errors, but software can quickly get expensive. That’s why I looked at products that provide the most value, and I favored those that give you more tools for less money.","Compatibility is important to consider when you select an online grammar checking extension. You want to make sure the grammar checker works well with the browser and word processor you prefer. Programs that offer more features and work on more websites are a better value. Some even work on mobile devices, so you can produce error-free writing online from your phone, and I gave those products higher scores.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>If you’re a writer working with a deadline, 24-hour support can be incredibly helpful. I looked for services that provide instant access to help. Grammar checkers that have live chat support or provide email and phone contact information fared better in our rankings.","<strong><em>Contributing Reviewer:</em></strong> <em>Noel Case</em>"," "]},"id":"50a4d614-599b-4ccc-8de2-01364fd02984","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9255d494-0d6f-4bdc-910a-7b55e95886ce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=113582&b=223514&m=26748&afftrack=OnlineGrammarCheck&urllink=www%2Egrammarly%2Ecom%2Fpremium\">Grammarly</a>","<a href=\"http://www.whitesmoke.com/lp_general/?d=4&a=819&r=7935&refID=T3\">WhiteSmoke</a>","<a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1001289&u=113582&m=71612&urllink=&afftrack=OnlineGrammar\">Ginger</a>","<a href=\"http://prowritingaid.com?afid=4566\">ProWritingAid</a>","<a href=\"http://pro.spellcheckplus.com/\">SpellCheckPlus Pro</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"610da3cc-f0ea-4b4c-a5b5-d64c0918d1a2","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_524","url":"/best-online-grammar-checker","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-05-18T17:12:15Z","datePublished":"2016-05-18T15:11:17Z","name":"Best Online Grammar Checker","synopsis":"Find the best online grammar application to improve your writing.","review":{},"strapline":"Find the best online grammar application to improve your writing.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","id":"Ro3aJdkMJD43bjpiYGekmW","meta":{"title":"Best Grammar Checker of 2019 -
