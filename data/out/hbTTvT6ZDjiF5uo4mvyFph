The Free Studio actually includes 25 programs unlike many of the other converting programs we have looked at which are one integrated program. Regularly we do not review free video converter software but we wanted to check this bundle out to see how it compared to other paid products we have looked at in our video converting  and audio editing reviews.","The applications we found the easiest to use and most functional in the Free Studio were the video downloading tools and the video converter software. The YouTube downloaders worked really well and were fairly fast. We also looked at the 3D Photo Maker offered by DVDVideoSoft as a separate program, which can create 3D images from two similar images.","Even though this video converter software is free, it is kept up-to-date. DVDVideoSoft can run with Windows 7 and can work with HD video file types as well at HQ MP4s. Free Studio comes in 10 languages and can support file types for a variety of devices including iPhones, Blackberrys, iPods, PSPs and PCs.","For the purpose of this review of DVDVideoSoft we used sample music videos downloaded from YouTube to check video and audio converter quality. We also tested the burn quality and the video to iPhone converter. Additionally, we tested the 3D Photo Maker just for fun.","<strong>Video Converters and Video Editors:</strong>","This group of free video converter software from DVDVideoSoft includes YouTube downloaders, uploaders, editors and converters as well as a variety of video converters. The converters can convert video files to DVD, Flash, 3GP, iPod, PSP, iPhone and MP3. We had no trouble using the downloaders and all the video converters worked for us except the iPhone one. We downloaded an MP4 from YouTube and used the free video-to-iPhone converter and then sent the resulting video to an iPhone via email and the file type could not be recognized. The YouTube uploaders worked very well for us though, basically you just copy a YouTube URL and paste it into the program to begin downloading and it downloads rather quickly.","The free DVDVideo Soft video editing tools include video dub, screen video recorder and a flip and rotate tool. The rotate was extremely simple to use and worked.  The dub was fairly easy to use, basically it will let you view video and cut out a desired section. The screen video recorder was a bit more difficult. We could easily figure out how to capture a screenshot image but had to consult the help files to learn how to capture streaming video.  This screen recorder saves video in AVI format and images as BMP, JPEG, GIF, TGA and PNG image file formats."]},"id":"6a7b4242-67b0-4925-9d90-402fc2450212","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/N2aRNZqTkAmWkXVcpxgs2P.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4939/dvdvideosoft-fr-6.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2aRNZqTkAmWkXVcpxgs2P.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"N2aRNZqTkAmWkXVcpxgs2P","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2aRNZqTkAmWkXVcpxgs2P.jpg","alt":"This screenshot image shows DVDVideoSoft Free Studio video dub module.

We didn t have any issues with these programs; they all performed fast and executed easy conversions. It includes an audio-to-flash, an audio CD-to-MP3 and a basic converter.","The basic audio converter can work with MP3, WAV, M4A, WMA, OGG, FLAC and APE audio file type formats. It can do batch and single conversions and it will create new presets or edit the old ones. This particular free audio editor converter comes in 14 languages and works with Windows 7.","<strong>3D Photo Maker:</strong>","This is a standalone program separate from the DVDVideoSoft video converter software that can turn two images into a 3D image. This tool is really easy to use. The only hard part is getting the right images to convert. To create a 3D image you have to have two quality images that differ slightly with a horizontal shift. Once you have good images to use, though, you can have a 3D image created rather quickly. We did run into one minor issue with this program, however. When we clicked the Make 3D button the created image would only show for a few seconds. To view the image longer you have to open it from the newly created saved file and of course you have to have 3D glasses to see the 3D image."]},"id":"7107b920-6be8-490e-863f-81b2895784f6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/gDTEeGcdUFTJdH5TsrthNL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4939/dvdvideosoft-fr-3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDTEeGcdUFTJdH5TsrthNL.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"gDTEeGcdUFTJdH5TsrthNL","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDTEeGcdUFTJdH5TsrthNL.jpg","alt":"This screenshot image shows the DVDVideoSoft  3D Photo Maker."},"id":"435baf3b-46c4-4640-8014-bf6e889ae80f","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Ease of Use:</strong>","All of these free video converter software applications were rather simplistic, therefore rather easy to use. The only thing that took us a bit to figure out was how to make sure the files were saved where we wanted them since by default they all go into separate folders depending on which DVDVideoSoft program you are using.","We also had some issues with burning a disc. When we used the  Free DVD Video Burner  and the  Free Video to DVD Converter  tool and tried to burn a video file onto a disk it would say there was no burner software available. The program would then ask us if we wanted to find the right software so we chose that option and downloaded the recommended software. However, we could never get that software to burn video to a disk. So in order to burn to a disk you may need to use another program like Nero or Roxio.","Since this is free video converter software from DVDVideoSoft it does come with a few catches. First off we did not have any download issues or malicious content downloaded with this software, which is good, so no worries there. However, it does want you to install certain toolbars and search options but you can opt out of those offers, but you have to be careful, if you click  next  without reading the offer you may end up with some installations you don t want.","Additionally, even though Free Studio is one video converter software download the different elements of the bundle are still separate and on the DVDVideoSoft website you can download them all collectively or individually if you want. The Free Studio package has the addition of a screen that is similar to a portal screen which basically acts as a way for you to access all individual sections. What this means is that sometimes moving video from one section to the next may take a few extra steps since not all applications are integrated."]},"id":"e26fb934-c02a-4dbb-80a2-e381e1dc3af3","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/KWWUhxaj3vfeDhKoGVZCaC.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4939/dvdvideosoft-fr-7.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KWWUhxaj3vfeDhKoGVZCaC.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"KWWUhxaj3vfeDhKoGVZCaC","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KWWUhxaj3vfeDhKoGVZCaC.jpg","alt":"This screenshot image shows the video flipping tool included in DVDVideoSoft Free Studio."},"id":"dc60ebcb-c8a5-4d05-91dd-c85275446a50","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Help &amp; Support:</strong>","Even though the DVDVideoSoft Free Studio video converter software and the 3D Photo Maker are free products they do come with some support. Online DVDVideoSoft posts some FAQs and step-by-step instructions, and you can submit by form a request for support. We submitted a support request regarding the iPhone video converter and received an email confirmation of our request immediately, but then had to wait a bit for the actual response.","<strong><strong>Summary:</strong></strong>","Sometimes free video converter software can come with some issues or spyware or adware, however we had few problems with DVDVideoSoft Free Studio especially in regards to their free video downloaders and video converters. We only had a few issues with disc creation and the iPhone converter, but those are only two elements of a suite of 25 applications.","If you need easy-to-use video converter software or YouTube uploaders and downloaders,  DVDVideoSoftware can provide some good tools either in the Free Studio bundle or as separate downloads. All the applications are easy to use and they post step-by-step instructions online that we found quite helpful.","<strong>More DVDVideo Free Studio Screenshot Images:</strong>","This screenshot image shows the YouTube tools available in the DVDVideoSoft Free Studio."]},"id":"00506ac4-dac4-4de5-8eb7-e8c213d0e3f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/XZ4roJjZZe78Hxt6YVy7Yo.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4939/dvdvideosoft-fr-8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XZ4roJjZZe78Hxt6YVy7Yo.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"XZ4roJjZZe78Hxt6YVy7Yo","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XZ4roJjZZe78Hxt6YVy7Yo.jpg","alt":"This screenshot image shows the YouTube tools available in the DVDVideoSoft Free Studio."},"id":"58333dd4-8182-4838-9974-1acc0d308de8","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This screenshot image shows the MP3 and audio converter included in the DVDVideoSoft Free Studio."]},"id":"466227b4-9263-40dc-b45a-defa4a17529a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/uNNPLTFhoY4kQFCQV2obra.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4939/dvdvideosoft-fr-10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNNPLTFhoY4kQFCQV2obra.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"uNNPLTFhoY4kQFCQV2obra","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNNPLTFhoY4kQFCQV2obra.jpg","alt":"This screenshot image shows the MP3 and audio converter included in the DVDVideoSoft Free Studio."},"id":"f115adec-66a8-47d8-b83c-54139861c077","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This image shows the DVD and CD disc burning tools included in the DVDVideoSoft Free Studio."]},"id":"e89b1bbe-72e8-4f8f-a703-1a715f19e1ee","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/koym75V3Fx86btRaexUGeQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4939/dvdvideosoft-fr-11.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koym75V3Fx86btRaexUGeQ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"koym75V3Fx86btRaexUGeQ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koym75V3Fx86btRaexUGeQ.jpg","alt":"This image shows the DVD and CD disc burning tools included in the DVDVideoSoft Free Studio."},"id":"46142df1-c2e1-4a78-8779-e93e30c5b606","type":"image"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4939","url":"/dvdvideosoft-free-studio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"pamela-s-stevens","url":"/author/pamela-s-stevens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Pamela S Stevens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"e9bBMEAQ9LLhA3c2cSq39Z","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-22T20:35:08Z","datePublished":"2010-09-22T20:35:08Z","name":"DVDVideoSoft Free Studio Review","synopsis":"Pros: Free Studio contains 25 free video converting, editing and burning applications.
