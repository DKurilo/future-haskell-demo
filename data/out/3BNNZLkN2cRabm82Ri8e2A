This option eliminates the need to pre-soak, wash or scrub your dishes before running them through a load – saving you time and hassle.","The KitchenAid Superba KUDS30FXSS dishwasher includes four basic wash cycles: normal, one-hour wash, heavy duty and light/china. These are the basic cycles that you would see on just about any dishwasher. It also has an additional six options that you can run with the wash cycles:  ProScrub, Hi-Temp Scrub, sani rinse, heat dry and four hour delay. Additionally, this dishwasher has the standard two racks, which can fit up to 15-place settings, and it features four spray arms.","Aside from the four basic cycles,  this KitchenAid dishwasher features an optimum wash sensor, one of our favorite features on this unit. During the cycle, this feature senses when the dishes are clean and ends the cycle, even if there is additional time left. This means you won&#39;t use unnecessary energy or water cleaning  your dishes.","As with many other dishwashers, this KitchenAid dishwasher comes with a standard warranty. The parts and any labor are covered for the first year while the racks and electronics are covered for the second through fifth year. Additionally, the dishwasher&#39;s tub and door liner is warranted for the lifetime of the unit.","Although this specific KitchenAid Superba dishwasher has a bar handle and hidden controls on top of the door, there are additional dishwashers in the KitchenAid Superba series that have front controls and a recessed handle design. This dishwasher is also available in three colors – black, white and a panel ready option.","KitchenAid has excellent support options for its customers. The website&#39;s support page has a flood of helpful information. In addition to being able to contact KitchenAid by phone and email, you can talk with a support representative via its live chat feature. KitchenAid provides frequently asked questions, information about product registration, warranty and service plans and replacements parts and accessories. You can also schedule a service appointment right from the website."]},"id":"8481a19d-aa32-4950-8f36-a69f1777be16","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"33ad159a-d50a-42e5-9ab5-856d61f1d598","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KitchenAid Superba KUDS30FXSS is a pretty basic dishwasher, but does include some extra benefits such as the ProScrub option.
