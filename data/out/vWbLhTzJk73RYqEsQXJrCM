It is slimmer than any recorder in our lineup and is just flat-out pretty. And while it isn&#39;t exactly the best digital recorder on the market, it&#39;s not all looks either. The design is also practical with a built-in pocket clip that makes this the most portable and discreet recorder out there. Simply slide it in your pocket and take it with you to your next lecture or interview. You almost forget it&#39;s there. <br/>Beyond design, it has a number of features to recommend it. It records up to 16 hours in LPCM (CD-quality) sound or up to 178 hours in MP3-quality sound. This is on the lower end of total hours when compared to other products in our digital recorder reviews, but for most people&#39;s needs, this is more than enough time.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"3dbe46c8-47c9-4188-b2fc-ade2cbe958d3","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One problematic thing about having controls like fast forward, rewind and track marking buttons on the side is they can be tricky to access and it will take some getting used to, especially when you&#39;re used to having them in front.
