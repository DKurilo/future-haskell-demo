You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Finding a pair of glasses that fits your budget as well as your style can be challenging, especially if you are buying them online. Fortunately, GlassesShop.com offers over nine years of experience providing <a href=\"/best-eyeglasses-online\">eyeglasses online</a>, as well as a great selection of budget frames.","GlassesShop.com has a great selection of budget frames for men, women and children, as well as a growing inventory of frames from designers like Calvin Klein, DVF, Trés Jolie and Ray Ban. Finding the right pair of eyeglasses or sunglasses is as easy as selecting options in the search sidebar. You can choose from full-rim, half-rim or rimless frames in various materials like plastic, metal or Flexlite. Multiple shapes, colors and styles are available, and you can search by price or lens type.","We are very impressed with GlassesShop.com&#39;s Virtual Try-It application. Using this widget you can upload a picture of yourself or use a stock image to try on frames to see what they would look like on your face. While many online optic vendors offer a virtual try-on widget, the ability to rotate and resize and change the pupillary distance makes Virtual Try-It stand out. After trying on frames, you can save the picture or upload it directly to Facebook to share your new look with your friends or family and get their opinion of your frame choice.","GlassesShop.com offers a good selection of lenses ranging from single vision, bifocals and progressives. Unfortunately, trifocals are not available, but check with your optometrist to see if progressive lenses might be a good choice instead. You&#39;ll also find high-index, polycarbonate and polarized lenses, and you can choose to add lens options like UV and anti-reflective coatings, color tints or photochromatic tinting. This tinting automatically lightens and darkens depending on how bright your surroundings are. Transitions are a popular brand of photochromatic lenses.","Standard single vision lenses with anti-scratch coating are included with each pair of glasses from GlassesShop.com. A hard eyeglass case and microfiber cleaning cloth are also included. Reading glasses are available if you don&#39;t need full prescription glasses. Be sure to check GlassesShop.com&#39;s social media pages to find coupon codes to get additional offers and discounts before you finalize your order.","Free shipping is available on orders of  $59 or more using the free shipping code, but unfortunately you cannot take advantage of any other discount code as GlassesShop.com only allows you to use one coupon code per transaction. GlassesShop.com takes a few days to make your glasses before shipping them out. Orders are sent via the postal service for orders in the United States and through DHL for the rest of the world. If you want your glasses more quickly, you can opt to pay for UPS expedited shipping.","You can contact GlassesShop.com by email or phone, or  you can chat with a service representative online. Standing behind their products, GlassesShop.com offers a 90-day guaranteed warranty, giving you a one-time replacement for glasses that are made incorrectly or arrive damaged. Unfortunately, the company does not pay for return shipping, and we recommend that you use a shipping method that includes delivery confirmation when returning any glasses. The GlassesShop.com website has a FAQs section, and you can sign up for an email newsletter that will keep you up to date with new models and specials."]},"id":"927989d3-a430-41b8-a60f-ab270f4fc123","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"549e0e29-ea53-4585-8e0e-2c3341cbde53","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["GlassesShop.com&#39;s selection and affordability make them a good place to find a great pair of glasses.
