We like to get hands on with the products and services we test, and with software, this means we subscribe, download, research and use each of the programs that we review. This level of testing lets us make comparisons to make sure that we’re recommending the very best products available to our readers. As a reviewer, I test dozens of other educational and professional software packages, so I’m familiar with what’s possible in programming these days. ","<strong>How much Does Resume Writing Software Cost? </strong>","Resume writing programs that you download for a one-time cost usually run about $30.00. However web-based subscription services range anywhere from $1 to $2 dollars up to about $20 a month. Pay attention when you subscribe, though, because most services offer several different plans – and some plans limit the features or number of resumes you can create. Make sure to find a selection that works for your job search. Also, several of the programs we tested come with a free trial, but frequently the company won’t remove their watermark from free templates. It’s best to pay a little extra and remove the companies’ branding. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We read dozens of articles and researched the current industry standard in resume writing software before we selected which programs to test. Then we downloaded or subscribed to the ones we selected. Most of the current software is web-based, but there are few downloadable programs that have enough features and support to be worth mentioning.","In each program we created a resume and then tested the available features. We evaluated how intuitive the input options and wizard (the tool that you use to input your data) were in each program. We also looked for programs that offer additional support beyond simple resume creation. Resume software that connect with popular job search engines or give tips about acing your interview ranked higher in our comparison.","We looked for import and export options that allow you to easily transfer your completed work to new systems and give you flexibility to use the information from older resumes to create new ones. We also graded the software on customization tools, like margin spacing and font choices, as well as text size and watermarks to make sure you can create a resume that’ll stand out.  We learned there’s often a balance between having plenty of options and having so many that they become overwhelming, so we looked for a number of templates and features that was just right.","<strong>Are Resume Builders Worth It?</strong>","In a word, yes. Based on our experience with the sites and services we tested, it&#39;s helpful to have the task of creating a resume broken up into more manageable chunks. Many of the programs that we used have wizards that provide helpful tips or guidance on each section. It&#39;s also convenient to be able to save personal information, like your address and home phone number, to be used over and over again as you customize resumes for different job applications. Overall, because resume writing is such a common experience, we think its hard to go wrong with these programs. They are also inexpensive enough that its worth a try.","<strong>Resumes of the Future</strong>","As you build your resume, it’s worth considering how hiring practices will change over time. We wouldn’t be surprised to see personal web pages or portfolios replace more traditional resume templates over the next few years, and many of the web-based programs seem to offer more connectivity options and link-sharing capabilities than their downloadable counterparts. There may come a day when we use certification services like Lynda and Degreed to show off the skills we’ve gained.","The New York Times reported in its article, “Job Hunting in the Digital Age,” that some companies use bots to conduct keyword searches of your documents to find the best match from a large pool of applicants. This means it matters which words you use to express your interests and experience. It&#39;s important to check in with the trends and services available to make sure you’re on the right track before creating your next resume.","<strong>Resume &amp; Job-Hunting Trends to Look for in 2019</strong>","A recent <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/how-to-create-a-perfect-resume-in-2019.html\">survey</a> shows that nearly 25 percent of Americans plan to look for a new job in 2019. If you’re among them or just want to keep a resume on hand in case a job posting catches your eye, here are some things to keep in mind:","Keep It Short, but Not Too Short: A recent study by <a href=\"https://www.resumego.net/research/one-or-two-page-resumes/\">ResumeGo</a> shows that recruiters are twice as likely to prefer a two-page resume than a single-page resume. The common wisdom used to be that anything beyond a single page is a strike against you, but if you have the work experience and qualifications, don’t skimp on including them. Be as thorough as possible.","Start Strong: The top third of your resume is the most important real estate. Use it to make an impression and to give the hiring manager the most important information. Include contact information, your LinkedIn account info, your most recent job and a summary statement. The summary isn’t an objective – instead, it should be a statement that catches the recruiter’s eyes. In the summary, talk about your successes and what you can add to the company you’re applying at.","Optimize Your Resume: Many companies use <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/explore/careers/outsmart-the-resume-bots/\">applicant tracking systems</a> to monitor and update you on your application’s progress. Some of these systems can be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jobscan-resume-keywords-2017-3#first-i-tracked-down-this-job-description-of-a-careers-reporter-at-business-insider-1\">overzealous</a> about filtering resumes, so you may need to include some keywords used in the job posting. In some cases, you can benefit from using the particular jargon preferred by the company you’re applying at.","Customize &amp; Cut: Make sure each resume is tailored to the specific job you’re applying for. One-size-fits-all resumes don’t really work any more. Trim your resume to the last 10 to 15 years of your job history – anything further back could date you or may be irrelevant. If you’re applying for a job as a software developer, the company hiring you isn’t interested in your high school dishwashing job."]},"id":"6abf9679-f7f6-48e8-ac26-083feb6d663a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"45a85e65-43c8-431b-ab48-ca333c5cdf0b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/live-career-review\">LiveCareer My Perfect Resume</a>","<a href=\"/resume-companion-review\">Resume Companion</a>","<a href=\"/pongo-review\">Pongo Resume Builder</a>","<a href=\"/resume-maker-professional-review\">ResumeMaker Professional Deluxe 20</a>","<a href=\"/visualcv-review\">VisualCV Professional</a>","<a href=\"/winway-resume-deluxe-review\">WinWay Resume Deluxe 14</a>","<a href=\"/cakeresume-review\">CakeResume</a>","<a href=\"/zety-review\">Zety</a>","<a href=\"/novoresume-review\">Novoresume</a>","<a href=\"/enhancv-review\">Enhancv</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c25b86fd-7f31-4f68-a5f1-ca93a2eba636","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_345","url":"/best-resume-writing-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-31T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-08-31T07:00:00Z","name":"The Best Resume Writing Software of 2019","synopsis":"We rank the best resume writing software with side-by-side comparisons.
