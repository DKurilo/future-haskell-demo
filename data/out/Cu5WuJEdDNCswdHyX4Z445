It doesn’t look like any other <a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">electric string trimmer</a> in our lineup. Instead of a straight metal shaft, it, has a green 38-inch plastic shaft that is slightly curved at the bottom. It is an extremely inexpensive, lightweight trimmer with a small cutting path that is designed for one purpose, to trim a small lawn. It has no edging features such as a rotating head or a wheel.","This corded trimmer weighs in at just 3.3 pounds and has a small 3-amp motor. It has a tiny cutting path of 9.45 inches, much smaller than the other trimmers in our lineup. While the ergonomically friendly weight will save your back, you might be out there trimming your lawn for longer periods, and it’s only suited for trimming and clearing weeds in a small space.","The trimmer operates on a bump line feed system. You simply need to tap the trimmer’s head on the ground and the spool lengthens. You can also stop the device and tap it with your finger. The shaft on this trimmer doesn’t adjust for height, and the head doesn’t rotate or adjust for different terrain. So while this is an affordable grass trimmer, it’s functionality is very limited.","The two-year warranty, which is shorter than average, covers the product in case something goes wrong. While this may be a valid option for a person with a small yard who isn’t concerned about edging, this weed eater falls behind the competition in almost every regard. An electric weed eater in the same price range with more functionality, including a shaft that adjusts for edging, is the <a href=\"/greenworks-review\">Greenworks 21212</a>."]},"id":"b6d4a9ec-632a-4533-94e9-a014a1c4dca4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e61c6ebf-85bb-4215-b79a-eaf22979fbc4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sun Joe&#39;s Trimmer Joe TRJ609E has a unique, lightweight design that will save your back, but may add minutes to your job with its modest 9.45-inch swath.
