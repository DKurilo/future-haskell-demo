It is good for construction sites and other workspaces since it heats up to 1,750 square feet. This <a href=\"/best-space-heaters\">industrial heater</a> is designed for indoor and outdoor use, wherever there is adequate ventilation. It’s easy to transport between worksites, and it comes with built-in safety features for worry-free operation. It has a spark plug ignition system and is backed by a one-year limited warranty.","It uses a premium quality motor that comes encased in aluminum, which is designed to prevent corrosion and maintain consistent pressure over a longer period than heaters with two- or three-piece motors. This industrial space heater is a floor heater. It has a convenient handle with a cord wrap so you can easily move from place to place. The heater’s power cord has a convenient additional outlet, so you can use it to charge a mobile phone or other tools.","This industrial heater is easy to operate. It has an automatic Sure-Fire spark plug ignition system for reliability and easy ignition. It uses a high-temp composite nozzle adapter that stays cool and keeps the hoses fitting tight while maintaining pressure. Other types of adapters can cause pressure leaks over time and premature failure. The ignition does not require matches, batteries and other sources to light.","This space heater includes a comfort control thermostat, which is easy to operate. You can set the thermostat from 40 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. There is a power indicator lamp above that lights up when the heater starts.","This model features dual-fuel capability, which allows you to use either 1-K kerosene or #1 diesel, whichever you prefer. It has a 5-gallon fuel capacity and heats your workspace for nine hours per tank. The heater has a run-time fuel gauge that shows how many hours of operation remain, so you know when your fuel is running low and can plan accordingly. The thermostat senses the room temperature and shuts off when the room exceeds the set temperature. Likewise, when the room temperature falls below the set temperature, the heater cycles back on. The control knob has five comfort levels you can set. Safety sensors shut off the heater in case of a flameout or overheating; the motor is UL Listed, and this heater is certified by CSA for safety.","The Dyna-Glo KFA75DGD is a durable space heater that can heat up to 1,750 square feet. It has built-in safety features and is easy to operate. This is a solid heater worth considering if you need to warm up your worksite."]},"id":"67e844ba-559e-4685-91a3-9a4b85746d21","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66815","url":"/dyna-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-04T20:59:03Z","datePublished":"2015-09-04T20:59:03Z","name":"Dyna-Glo KFA75DGD","synopsis":"The Dyna-Glo KFA75DGD Dual Fuel Heater runs on two types of fuel and has an operation time of  nine hours.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Dyna-Glo KFA75DGD Dual Fuel Heater runs on two types of fuel and has an operation time of  nine hours.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-04T20:59:03Z","id":"HJnT2Gbg57f3GadpCBsyrf","meta":{"title":"Dyna-Glo KFA75DGD Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Dyna-Glo KFA75DGD is a powerful duel-fuel forced air space heater with a heating capacity of 75,000 BTUs.
