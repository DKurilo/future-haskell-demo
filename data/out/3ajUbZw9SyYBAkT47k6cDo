Its primary burner, located in the front right spot, has a generous 17,000 Btu heat output – hot enough to quickly boil water or sear meat. There is also a slow-simmering, 5,000 Btu burner you can use to melt butter and other delicate foods as well as two midrange burners with outputs of 9,500 Btu and 12,000 Btu that are great for everyday cooking. In addition, the stovetop features an oval burner in the center, which is useful for elongated pans and griddles. Unlike some gas ranges, the FFGF3054TB doesn’t come with an integrated griddle to use on this burner, though you can buy one separately.","At 5 cubic feet, this range has a fairly average-size oven. Its powerful broiler outputs up to 13,500 Btu of heat. However, the oven heats up to only 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn’t as hot as many of the gas ovens we reviewed, some of which reach 550 degrees. However, 500 degrees is still more than hot enough to bake most dishes.","The FFGF3054TB’s oven isn’t a convection oven, so your food may not bake as evenly as it would in some of the range’s competitors. It comes with two oven racks you can place in six slots. One of the racks is offset, so its main portion sits lower than pieces that slide into the rack holders. This creates extra room to accommodate tall items such as large roasting pans and turkeys. However, this Frigidaire range doesn’t have a gliding rack, which would make it easier to access food inside the oven.","The oven has a heat self-clean mode you can set to run in two-, four- or six-hour cycles, depending on how dirty it is inside. If you prefer an oven that self-cleans with steam, check out the <a href=\"/lg-review\">LG LRG4115ST</a> – its steam clean cycle takes just 10 minutes.<br/>The Frigidaire FFGF3054TB has a timed shutoff that automatically turns off the oven after 12 hours. There is also a timed cook feature that lets you set when you want the oven to begin cooking. In addition, you can lock the controls to prevent children from messing with them. However, this oven doesn’t have a Sabbath mode, so it isn’t the best option if you keep a kosher kitchen. The drawer underneath the oven is built to store pots and pans.","Frigidaire includes a one-year warranty, which is standard for freestanding gas ranges. You can contact the company’s customer service team by phone during daytime hours six days a week or send an email. However, there isn’t a live chat support option. If you prefer to troubleshoot on your own, you can always consult the manual and warranty information online. There is also a good FAQs section and corresponding YouTube channel that can help you if you’re new to cooking with gas."]},"id":"74561bd2-3767-4a5b-b652-c176ed994fa5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70286","url":"/frigidaire-ffgf3054tb-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-16T16:51:51Z","datePublished":"2018-10-16T16:51:51Z","name":"Frigidaire FFGF3054TB","synopsis":"The Frigidaire FFGF3054TB gas stove has a good selection of burners.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The Frigidaire FFGF3054TB is powerful, but it&#8217;s missing features found on the best gas ranges &#8211; for example, a convection oven and Sabbath mode.
