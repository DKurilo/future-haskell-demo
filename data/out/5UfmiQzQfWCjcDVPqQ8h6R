The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The LG Ultra Large Capacity WM4070HWA front-load washer has a tub with a capacity of 4.3 cubic feet, which gives you plenty of room and then some for all the laundry you do. It also comes with a good deal of wash cycles and options to give you plenty of variety. You can choose from 14 wash cycles, 12 options, five soil levels, and five wash and rinse temperatures every time you need to put in a load.","This front-load washing machine bares the Energy Star label and was awarded as an Energy Star Most Efficient appliance in 2013. Along with being energy efficient, this LG washer has a cold-wash option, which will help to reduce energy usage by using cold water. This cycle still provides you with washing performance that is equivalent to that of a warm water cycle.","The LG Ultra Large Capacity front-load washer is missing a few features we like to see, but does include all the usual wash cycles and options you find on most front-loader washing machines. It also has a few distinctive cycles and options that we found impressive. Among those distinctive cycles are an allergen cycle and a speed-wash cycle, both of which could come in very handy for just about anyone.","We were also impressed with the TurboWash and steam technology that are included on this LG washer. The TurboWash option takes 20 minutes off a large load, saving you time and energy, but still gives you the washing performance you want. You can add the steam option to a cycle to help clean deep into the fabrics.","You don’t have to worry about floor vibration with this LG front-loading washer, as it boasts LG’s TrueBalance Anti Vibration System, which helps to minimize noise and vibration of the washer. The LG Ultra Large Capacity front-load washer also has LG’s revolutionary 6Motion Technology, which uses six different wash motions in each cycle to give you superior cleaning.","This LG front-load washer is available in both a white and graphite steel color. However, the graphite steel color has a slightly higher price tag. An optional pedestal drawer is available with this front-loading washer but it will cost you extra.","Without the optional pedestal drawer, this LG washer sits at 38-11/16 inches high, and is 27 inches wide and 29-3/4 inches deep. The pedestal drawer adds 13-3/5 inches to the height, and when the door on the washer is open, the appliance is 51 inches deep.","The warranty coverage LG provides for its front-loading washers is one of the best in the industry. Parts and labor are covered for the first year, while the motor is backed by a 10-year warranty and the tub is covered for the lifetime of the appliance.","You can contact LG by phone and email for help and support, and you can even speak to a representative via live chat on its website. LG also provides the user manual, FAQs and product tutorials on its website for your reference."]},"id":"6881ffba-2c4c-45fc-89b6-8a988abb07b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9189d799-84de-4ba1-aae0-2cf3297930ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG Ultra Large Capacity WM4070HWA front-load washer is definitely ultra large with a high-capacity tub of 4.3 cubic feet and you have a sufficient number of wash cycles and options to choose from.
