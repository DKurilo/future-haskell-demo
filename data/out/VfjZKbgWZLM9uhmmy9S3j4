Supporting premature babies as light as 4 pounds, this infant car seat keeps your child snug and secure. The seat is compatible with Mia Moda&#39;s Novella and Energi strollers, and it includes a reclining stay-in-car base and a zippered canopy. Unfortunately, the seat can only support a child up to 22 pounds or 29 inches, so you&#39;ll have to buy a new rear-facing car seat before your child is 2 years old.","The Certo meets federal crash-testing requirements, offers side-impact protection and is airplane compliant. The car seat comes with a full-body infant pillow to support newborn children as light as 4 pounds. This makes it a great option for premature children. However, the Certo only has four harness slot positions, and its support maxes out at 22 pounds or 29 inches. The average boy will outgrow this seat by his first year. It is important to note that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that a child remain in a rear-facing car seat until age 2, so you&#39;ll have to buy a new car seat until your child is ready for a front-facing seat.","The car seat has some excellent convenience features to make it easy to live with during its short life. It is compatible with the Mia Moda Novella and Energi Strollers. The car seat has four harness positions to keep your baby comfortable as he grows. The adjustable carry handle is comfortable on the hand and the arm. Also, the Certo includes a three-section canopy that you can zipper shut to make sure it doesn&#39;t flap around in the breeze.","The Mia Moda Certo comes with a one-year warranty. Unfortunately, the Mia Moda website does not have a downloadable user manual, although there is a blank User Manuals tab at the top of the page. Also, you cannot search for a local retailer that carries the Certo. Customer support is available by email and telephone, but we could not get in touch with anyone through either method."]},"id":"2e03b3fb-8616-4d51-b408-2306ef2bdd37","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c0084485-ce23-49fd-abf7-92e95924f568","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Mia Moda Certo is a newborn baby car seat that supports a child from 4 to 22 pounds.
