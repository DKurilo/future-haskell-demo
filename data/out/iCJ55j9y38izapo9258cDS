However, the savings account options are not as comprehensive do have high monthly minimum balance requirements along with fees if your balance drops below the required minimum. Overall, this online bank is a secure option with wonderful customer service.","***How we formulate the Benchmark Data:","Under the Benchmark tab labeled &#34;Online Banks&#39; Interest Rates,&#34; you will find the basic interest rate paid on a savings account for new customers. This number is not static and will change based on the amount you deposit, your current balance and special promotions the bank might be having. The interest rate we have displayed was obtained by contacting the bank to evaluate the interest rate on a new account with the lowest possible minimum balance.","The second Benchmark tab, &#34;Online Bank Interest Rates Compared to Major Banks,&#34; is a computation of the interest rate found at the online bank, as above, and divided by the average rate of major “brick and mortar” banks. The average interest earnings for these banks is currently calculated as .05%, and was derived by contacting the three major banks (Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Chase), and averaging their interest earnings rate for a similar account.","The Benchmark values found under this tab represent the ratio of each online bank&#39;s interest rate to .05% (the brick and mortar average). The value you see here is a product of that ratio, which is obtained by dividing the estimated interest rate found at online banks (the values in the first tab) by the average interest rate of the brick and mortar banks (.05). The banks that feature a larger Benchmark number than competing banks in our review provide a proportionately higher interest earnings rate on savings. The data used to compute these values is current as of October 2011."]},"id":"d41291b3-91d6-4e16-a08e-7bc3d18e77db","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53218","url":"/citibank-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-30T22:20:18Z","datePublished":"2011-06-30T22:20:18Z","name":"Citibank","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"verdict":"We recommend this online bank for its no-hassle checking accounts.","pros":["The checking account has no hidden fees or minimum deposits."],"cons":["The savings account has a high minimum balance requirement."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-06-30T22:20:18Z","id":"iCJ55j9y38izapo9258cDS","meta":{"title":"Citibank Online Banking Review - Interest Rates, Service & Security","description":" The Citibank online banking options are extensive and useful.
