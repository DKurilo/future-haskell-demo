Although the design is bulkier than others, the strong bass overtones and quiet listening environment are great for listening to your favorite hits.","Instead of releasing specifications for headphones, Beats instead compels you to listen and judge for yourself. The sound quality of the Beats Studio Wireless is solid, but not overly exceptional. The over-exaggerated bass works well for genres like hip-hop and techno, but it is too overpowering for classical and jazz. When the volume is high, you can hear the detailed artistry of each track but when the volume is low, your music sounds muffled and distant.","The Studio Wireless excels at multi-tasking since it functions as Bluetooth noise-cancelling headphones instead of just one or the other. With both of these conveniences, you can listen in peace and quiet, and without a cord.","As a signature feature of all Beats products, the design of the Beats Studio Wireless headphones is uniquely chic. Eight color options include black, blue, gray, white, red and a few more but the included cable is red no matter which color you choose. A 12-hour to 20-hour battery life will get you through a working day without dying. However, once the battery does die, you won&#39;t be able to listen at all since there is no passive play option. You&#39;ll need to charge the battery before beginning another listening session. The on-ear remote and mic allow you to take phone calls, change songs and adjust the volume without reaching for your phone. Since they also fold in on themselves, the Studio Wireless are easy to carry around with you while traveling.","Like the best Bluetooth headphones, the over-ear design naturally seals out sound and creates an isolated listening space. However, at 9 ounces, these headphones are much heavier and bulkier than other models. If you value style above comfort though, the Studio Wireless are an excellent option.","With a connectivity range of 30 feet, the Studio Wireless headphones are about average for wireless range. A detachable cable is also included should you want to listen with a wire instead of wireless. These headphones also support aptX for increased music quality.","The Beats Studio Wireless headphones come with a one-year warranty and you can find user manuals and FAQs on the Beats website. Should you need technical support, email and phone contact details are also on the website. Beats&#39; Facebook and Twitter social media team can also answer questions as well."]},"id":"da2e6fa5-7d7c-4888-871c-89842924c7c9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"26b21c2f-aa34-4a66-a3be-8c228acd199b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Bluetooth headphones like the Beats Studio Wireless are designed for loud jam sessions.
