You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">wine cooler</a> is the only one we reviewed that has mirrored door finish. It is designed to be an attractive addition to your home and not necessarily for matching your other appliances. It includes blue LED lighting, a pole (towel-rack style) handle and stylish wooden shelves. The Vinotemp VT-21TSP-2Z features dual zones and a quiet thermoelectric cooling unit.","The Vinotemp VT-21TSP-2Z can cool to as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit and up to 64 F, making it suitable for white and red wines. As with most thermoelectric coolers, this one cannot cool to the low 40s, the temperature at which many enjoy sparkling wines. If you need a cooler that will reach lower temperatures, check out the <a href=\"/newair-awc-330e-review\">NewAir AWC-330E</a>. ","As with all wine fridges, you will want to test each zone and each shelf to find the best location for each type of wine. Some can vary as much as 10 degrees from top to bottom. In most cases, the top of the white wine section will be around 55 F and the bottom as low as 47 F. The red wine section might hold a temperature of 60 F at the top and 66 F at the bottom. This unit should be able to maintain these ranges, making it suitable to cool most wine types to ideal serving temperatures.","Since this wine chiller uses a thermoelectric cooling unit, it runs quietly and is more energy-efficient than compressor-type units. However, that also means you should install this unit in a location that maintains a steady, moderate ambient temperature of between 60 and 80 F. Our research indicates that this kind of unit performs better when the temperature is not too high. Around 70 F seems to be the optimal ambient temperature for best performance. Of course, this machine cannot warm wine, so it should not be put in a cold basement or garage. Once the ambient temperature reaches below 45 F, the unit will simply shut off and you would risk freezing your bottles. So it is best to find a climate-controlled space with proper ventilation to install your new wine cooler.","This wine refrigerator comes with a standard one-year warranty and adequate support. However, it should be noted that if you order this unit directly from Vinotemp, shipping is about $100. If you have an Amazon Prime membership, you can purchase this wine fridge from Amazon and take advantage of free shipping."]},"id":"f98887aa-40be-4226-a558-31cd0cc52b61","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2d96a384-8fce-4efd-b3f6-56cab354c857","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for a single unit to chill both red and white wines, plus you want an interesting mirrored finish over the standard stainless steel, this unit will work for you.
