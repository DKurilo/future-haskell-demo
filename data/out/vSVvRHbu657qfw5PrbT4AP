shopping for a <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">portable DVD player</a>, it’s tempting to buy one of the options under $100. However, during our testing, we found that the sub-$100 players were very disappointing, particularly the Naxa NPD-1003. On paper, the Naxa travel DVD player looks like a great purchase, since it has a large screen that can both tilt and swivel. Some of our testing offered promising results, especially with its speaker quality and battery life. However, the player lacks parental controls, and its screen was a huge disappointment.","We tested the Naxa’s screen quality with the same test DVD we used for each compact DVD player. First, we used a protractor and thread to test the maximum viewing angle from center. The Naxa can maintain its image when up to 40 degrees from center, allowing for two to three people viewing without any problem. However, the screen itself is far too dark on default settings. Also, the colors appear faded and unsaturated, making a bright and colorful movie look old.","We tested the sound with a decibel meter. Through the speakers, the maximum loudness reaches 85 dB, somewhat quieter than most other travel DVD players. The sounds were clear and free of distortion. Through our test headphones, the maximum loudness is 63 dB, significantly quieter than many other players. Also, the sounds were somewhat muted, losing some of the fidelity we expected in our test DVD.","Naxa claims that its battery will last two hours. We fully charged the player and ran our test DVD on repeat. The Naxa eventually died after two and a half hours, 30 minutes longer than the claimed life.","Unfortunately, the Naxa is missing one crucial feature: parental controls. This means that you’ll have to be actively involved in your child’s viewing habits to make sure they don’t watch something you don’t want them watching. We’ve come to expect parental controls as a standard feature in car DVD players, so for this feature to be missing is disappointing."]},"id":"ca228244-47b5-49f1-8d91-0cecd76b5b02","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3495c561-3f87-490f-8106-8927969ad34a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Naxa NPD-1003 is a disappointing portable DVD player that hides its poor screen behind a low price.
