The only problem is the typical programming delay you get with services like Hulu or Netflix. The HD HomeRun Dual is the perfect solution. This  DVR connects to a standard ATSC digital antenna and broadcasts live over-the-air channels straight to your computer.","The HD HomeRun Dual doesn’t have internal memory; instead, it uses your computer’s hard drive as its recording space. While we don’t like the thought of using up our hard drive to record TV, it’s better than paying for cable and a monthly usage fee for a DVR. If it starts taking up too much of your hard drive space, you can buy an external hard drive. This DVR can schedule recordings and has two tuners for antenna and cable access.","As a computer-based DVR, this unit is quite compatible with most of the elements we deem essential. It works with both PCs and Macs, and HD and SD TVs. The HomeRun essentially functions as a DVR without subscription.","Unencrypted digital cable TV and free, over-the-air channels are the HD HomeRun Dual’s bread and butter. It can’t access anything more than that, but if you know your way around Windows media center or Elgato, you may be able to access more online video programs.","We would love to see the addition of online streaming included on the HomeRun Dual in the form of apps like Hulu, Amazon Instant Video and Netflix in their DVR software. The inclusion of this would help this device truly live up to its name. That would be a homerun in the best sense of the word and make it a more complete entertainment package.","Ever wondered which channels are broadcast over-the-air for anyone to watch? Head to Silicon Dust’s support page, type in your zip code and they will provide an extensive list, customized to your area. They also have downloadable drives, FAQs and direct access to technical support through email or social media networks. A one-year warranty is included with this HD DVR."]},"id":"cb9adc94-86f0-4975-a542-c8434ae22c46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b22d0d08-abde-4ad7-a2b2-71ed16ed0e01","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We like the idea of watching and recording free, over-the-air TV via the HD HomeRun Dual.
