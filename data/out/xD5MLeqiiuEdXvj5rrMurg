You can edit your photos in just one click, which can be nice if you don&#39;t have time or the desire to make extensive or precise edits to your images; however, the one-click feature can be frustrating for those who want more control over the editing process for their pictures. This <a href=\"/best-photo-organizing-software\">photo organizing software</a> enables you to share you images with family and friends, but it has limited sharing functions.","Quickly organize your photos by adding them to albums, rating the images and describing them with tags. If you prefer, you can also view your photos in folders instead of albums. PaintShop Photo Express can also organize your music and videos in the same software.","Eliminate imperfections in your photos by removing red eye, and marks and blemishes on your photos. If you have a photo where the horizon is crooked, you can use the straightening tool to adjust it. You can also adjust the brightness, contrast, and sharpness. The software allows you to convert photos to black and white, antique and sepia,  and you can even whiten teeth and add a suntan. PaintShop Photo Express has a cropping tool. If you want, you can add photo edges and frames to your images.","Show off your pictures in digital photo albums, collages, slideshows, photo books and on calendars. Add music, video clips and templates to create a professional-looking slideshows with a personal touch to them. For printed projects, you can print your photo projects from home or send your images to a professional printer.","When we opened this photo organizing software for the first time, it was so simple that we weren&#39;t sure if we had the whole product. While it was easy to navigate, we spent time looking to see if there was more to the software. As we stated above, the editing tools don&#39;t allow you to make custom adjustments. While this may be a positive aspect for some people, others will want a photo organizing software that allows you to perform more detailed adjustments to your photos that require some manual tweaking.","You can talk to Corel&#39;s tech support on the telephone. If you&#39;re having trouble, they can remotely control your computer to help you get your photo organizing software running properly. Most of our interaction with customer support was positive; however, we did once have to wait on hold for about twenty minutes to reach someone in tech support. Once we started talking to them, they resolved our technical question quickly."]},"id":"b1b05599-68a2-4a89-a31f-12fa2540e094","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e87abd58-503f-420a-b1bd-f168a5484809","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Corel PaintShop Photo Express can help you organize your photos into albums with rating stars and tags.
