The software offers 30 scenes representing different learning environments; by using your mouse and keyboard you can navigate through any scene to learn the names for everything on the screen. For example, when you visit the bathroom scene you can move the mouse over an element in the room–such as the toothbrush–and you will automatically be given the Spanish translation. This uncommon approach was both amusing and informative, earning Panoramic a spot as one of our top 10 Spanish language software products."]},"id":"d93d69bf-ef58-49fd-b9c2-d3e6d523e031","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Learning Content"},"id":"ce58341e-4767-490e-9593-f3f3f47ac865","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Panoramic offers a few features essential to Spanish language acquisition. It contains a dictionary with more than 2000 words and 1200 phrases covering topics from travel to weather.

Although the program includes these convenient vocabulary learning and testing features, it lacks many valuable tools available in top–of–the–line Spanish software programs, such as grammar–building exercises and conversation practice."]},"id":"8b6038e4-efed-4163-bb6b-d7149472832e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Learning Versatility"},"id":"6a6790ce-92fe-4e61-8299-225406c26d28","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This product is not simple to use.
