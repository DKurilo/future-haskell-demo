This model uses antimicrobial technology to prevent viruses, bacteria and mold from growing in its water tank and ultimately spewing into the air of your home.","Since the EE-8065 is an ultrasonic humidifier, it uses high-frequency vibrations to convert water into a fine mist. It can convert 2.5 gallons of water into mist every 24 hours and efficiently humidifies rooms up to 500 square feet.","The Crane Germ Defense EE-8065 has almost silent operation. Its barely noticeable hum allows you to sleep peacefully at night, even if you use it right next to your bed, and also makes it one of the best humidifiers for a baby.","This humidifier runs without a refill for an impressive 72 hours, far longer than most humidifiers, so you will not run out of water in the middle of the night. When it eventually does run out of water, it automatically shuts off. This important automatic safety feature prevents overheating and the potential risk of fire, prolonging the life of the humidifier.","The EE-8065 is available with either digital or manual controls; this review focuses on the manual model. While the digital version comes with a timer to preset how long it runs and the basic unit does not, the manual unit is easier to operate. The digital model has no memory, and you have to reset every function every time you use it. Unless the timer is important to you, choosing the manual model saves you lots of time and frustration.","There are three output settings, so you can operate it as a cool or warm mist humidifier. If you have children, always use the safer cool humidification mode. Warm mist can burn a child if they get too close, and the heated water is a scalding hazard if the unit tips over.","The humidifier offers additional safety by helping prevent the spread of unwanted bacteria, viruses and mold. The manufacturer embeds antimicrobial silver particles in the tank to fill your home with a more sanitized mist than you would get from humidifiers without this technology.","As this is an ultrasonic humidifier, when it converts water with high calcium and magnesium content into mist, it often evaporates into a fine white dust that coats the furniture in your home over time. Filters are optional with this unit, and you could save money by avoiding them if you don&#39;t mind wiping down the powder occasionally.","However, if your tap water has a high mineral content, you should use the separately sold demineralization filter cartridge to save your family from breathing white dust and save yourself the aggravation of cleaning it up as part of your housework routine. You can also reduce the white dust problem by using distilled or filtered water.","The design of this humidifier&#39;s nozzle allows you to rotate it a full 360 degrees to control the direction of the moisturized mist. Since this unit does not have a clear water tank, you have to rely on the red indicator light to tell you when the water is low. This light is very bright, and it flashes and makes a clicking noise for several minutes before the unit turns off.","The EE-8065 includes a one-year warranty, though this is much shorter than the five-year warranty on the <a href=\"/vornado-review\">Vornado Evap2</a>. The company website has a toll-free telephone number. A live chat service is also available for general assistance and quick answers to your questions."]},"id":"2cd05b79-583d-44a9-ac0c-9a0ca2e3e701","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"619d21e6-b8d3-4d95-bddc-800db3d8e960","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Crane Germ Defense EE-8065 is a sleek humidifier with a high-mist, germ-reducing and almost silent moisture output.
