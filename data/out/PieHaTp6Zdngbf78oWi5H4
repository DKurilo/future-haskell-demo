You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","AutoRoadService.com is a <a href=\"/best-roadside-assistance-services\">roadside assistance</a> service that has helped stranded drivers for over 30 years. This roadside service company offers one plan, giving all its customers access to premium service and benefits without the need to upgrade to a more expensive plan. With coverage that extends into Canada, as well as nationwide across the United States, AutoRoadService.com is a good choice for everyday drivers and those who go on long road trips.","One of the best features of this breakdown service provider is the payment options. You can opt for monthly or yearly payments. You can also get substantial savings over time by choosing to pay for three, five or seven years upfront, eliminating the need for a yearly renewal. The downside with taking this option is that you will be locked into it for that period of time. If this is a concern, you can always pay for a year of service upfront, see how you like it, then sign up for multiple years later if you decide it’s something you want to keep around for a while.","The service also simplifies options by offering a single plan, the Premium Roadside Assistance Package, which covers all cars, SUVs, motorcycles, RVs and noncommercial trucks for a reasonable fee. Each membership covers the primary member and an additional family member, who is included in your membership at no additional charge.","The roadside assistance service provides coverage for just about every imaginable situation that could occur on the road, including battery jump-starts, minor roadside adjustments, flat-tire assistance, fuel delivery, vehicle winching and extrication, and lock-out services. It also has a $100 towing allowance for tows of up to 35 miles, and if you require a further tow, there&#39;s an extra fee of around $2 per mile.","AutoRoadService.com does not provide any legal assistance, such as arrest bond certificates or legal representation reimbursement. There is also no on-time arrival guarantee, which some other roadside services out there provide. This means that you might have to wait for a while if a service representative cannot come to you immediately. Also, this service only allows for three service calls per year without charging extra. That is the fewest offered from the lineup of services we reviewed. Most of the services provide four service calls, but some allow for as many as five or six before charges accrue.","Despite the lack of benefits, this company provides some nice extras with your membership. You receive the ExxonMobil Travel Guide&#39;s online reservation service that provides hotel and motel discounts at over 12,000 hotels, including Marriott and Sheraton hotels. You also receive access to ExxonMobil Travel Guide ratings for hotels and restaurants, and a 50-percent discount on all Mobil Travel Guide publications.","Another noteworthy extra this breakdown service offers is access to FreeTrip.com&#39;s Trip Planner, an online travel-planning tool that helps you figure out the best route to your destination and recommends hotels (from economy to luxury) and sights along the way. AutoRoadService.com also has a blog that offers advice on a variety of auto-related topics.","If you need to contact a customer service representative at AutoRoadService.com, you can access a toll-free number for road service sales and another number for the corporate offices. You&#39;ll also find a FAQs section and an email address for support on the website."]},"id":"a4aafa9f-6649-40d5-88b8-fcd6627a3423","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2293b7a0-c1e0-4011-9fc3-b870814a6658","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["AutoRoadService.com is a good emergency roadside service that provides all the core roadside assistance you’ll need.
