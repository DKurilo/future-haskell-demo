You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Cooking with natural gas definitely has its advantages. Gas stoves produce steady flames and reach astounding temperatures for evenly cooked foods, and gas ovens heat quickly for fast preheat times. The Whirlpool Gold 30 inch <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">slide-in gas range</a> (GW397LXUS) is no exception.","The four burners produce up to 9,200 BTUs, so you get soaring temperatures for boiling, or you can choose to lower the heat on the 5,000-BTU simmer burners. The continuous cast iron grates make moving heavy pots and pans from burner to burner easy, and it reduces the risk of spilling or tipping. In case of accidents, the gas burners are sealed to prevent messes and boil overs from interfering with the flame quality.","The knobs and digital display located on the front of the range are simple to use and control the burners, oven and self-cleaning features. This die-cast console sits at an angle to keep children from adjusting settings, and the control lock keeps the oven sealed whenever you need to keep it closed. The self-cleaning feature uses pyrolitic technology to char food spills and debris into ash so you don&#39;t have to scrub messes from the oven walls and surfaces. The porcelain surface on the black and white finishes is easy to clean with all purpose cleaner and a soft rag, while the stainless steel model requires standard stainless steel cleaner.","While baking, the temperature sensors monitor the oven to keep consistent results on each rack. You can bookmark favorite temperatures and settings for your most frequent dishes. The oven capacity is 4.5 cubic feet, so you can cook green beans, mashed potatoes and a meat dish all at once. To save space in your cabinets, the storage drawer is perfect for baking sheets and small pots or pans.","Before purchasing or installing any type of slide-in range, know what type of power flows through your kitchen. Hookups for natural gas require a professional installer, and the same is recommended for this Whirlpool Gold model. If you want a gas range, but don&#39;t have a hookup, the Whirlpool Gold GW397LXUS has an LP convertible kit for liquid propane. If you&#39;re remodeling and change your mind about a slide-in range, this model has an optional filler kit, side and back splash panels available for purchase to convert it to a free-standing range.","The Whirlpool Gold GW397LXUS provides a steady natural gas flame for even results on the stove top and in the oven. Personalized settings helps you make this slide-in range perfect for your kitchen, and the smooth surface and self-cleaning feature makes the clean up fast after big meals."]},"id":"4253fdd6-4cc6-400f-a39f-faba28dace17","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58012","url":"/whirlpool-gold-slide-in-range-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T12:59:10Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T12:59:10Z","name":"Whirlpool Gold GW397LXUS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
