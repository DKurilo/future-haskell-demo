Where do you find quality clip art images licensed for business use? How can you tell if an image is legal to use in a given situation? Which laws apply to which clip art images?","First, a definition of clip art is in order. The words &#34;clip art&#34; can classify a wide variety of files—professional photographs, technical illustrations, simple line drawings, even fonts. However, some define clip art only as scalable vector illustrations. Others may define clip art as any image used on a computer.","The definition of clip art is flexible, but US copyright laws apply to all image types equally—the right of legal use depends on the intent of the copyright owner.","Professional graphic designers must draw the line between clip art that&#39;s legit and clip art that can cause legal troubles. Below are the common legal categories and definitions for clip art images that graphic designers use every day."]},"id":"ce7ebe84-bc61-47b7-9213-0b621f88bcb3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Free Clip Art"},"id":"c9f5d13e-4744-468d-9917-4fe08f17c36e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are plenty of free clip art websites online.

(You may also leave your computer vulnerable to uninvited guests, like <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">spyware</a>.)","Legal business use for free clip art images isn&#39;t easy to pinpoint since the original source is obscure, so free clip art images aren&#39;t recommended for business use."]},"id":"e46f012a-d756-4975-ba11-7b434c85226c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Published Clip Art"},"id":"307f8371-38bf-4c74-b082-138afb2f9393","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Published clip art categorizes every image you see online or in print.
