On the outside, the PH550 is slightly bulkier than standard mini projectors with dimensions of 6.9 x 4.3 x 1.7 inches and a weight of 1.4 pounds. Still, it’s much easier to carry around than a standard full-size projector, and the included carrying pouch is a useful accessory when you’re on the go. More importantly, the LG makes the most of its slightly larger size.","The LG includes a deep bench of port options. Along with standards like HDMI input and support for USB storage and composite video, the PH550 touts Bluetooth audio output and even a coaxial connector, meaning you can hook up an antenna for over-the-air broadcast television. The projector is easy to control with the LG’s full-size remote.","Unlike most portable projectors, which feature equally small-scale remotes, the LG’s remote is virtually identical to the ones used on home televisions. As a result, it’s far easier to scroll through menus and adjust image settings without having to manually click through individual prompts with the projector’s manual controls. Additionally, you can fully control the projector from your seat – you’ll never have to get up unless you’re going for more popcorn.","The lack of microSD support is the only major downside to the LG’s connectivity options. Considering how common the format is for devices like this, it’s a baffling omission and a nuisance if you want to share content like videos or photos through the projector.","The LG was a relatively consistent performer in all of our tests. Its brightness levels weren’t as high as the best LED-based projectors we reviewed, like the <a href=\"/optoma-ml750st-review\">Optoma ML750ST</a>, but its color accuracy is comparable to that of competing models. In practice, the LG’s image quality was above average, and it is plenty usable in both light and dark viewing environments. With the best battery life capacity of any unit in our comparison – up to two and a half hours – the projector has the endurance to last through a movie or presentation.","The LG PH550 isn’t the smallest mini projector but is still compact and makes the most of its size. While it lacks a microSD slot and its image quality is a small step behind the best mini projectors, stellar features and a full suite of entertainment-friendly connectivity options make it a versatile projector."]},"id":"cc82351c-0fee-4890-bad6-370d44e95475","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68488","url":"/lg-ph550-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-29T22:55:12Z","datePublished":"2016-09-29T22:55:12Z","name":"LG PH550","synopsis":"Home theater enthusiasts or anyone in need of a versatile mini projector can find lots to like with the LG PH550.
