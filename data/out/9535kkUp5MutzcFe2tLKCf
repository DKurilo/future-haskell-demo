With a paid service, you won&#39;t be restricted to what types of content you can post, and you&#39;ll have more control over customization options. You&#39;ll also have your own domain name. With these extra features, you can create a more professional blog, which in turn attracts more readers and lends you more credibility. Three of the most common web hosts for blogs are <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/bluehost/\">Bluehost</a>, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/arvixe/\">Arvixe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/godaddy/\">GoDaddy</a>.","When your blog is hosted by a service, it means you are storing it on the hosting company&#39;s servers, which then deliver your website when it is requested by someone on the internet. Along with the extra features the blog hosting services provide, you also gain added reliability, speed and security when your blog is on someone else&#39;s servers. Most services charge per month for hosting services, and have different pricing packages that include varying amounts of storage, allowed visitors per month and security options.","<strong>Blog Hosting: What to Look For</strong>","Looking for the right web host for your blog starts with knowing what your blog needs. Every blog is different and has unique needs when it comes to content and traffic, so you&#39;ll want to be sure of the direction you want to take before choosing a blog host. For example, websites with more dynamic content like videos and pictures will often need more storage on the servers. If your blog houses a lot of dynamic content, you&#39;ll want to focus on plans that offer higher storage options. As you determine what your blog will include, you will be able to recognize what aspects of hosting plans will matter most to you. However, there are three things that are especially important to consider no matter what kind of content your site delivers. The best blog hosting services excel at reliability, speed and security.","<strong>Reliability<br/></strong>The internet never sleeps, and neither do your readers. This means you can expect someone to be looking at your blog at any given moment, day or night, especially if you have readers from all over the world. It&#39;s important that your website is up and running as much as it can be, and that reliability is largely up to the web host you choose to host your blog.","The host&#39;s hardware is an important part of reliability. The best web hosts for blogs use solid-state drives (SSD), which are faster than hard disk drives (HDD). The web host you choose should also guarantee a high percentage of uptime for its servers. Try to use a web host that guarantees at least 99.5% uptime.<strong> </strong>","<strong>Speed<br/></strong>Your readers expect fast load times on any site they visit, and the web host you choose for your blog can do a lot to help or hinder you in that area. Most hosting services list how many visitors their servers can handle at any given time for your site specifically. You can also ask a potential web host for a list of its clients and visit those sites to see how fast the pages load.<strong> </strong>","Speed can also depend on whether or not the host is using solid-state drives for their servers and if a content delivery network (CDN) is included in the hosting package. Solid-state drives are much faster than their older hard disk drive counterparts, and CDNs help distribute the traffic load to faster servers.","<strong>Security<br/></strong>The web can be a little unpredictable at times, and you&#39;ll want to make sure your data stays protected as much as possible. There are two points of concern that can compromise your data: infrastructure failure and outside security breaches.<strong> </strong>","When hardware and infrastructure fails, it can often mean loss of data, so you&#39;ll want to make sure the web host you choose has some sort of backup. When your data is backed up to different hard drives or servers, it can prevent data loss as well as extended periods of downtime.","Web hosts for blogs may also include additional security features to guard against external security breaches, like providing a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate for your blog. A SSL certificate is essential for websites that deal in sensitive and personal information like names, addresses and credit card numbers. Some blog hosting services also include proprietary security measures to prevent attacks on networks. These options vary depending on which company you&#39;re looking at, but they often include security measures like malware removal, firewalls and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack prevention.","Finding a web host for your blog is one of the best things you can do to help your blog grow and earn you more money. As you provide a more stable website for your readers to visit, they will visit more often and you will attract more readers, too. Using the guidelines above, you can find the best web host for your blog.","Â "]},"id":"16d65d44-e9d3-4ab7-8151-1966d84473de","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"7df3d37e-60dc-4d78-8b61-e39157777a3b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.a2hosting.com/7174.html\">A2 Hosting</a>","<a href=\"https://www.arvixe.com/wordpress_hosting\">Arvixe</a>","<a href=\"http://www.bluehost.com/track/ropelato/\">Bluehost</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?533880\">DreamHost</a>","<a href=\"http://share.getf.ly/z48v2k\">Flywheel</a>","<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7912591-10699215-1439240992000\">GoDaddy</a>","<a href=\"https://secure1.inmotionhosting.com/cgi-bin/gby/clickthru.cgi?id=ropelato&page=1\">InMotion Hosting</a>","<a href=\"https://www.site5.com/p/wordpress/\">Site5</a>","<a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=a88563c68026a262132d154009b420f5&campaign=bloghosting1\">SiteGround</a>","<a href=\"http://wpengine.com/\">WP Engine</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b9179a9e-5275-4a42-a60a-39b91c025d2c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1822","url":"/best-blog-hosting-sites","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-28T20:43:35Z","datePublished":"2016-11-10T17:50:16Z","name":"Blog Hosting Review","synopsis":"Blog hosting services can help take your blog to the next level of professionalism.
