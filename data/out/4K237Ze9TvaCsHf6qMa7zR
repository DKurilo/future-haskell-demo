The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-binoculars\"><em>binoculars here</em></a><em>.</em>","Almost everyone has heard of “Man vs. Wild” by now, and if you really like having outdoor adventures of your own, you probably know the name of Bear Grylls. Well, Bushnell and Grylls have teamed up to give you a decent set of binoculars that are well-designed for outdoor life. They may pose some challenges, however.","These binoculars will be an attractive buy for anyone who loves the cachet of a product with a celebrity endorsement. However, features ought to trump endorsements when making a careful purchase. These compact binoculars are not necessarily the best binoculars for hunters or light travelers.","The magnification is 10x42mm, which is very good. However, the linear field of view is just 93 – markedly less than many of its competitors, which usually go into the hundreds. The apparent angular field of view is decent at 58, but there is still a lot of lost ground due to the linear field of view. The eyepiece distance is 17mm, which will give you a lot of room if you wear glasses regularly. The minimum distance is 3.6 meters, which is decent but not stellar.","The build and design are fun to look at, and the orange lining is obviously meant to be eye-catching. However, if you want to remain inconspicuous, that might not be an advantage for you. Thankfully, the binoculars are tripod adaptable, and Bushnell offers several different kinds of tripods as additional accessories. The Bushnell Bear Grylls are also waterproof, with rubber armor and curved inlay that will help you keep a grip on them. Lens caps are also included, and the binoculars are protectively nitrogen-filled in case of fog.","Like all Bushnell’s products, the Bushnell Bear Grylls have a carry strap and case, but its size alone is going to pose a challenge for any traveler or hiker who is trying to lighten the load and move with ease. Its length and width are over 300mm, much larger than what you might find from other models and manufacturers. The polycarbonate housing is probably responsible for keeping the Bushnell Bear Grylls’ weight down to 709 grams, but that is still heavy for a pair of binoculars. The weight might place a strain on your neck if you plan to wear them continuously during whatever activities you have planned.","Help and support services are usually superb from Bushnell, and that still holds in most areas here. Email service is usually fast, within 24 hours, and the phone lines are almost always answered promptly. Bushnell employees seem knowledgeable about the products and friendly to customers. However, the information on the site could be a little more extensive and clear. There is a specs section, but there are not many pictures of the binoculars or the view they will give you. There are also some gaps in the specs, such as the Bushnell Bear Grylls’ eye distance range."]},"id":"398eea53-8eef-4b62-957b-592a31dfd45e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2eea17bc-d7cf-4c90-a86c-175ab4191e52","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bushnell Bear Grylls are cute, and they have some good features, but there is definitely room for improvement in making them more user-friendly."]},"id":"fa9b8411-2f2c-48da-a596-4fde9d494e15","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59866","url":"/bushnell-bear-grylls-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-26T18:56:15Z","datePublished":"2014-06-26T18:56:15Z","name":"Bushnell Bear Grylls","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
