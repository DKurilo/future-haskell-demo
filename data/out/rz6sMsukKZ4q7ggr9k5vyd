XTERRA Fitness FB350 is a new release from XTERRA Fitness that upgrades the popular <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/XTERRA-Fitness-FB150-Folding-Exercise/dp/B01LYFWKMH/?tag=ttr_exercise-bike-20\">FB150</a> with a redesigned seat. Priced below $150, it’s the most affordable <a href=\"/best-exercise-bikes\">exercise bike</a> we reviewed. The most expensive machines we considered – the <a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm 8.0 EX</a>, the <a href=\"/nordictrack-gx-4.4-pro-review\">NordicTrack GX 4.4 Pro</a> and the <a href=\"/diamondback-fitness-review\">Diamondback Fitness 510Ub Upright</a> – cost $799 apiece.","The FB350 is an upright exercise bike with a folding x-frame design. It doesn’t have any preprogrammed workout options, but it provides eight levels of resistance to make your workout more challenging and versatile. Resistance is changed manually with a dial tension knob. This can seem old-school if you’re used to digital equipment, but it’s characteristic of lower-end products.","This exercise bike has a maximum user weight of 225 pounds, which is the lowest weight capacity we found in our comparison. Its seat is adjustable, oversized and padded, and it has a backrest for lumbar support. Given that most upright bikes have traditional saddle seats, the backrest is unique to the XTERRA. However, its frame structure and functionality are comparable to the other six uprights we reviewed. If you’re looking for an affordable recumbent, we recommend the <a href=\"/marcy-recumbent-me-709-review\">Marcy Recumbent ME-709</a> as a solid option in a similar price range.","The FB350 is equipped with pedal straps. Although its handles aren’t adjustable, they do have integrated pulse grips. In terms of comfort and convenience, this bike has an accessory pocket, but it doesn’t have a water bottle holder, a workout fan, speakers or an aux port. Its console is easy to use, but you can’t adjust its angle. It’s also lacking Bluetooth connectivity, and it doesn’t store any user profiles. If you’d like a folding bike with more features, consider the <a href=\"/exerpeutic-gold-575-xls-review\">Exerpeutic Gold 575 XLS</a>.","The machine’s assembled dimensions are 40.5 x 21 x 48 inches (length, width, height), and it weighs only 42 pounds. Its folded dimensions are 20.5 x 21 x 50.5 inches. XTERRA Fitness backs the FB350 with a one-year frame warranty and 90 days on parts. Customer service is available by phone and email, and the representative we spoke with was friendly. If you’re looking for more options from XTERRA, it’s important to note that the products available on the company’s website aren’t always the same models you can purchase from third-party retailers."]},"id":"2d355e12-a64a-4880-9b5f-7e6d42a49ccd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70191","url":"/xterra-fitness-fb350-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-29T16:26:41Z","datePublished":"2018-08-29T16:26:41Z","name":"XTERRA Fitness FB350","synopsis":"The XTERRA Fitness FB350 is a new release from XTERRA Fitness that upgrades the popular FB150 with a redesigned seat.
