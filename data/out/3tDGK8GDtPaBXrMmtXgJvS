doesn&#39;t have the speed or all the features of the best <a href=\"/best-encryption-software\">Mac encryption software</a> available, but it has some rare security strengths. The files you choose to encrypt stay within the application, so no one even knows the files exist unless they&#39;re able to open MacKeeper – and to do that, they&#39;d need the right password.","To test this Mac file encryption software, we started with 63 files that equaled 134.5MB. MacKeeper took more than 20 seconds to encrypt those files, which doesn&#39;t seem like a long time – and compared to some programs&#39; encryption times, it isn&#39;t – but when you have gigabytes or terabytes of information to scramble, the time adds up. MacKeeper didn&#39;t take as long to decipher the same amount of information, though – this took just under 16 seconds.","Although MacKeeper includes a multitude of help files, guides and tip windows, it isn&#39;t the easiest program to use, nor is it the hardest. This software offers several tools beyond the data encryption feature, so there are several options listed in the menu, which can be distracting. Once you start setting up encryption, you come across screens where you can choose your password and the algorithm you want to use, but there&#39;s no explanation as to why you would want AES 128-bit over 256-bit key (128-bit encrypts faster but is technically less secure).","MacKeeper is one of the few Mac encryption programs that keep your encrypted files the same size as your original files. This means you don&#39;t have to find extra hard drive space for those encrypted files.","We gave MacKeeper credit for offering Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-key to encrypt your files, because it is considered the strongest algorithm and is used by the U.S. government. Another big benefit you get with MacKeeper is a secure backup feature that you can schedule to automatically back up your files, or you can do it manually.","Encryption gives you peace of mind, but your password is just as important as the Mac encryption software you choose. Your password should be long, full of random characters and hard to guess – so single words aren&#39;t a good idea. You have to devote some extra time and effort to figuring out the best password to use, because MacKeeper doesn&#39;t include a password generator so you don&#39;t have to think of one or a password strength meter to take the guesswork out of how secure your password is.","MacKeeper is one of the few Mac encryption programs to include a file shredder. If you simply delete a file from your computer, it remains there for a long while, and anyone with access to your computer can recover that deleted file with a simple program. However, a file-shredding feature lets you permanently delete files so that they are no longer recoverable.","All of the Mac encryption software companies we reviewed offer customer support in some form, whether it&#39;s by phone, email or feedback form on the company&#39;s website. MacKeeper goes a step further and offers remote support that allows customer service representatives to connect remotely to your computer and help you through whatever issue you&#39;re having with the software. You can also contact customer support by phone or email 24/7.","In case you prefer to figure out issues on your own, though, MacKeeper&#39;s website is chock-full of FAQs, a knowledgebase and tutorials. The user manual is available on the website and within the program. You can use MacKeeper on any OS X from Lion (10.7) up to El Capitan (10)."]},"id":"a0a91633-cc06-4233-b7aa-471a336f77f5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c9a1d49a-b559-45ae-aa0c-8a613f4efeb9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MacKeeper not only encrypts your files, it hides them.
