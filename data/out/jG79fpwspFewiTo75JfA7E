The company&#39;s overhead DVD players include built-in infrared transmitters and FM transmitters, which allow you to stream the audio from your movies in two different ways. You also get various inputs, remote controls and other helpful features.","The screen sizes on XO Vision&#39;s roof-mounted DVD players are 15 inches, which is large enough for everyone in the back seat to see the movie. The monitors swivel, so you can adjust the screen&#39;s angle to get a better view. These flip down DVD players include A/V input and output so you can plug in other media devices to watch movies or play video games. A USB port lets you connect your smartphone, and with an internet connection, you can stream movies while you travel.","The built-in IR transmitter that XO Vision includes in its overhead DVD players let you connect wireless headphones so passengers in the back can listen to and watch a movie without disturbing other passengers in the vehicle. Likewise, everyone can watch and listen if you use the FM transmitter to route the sound from the mobile entertainment system to your vehicle&#39;s speakers.","You get a remote control with each XO Vision flip down DVD player, which makes it easy for you to press play, rewind, fast-forward or pause, and you can change settings in menus with it. Each overhead DVD player includes dome lights, so when you install it, you don&#39;t have to worry about losing your factory-installed dome light.","These XO Vision overhead DVD players are streamlined in design so that they fit any vehicle&#39;s interior. As with any flip down DVD player, the monitors also flip up so they&#39;re out of the way.","An XO Vision flip down DVD player lets you play your favorite movies from your DVD collection while you&#39;re on the road. You can also use the A/V input and output to hook up other media devices and the USB port to connect your phone. All of these features in the XO Vision overhead DVD players can turn your minivan, SUV or RV into a moving entertainment system."]},"id":"5910a5dc-2d74-4085-b6c9-97145938bd93","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50601","url":"/xovision-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-31T14:26:46Z","datePublished":"2010-08-31T14:26:46Z","name":"XO Vision","synopsis":"XO Vision is an electronics manufacturer that specializes in car audio and video products, including flip down DVD players and monitors.","review":{"rating":67,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"XO Vision is an electronics manufacturer that specializes in car audio and video products, including flip down DVD players and monitors.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-08-31T14:26:46Z","id":"jG79fpwspFewiTo75JfA7E","meta":{"title":"XO Vision Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"XO Vision flip down DVD players offer a number of features in addition to the ability to play DVDs in your car.
