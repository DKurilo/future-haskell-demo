We assembled each grill, tested how quickly each preheats, the heat consistency and distribution. We also cooked dozens of pounds of burgers, steak, chicken and fish on each model. After all that testing, we recommend the <a href=\"/weber-spirit-review\">Weber Spirit II</a> as the best gas grill, the <a href=\"/char-broil-performance-review\">Char-Broil Performance</a> as the best infrared grill and the <a href=\"/cuisinart-review\">Cuisinart Griddler</a> as our top pick for an indoor electric grill. ","However, personal preferences matter: <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">propane</a>, <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared</a> and <a href=\"/best-indoor-electric-grills\">electric</a> all have different benefits and disadvantages. A propane grill is easier and less expensive than cooking over coals, but the tank needs to be refilled occasionally. Infrared grills heat up faster than gas grills and allow you to cook meat using powerful sear burners, but aren’t designed for low-temperature cooking for veggies or fish. Cooking on an indoor electric grill is fast and healthy, but you lose some of the tasty smoky flavor infused by other grills. Below are our top picks for each category."]},"id":"0bd350b9-fecc-4f3f-9855-db3df9a77fc3","type":"text"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Weber-Spirit-II.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/9/2/771446/original/Weber-Spirit-II.jpg","id":"Gj3hQUChbi7yLPk4ysBaKB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gj3hQUChbi7yLPk4ysBaKB.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"Weber Spirit II"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Weber-45010001-Black-Spirit-Grill/dp/B077JTCMKQ?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews-en_US_43_Review_4-20","urlStyle":"button","name":"Weber Spirit II","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Gas Grill"},"id":"703092d1-268a-4101-9c8e-5f676c5dd625","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Char-Broil-Performance.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/R/8/772100/original/Char-Broil-Performance.jpg","id":"BRpdrCv8eKYMsRvrk2GiTc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BRpdrCv8eKYMsRvrk2GiTc.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"Char-Broil Performance"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Char-Broil-Performance-TRU-Infrared-3-Burner-Cabinet/dp/B016ZIB8KG?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews-en_US_43_Review_4-20","urlStyle":"button","name":"Char-Broil Performance","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Infrared Grill"},"id":"b28b5918-03da-4603-a815-95a1cdf73c44","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Cuisinart-Griddler.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/9/1/771445/original/Cuisinart-Griddler.jpg","id":"oAyPLwh8U88Uy9C6D9aFVK","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oAyPLwh8U88Uy9C6D9aFVK.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"Cuisinart Griddler"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/221109/483085/8154?subId1=en_US_43_Review_4-default-campaign-rule&amp;subId2=TTRV-en_US_43_Review_4&amp;u=%TARGET_URL:URL%","urlStyle":"button","name":"Cuisinart Griddler","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Indoor Electric Grill"},"id":"51bc71ff-6252-474f-aac5-17e0b91c3c08","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"text":"Best Gas Grill"},"id":"22416584-5a4d-4ac1-a008-8dbf6646a18c","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/Gj3hQUChbi7yLPk4ysBaKB.jpg","link":{"href":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/weber-spirit-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/9/2/771446/original/Weber-Spirit-II.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gj3hQUChbi7yLPk4ysBaKB.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Gj3hQUChbi7yLPk4ysBaKB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gj3hQUChbi7yLPk4ysBaKB.jpg","alt":"Weber Spirit II"},"id":"69db0622-86e8-4a86-91b2-9c9fbdf78209","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Weber Spirit II\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":90,"url":"/weber-spirit-review","name":"Weber Spirit II","id":"157"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/weber-spirit-review\">Weber Spirit II</a>","pros":null,"cons":null},"id":"814ff192-3851-4422-933e-123597c9413a","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["","No other gas grill performed as well as the Weber Spirit II.
