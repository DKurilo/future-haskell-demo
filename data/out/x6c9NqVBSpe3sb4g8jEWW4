You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Weighing 1.54 pounds, this small sander is light and easy to use, but it still offers you many of the benefits of larger <a href=\"/best-belt-sanders\">belt sanders</a>. Its 1.25 amps may not seem like much, but it is powerful enough given its diminutive size. Another useful feature of this sander is that instead of sticking out, the motor is located flush on the left side, so you can more easily sand in corners. This unit is made out of fiber glass reinforced polyamide, which is a durable material.","This belt sander also comes with some fairly standard features found on comparable units. It comes with a hard-shell carrying case and a few additional grit sanding belts. The carrying case allows you to keep the tool safe during transport and when not in use. While this Proxxon sander has a belt release lever, compared to other sanders, the belts aren’t as easy to change.","Unlike most other units, this belt sander comes with a C-clamp. You can use this included clamp to hold the tool in place for stationary use. When using the stationary belt sander, your hands are free to sand smaller pieces of wood. Keep in mind that feature is specific to this model, and not all belt sanders are approved for stationary use.","Because this sander is so light, it is a good belt sander to use if you want to avoid handling heavier, more industrial-strength machinery. This model doesn’t require much strength to use, so you can lift and maneuver it easily. Its size also makes it easy to sand in extremely tight corners.","The Proxxon 38526 is one of the more expensive belt sander options. The unit is approved to be used as a stationary sander, and it comes with a C-clamp for this purpose. Because of its size, the sander is lightweight and easy to use. Its size also means it is suited for smaller, more delicate work, and it isn’t the best option for large projects."]},"id":"2ed61887-f414-4b9c-a112-00be3f2d7931","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61890","url":"/proxxon-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-24T16:59:10Z","datePublished":"2014-12-24T16:59:10Z","name":"Proxxon 38526 BBS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been has been discontinued.
