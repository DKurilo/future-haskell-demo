FGMV"},"id":"7f5ab319-6029-4a31-87a7-21533d5085c9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"text":"Introduction"},"id":"cb85151a-64e1-4ff2-a165-edcb8c5b5268","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<em>Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frigidaire Gallery FGMV175QF is a fairly standard model. It doesn&#39;t stand out in any way, but it includes basic features we look for in an <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">over the range microwave</a>, including sensor cooking and pre-programmed auto cycles.","This built-in microwave is average-size with an interior capacity of 1.7 cubic feet, though other models in the series have different capacities. It also includes a rack so you can double your cooking area. The appliance puts out 1,000 watts of power, which is typical for an over the range microwave, and it has nine adjustable power levels. Models in the Frigidaire Gallery series that offer convection cooking have slightly less power, but that is not unusual for convection microwave ovens. This is a quality model but if you would like to have convection capabilities in your microwave, consider the <a href=\"/kenmore-elite-review\">Kenmore Elite</a>.","Sensor cooking is common in the microwaves we reviewed, and it is a handy feature. Sensors determine how done your food is by measuring the amount of moisture in the air. If your item needs more cooking time, the microwave will automatically adjust it for you. This model has sensor options for proteins, veggies and rice as well as options for snacks like popcorn and chicken nuggets.","It also has auto-cook options that don&#39;t use sensors but that are preprogrammed for a number of different dishes. The auto-defrost will have your food thawed and ready to cook in a matter of minutes, and if you aren&#39;t ready to eat right away, the keep-warm option will ensure your food is warm and ready for up to 30 minutes. While the model we reviewed does not have convection capabilities, a few of the more expensive models in the Gallery series offer convection baking and roasting.","This microwave also includes other features that we like to see. The auto-start feature allows you to delay the start of your cooking. The child lock stops little hands from unauthorized cooking or altering settings. If you need to cook a large or heavy dish, the turntable turns off so it won&#39;t have to struggle under the weight of the dish.","Of course, one of the main reasons to buy an over the range microwave oven is to save space because it replaces a traditional range hood. If your kitchen allows for it, the ventilation moves air outside of your home. But if not, the vent will still filter and recirculate the air. The fan will automatically turn on if it senses too much heat, and it has two speeds and a clearing capacity that matches its competitors. The design of the hood is also nice, with two lights to provide ample illumination to your cooktop and a hidden vent, keeping the unattractive parts of your microwave out of sight.","The rest of the microwave is good looking, too. It comes in smudge-proof stainless steel or silver mist. Other models in the Gallery series have more color options, like black, white and beige. The keypad is simple and the buttons are flat, allowing you to easily clean messes left by sticky fingers.","The manufacturer offers a limited one-year warranty on both parts and labor. Unfortunately, there is no extended warranty on the magnetron, the main cooking component in your microwave. The website provides a phone number, an email address and live chat for customer service."]},"id":"a8acf59a-6572-475c-9268-a126057279cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b09dd4c5-ec18-4765-9d66-ea39138a8132","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Frigidaire Gallery FGMV175QF provides all of the expected features of an over the range microwave at a reasonable price.
