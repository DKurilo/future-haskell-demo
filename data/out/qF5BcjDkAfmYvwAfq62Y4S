Though the software isn&#39;t the most intuitive on our lineup, it comes with an artillery of guides, tutorials, FAQs and forum help, and it is stocked full of features to maximize your viewing experience.","If you have Windows, you can enjoy using this player for digital video formats and physical discs alike. Whether you use Windows Vista, 7, 8 or 10, the software is compatible to play a wide variety of video, audio, interactive and image formats, including standard and rewritable DVDs and Blu-ray discs.","During testing, we were impressed that this software can play videos on a computer using just 6 percent CPU consumption, making it convenient for multitasking while you watch videos. However, we did not find this application very intuitive or easy to use. Menus are not comfortably accessible or easy to navigate. We also dislike the player&#39;s dual-screen layout and button placement, as it looks a bit cluttered.","Despite these setbacks, the player has Dolby and DTS audio support as well as lossless audio playback, ensuring that you&#39;ll have outstanding audio to accompany your HD videos. Its playback smoothing prevents lag and buffering so you can get straight to watching your movie, and if you can&#39;t watch all of it in one sitting, the auto-resume playback feature remembers where you leave off and resumes playing from the same point once you&#39;re ready to watch again.","The built-in power manager works to conserve your laptop&#39;s battery while you watch videos, and the customizable skin option lets you personalize the player&#39;s look. For foreign movies, you can change the world region on the player multiple times and turn subtitles on.","You can upscale your videos from standard definition to HD while keeping both versions. If there is an important or funny part in a video you want to rewatch, the AB repeat function can loop it for you, and the digital zoom option lets you zoom in on important details. The smart stretching allows you to change the aspect ratio or customize it to fit your specific needs.","This movie player&#39;s software developer, Inmatrix LTD, has terrific technical support resources, including forums and a section on its website with diagrammed screenshots of various pages of the software, explaining what everything is and how it works. This makes the software easier to understand and use. It also has an extensive FAQ section on the site. This mostly makes up for the fact that the software is not the most intuitive player to use, and the guides can walk you through it. Should you need to contact Inmatrix directly, you can do so via an online form on its website. Inmatrix also allows free upgrades on the software."]},"id":"0748f3ff-cede-4bce-b1b2-45450a842572","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"468d1860-56cb-4f57-8e35-ea72860b75f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Zoom Player software is a good option for a video player that lets you multitask while you watch videos, and its multiple features and technical support options give you a nice movie-viewing experience.
