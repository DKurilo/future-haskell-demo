You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Solar Sun Rings solar <a href=\"/best-pool-heaters\">pool heater</a> is the perfect design if you prefer not to install heavy equipment that could increase your electric bill. These rings use the sun to increase the temperature of your swimming pool by several degrees and hold heat in once the pool begins to warm.","These Solar Sun Rings are clear flat inflatable disks that are designed to sit on top of your pool water. Each is equipped with magnets that hold the disks to one another. The magnets also work together to help decrease the hardness of your pool water. The disks have prisms that attract the rays of the sun and hold the heat in your pool water. This pool heater acts in much the same way as a solar blanket with the exception that you do not have to struggle with a large piece of material on top of your pool. You can use these disks with any type and size of swimming pool, whether it is in ground or above ground.","These disks run off the solar energy from the sun. They do not require any extra hookups, and you don&#39;t need to pay extra on your gas or electric bill. One issue with these sun panels is if you do not get a lot of sun where your pool sits, they are not going to work as efficiently as a traditional gas or electric pool heater. You also have to remove the rings each time you use the pool, and then they have to be put back on your pool once you get out of the water.","It is recommended that you purchase at least one Sun Ring for every 50 square feet of water surface area. A 10 x 20-foot swimming pool needs at least four Sun Rings for the most efficient use. Every Sun Ring that is in direct sunlight puts out around 1,070 Btu per square foot. For the best result, you should make sure the Sun Rings cover at least 70 to 80 percent of the surface water of your pool. The more empty space you allow, the more heat escapes.","The Solar Sun Rings swimming pool heater is not very efficient at heating your swimming pool water. If your pool tends to stay warm, the rings will keep the heat from escaping and may help raise the temperature of the water a few degrees. The Solar Sun Rings are an economical, environmentally-friendly option of heating an inground or above-ground pool. The <a href=\"/coates-review\">Coates Single Phase</a> will also heat both kinds of pools."]},"id":"d5697b3f-a425-4c72-8fbe-f08fc73220d0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66203","url":"/solar-sun-rings-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-14T21:20:28Z","datePublished":"2015-07-14T21:20:28Z","name":"Solar Sun Rings","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-14T21:20:28Z","id":"mGgTrx63rjfyJ3QzaAjicL","meta":{"title":"Solar Sun Rings Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Solar Sun Rings pool heater delivers heat through sustainable energy.
