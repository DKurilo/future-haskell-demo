The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about here.&#34;</em>","The Nokia Purity Pro <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Bluetooth headphones</a> are one of the few sets of headphones that take simplicity to heart. Branded by Monster, these headphones work beautifully wirelessly. These Nokia headphones have near-field communication technology, so if they are within a few feet of your music player, you can experience quality audio. The headphones&#39; design features operating keys for answering and ending calls and controlling your music.","The Purity Pro headphones have a standard frequency response, ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. This means these headphones let you experience professional studio sound. If you listen to a bass-heavy song with the volume turned up high, you will hear a slight distortion when the bass hits, but this shouldn&#39;t be a problem because the volume has to be higher than is safe for human ears. The over-ear design and soft cushions help filter out ambient noise, letting you focus on your tunes while shutting out any distractions.","The way you turn these headphones and their Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on is what sets the Purity Pro apart from other headphones. Unfolding the earphones turns the headphones and ANC on, which helps to conserve the battery life. Many headphones use ANC even on standby, which can quickly drain the battery life. The Purity Pro headphones turn this feature and the device off when you fold up the earphones. The only problem is that if you forget to fold the headphones up, the device will remain on.","The Purity Pro headphones will function for almost 24 hours on one battery charge, and that is with continuous listening. If you use the headphones to talk on the phone, you will get a little less than 10 hours of battery life. You can continue to listen to music and use the Purity Pros while you charge them. You will also find buttons on the sides that control the volume, answer and end calls, and skip songs. These Bluetooth stereo headphones are made of a polycarbonate plastic, making them long lasting and durable. They also come with a carrying case.","One problem we did notice is that some devices, phones and MP3 players, have difficulty pairing with the headphones. During our tests, some devices didn&#39;t pair or took several attempts. We did learn that some devices that wouldn&#39;t pair with these headphones use older Bluetooth technologies, which can be incompatible. Ask Nokia to make sure your device will work with the Purity Pro headphones before you purchase them.","You will find that Nokia offers quite a bit of information on its website regarding the Purity Pro headset. You can search through the FAQs and request help by email or phone, but since it is a large international company, you can experience longer-than-average wait times when you call."]},"id":"f18a6f8e-88fd-4eb9-976a-f7b831c7096b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9442ccbc-fb17-4b9c-a3c3-d24ad1e0844c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want professional-quality headphones and aren&#39;t worried about the price tag, consider the Purity Pro headphones by Nokia and Monster.
