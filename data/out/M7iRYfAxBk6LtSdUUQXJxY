The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-electric-fireplaces\">Electric Fireplaces</a> here.</em>","The Fire Sense 60757 has a lower Btu output than most of the best electric fireplaces on our lineup, and it isn&#39;t designed to heat a large living area like most units. It is a good option to consider if you&#39;re only looking for a small unit to heat a small room in your house.","This electric wall fireplace features two settings – low and high heat. The low heat setting draws 700 watts of power to operate, while the high heat setting draws 1,400 watts. Both are standard for an electric fireplace.","Although this unit has a Btu output of 4,600, which is slightly lower than the standard 5,000 or more, it is designed to only heat an area of up to 130 square feet. This is substantially lower than the majority of electric fireplaces with similar Btu outputs, which can heat up to 400 square feet.","The heat the fireplace creates is dispersed into the room with its built-in fan and out through the vent on the top. The fan helps the room heat more evenly, not just in the area surrounding the fireplace.","This electric fireplace has LED flames and includes both log and rock inserts, all of which make the fire look more real. Most units only come with logs or rocks, not both. Depending on what you want your fire to look like, you can insert both or just one or the other.","You can control all the functions on this wall-mounted electric fireplace with the included remote control. This makes it easy to operate the unit from anywhere in the room. Additionally, you can set the timer to keep the unit on for a certain amount of time so you won&#39;t forget to turn it off before you leave the house. And if the unit gets too hot, it shuts off automatically. This safety feature prevents it from overheating and causing any damage to your wall or starting a fire.","This unit doesn&#39;t have touchscreen controls, which makes it a little bit inconvenient if you don&#39;t use the remote control to turn it on and control the functions of the heat. Also, the control panel is on the side of the unit, rather than conveniently placed in the front, though this does mean it doesn&#39;t detract from the look.","You get the standard one-year warranty on this wall electric fireplace. You can contact the manufacturer for help by email, but it doesn&#39;t offer phone support, which makes it difficult to get any support quickly. It doesn&#39;t offer a live chat option on its website either, but you can reference the online manual and a list of FAQs online."]},"id":"898455fe-a5fe-4e2f-9543-3189d7f01bd4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5ccf1f96-ccef-4fde-8251-9dc37494795c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Fire Sense 60757 electric wall fireplace has some great features, but it&#39;s not designed to heat a very large area, so it&#39;s not a great unit to add to a living space of more than 130 square feet.
