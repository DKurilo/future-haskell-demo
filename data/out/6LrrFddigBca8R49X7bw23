Click here to see our current Top Ten </em><a href=\"/best-car-audio-systems\"><em>car stereos</em></a><em>.</em>","The Parrot Asteroid Classic has an impressive array of design features that help you make the most of this versatile car audio head unit. While this unit includes an auxiliary input and an impressive four USB ports, they are all located on the back. You are then required to find a way to connect your devices to the Parrot Asteroid Classic. You can drill holes or run cables through preexisting openings, but the whole installation can be frustrating and inconvenient. Despite the installation woes, having that many USB ports is a nice way to charge and control multiple devices at the same time.","The Parrot Asteroid Classic does not have a CD player, but it is Bluetooth enabled, which also helps make up for the fact that all of the ports are on the backside of the head unit. You can stream your music from your phone or make and receive calls. The Parrot Asteroid Classic comes with a separate microphone that you can position wherever you find most convenient. Not only can you take calls using the microphone, but you can also control your music by speech. When playing music from your devices, the Parrot Asteroid Classic only reads MP3, WMA and AAC files, which is only a problem if some of your files are rarer, like FLAC.","The Parrot Asteroid Classic is unique in that it has an App Market where you can purchase useful apps for driving, and it uses an Android operating system. The Asteroid Classic can connect to the internet, which is how you can use the installed apps, but you need to have a data plan and be able to tether your phone to the head unit or purchase the 3G USB dongle separately if you want to use any of those features.","Besides its sleek design and high definition 3.2-inch screen, another of the nice things about the faceplate is that it is detachable. Having a detachable faceplate is nice because it acts as a theft deterrent in that thieves are less likely to steal an incomplete unit. Only part of the faceplate comes off, the part with the buttons, and this is convenient because it is easy to conceal and carry around on your person. Also convenient is the fact that you can set up the Parrot Asteroid Classic so that it can be controlled from the steering wheel if you have a car with this feature.","Parrot offers a one-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects, and you can find both the phone number and email address for the company on the website. Also, an online user manual and quick-start guide can be found on the website, which could prove helpful if you lose your copy. These documents are even offered in several different languages. Each product support page also has its own FAQs page, which gives you more detailed answers to your common questions about the Parrot Asteroid Classic."]},"id":"ec75414d-3364-416f-9b5a-872e03828d14","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a3e6a975-c03e-4b56-9956-6dd7b20b61ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Parrot Asteroid Classic is a very cool looking in-dash receiver, but the fact that all the connections are in the back of the unit make for a frustrating and complicated install.
