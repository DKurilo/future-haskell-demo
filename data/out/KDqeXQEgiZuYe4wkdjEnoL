The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 </em><a href=\"/best-home-security-monitoring\"><em>Home Security Monitoring</em></a><em> services.</em>","AlarmForce is a company that caters to people who do not want to deal with their alarm monitoring systems on any technical level. It provides equipment that is customized for your home at no charge unless you break it – if you break it, you buy it, as the saying goes.","Normally, companies that offer free systems charge more for monthly monitoring services, but that is not the case here. The reason for the company’s low prices is you do not actually own the security devices. When you stop your home security monitoring service with AlarmForce, the system goes with it.","This home security monitoring company says that owning the system yourself is of no value; however, that is not exactly true. Security systems are still somewhat useful without a monitoring service. When you own the system, you get to keep the yard sign and the stickers in your windows. That is your first line of defense. A home without these markings is more likely to attract intruders than one that does.","The second line of defense is the siren that goes off when an intruder attempts to enter the home. Intruders commonly panic and leave when they hear an alarm. The monitoring service is the third line of defense. So does owning the security equipment really have no value? We disagree. Not owning the system does mean you pay a lot less money. If you are planning to stick with your monitoring service, AlarmForce is a good way to go.","The security monitoring system itself is manufactured, installed and maintained by AlarmForce. Occasionally, the company can use an existing system in your house if you have one, but generally, it favors installing its own system. It even has most sensors that other companies offer. The only sensors we couldn&#39;t find through this service are recessed door sensors and garage door sensors.","AlarmForce now lets you connect remotely to your home security monitoring system through an app on your cell phone. This access allows you to adjust settings and even remotely turn your alarm system on and off.  You also can make use of add-on features such as smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, temperature sensors, flood detectors and glass break sensors. However, you do not get alerts for natural gas leaks or power failures.","There is one unique feature that AlarmForce offers separately that no other company we reviewed does, and it&#39;s called VideoRelay. The VideoRelay system is a combination of a video surveillance camera and a two-way voice system. You place it above your front door so you can see and talk with anyone who comes to the door without stopping what you are doing. This is done through an app on your cell phone."]},"id":"8ccb1351-223f-42a7-b404-cd4155560f38","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"59e0ea40-7ce4-4e20-bc68-4c6482182996","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although AlarmForce offers the basics at a very affordable price and it has its intuitive VideoRelay system, the company lacks in enough areas to leave it a runner-up to the leading home security monitoring companies.
