In fact, it produced a better image at 10 feet than any other home surveillance system we tested, including the top nighttime performer, <a href=\"/swann-review\">Swann</a>. Close to the camera and at 30 feet, though, the image quality was among the lowest in our review. There was noise in the video that obscured some of the details, but this is standard among home surveillance cameras.","The Arlo captured important facial features in total darkness up to 20 feet from the camera, which is a very good result. The system did well considering it has about a third as many infrared LEDs as the home surveillance systems with the best nighttime video. With fewer LEDs, though, the Arlo&#39;s video can be quite dim at times.","Since the Arlo camera is wireless, it&#39;s very easy to install. You still need to connect the base station&#39;s power adapter and use an Ethernet cable to connect it to your router, but this is simple. The camera is weatherproof so you can mount it indoors or outdoors up to 300 feet from the base station.","The camera attaches to the mounting hardware or most metal surfaces magnetically, which is unique in our review. The mobile app is easy to use as well, but it took up more space on our test smartphone than any other in our tests. This is why it scored lower than our other wireless home surveillance camera in usability."]},"id":"7f2912ca-4b99-4ee8-b136-589457ebecc3","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/2eSHBYdFUVuNgUSfuQSUa.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68977-arlo4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2eSHBYdFUVuNgUSfuQSUa.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"2eSHBYdFUVuNgUSfuQSUa","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2eSHBYdFUVuNgUSfuQSUa.jpg","alt":""},"id":"309fa57a-6b92-4941-859b-91a399ec5d1a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This system records your video to a cloud-based server that stores clips for up to seven days before deleting them.
