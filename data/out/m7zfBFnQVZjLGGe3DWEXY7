While it isn&#39;t as smooth as the <a href=\"/snagit-review\">best products we reviewed</a>, it still offers a number of tools and resources to help you make good-looking final products. Overall, HyperSnap takes care of your screen capturing needs, albeit in a less glossy and dated looking program.","This screenshot software offers a full slate of capture options. You can take menu and scrolling captures, as well as snapshots of games and specific objects. These images can be captured in a variety of shapes, though there isn’t an option for polygons. The program also has a freehand capture option, so you can draw a line around an image in any free-flowing shape you may need. HyperSnap is capable of taking screenshots of a region, active window or full screen. The program cannot record video of your screen, so if you want a program to create training videos, YouTube clips or screen recordings in general, this isn’t the program for you.","HyperSnap has an editing toolbar full of tools to enhance and alter the screenshots you capture. There are digital editing tools to add lines, arrows and text. You can also resize, flip, rotate, erase, alter colors and crop images. This screenshot software has special effect tools that shear images, make mosaics, emboss, sharpen or blur, and add shadows and frames. You can change resolutions and invert colors, as well as create halftones, grayscales, and black and white images.","HyperSnap is one of the easiest programs to install. It takes only a few moments, the installation wizard is brief and effective, and the software doesn’t try to install additional bloatware. The program’s on-screen interface is quite antiquated, but it’s effective and intuitive, so you can start editing images immediately.","You can export your images to 12 of the most popular file formats. Including JPG, BMP, PDF and GIF. This is above average among the products we reviewed. Some programs offer as few as four options, so HyperSnap delivers in this regard.","One of the things you’ll notice immediately about HyperSnap is that it’s interface seems antiquated and out of date. If you don’t mind aesthetics, this won’t be a problem. But many people will feel like they’re stuck 15 years in the past.","HyperSnap offers a full list of FAQs to help you troubleshoot and answer questions you may have. If you can&#39;t find your answer, customer support representatives are available to respond to email queries. They responded the same day to emails we sent. There are also tutorials and an online forum with questions and answers posted by users. Phone support is not offered.","HyperSnap is solid screen capture software that meets most needs. It&#39;s not as fancy as our top products, but it&#39;s effective when it comes to capturing images. With a number of capturing and editing tools, you can create projects like insightful papers and step-by-step training manuals. HyperSnap is a solid tool for anyone who wants efficient, easy-to-use screenshot software, but isn&#39;t concerned with application aesthetics or making videos."]},"id":"081eec45-337c-4da4-a638-ca12e80ac0b5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1055","url":"/hypersnap-dx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
