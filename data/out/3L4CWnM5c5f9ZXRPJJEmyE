The control panel also has a convenient timer that you can set to run immediately or up to four hours in the future.","The effective rate of coverage does differ in relation to the room’s size and the speed you’ve set the purifier at. The lower the setting, the larger the area the air purifier can cover, but a large area means fewer air changes per hour rate. For example, at two air changes per hour, the BioGS can cover 600 sq. ft. At four air changes per hour, the BioGS can only cover 300 sq. ft. For normal household use, any of the five fan settings would be sufficient, but depending on how often you want your room’s air to rotate, you’ll want to test which setting works best for you.
