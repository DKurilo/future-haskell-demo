The Poulan Pro PP428S straight-shaft weed whacker is one of the latest pieces of equipment in this venerable lineup. This weed eater boasts good design features and compatibility with a wide range of accessories.","The Poulan Pro PP428S gas trimmer is easy to use thanks to its large 28 cc, four-cycle engine. The engine on this grass trimmer doesn&#39;t require an oil and gasoline mix like two-cycle engines do. This allows you to use pure gasoline in the 16.9-ounce fuel tank.","You can use the bump-feed mechanism to advance new trimmer line with a simple tap on the ground after the old line wears away. This yard trimmer has a 17-inch cutting width to help you clear your yard of bothersome weeds. The trimmer head comes with a debris shield to protect you from flying bits of grass and weeds, but you&#39;ll still want to wear safety goggles. To improve handling, this weed trimmer comes with a trigger control, an adjustable handle and an easy-start pull cord. This machine does not have an anti-vibration function to reduce muscle stress.","The Poulan Pro PP428S is designed to work with a variety of Pro-Link attachments. You can purchase these additional attachments to accomplish other lawn care tasks, such as edging, trimming hedges, pruning trees, cultivating flower gardens and blowing grass clippings off the sidewalk. For larger properties with heavy brush and weeds, you can also get a brush cutter attachment. A shoulder strap is available for this unit as well.","Poulan Pro&#39;s technical support is not as strong as its other categories. The PP428S comes with a two-year warranty, but it lacks any warranty that protects the driveshaft beyond this time frame. If you&#39;re having problems, you can take the gas trimmer into a nearby service center. Hold on to the manual that comes with this unit, as we were unable to access the online manual due to a broken link. You can reach Poulan Pro support by telephone, but the company doesn&#39;t provide email support."]},"id":"884620ad-aab0-4e94-a5b0-7899d14191b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6103f9b2-e76f-4b14-82d3-0c2e15e92ce8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Poulan Pro PP428S four-cycle gas trimmer has a great design that allows you to accomplish a variety of tasks.
