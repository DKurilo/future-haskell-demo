You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you want to look great while you work out, the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness tracker</a> to wear is the Misfit Shine. Just like your running shoes or your favorite pair of sweats, the Shine is comfortable and easy to wear. Unlike your yoga pants or sweatband though, the Shine is smart and actively tracks your exercise.","The best fitness trackers have some of the same characteristics including step counter, distance traveled and calories burned. The Misfit Shine has all of these features plus a few others such as exercise duration and a sleep monitor to determine the quality of your sleep. Although this device does a great job at tracking your sleep habits and exercise, we found that it isn&#39;t completely accurate. Steps and calories burned are over-exaggerated, and the Shine doesn&#39;t have a heart rate monitor to track your target heart rate zones.","The single best quality of the Shine is its stylish design. This super comfortable device is about the size of a quarter and it has interchangeable styles. You can choose from eight different colors and it&#39;s waterproof so you can wear it to swim, too. You can wear it on your wrist, in a pocket, as a necklace and more. During our fitness tracker review, the Shine was the lightest device and it&#39;s so discreet, you can easily forget you&#39;re wearing it. Most of the best fitness devices have long battery lives, and the Shine lasts for four months before you need to replace it.","This personal fitness device doesn’t have a screen, but the light indicators work both as a clock and as a progress indicator. By tapping the device, you can see a clock, then the amount of progress you&#39;ve completed. If all of the lights are on, you&#39;ve met your daily activity goal. If only half the lights light up, you&#39;ll need to keep walking or add in extra exercise to your routine. Sometimes, however, you have to tap the screen multiple times before it will light up. Wearing it a certain way against your arm seems to be the best way to access the interface.","To sync your device with the accompanying app, the screen prompts you to tap. From there, the device can wirelessly upload your data. You can see your sleep patterns, record your weight, share data with Facebook and see your exercise score for the day. The information isn’t as comprehensive as other programs, but you can see steps, calories and miles for each day. The app is compatible with both iPhone and Android phones but you can’t set up an online account or link to other fitness apps, unfortunately.","The Shine has a surprisingly short warranty of only 60 days, but since it is well built you hopefully won&#39;t have to utilize the warranty. Misfit doesn&#39;t offer phone support, but we found the email support to be more than adequate. The support staff quickly helped with a syncing issue on our end and all problems were resolved. FAQs and instructions are also available on the website for extra help as well."]},"id":"9c7b2cf7-a0ab-4c4e-b5e7-6e698907a36e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cde6d0fb-1692-4386-a28c-4900b9bb18d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Misfit Shine is one of the best activity trackers for its sleek design and easy-to-use nature.
