The original review is below, but check out our current top</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-navigation-gps\"><em>Navigation GPS</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Garmin Nuvi 58LMT is a car GPS with preloaded maps of the United States and Canada. It features a 5-inch color display that can be set in landscape or portrait orientation. While it doesn&#39;t have any premium features, like Bluetooth or a capacitive touch screen, it does have all the essential features you need to begin navigating.","The Nuvi 58LMT&#39;s best feature is its lifetime map updates. You can download fresh maps onto the device from Garmin&#39;s website at no additional cost whenever you want to. If you know you&#39;ll keep the GPS for a couple years, it&#39;s best to buy a model like the Nuvi 58LMT that has lifetime map updates.","Because the Nuvi 58LMT has a built-in traffic receiver, you won&#39;t have to use your smartphone to check the traffic. You can do it directly from the unit. This is Garmin&#39;s basic traffic service, so it updates conditions every five minutes instead of every 30 seconds like Garmin&#39;s deluxe traffic service.","Like the rest of the Nuvi line, the 58LMT has 10 million points of interest. Out of the three major GPS brands, Garmin currently offers the most points of interest. This means you&#39;ll have a good chance of finding the hotels, restaurants or gas station that you&#39;re looking for.","Because the device can be oriented either vertically or horizontally, you can mount the 58LMT in your vehicle in the way that seems the least intrusive. It has a two-hour battery life, so if you want to unplug to charge another device, you can still get directions.","The 58LMT doesn&#39;t have the premium features boasted by the best navigation GPS units. It lacks voice-activated navigation, which is one of the most practical features a premium GPS has. The 58LMT doesn&#39;t have any Bluetooth-enabled features either, such as speakerphone functionality.","This GPS unit has a resistive touchscreen, not capacitive. Resistive screens are less responsive than capacitive touchscreens and can&#39;t pinch to zoom."]},"id":"ca5f97de-22c5-4819-a4b7-4be3b35150aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"101625bb-ba20-4ee9-ab47-1a586c66f5bb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Garmin Nuvi 58LMT is not for the driver who wants every convenience, but it does offer lifetime maps updates, a time-tested design and free traffic updates.
