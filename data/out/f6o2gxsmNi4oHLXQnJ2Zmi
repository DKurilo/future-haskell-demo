The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-wireless-routers\">Wireless Routers</a> here.</em>","The Buffalo AirStation Extreme is a modern, dual-band wireless router that offers some of the latest technology in home wireless networking. Plus, it has a convenient design that allows it to be set up in several different configurations.","Premium wireless routers typically come in two physical designs: vertical or horizontal. They both have benefits; horizontal designs mean you can place the router on a shelf or in a cabinet, while the vertical designs make for a smaller footprint. The AirStation Extreme comes with a stand that allows you to place your router in both configurations so that you can choose the set up that suits you best.","Like the best wireless routers, this router is a dual-band device, meaning that it can broadcast on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. The 2.4GHz band offers support for all of your older devices that don&#39;t have the hardware to support the new 802.11ac standard. The 5GHz band, on the other hand, serves devices that are compatible with 802.11ac and provides the fastest speeds possible.","Setup is quick and easy. The included set-up guide helps you attach all the cables properly when connecting to the default wireless network via Windows or Mac.","Once you&#39;re connected, programming things like parental controls and web filtering is straightforward. You can block sites containing phishing scams, malware or do a total lockdown of anything containing content that you don’t want to be accessible on your network. Despite these features, there&#39;s no option for setting up a VPN or a guest network with this router.","Buffalo backs the AirStation with one of the best warranties in the premium wireless routers market: a two-year limited warranty and lifetime 24/7 technical support. The Buffalo support website contains a knowledgebase, user forums and downloads for software, drivers and documentation.","The Buffalo AirStation Extreme offers the latest technology for the fastest 5HGz speeds, solid security and parental settings, as well as a versatile design. It lacks a few small features like VPN support or a guest network, but overall it&#39;s a good choice for a premium wireless router."]},"id":"34229475-c9b3-49a6-b0a4-46fee962b755","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69359","url":"/buffalo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-24T16:10:41Z","datePublished":"2017-05-24T16:10:41Z","name":"Buffalo AirStation Extreme","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":43,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-05-24T16:10:41Z","id":"f6o2gxsmNi4oHLXQnJ2Zmi","meta":{"title":"Buffalo AirStation Extreme Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Buffalo AirStation Extreme is a premium wireless router with a versatile design and solid performance.
