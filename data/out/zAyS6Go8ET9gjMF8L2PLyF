You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Zoom 5345 <a href=\"/best-cable-modems\">cable modem</a> is compatible with all the cable internet providers that use the DOCSIS standard. This includes four of the largest cable companies in the U.S.: Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Bright House and Cox. This modem costs less than $50, so your investment pays dividends after only six months of ownership.","Its eight downstream channels offer a theoretical download speed of 343 Mbps, and the four upstream data channels give you 123 Mbps upload speeds. The 8 x 4 channel bonding and fast speeds make the Zoom 5345 a good choice for casual internet use and downloading medium and small files. If you need a high-speed modem, check out the <a href=\"/motorola-mb7420-review\">Motorola MB7420</a>.","The housing’s vertical-standing design is slim enough to fit nicely next to a computer screen or in tight spaces where your cable is installed. Zoom did well putting the coaxial connection at the bottom of the vertical housing – modems with the coaxial connection near the top, like the <a href=\"/netgear-cm500-review\">Netgear CM500</a>, are far more likely to fall over because of the weight of the cable.","There are five status indicator LEDs on the front panel of the housing. They alert you of the power, internet connection and Ethernet link status, as well as if information is downloading or uploading. If the upstream (US) and downstream (DS) lights are blue, the modem is bonded with more than one channel.","The back panel features a Gigabit Ethernet port to connect the modem to your computer or router. Zoom also includes a power switch and reset button, so you don’t have to disconnect the power supply every time you need to reset the modem.","Zoom offers a two-year manufacturer warranty, so your modem investment could save you as much as $190 during the warranty term. You can contact Zoom by phone or email if you have questions about connecting your modem to your network. The support section on the company’s website has troubleshooting tips as well as firmware and driver downloads.","The Zoom 5345 cable modem costs less than $50 and is compatible with all the major cable internet providers. The two-year warranty ensures your investment is covered, and it happens to be the longest warranty term offered by a modem manufacturer."]},"id":"c1477da7-076f-442f-a642-8efcee1d6b23","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66023","url":"/zoom-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-01T19:59:55Z","datePublished":"2015-07-01T19:59:55Z","name":"Zoom 5345","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":23,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","id":"zAyS6Go8ET9gjMF8L2PLyF","meta":{"title":"Zoom 5345 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Zoom 5345 is a great low-cost option for replacing the rental modem supplied by your cable internet service provider.
