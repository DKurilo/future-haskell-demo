The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about Tower Fans <a href=\"/best-tower-fans\">here</a>.</em>","The Air King 9215 is an affordable tower fan with a wide, stable base that is best suited to function in a casual environment. While the plastic casing on the Air King 9215 is manufactured to be impact resistant, it is not as strong as our top-ranked tower fans. This can be deceptive as this tower fan produces a strong, breezy airflow that can cool your room quickly.","The Air King 9215 runs quietly, emitting only a low hum of 33 to 45 dBA, depending on the speed setting you choose. The push-button controls are easily reached on the crest of the device, allowing you to choose from three speed settings: continuous, natural or soothing sleep. You can lock the fan in place or allow it to oscillate at a full 90-degree range.","Like other affordable tower fans, the Air King 9215 features a programmable timer that allows you to choose any time length between a half hour and seven and a half hours for the fan to blow. This enables you to have cool air blowing when you need it most without the worry of forgetting to turn off the fan. An easy-to-use, multi-function remote control is included with this fan as well. There is no built-in storage for the remote, so you will need to keep track of it.","The Air King 9215 measures 40 inches high, 12.5 inches wide and just more than 12 inches deep. It weighs 12 pounds and doesn&#39;t take much effort to move, but the Air King 9215 lacks a built-in carrying handle to make repositioning easier. While this tower fan is a convenient size, it is not Energy Star compliant, which means it won&#39;t save you any money on your electric bill.","Air King offers a standard one-year warranty with the 9215, and if you ever have problems, you can call or email their support team. There&#39;s no live chat assistance available if you need an immediate response. The company does not offer a downloadable owner&#39;s manual, so if you happen to misplace yours, you have to contact customer service or search online to find a copy."]},"id":"e828edc8-1e10-4bae-abbe-f6108f4fda05","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2d680574-de6a-4c97-9753-e868984fb8f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While not as sturdy as our top ranked fans, the Air King 9215 is a good alternative if you are on a budget.
