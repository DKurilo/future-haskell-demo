InDesign’s new Content-Aware Fit tool helps designers by automatically resizing and fitting images within frames. It does this using Adobe Sensei technology, which identifies an image&#39;s main focus so it can maintain it while intelligently placing the image in any frame.","Another new, extraordinary feature is the Layout Adjustment tool. Say you’ve been working with an 8.5 x 11-inch template and you’ve been told you need to change it to a 10 x 10-inch template. Layout Adjustment automatically makes changes throughout your document to match the new template size. It can re-adjust images, text and other formatting. You definitely have to tweak things a bit to get everything to look just right, but this new feature is a huge time-saver.","We also loved the new Global Editing feature, which allows you to make changes to like elements at the same time. For example, say you have a logo dappling your document. Using Global Editing, you can make color, shape or stroke changes to one logo and the changes will show up on all the similar logos throughout the document.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>"]},"id":"09f4bd71-c676-4137-936a-5f0a38a57624","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/sXUJ4UsYkxfCYweLKws6JR.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69449-indesign29.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sXUJ4UsYkxfCYweLKws6JR.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"sXUJ4UsYkxfCYweLKws6JR","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sXUJ4UsYkxfCYweLKws6JR.jpg","alt":""},"id":"10c6344b-cf1b-4f54-9985-180bf4439a5d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of the best things about using any Adobe product is the amount of support available to you.
