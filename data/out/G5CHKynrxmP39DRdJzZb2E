You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE 30522 line of <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phones</a> is a basic but all-around functional product that can add convenience to your home or small business by saving you from having to hustle from one room to another to answer each time a phone rings.","The 30522 line is also attractive with black-and-silver designs, a deep-turquoise background on the LCD screens that feature black letters and numbers, as well as good-sized buttons with funky turquoise numbers.","Of this GE line, the GE 30522EE4 is a useful version that comes with three extra handsets along with the handset that accompanies the base. You can add one extra handset to this phone&#39;s base station if you choose.","For a modestly priced cordless phone system, this model presents some good features.","It lacks Bluetooth capability, unfortunately, so that might be problematic for people who love to switch easily back and forth from cell to landline phones. However, you do get a healthy 10 hours of talk time with this phone, which is quite good in the cordless phone industry.","However, you do get the DECT 6.0 technology that ensures great sound quality, so making or receiving calls should be a pleasure.","You also get 20 minutes of recorded messages, which is a feature often found on higher-end cordless phones and will go a long way in helping you keep track of who called, who needs a call back and who can be ignored.","There are speakerphones on each of the handsets, and you can program them so you have certain times when the phones will not ring. That way, you are assured of a regular, peaceful nap time for your infant, a good night&#39;s sleep for yourself or uninterrupted time to read, meditate, practice a musical instrument or have a heart-to-heart talk with someone you love.","The GE 30522EE4 comes with conferencing capabilities, an alarm, headset jack and an intercom function. Its phonebook holds up to 100 items – again, a generous number – while the caller ID can handle 50 items. The redial capability is 10."]},"id":"13235418-8bc0-4fb7-8237-ea35665a8df5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1fe71c9a-25f0-430b-a944-738b9f5ff03c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although this home phone cannot be connected to your cell phone and lacks of the glossy features of high-end models, the GE 30522EE4 can work nicely in your office or home."]},"id":"8280de2e-1e58-49a4-9ef6-baf6c50836cd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57664","url":"/ge-30522-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-02T13:52:05Z","datePublished":"2013-10-02T13:52:05Z","name":"GE 30522 EE4","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits into our top ten lineup.","review":{"verdict":"This is a helpful cordless phone with basic functionality that does not provide every extra in the book, but still offers enough features to make it worth a good look.","pros":["You get 10 hours of talk time."],"cons":["You can add only one extra handset to the GE 30522EE4 model, for a total of five."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits into our top ten lineup.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-02T13:52:05Z","id":"G5CHKynrxmP39DRdJzZb2E","meta":{"title":"GE 30522 EE4 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The GE 30522 cordless phone offers 10 hours of talk time, four handsets and a 100-entry phonebook.
