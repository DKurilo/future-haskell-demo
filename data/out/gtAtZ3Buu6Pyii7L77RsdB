You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sony STR-DH Series <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a> are non-networked devices, which means you will not be able to connect your home theater to the internet via these receivers. They intend to provide a quality product without network features, which you may not want or need. Plus, you likely won&#39;t miss the networking features if your media players and TV have them instead. The sound quality, decent amount of ports and high-resolution video features make this a great choice for the home theater. Couple these things with excellent product support and you get a good receiver that won&#39;t bust your budget.","The Sony STR-DH740 has decent sound quality, although it is not the best due to some audible distortion; however, this distortion is only present at high volume levels you may never use. The frequency response and signal-to-noise ratio make up for the distortion and give you a sound quality more than sufficient for a basic home theater. The 7.2-channel surround sound has power to spare with a 145-watt peak power output and 90 watts of continuous power.","The STR-DH740 has a useful amount of ports, though not as many as other receivers. Four HDMI inputs and one HDMI output with an audio return channel provide enough expansion options for most setups. The receiver comes with a front USB port to connect digital media devices such as MP3 players, flash media and iPods. There are some legacy ports for component, composite, optical and coaxial connections. Other essential ports hook up to headphones, AM/FM antennas and the setup microphone that calibrates your speakers.","This digital receiver has 21st century video technology and features support for 1080p video scaling, 3D video and 4K Ultra HD. The unit also comes with an equalizer and dynamic volume to preserve the audio fidelity of your music and movies. There is no multi-room speaker support for the Sony STR-DH740.","Technical support by Sony is a great value. You can call or email the support staff and look up the user guide and FAQs on the company&#39;s website. This receiver comes with a two-year warranty that covers parts and labor. The support staff responded quickly to questions we had during our review."]},"id":"f5e88feb-4117-4ade-bb95-86c689b6ef49","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e1bdef12-eb0d-403c-a912-6b5e0e9be557","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony STR-DH740 home theater receiver is a great alternative to more expensive networked receivers. The good quality sound and high-resolution video are more than enough to keep you satisfied with this unit. The ports and features are limited, but they are also extremely useful.
