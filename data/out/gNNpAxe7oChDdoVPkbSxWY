You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hansgrohe Croma <a href=\"/best-handheld-showerheads\">3-Jet Hand Shower</a> has clean lines, an array of useful functions. The showerhead itself is 4 inches wide, which provides all-over coverage when you take your shower. The head has a smooth finish and the angled design makes it much easier to reach all areas of your body without a struggle. You can place the detachable showerhead in its cradle if you prefer to use it like a standard showerhead, or you can remove it and use it to rinse your hair or massage your body. At full 63 inches long, the hose reaches throughout your bath easily.","The spray settings on Hansgrohe Croma 3-Jet Hand Shower includes the full spray, a pulsating massage or the intense turbo. If you prefer a relaxing shower, the full spray mimics the feel of a rain shower. The pulsating massage can work out some of the kinks you may have after a workout or injury, and the intense turbo is ideal if you prefer an invigorating rinse. This is a smaller number of spray settings compared to comparable models, some of which have seven or more.","Although there are five separate settings, there are actually three primary settings and two combination settings. The full spray allows water to shoot through the largest holes in the showerhead. The mist gives you the feeling of a waterfall shower because it encompasses such a large area. Finally, the pulsing massage works specifically where you point the stream.","Cleaning is easy with the showerhead&#39;s anti-limescale function. Not only can mineral buildup damage parts and cause rust and corrosion, it can also limit the flow of water and impede your shower. The Hansgrohe handheld showerhead is designed from a special material that does not allow as much mineral buildup to develop as other showerheads may.","All showerheads sold in the United States must have a water flow of a maximum of 2.5 gallons per minute. The Hansgrohe water-saving showerhead caps out at 2.2 gallons per minute, which can save you money on your monthly water bill. While this can save you money, you may also feel as though the water pressure is too low in your shower.","The Hansgrohe Croma 3-Jet Hand Shower is a typical handheld showerhead for its price range. This head can save you money by reducing the amount of water you use when you shower, and it is easy to clean since it naturally protects against mineral buildup."]},"id":"df3c84dc-9c14-4346-97ee-fa17af7066ff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62905","url":"/hansgrohe-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-19T22:32:57Z","datePublished":"2015-02-19T22:32:57Z","name":"Hansgrohe Croma 3-Jet Hand Shower","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-19T22:32:57Z","id":"gNNpAxe7oChDdoVPkbSxWY","meta":{"title":"Hansgrohe Croma 3-Jet Hand Shower Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Hansgrohe.
