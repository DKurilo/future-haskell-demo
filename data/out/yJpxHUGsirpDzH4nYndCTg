The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-treadmills\"><em>Treadmills</em></a><em> here.</em>","SportsArt is a premium treadmill manufacturer with a history of excellence and quality. The only reason the SportsArt Performance T611 ranks so low on our lineup is that it lacks the extras of our higher-ranked treadmills for the price you pay. Aside from that, this is a quality treadmill with near-commercial quality. The warranty and technical support are well equipped to protect your investment in this product.","The SportsArt Performance T611 is a performance machine built for endurance training. This treadmill has a 3.0-horsepower motor that propels the tread surface up to 12 mph. The treadmill can achieve up to a 15 percent incline, which can help reduce impact on your joints. The maximum user weight is rated at 400 pounds, which is above average for most treadmills.","With the T611, you have a choice of 12 workout programs. The selection of programs has several notable modes such as glutes, hill, weight loss, random and much more. The random program in particular gives you 10,000 variations, which can keep you busy for decades if you only do one program a day. The speed and incline controls are low on the console, which makes them easy to use as you run. The best thing about this motorized treadmill is the MyFlex cushioning. This cushioning is luxurious and far more comfortable than that of any other treadmill we reviewed.","This treadmill has a QuikFold design that allows you to store the deck when not in use. This saves space and prevents damage to the deck. If you want to add a television or speakers to the treadmill, you can purchase an entertainment bracket, but you&#39;ll also have to provide your own tech. This is great if you have a spare TV lying around the house, but can be yet another expense if you don&#39;t.","The lifetime warranty on the frame and motor reflects the quality of this product. This folding treadmill guarantees parts for 10 years and electronics for five. All labor on this unit carries a 1-year warranty. SportsArt Fitness has product support that you can contact by phone or email. If you wish to download a PDF user manual or learn how to maintain your treadmill, simply visit the SportsArt customer service center online. SportsArt doesn&#39;t have a live chat support option."]},"id":"06176bb5-3343-46f8-ace1-4f3be273e165","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97ece0d6-8aae-4aea-ab2e-3a3ea647b521","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This SportsArt treadmill is a premium product with quality construction and operation.
