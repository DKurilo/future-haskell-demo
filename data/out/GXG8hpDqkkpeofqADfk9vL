Most small air filters do not have the effective filtration capabilities you need if you have allergies. The Blueair 450E is the best portable air purifier, thanks to its compact size and impressive functionality. It is a great air purifier for mid-size rooms, and its power places it in a filtration class equal to many large-room filters. It is a quiet machine that will help you reduce the pollen and odors from your mid-size rooms.","The Blueair 450E uses two types of filters: the SmokeStop filter and the particle filter. The SmokeStop filters gases and reduces odors. It is a sophisticated filter and costs more than the particle filter, which focuses on particulates like pollen and dust. No matter which filter you choose, one of the 450E&#39;s flaws is its reliance on its ionizer. To fully clean the air, the 450E electromagnetically charges the filtered particles and sends them back into the air. In the second pass through the filter, the charged particles stick to the filter. Although most ionizers emit ozone, the 450E is certified by the California Air Resources Board for low to no ozone emissions.","The Blueair meets all of the third-party requirements we looked for, including HEPA requirements, Energy Star verification and Edison Testing Laboratories listing. The 450E also comes with excellent bonuses, including a sleep mode after scheduled operation and a remote control. Unfortunately, this air filter lacks an air-quality monitor to help manage fan speeds and a pre-filter to capture large particles.","Blueair offers a five-year warranty on the 450E. This warranty covers repairs and replacements if the air purifier is defective. Blueair&#39;s website has a wide range of articles, a good FAQs page and downloadable user manuals. If you need to contact customer support representatives, Blueair provides telephone, email and live chat options."]},"id":"d978d75e-6ccf-420e-a2c8-12d10a43a1a7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8cccb82c-a385-4e93-9ba4-ad4e55188c7d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Blueair 450E is an excellent portable air purifier.
