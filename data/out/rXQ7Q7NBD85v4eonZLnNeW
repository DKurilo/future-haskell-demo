This stovetop range is sturdy and reliable, bringing liquids to boil rapidly and using a dual-bake element to bake your pies, cakes and casseroles perfectly.","There are four coil burners located on the cooktop, two 6-inch and two 8-inch. The 8-inch burners are designed to use up to 2,600 watts of power to heat your pots and pans quickly, reducing the wait time for boiling. The stovetop is easy to wipe down, and the chrome bowls under the burners are removable so you can scrub them out. The top of the range lifts up as well, allowing you to clean up boil-over spills and crumbs.","There GE JB250 has many convenient settings, including a delay-bake function and a control-lock option. The delay bake is handy if you have a dish prepared ahead of time, and want to come home to a warm meal. With this function, you can set a temperature and a time and the oven will turn on and cook the meal.","The control lock allows you to keep anyone, especially children from altering or changing any of the cooking range functions, including the timer and oven temperature. Unfortunately, the GE JB250 does not include a keep-warm function, which is found on the best electric stoves.","If you cook for a large family or group regularly, you will enjoy the 5.3-cubic-foot oven capacity. You can place multiple dishes in the oven without worrying about setting them on each other. You can comfortably fit two standard-size cookie sheets next to each other, and your Thanksgiving turkey or special roast will have no problem fitting in.","The oven comes with two racks and six levels to place them on. These variable levels help with proper baking as you don&#39;t want your food to be to close and burn or be too far away and undercook. You can check on the status of your dishes as they cook without opening the door by turning on the interior oven light and looking through the large screen. This oven uses the heating elements on both the bottom and the top of the oven to provide an even bake. This dual-element approach is not common and allows you to have more control over your baking results."]},"id":"5e45e9ab-98e9-4f9c-bbaa-994c6c1f2c7c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8672b9f0-3003-45c7-8387-80a2b8d6f368","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE JB250 is a great electric range for cooks who need to feed a larger crowd and want better control over the temperature.
