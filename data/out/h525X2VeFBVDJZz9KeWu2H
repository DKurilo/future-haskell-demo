You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","TrueCredit is part of TransUnion and provides you with daily <a href=\"/best-credit-report-services\">credit reports</a> and scores from TransUnion as part of your monthly membership fee. However, you must pay an additional cost if you want to get reports and scores that reflect data from all three credit reporting bureaus.","TrueCredit reports have information from TransUnion, and it employs the VantageScore model to calculate your credit score. This credit score model is one that the three credit bureaus developed in 2006 to compete with the FICO score. However, it and the FICO score have different number ranges. While the FICO score lands between 300 and 850, the VantageScore has a range between 501 and 990 points. The VantageScore correlates with a letter grade between A and F. Although the credit bureaus created this scoring model, the FICO score is still more widely used among lenders.","TransUnion Interactive Inc. provides this credit-monitoring service, which is helpful in tracking what information is available about your credit and can help you keep or build a good credit rating. This service provides ID fraud watch, credit alerts, credit report monitoring and more. As long as you are an active member, you can view your reports and scores online as often as you desire. Regular credit checks are typically far more helpful than a simple annual credit report, since so much can happen so quickly these days with online purchases, financial transactions and the ever-present danger of hacking.","TrueCredit has fraud-resolution services, identity theft insurance and TransUnion security freezes. You can obtain up to $1 million in identity theft insurance. One-on-one dispute services are somewhat limited, although TrueCredit provides information about how to dispute a discrepancy on your TransUnion report through its online dispute service. The company does not provide lost wallet assistance.","This credit report service also provides general information online in its Credit Learning Center and via the company&#39;s blog and newsletter. You can receive a separate debt-analysis report with tips on how to improve your credit scores."]},"id":"0fdfccc3-a0e4-4a51-bb92-6d3bfb099bac","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7d0daf6-e9cb-454c-a6cc-b613e99aeee4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TrueCredit offers credit reports and scores from TransUnion  as part of your membership.
