When the earbuds receive the transmission, they decompress the audio, which causes a loss in audio quality and can result in distortions. The Shift codec addresses the compression and decompression issues to produce audio that is better than that of most wireless Bluetooth earbuds we reviewed. It&#39;s not comparable to the audio of wired in-ear headphones within the same price range, but it is comparable to the more affordable wired headphones.","The battery life is eight hours for both music streaming and talking. This is the longest battery life among the wireless earbuds reviewed. However, it takes 2.5 hours to fully recharge, which is the longest recharge time in our lineup. The battery life also varies depending on the volume and activity with the controls.","The call quality is good for wireless earbuds. It doesn&#39;t have a noise cancellation system, which means that if you take a call while you&#39;re out on a run through the city, your caller will hear the traffic. However, you&#39;ll hear your caller much better than you do when you have the phone up to your ear, because the voice is in stereo. Since the call is in wideband audio, the voice sounds detailed and natural. You can also answer and end the calls from the controls instead of the phone, which means that you don&#39;t have to run to your gym bag to retrieve your phone if you receive a call while working out."]},"id":"d7f5dc2d-955a-42a6-a191-af5a7a8fb869","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"4d06fd25-08c7-4585-98d8-66dba1781dfd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BlueBuds only come with three earbud sizes.

The best wireless earbuds provide four options, which gives you the best chance of finding a comfortable fit. Your ear canal can change size throughout the day. Different options allow you to always have the best fit possible.","These wireless earphones weigh only 0.48 ounces, making this one of the lightest wireless in-ear headphone sets available.
