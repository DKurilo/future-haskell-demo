The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-gas-lawn-mowers\">Gas Lawn Mower Reviews</a> here.</em>","The Husqvarna HU725AWD is a self-propelled gas lawn mower that defies convention with its bright orange body and all-wheel-drive functionality. It has a bulky design that didn&#39;t make for the smoothest ride of the mowers we tested for our gas lawn mower reviews, but when it came to cutting grass, it did an effective job.","One of its strengths is that it is an all-wheel-drive lawn mower, making it traversable over all types of terrain. Over most types of terrain, like yards with gentle slopes, you won&#39;t notice much difference between this lawn mower and a nice, perhaps less expensive rear-wheel lawn mower. However, if you have a yard with serious grades, this mower will work in your favor.","This AWD mower comes with a large-capacity bag that holds plenty of grass, decreasing the number of times you need to interrupt mowing to empty it. The bag rides low, however, so there is a tendency for it to bump the ground over certain terrain, and you may lose clumps of grass if the bag is full.","It also has a detachable chute that you can use in place of the bag if you prefer to mulch instead. This mower does have a hose attachment feature. Unfortunately, the mower we received for testing was missing this part, so we couldn&#39;t test it, but this is a nice convenience that will help you keep the mower clean and well maintained.","The wheel adjustment has four separate levers, but they adjust the mower&#39;s height with a quick motion. This is thanks in part to a big hook that extends past the wheel and is easy to grab. A single- or dual-handle adjustment option is nice because it allows you to adjust multiple wheels to the same height with a single motion. However, this mower adjusts easily enough that having four separate levers isn&#39;t a huge disadvantage.","It has a nice cutting swath of 22 inches, so if you have a large yard, this mower will cut it slightly faster than average. It also starts up quickly, with one pull each time.","This self-propelled mower comes with a generous three-year warranty. You can download a manual online to get answers to many questions when you first use the mower. You can also contact support via phone or email to ask questions or voice concerns."]},"id":"93985c94-1c57-417b-a635-0b4eb0dd864f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"008a12db-d5da-465b-9fdb-8c9a149b4d63","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Husqvarna HU725AWD has a unique design and all-wheel-drive functionality, which can come in handy if you have a hilly yard.
