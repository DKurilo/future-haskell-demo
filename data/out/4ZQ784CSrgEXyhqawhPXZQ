It doesn&#39;t reflect a lot, so you can use see your screen in bright conditions. The design is so similar to the look of the iPhone itself that once you apply it to your phone, you can hardly tell it&#39;s there.","This iPhone screen protector is made of 0.38mm-thick tempered glass. The Good Gadget Glass Guard received an 9H rating on the pencil hardness scale. This is a test that measures how hard surfaces are, with 9B being the softest and 9H the hardest. Additionally, this iPhone 6 screen protector didn&#39;t scratch when we scraped a pocketknife blade against it. It also wasn&#39;t damaged when we hit it multiple times with a hammer using moderate pressure. In a Taber Abrasion test that Good Gadget reported on, the iPhone screen protector withstood steel wool rubbing on it at 1,000g for 2,000 cycles without scratching the surface. Although it can withstand this type of abuse without scratching or breaking, it doesn&#39;t mean the material is indestructible.","The Good Gadget screen protector has military-grade anti-glare coating, and it&#39;s oil resistant. It transmits more than 96 percent of light but reflects less than 1.5 percent, which means you&#39;ll have a great image in sunny conditions. As you use your phone, your fingerprints and face can leave oil on your screen. The best iPhone screen protectors have an oleophobic coating that resists oil, which Good Gadget does.","This iPhone 6 screen protector comes with a zero air bubbles guarantee. This is because the adhesive is only around the colored edges of the screen protector. No adhesive goes directly over the portion of the phone that covers the functional part of your screen. This means there&#39;s no chance that any bubbles will form.","Since the portion of the phone that has the adhesive isn&#39;t visible, it&#39;s much easier to apply the iPhone screen protector on the phone. You still need to clean off any dirt or grease, but then all you have to do is position the screen protector squarely on the phone. The Good Gadget protector goes on dry, which means that you don&#39;t have to moisten the iPhone screen first.","Although the adhesive is only around the edges, it still holds well to the phone. You can break the seal by carefully sliding a thin, sturdy material between the screen and the Good Gadget protector. Just make sure to be careful of your iPhone screen as you do this. Although the adhesive holds the screen protector to the phone, the adhesive isn&#39;t as strong as other products we reviewed.","The design of this screen protector looks so similar to the iPhone screen itself that once you have it on, it&#39;s hard to tell it&#39;s there. It is 0.38 mm thick making it easy to access the home button with no inconveniences.","The Good Gadget Glass Guard comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. It also has a three-month warranty against manufacturer defects. If you have questions, you can email the company for assistance.","The Good Gadget Glass Guard for iPhone 4, 5 and iPhone 6 come in five colors: black, white, red, pink and blue. All color options come with a matte or glossy finish."]},"id":"108b2086-a7f5-4c28-a241-8f131b60cc67","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d2a1315a-7cfc-4b38-841a-ca4a4cc964af","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Good Gadget Glass Guard is a little thicker than PET-film screen protectors, but it does a better job at protecting your phone from scratches and impacts.
