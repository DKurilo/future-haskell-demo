Dual plate burners heat food from the top and the bottom, which dramatically improves cook times. They&#39;re easy to use, and the relatively compact size of panini grills makes them a much more space-efficient option than traditional outdoor grills. Thankfully, the grooves often found in many Panini makers mean that you won t have to sacrifice that freshly grilled aesthetic. As far as features and price go, there&#39;s a lot of variation within the panini press market. Some presses, like the <a href=\"/breville-smart-grill-review\">Breville Smart Grill</a>, have LCD screens. Others have reversible plates, like the <a href=\"/cuisinart-gr-4n-griddler-review\">Cuisinart GR-4N Griddler</a>. And still more, like the <a href=\"/west-bend-grill-and-panini-press-review\">West Bend Grill &amp; Panini Press</a>, shed the extra features in favor of a good price.","<strong>Panini Presses: What to Look For</strong>","As you attempt to find the best panini press for you, there are several things to take into consideration.","<strong>Size &amp; Power</strong><br/>Panini grills are known for their convenience, so size is a primary concern. It s important to find one that fits well in your space, yet provides enough cooking area to prepare the kinds of dishes that you re looking to make. Panini presses come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so it s a good idea to think about whether you want to make only sandwiches or use it as a contact grill to prepare full-fledged meals.","Another important factor to consider is the wattage of your potential panini press. Typically ranging from 650  to 1800 watts, the wattage profoundly affects how quickly the plates heat up, how well they maintain heat and how efficiently they can cook heartier items like burgers or steaks. Higher wattage presses are typically more expensive, so choose the one that suits your needs best.","<strong>Plate Design</strong><br/>The most important feature of your panini press is its plates. The type of plates included with your press determines what types of dishes you can make, how your food looks and how difficult the plates are to clean. This all depends on the surface of the plates, the material with which they are constructed and whether they are removable or exchangeable.","Plates typically come in two surface types, grooved and flat. The grooved variety does well with sandwiches, burgers, chicken breasts and other items on which you prefer grill marks. The flat, griddle-style plates facilitate preparing pancakes, eggs or French toast. On some models, the top plate folds all the way back so you can use the press as a contact grill.","Some models also offer removable or interchangeable plates, and some removable plates are reversible   grooved on the top and flat on the bottom   for added versatility. You could have two flat griddle plates for pancakes, two grooved grill plates for paninis, one of each or all of the above. This type of panini maker is an excellent choice if you want to keep a variety of cooking options open.","Panini press plates are typically made of aluminum or cast iron. Aluminum plates are much lighter and cheaper than their cast iron counter parts, and they often have non-stick coatings such as Teflon or ceramic. They also have a much higher heat transfer rate, which means your panini press heats up faster and maintains more even heat throughout.","Cast-iron plates, on the other hand, are heavy and more expensive. They have the ability to get hotter than aluminum and retain heat better when cooking hearty meats. Rather than using non-stick coatings that may flake and degrade, cast-iron plates require occasional seasoning to keep food from sticking to the cooking surface. Despite these benefits, the increased weight of cast-iron panini presses makes them less portable and much more difficult to hide away when not in use.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong><br/>Cleanup is often the most dreaded aspect of preparing meals. In order to speed this process, some manufacturers include removable plates that are dishwasher safe, which means you won&#39;t have to wrestle with the entire appliance when it comes time to clean it.","Controls also affect how easy a panini grill is to use. Some models are very simple, offering a single knob for heat control. Others offer options for more fine adjustment, including specific temperature selection and special settings for searing meats or for using your press as a griddle.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>It is important to understand the warranty lengths for each panini press before making your purchase. Most panini presses come with a one-year limited warranty, though some warranties extend to two years. In addition, many manufactures have support phone numbers and email addresses as well as FAQs sections on their websites to help you resolve issues more quickly.","Panini presses provide you with an easy way to make a surprising variety of foods. From grilled sandwiches to freshly chopped vegies, their wide variety of applications makes them an excellent addition to any kitchen."]},"id":"d527ea50-6e58-4bcd-9bf4-2b41103a2bbe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"d9ef4547-f71c-4ed4-8f6e-450155c4051b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GT0NEUI?tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60224[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Brentwood Panini Maker</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PY6X1E/?&tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60225[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Breville Panini Duo</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SIN0BC/?tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60226[tid|NA[bbc|NA \">Breville Smart Grill</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EYOPPU/?&tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60228[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cuisinart GR-150 Griddler Deluxe</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YD99Y4/?&tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60228[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cuisinart GR-4N Griddler</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AZK80/?tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60229[tid|NA[bbc|NA \">De&#39;Longhi Contact Grill and Panini Press</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AG8F0/?&tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60230[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Hamilton Beach Panini Grill</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FR6RCBM/?&tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60231[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Oster DuraCeramic Panini Maker &amp; Grill</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KIPXM4/?&tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60232[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Waring Italian-Style Panini Grill</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TK0RSE/?&tag=ttr_panini-press-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1268[art|NA[pid|60233[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">West Bend Grill and Panini Press</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"148a980a-f690-4f5a-abc3-113014cb91bc","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1268","url":"/best-panini-press","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-01T16:45:02Z","datePublished":"2014-09-08T15:57:17Z","name":"Panini Press Review","synopsis":"Panini presses are a fun way to make delicious dishes.
