To ensure you kick up the least dust possible, follow these tips:","1.  Go for Bags – Vacuum cleaners with dust cups are better than ever at filtering out particles as they clean, but they still create a dust cloud when you empty them. Bagged models contain the dust better when you empty them.","2.  Be Picky About Filters – Look for HEPA filters that have been certified as meeting the U.S. Department of Energy standards for eliminating 99.99 percent of dust. A true HEPA filter on a bad vacuum is not a perfect solution, but it will help.","3.  Keep Up on Maintenance – Empty the dust cup or bag often and clean and replace filters so your vacuum works at its best.","4.  Empty Bag or Dust Cup Outside – That way, you don’t release dust back into your home.","5.  Slow Down – Going a little slower in your passes gives the vacuum time to pick up as much dust as possible. Also, get into corners as often as you can – dust can hide there.","6.  Consider Wearing a Mask – The <a href=\"https://www.aafa.org/\">Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America</a> recommends wearing a mask when you dust or vacuum to lessen the likelihood of an asthma attack."]},"id":"73786b52-49f7-4baa-bb8b-3a4950761edd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_199","url":"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angela-parkinson","url":"/author/angela-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Angela Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4mNVTVXMirWtTXf6QMhCjd","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-19T01:58:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-19T01:58:00Z","name":"Best Hardwood Floor Vacuum Cleaners of 2019","synopsis":"We tested how well each vacuum picked up sawdust from a hardwood floor and how noisy it was, and ranked them from best to worst.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested how well each vacuum picked up sawdust from a hardwood floor and how noisy it was, and ranked them from best to worst.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-01T16:51:08Z","id":"FNTx79AzWaAN5X4tETWzgN","meta":{"title":"Best Vacuum for Hardwood Floors - 2019 Reviews and Test Results","description":"We tested how well each vacuum picked up sawdust from a hardwood floor and how noisy it was, and ranked them from best to worst."},"products":[{"slug":"shark-duoclean","url":"/product/shark-duoclean","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","name":"Shark DuoClean","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"jdA3PtcVgqF4isP6aYbohS","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"eureka-mighty-mite","url":"/product/eureka-mighty-mite","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","name":"Eureka Mighty Mite","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"MR9LVx8cajqwnPa39c3VWT","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"dyson-v7","url":"/product/dyson-v7","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","name":"Dyson V7","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"EDRVHFmoZCXVd9MVMfJ3e3","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"bissell-hard-floor-expert","url":"/product/bissell-hard-floor-expert","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","name":"Bissell Hard Floor Expert","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"v7d9PnmR2XZEe8nYfxoDe4","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"miele-s194-quickstep","url":"/product/miele-s194-quickstep","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","name":"Miele S194 Quickstep","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"QFcacyH4dfR5Lu9gANeBuS","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/uLxWh2MjCgBX2DKJZqk6HW.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Hardwood-Floor-Vacuums-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/N/819707/original/_Hero-Hardwood-Floor-Vacuums-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"uLxWh2MjCgBX2DKJZqk6HW","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uLxWh2MjCgBX2DKJZqk6HW.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Hardwood Floor Vacuum Cleaners of 2019","description":"We tested how well each vacuum picked up sawdust from a hardwood floor and how noisy it was, and ranked them from best to worst."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/uLxWh2MjCgBX2DKJZqk6HW.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Hardwood-Floor-Vacuums-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/N/819707/original/_Hero-Hardwood-Floor-Vacuums-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"uLxWh2MjCgBX2DKJZqk6HW","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uLxWh2MjCgBX2DKJZqk6HW.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Hardwood Floor Vacuum Cleaners of 2019","description":"We tested how well each vacuum picked up sawdust from a hardwood floor and how noisy it was, and ranked them from best to worst."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"vacuums","url":"/home-and-garden/vacuums","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","name":"Vacuums","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:09Z","id":"8ELcJaCVkXQm5iVYeKWzem","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
