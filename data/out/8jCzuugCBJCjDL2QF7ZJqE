The wheel itself is patterned after the actual Ferrari 458 Italia steering wheel; it&#39;s just a slightly smaller version. This wheel and pedal set also works on a PC and with Microsoft operating systems from Windows XP to Windows 8.1. It isn&#39;t the best racing wheel, but it&#39;s one of the few available for the Xbox One.","This gaming racing wheel shines in its design. The quality rubberized grip is very comfortable, and because it weighs in at 8.4 pounds, the peripheral has a sturdy feel. The wheel is not built exactly like a gaming controller; instead, its main action buttons are spread across the left and right side of the wheel frame. The pedals look fantastic and even give differing levels of tension. You won&#39;t find a surplus of buttons, but every button is clearly displayed and has a purpose.","Customization is not the focus of this wheel. It has 10 buttons in total, and they can be reprogrammed depending on the game. The adjustable dial lets you switch camera views. You get 900 degrees of rotation with the TX Ferrari 458 Italia. That helps the PC steering wheel feel more like the wheel in a real car. You can also fine-tune the steering sensitivity to ensure you find what you&#39;re comfortable with. Unfortunately, there are many features the TX Ferrari 458 Italia doesn&#39;t have – like headset support, adjustable pedals and adjustable feedback strength.","Thrustmaster, the manufacturer, excels when it comes to help and support issues. The company offers a limited two-year warranty and can be reached by phone or email. There are also FAQs specific to each product, and Thrustmaster recommends you start there for troubleshooting help. The included user guide is fairly in-depth and helpful. The only thing missing is an online forum where you could find information and contribute to the community."]},"id":"c7070b15-2614-4b81-b044-bbd5f24e8fd1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0b7a40b3-7b86-4d63-8fb2-998014fea868","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TX Ferrari 458 Italia wheel and pedal set focuses on PC and Xbox One gamers.
