Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Garmin nuvi 57 is a basic <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> without many of the premium features we look for. However, it’s decently easy to use and comes with preloaded maps of the lower 49 states.","This GPS navigator is lacking a few features typically found in the best navigation GPS units. First, it lacks lifetime map updates, meaning that after you own the nuvi 57 for a few years, you’ll need to pay to update its maps. Second, it doesn’t have voice-activated navigation, so you’ll have to type your intended destination into the device manually. Third, this device does not have any Bluetooth capabilities, meaning it lacks speakerphone functionality or the ability to pair with your smartphone in any way.","Despite those shortcomings, the nuvi 57 is a solid navigation system. You get Garmin’s navigation platform, which allows you to create several waypoints along to the way to a particular destination. It then routes you along the most efficient way to get to your destination while passing every waypoint.","It also has a speed limit indicator, which tells you both your current speed and the speed limit of the road you’re driving on. This can help you avoid a speeding ticket if you’re driving on an unfamiliar road.","The nuvi 57 has a resistive touchscreen with a resolution of 480 x 272 pixels. This is on par with other GPS units in its price range, like the <a href=\"/tomtom-go-500-review\">TomTom GO 500</a>. It also has a rechargeable battery, so you can use the GPS without having it plugged in. The battery lasts for about one to two hours. This is especially helpful if you happen to need to charge your phone and have just one charging port in your vehicle.","Like all other nuvi units, the nuvi 57 can be oriented in portrait or landscape mode, whichever you prefer. Portrait orientation is especially useful to help make the device feel more like a native build-in of your car’s panel interface.","Garmin has customer support representatives available to you via telephone or email, and it hosts a variety of informational resources on its website. The nuvi 57 ships with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"5592f93c-eb6c-4248-bafd-8c73f220f99a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ab320ab4-feed-4897-9e9b-e6ccbbf91445","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Garmin nuvi 57 is a bare-bones navigation device without the fancy extras like voice navigation and a high-definition, capacitive touchscreen.
