They stay in the shade, drink many fluids, put on sunscreen, go for a quick dip in the pool, lake or ocean and try not to overheat. If a person overheats, their bodies can shut down because they need a break to rejuvenate. They need to cool down before they can perform in tiptop shape.","Just like a person overheating in summertime, a laptop runs the risk of overheating after limitless uses. And just like the steps you take to prevent or recover from the heat, it&#39;s important to  take precautions to prevent your laptop from shutting down and being ineffective. One of the best precautions you can take is using a <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-laptop-coolers\">laptop cooler</a>.","Before we get to treatments, we must first know the symptoms and warning signs of overheating.","Symptoms:","1.\tThe internal fan kicks on to full blast. Whenever your computer is on, the internal fans are inside doing their thing. Desktop computers are bigger and have better air circulation. They don&#39;t have to work as hard to stay cool because they have more room to breathe. Think of it like this: In &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,&#34; whenever Elizabeth is wearing that tight corset, sucking in and struggling for breath, she has one of the big fancy fans helping her keep cool. On the other hand, whenever she is wearing pirate getup, she never has a fan. She is comfortable and functioning properly. Your desktop computer is wearing pirate attire with plenty of breathing room, and your laptop is constantly wearing a corset with very little breathing room.","Laptops have fans inside constantly keeping them cool, but when that fan kicks into over drive, it&#39;s time to give your device a break. When Elizabeth was fanning in overdrive, she collapsed and fell off a cliff into the ocean. Laptop fans shouldn&#39;t kick into overdrive, and when they do, we know it&#39;s on the verge of overheating and shutting down Â  potentially falling into the ocean.","2.\tYour laptop is hot to the touch or blowing hot air. We learn at a very young age when something is too hot and we shouldn&#39;t touch it. When you feel the bottom of the laptop, the keyboard or the screen getting warmer, you know it&#39;s time to cool off. When the heat becomes uncomfortable and that trigger in your head is saying, &#34;This is too hot,&#34; it&#39;s a sure fire-sign your laptop is well on its way to overheating.","Prevention and treatment:","1.\tUse it on a flat solid surface. It&#39;s called a laptop, right? Its name suggests it can sit on the top of your lap. Laptops are portable, making it easy for the devices to sit on your lap or bed or couch, but these are not the best places for a laptop when in use. A laptop is so compact that it only has small vents to help keep the airflow moving. The soft material will surround and enclose the laptop, which then blocks the small but essential vents. Laptops with blocked vents run a much higher risk of overheating. When laptops are used on a desk or table, its vents and fans can run at optimal capacity. Flat and solid surfaces lower the risks of overheating.","2.\tInvest in a laptop cooler. True to their name, laptop coolers keep your laptop cool. Most coolers have fans that help circulate and disperse any hot air flow emitted from your laptop. Some will also elevate your laptop to allow for more breathing room. Coolers protect your laptop from suffocation and give the internal fans a boost so they aren&#39;t constantly on overdrive.  A laptop cooling pad will keep you laptop up and running for endless hours.","Whether you&#39;re a gamer or a work-a-holic, overusing a laptop is easy to do. Laptops are a huge convenience and nothing is worse than when that convenience is gone. In order to prevent any frustration from overheating laptops, make sure to take the right precautions before the heat damages your system beyond repair."]},"id":"c1aa23d4-7b34-4c0a-8f6d-db543b3e3ff2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7911","url":"/symptoms-and-treatments-for-overheating-laptops","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"corie-holmes","url":"/author/corie-holmes","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Corie Holmes","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"xskicTBam2CCfMxor86Fad","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-03T19:47:23Z","datePublished":"2013-06-03T19:47:23Z","name":"Symptoms and Treatments for Overheating Laptops","synopsis":"During scorching summers, people take precautions to avoid heatstroke, sunburn and dehydration.","review":{},"strapline":"During scorching summers, people take precautions to avoid heatstroke, sunburn and dehydration.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-10T16:29:33Z","id":"45AgRrGLz23RXj2gDFwuR5","meta":{"title":"Symptoms and Treatments for Overheating Laptops","description":"Learn the common symptoms and treatments for an overheating laptop.
