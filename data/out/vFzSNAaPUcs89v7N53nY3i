Our reviewers dug into manufacturers’ websites and engineering documents, asked questions of expert riders on cycling forums, and evaluated the pros and cons of features on the various models we chose for our product lineup. From there, we compared and evaluated the top models of each style to reach our conclusions.","<strong>Types of Bike Trainers</strong>","Your indoor bike training needs will be different depending on your focus; some types are better suited for increasing your distance, and others are designed to help you increase your resistance tolerance. The five main indoor bike trainer styles are as follows:","Wind Bike Trainers<br/>Along with being durable, wind trainers tend to be the least expensive and the most lightweight. They also tend to be more durable than magnetic trainers. Pressing on the pedal causes the fan on the trainer to spin. The amount of air getting scooped into the fan generates progressive resistance while you bike.","This is not the ideal choice for someone living in an apartment or shared living space because the wind bike trainer tends to be the noisiest option.  It is also possible to exceed the maximum resistance available, which can be frustrating if you want to increase your resistance tolerance.","Magnetic Bike Trainers<br/>A magnetic bike trainer uses a magnetic flywheel to create resistance. Some have fixed resistance, which requires you to manually shift gears to increase difficulty levels. Others have progressive resistance.","Most fixed-resistance models have toggle switches or handle-bar-mounted shifters, allowing you to increase resistance while you pedal. However, to increase resistance on some fixed-resistance trainers, you will have to dismount and manually change the setting, which can be frustrating when you want a long, uninterrupted ride.","This type of trainer is less noisy than wind bike trainers, making this style more apartment-friendly. Magnetic trainers are often less durable than wind trainers. <br/><br/>Fluid Bike Trainers<br/>Fluid bike trainers have a reputation for having the best road-like feel, which includes simulating inclines. On the fancier models, you can adjust the resistance electronically while you’re biking. Fluid bike trainers have a shell connected to the flywheel that houses an impeller and fluid. As the impeller turns, the liquid heats up and makes it harder to push the pedal. This design makes these trainers much quieter than magnetic or wind types.","In the past, fluid bike trainers had a potential for leaking when the fluid overheated, but as updated and improved machines keep coming, this is less of an issue.","Direct-Drive Trainers<br/>Instead of attaching your axle and back tire to the trainer, direct-drive trainers require you remove your rear tire and directly connect the trainer to the bike frame and chain. Since there is less equipment between your bike and the device, more of your power goes directly into your workout and doesn&#39;t get lost in the friction between the two machines. This also makes the direct drive a quieter ride. These tend to be the most expensive trainers on the market due to their complex build.","Bike Rollers<br/>The build of a bike roller differs radically from the other trainers we have discussed. These machines typically have three rolling drums or cylinders your bike rides atop, rotating these cylinders as the front and rear tires spin. Generally, these machines tend to be longer than the average trainer. Fortunately, one of the best roller bike trainers, the Minoura MoZ-Roller, folds up and weighs only 12.7 pounds, making it more portable and easier to store.","Unlike the magnetic, fluid, wind and direct-drive units, which securely hold your bike in place, the roller design forces you to use your core muscles to balance yourself. It also teaches you to maintain an even pedal stroke to maintain a smooth ride. Since these machines require so much balance and technique, bike rollers have the strongest road-like feel.","Unfortunately, this balancing act is not beginner-friendly. If your pedal stroke is not smooth, the ride will be jerky and you may end up falling off or needing to stop and start frequently. Since your bike is elevated higher by riding atop the roller, mounting and dismounting are more difficult. High-end rollers are typically quieter than low-end rollers, but low-end rollers are typically louder than most other trainer resistance styles. It is also easier to max out resistance on these trainers, keeping you from pushing yourself further in your training.","<strong>Choosing the Right Bike Trainer</strong>","Price<br/>We reviewed bike trainers ranging in price from under $100 up to $1,200. While many people search for trainers priced below $100, you’re more likely to find a higher quality one with better features if you spend $200 to $300. Trainers with wind resistance are the least expensive, while trainers with fluid resistance are the most expensive.","Ride Feel &amp; Resistance<br/>Higher-end bike trainers give your exercise a more realistic road-like feel than basic models. Fluid and direct-drive bike trainers ride smoother than others, and the more road-like conditions make indoor training as close to outdoor riding as possible. If you’re looking for a simpler ride without changes in elevation or deliberate resistance adjustments, a less expensive wind resistance trainer is an option. But if you need a trainer for more intense off-season workouts, we advise investing in a product that creates a translatable experience. Part of that is choosing a trainer with a compatible resistance-adjusting style to the kind of rides you desire. If you want a simulated hilly workout, choose a trainer that can switch resistance levels quickly as opposed to one with manual resistance shifting.","Smart Device, App &amp; Tracking Connectivity<br/>Bike trainers that are compatible with training and smart devices help you take your workouts to the next level. It&#39;s a bonus if you can connect directly to your tablet or smartphone to control resistance via an app, on top of tracking and storing your stats through software and apps.","The biggest downside to some of these smart bike trainers is they must be plugged into an outlet for their features to work. Also, as with most smart devices, buggy software can sometimes make apps and programs unresponsive or delayed. This all depends on the brand. Tacx has a reputation for making dependable smart software for its trainers, and the Tacx Vortex is one of its best models with smart compatibility.","Storage<br/>Bike trainers are often foldable and storable and usually weigh between 15 and 30 pounds. Most are small enough to store under a bed or in a closet when not in use. This is the clear advantage the best indoor bike trainers have over full-size exercise or spinning bikes, which take up a lot of room. We found the Bike Lane Pro to be lightweight and low profile, so it&#39;s easy to store.","Wheel Wear<br/>Riding on a trainer wears out your wheel faster than road riding does. For this reason, it is a good idea to have an extra smooth tire specifically for trainer riding. Most bike trainers are designed for a quick-release bike wheel, which is common on road bikes, and come with a special quick-release skewer to help you connect the back wheel to the machine. Although less common, some machines also come with a thru axle, which is a typical wheel attachment for high-end mountain bikes.","Noise<br/>If you live in an apartment or any other noise-sensitive environment, a wind trainer is not the best choice. Magnetic trainers are also quite loud. Beyond annoying your neighbors, noise may affect the quality of your workout if you want to watch TV or interact with others while you pedal away. This is amplified in a small space, especially as indoor workouts last longer than a few minutes. One way to mitigate noise is to make sure you use the smoothest possible back tire for all but direct-drive trainers, as tire treads can cause extra noise.
