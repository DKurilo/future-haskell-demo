Based on our research, we think the best overall massager for most people is the cordless PADO PureWave CM7 because of its versatility and battery life. If you’re looking for a full-body massage chair, one of the best options is the RealRelax Favor-03. It has features typically found in much more expensive models. Since there are so many types of massagers to choose from, you&#39;ll want to think about which type will work best for you before you decide what to buy.","How Much Do Massagers Cost?<br/>The cost of a massager depends on the type you buy. Small handheld devices cost as little as $8 but can be as much as $50 if they’re electronic. Full body massage chairs, on the other hand, are much more expensive and can run anywhere from $300 to $10,000.","Massage at Home<br/>A massage is a great way to relieve tension and stress, but at what cost? Going to a professional can run you anywhere from $50 to $300 depending on the massage and spa experience. If you don’t have that kind of money to spend, there are numerous massage devices you can buy to use at home for a fraction of the cost. Handheld massagers can be used on the back, shoulders, legs and arms, while massage chairs will give you an entire body experience. Foot massagers work while in a seated position and do all the work for you, making them a great alternative to visiting an expensive spa.","Warranties<br/>If you’re going all out on an expensive massage chair or device, look at the warranty first. If used frequently, handheld massagers can malfunction as there are a lot of moving parts inside that create its vibrations and movements. Massage chairs can be incredibly expensive as well, so a good warranty is the best way to protect your investment. No matter what kind you buy, it’s important to keep your receipts and make sure you’re covered under the warranty."]},"id":"96f624cc-fe1f-4376-92da-8d9bd1e8f1d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"PADO-Pure-Wave-CM7_image_RAW.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/I/696582/original/PADO-Pure-Wave-CM7_image_RAW.jpg","id":"8gayUxceHFdSxKH9neVmCH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gayUxceHFdSxKH9neVmCH.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"PADO Pure Wave CM7"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014U1C1P6/?&tag=ttr_best-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|BestMassagers[art|NA[pid|69504[tid|NA[bbc|NA&ascsubtag=%site%%transactionId%-gclid-%gclid%-Fallback","urlStyle":"button","name":"PADO Pure Wave CM7","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Overall Massager"},"id":"a0722e00-65ea-4b5f-a9ab-2204786141eb","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Nayoya-Massage-Ball-Roller_image_RAW.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/K/696584/original/Nayoya-Massage-Ball-Roller_image_RAW.jpg","id":"Rek46sRPyge3pZam2jrfs","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rek46sRPyge3pZam2jrfs.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"Noyoya Massage Ball Roller"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Z6D5SQ/?tag=ttr_best-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|BestMassagers[art|NA[pid|62462[tid|NA[bbc|NA&ascsubtag=%site%%transactionId%-gclid-%gclid%-Fallback","urlStyle":"button","name":"Noyoya Massage Ball Roller","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Most Portable Back Massager"},"id":"979c50f9-35b4-4589-bd4c-e7cb43cb86a8","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Sharper-Image-Shiatsu_image_RAW.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/J/696583/original/Sharper-Image-Shiatsu_image_RAW.jpg","id":"pBME25267FVgJWmPCQzddC","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBME25267FVgJWmPCQzddC.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"Sharper Image Shiatsu Foot Massager"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Shiatsu-Foot-Massager/dp/B073RD4BSL/?tag=ttr_best-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|BestMassagers[art|NA[pid|63267[tid|NA[bbc|NA&ascsubtag=%site%%transactionId%-gclid-%gclid%-Fallback","urlStyle":"button","name":"Sharper Image Shiatsu Foot Massager","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Most Affordable Shiatsu Foot Massager"},"id":"1e04ac80-490b-46a9-941a-51d8a360424f","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"text":"Best Overall Massager"},"id":"0671bfff-caf4-46fa-be55-75bbb58d6698","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/8gayUxceHFdSxKH9neVmCH.jpg","link":{"href":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/pado-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/I/696582/original/PADO-Pure-Wave-CM7_image_RAW.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gayUxceHFdSxKH9neVmCH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"8gayUxceHFdSxKH9neVmCH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gayUxceHFdSxKH9neVmCH.jpg","alt":"PADO Pure Wave CM7"},"id":"f849eacd-4ea8-4be2-a5a5-13d0786af4b7","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"PADO Pure Wave CM7\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/pado-review\">PADO Pure Wave CM7</a>","pros":null,"cons":null},"id":"7bdb44a8-d4e9-415f-be19-386bd1d2d5e6","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["","The PADO Pure Wave CM7 is cordless and rechargeable, so you can use it pretty much anywhere.
