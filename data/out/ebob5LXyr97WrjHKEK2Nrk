This spring and summer season, sweat is out and joyful mowing is in. The Troy-Bilt TB230 makes it possible with a 190cc Briggs and Stratton 725ex Series L-Head engine, which comes with this guarantee: “With the Briggs &amp; Stratton Starting Promise, an engine equipped with ReadyStart will always start on the first or second pull, or it will be fixed for free.” That’s quite the promise, and one that dear old dad wishes he&#39;d had."]},"id":"d1c89c9d-a4e2-432f-bbfa-8af35bbaeb31","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/wzHKRJWPNT4C2J5CX9pXq6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56381-troy3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wzHKRJWPNT4C2J5CX9pXq6.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"wzHKRJWPNT4C2J5CX9pXq6","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wzHKRJWPNT4C2J5CX9pXq6.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b0d73c3b-144d-4fff-8913-e0d0917a9372","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This self-propelled lawn mower has a 3-in-1 convertible cutting system, which enables you to decide just what to do with your grass clippings. The Troy-Bilt TB230 is initially set up to be a mulcher, so if you would rather discharge your grass clippings, you will need to install the side discharge chute. The Grassbag can hold 1.9 bushels of grass, and you can easily detach it from the mower to spread on your garden or add to your compost pile.","The rotary mower has a 21-inch deck equipped with the TriAction cutting system. This system uses three steps to ensure that your grass is cut evenly at the level that you have chosen. The deck has six height settings, ranging from 1.25 inches to 3.75 inches.

Typically, front-wheel drive is better for flat yards, but because of the large rear wheels, this mower will also maneuver well over small hills in your land.","Because this is a self-propelled lawn mower, you are in charge of its speed. This lawn mower does not have cruise control, unfortunately, but it does have a squeeze-grip control lever that helps you maintain a relaxed pace. To keep your comfort level comfortable, you are able to adjust the height of the mower’s handle to three positions.","A lawn mower can be dangerous if proper safety precautions are not taken. If you need to stop the mower at any time for any reason, release the blade control, which you will find attached to the upper handle.
