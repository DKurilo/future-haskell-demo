The 2ms gray-to-gray response time is the fastest we have seen on any touchscreen monitor. This amazingly fast response time will ensure that images are crystal clear and seamless no matter what your plans are for this monitor.

The leg located behind the screen adjusts to a variety of different angles to make it much easier to interact with the monitor via touch. However, the adjustment felt rather still and takes quite a bit of pressure to adjust. This is a very minor issue and once set in place the touchscreen monitor will stay in that position. If your desk is rather cluttered or you simply don&#39;t want to deal with a monitor on your desk, you can always buy a wall mount.
