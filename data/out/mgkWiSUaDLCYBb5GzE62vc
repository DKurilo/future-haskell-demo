Its <a href=\"/best-online-sofa\">sleeper sofas</a> are especially popular and have high customer ratings. While customers say the sleepers are comfortable on their own, Pottery Barn sells an additional mattress topper designed to make its sleeper sofas even more comfortable. In addition to sleeper sofas, this retailer also has sectionals, traditional sofas and compact sofas that fit well in apartments or small living spaces.","You can search sofas based on a specific collection. These collections are displayed attractively on the website so you’ll be inspired to buy other items from the collection. Clicking on a collection brings up an image list of all the pieces available for purchase, including sofas.","After you choose a specific couch style, the sofa description page lists the different sizes the sofa comes in, the fabric and color options available, and the projected delivery time based on the choices you make. Selecting a color and fabric option on the right of the page triggers the sofa image to refresh with that option shown. The 360-view tool lets you grab and rotate the sofa to see it from any angle. The site shows a close-up of the fabric so you can see the threads and color more clearly. However, you can also order free swatches of material so you can see and feel it before ordering your sofa.","If you choose a popular ready-made sofa, Pottery Barn gives you seven days to return it for a full refund. If you choose a custom upholstered sleeper sofa, it cannot be returned unless there is a manufacturer’s defect. If you’d like a custom sofa that comes with the option to return it, check out <a href=\"/joybird-review\">Joybird’s</a> custom couches and return policy.","Sofas come in pieces, so some assembly is required. If you choose the white glove delivery service, the sofa will be delivered, assembled and set up for you in the room of your choice. However, there is an additional charge for this service beyond the standard shipping and handling fees.","If you’d like help planning and decorating your living room, Pottery Barn offers free interior design services, giving advice by phone or email. Or you can speak with a design specialist at any local Pottery Barn location. These services are free of charge and can help you figure out your style and learn how to properly take measurements."]},"id":"9d860870-c3f2-4ec1-babe-51abf3fdeba1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"eca4e3e9-980b-438d-9928-16689ff23be9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pottery Barn is a popular online furniture store with a great selection of comfortable sleeper sofas.
