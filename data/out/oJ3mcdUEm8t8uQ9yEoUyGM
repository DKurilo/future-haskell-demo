Their product is specifically designed to aid adult users with pornography problems. The $5 monthly fee has been changed to a yearly subscription price of $49.95. Because of identical filtering technology, WiseChoice is very similar to Safe Eyes. One exception is that WiseChoice defaults to a locked filter with no override option. In order to override the filter, users must purchase a different version.","For more details about the effectiveness and features of this product, please refer to our <a href=\"/safe-eyes-review\">complete review of Safe Eyes</a>.
