For instance, you don’t get priority boarding, VIP lounge access or free bag check with this air miles credit card. The travel benefits you can expect are no blackout dates, the ability to book international flights with the points you earn and discounts on in-flight purchases.","Although this air miles credit card doesn’t offer very many travel benefits, it gives you a nice sign-up bonus. If you spend $1,000 in the first three months of having the card, you receive 20,000 TrueBlue points. For every purchase you make with this air miles credit card, you earn one TrueBlue point. The best benefit of this card for frequent JetBlue travelers is that you can earn up to eight TrueBlue points when you use your card to make eligible JetBlue purchases.","This American Express card includes a few key features that are important for frequent travelers. When you use your card to purchase your travel fare, you automatically qualify for travel accident insurance and rental car insurance. Additionally, this air miles card includes a 24/7 roadside assistance feature. Unlike the best frequent flyer credit cards, this card doesn&#39;t include lost luggage reimbursement.","There&#39;s no introductory annual percentage rate promotion on this air miles credit card, but the standard APR is reasonable. Purchases you make with the card have a 15.24% Variable APR, and the same rate applies to any balance transfer transactions you make. If you use this card for cash advances, you pay 25.24% Variable APR, and this card has a 27.24% Variable penalty APR.","This card has industry standard fees. If you use this card for balance transfers or cash advances, you pay a minimum $5 or 3% fee for each transaction. If you use this card while traveling abroad, all the purchases you make incur a 2.7% fee. Although the international purchase fee is common, the best travel rewards cards don&#39;t charge it. This card carries an annual fee of $40, which is waived for the first year you have the card.","You can contact American Express by phone 24/7. You can also contact the company for member support via email. For general questions and inquiries about your card or account, you can reference the many frequently asked questions that American Express has posted on its website."]},"id":"71528969-66f7-448f-b646-bf3e4ec60f91","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0df131a6-1b1c-46f6-9fc3-69ea3ba4d2c8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The JetBlue Card from American Express is a card to consider if you frequently fly with JetBlue and want a credit card with a decent APR that will help you earn TrueBlue points.
