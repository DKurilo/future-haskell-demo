They have smart, highly efficient products, and their Edge <a href=\"/best-programmable-thermostats\">programmable thermostat</a> is no exception. This is the smaller thermostat on the market, and with several different designs, it fits with any décor inside your home.","The Edge thermostat has seven-day scheduling and can be programmed two different ways. The screen, while smaller than average, is a touchscreen and makes programming the device simple. Also, a memory card  detaches from the thermostat and plugs into your computer. Setting the schedule this way is extremely easy since it displays graphs of temperature and humidity settings and allows you to schedule the settings however you want.","This is the smallest programmable thermostat we have seen. The screen is just over 4 inches diagonally, but the buttons are spaced far enough apart that you won&#39;t accidentally push something you don&#39;t want to. We actually like the size, as it can fit in any style home without sticking out.","The digital thermostat works on three stages of heating and two stages of cooling. It shows you the outside temperature and the target temperature it is working towards. We really welcome the humidity sensor. It works with your heating unit to lower the moisture in the air. We should point out this feature only works with HVAC systems that are built with dehumidifiers. Carrier also offers a mobile application to work with the Edge thermostat, but it&#39;s an upgrade you have to pay for. If you do choose this upgrade, you will be alerted of any thermostat or heating unit malfunctions as well as reminders to change your air filter. The app also gives you control over the thermostat so you can change the temperature no matter where you&#39;re at.","Installing this thermostat requires the attention of a professional. There is a 10-year registered warranty and a huge help section with FAQs, troubleshooting guides and user manuals for all Carrier products. The documentation for this thermostat is only for programming temperatures and setting schedules, not for installing the unit."]},"id":"58eda33e-2158-4c25-b956-d3cfa33607b1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b37f0b89-2444-47d5-9bed-923618622609","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is very little the Edge thermostat from Carrier can&#39;t do.
