With the increased variety of colors, the picture is more intense. The Sony BDP-S370 also supports 24p True Cinema which means the Blu-ray player is able play discs at 24 frames per second – the same rate at which movies are filmed. Combine that with full HD 1080p resolution, and you’ll never go back to your old DVD player. Ditching the DVD player is okay though, because this Blu-ray player has the capability to upscale your DVD collection.

If your speakers don’t project the score of &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; to its fullest capacity, certain scenes won’t be as impactful. The Sony BDP-S370 does its best to make sure your ears are as entertained as your eyes. It is equipped with top-of-the-line Dolby True HD, dts HD, LPCM and noise reduction features.

This extra storage space allows for bonus content on the Blu-ray discs that you would never find on a DVD. With the Sony BDP-S350 you can access this Blu-ray disc content, or BD-Live, easily with a Wi-Fi connection. BD-Live features behind-the-scenes footage, special interviews with the director and interactive games.  BonusView is another feature associated with BD-Live. The BonusView option allows you to view picture-in-picture content, like watching the movie with director commentary in the upper right hand corner.","Once BD-Live content is saved onto an inserted USB drive, it can be shared with other devices in your home as long as they are DLNA certified. The Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) was created by a collaboration of brands to make digital content compatible with more devices. Once your Blu-ray player is connected to your home network, you can transfer movies, photos and other digital media to a TV, computer, phone or any device that boasts a DLNA certification.","Thanks to the Sony BD-S370 Blu-ray player, your iPhone just got a whole lot cooler. You thought you could do everything with your iPhone, until now.  Sony has a downloadable app available that turns your iPhone into a remote for your Blu-ray disc player, allowing you to manage everything from settings to BD-Live content to DLNA data directly from your phone. This app is available for all of Sony’s products.","If you are not the most careful person, the Sony BDP- S370 has a few features to protect itself. After a period of non-use, the player will go into standby mode and apply a screen saver, protecting your TV, if still on, and reducing expended energy.

Most impressively, the Sony BDP-S350 has decreased 21 percent in power consumption in playback mode, and 43 percent in standby mode. They even print the user guide on recycled paper.
