You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The recent trend in <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> has been growth. Many developers believe that people want the biggest device available. However, there are still people who want small phones. Fortunately, the HTC Droid Incredible 4G is a small smartphone that does not sacrifice quality for size.","The HTC Droid Incredible 4G is dwarfed by its competitors, but this becomes its best selling point. With a 4-inch screen, this smartphone comfortably fits in any pocket or purse. Although the touchscreen display is not in HD, it is still crisp and beautiful to look at. Easily the worst aspect of the phone&#39;s design is its plastic casing. Molded with odd grooves and grips, the Incredible 4G takes some getting used to while holding it. Also, the plastic feels flimsy, like it could crack at any minute.","The 8MP rear-facing camera is surprisingly good. Most small phones will use a 5MP camera, but HTC refuses to follow the norm with this feature. The display will not always show you whether or not you have taken a good picture, but with 8MP, you&#39;ll have a shot worth sharing with friends through social networking.","The HTC Droid Incredible 4G is an exclusive phone with Verizon Wireless, so you&#39;ll want to check your coverage area before picking this phone. When connected, the call quality is good, and some of the phone&#39;s features make the phone easier to use. For example, when you&#39;re on a call, you can set the phone on a flat surface, and it will automatically switch to conference mode. The Incredible 4G does suffer from some bugs, like dropping its data connections or freezing.","The battery is slightly better than previous Droid Incredibles, but if you&#39;re a heavy phone user, you&#39;ll want to keep your charger on you. However, if you&#39;re buying this phone to be a comfortable device that allows you to surf the web once in a while, the charge should last a full day. The smartphone comes with 8GB of installed storage space. Verizon&#39;s default apps dominate some of this space. If you intend on downloading a lot of files and apps, you&#39;ll want to invest in a memory card to expand the storage.","The HTC Droid Incredible 4G runs Android 4.0, and the dual-core, 1.2MHz processor keeps operations smooth. This phone is not the most powerful device on the shelf, but for a small smartphone, it&#39;s surprisingly fast and powerful."]},"id":"ecea974f-8794-4e78-8131-65eefb243a5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aade71c6-42d1-4e83-bc67-88c0fa0f8a54","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HTC Droid Incredible 4G is a perfect fit if you want a small smartphone that fits comfortably in your pocket.
