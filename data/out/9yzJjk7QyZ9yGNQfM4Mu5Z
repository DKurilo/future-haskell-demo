The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-Ray Player Reviews</a> here.</em>","With only a few minor drawbacks, the Samsung BD-F7500 falls just short of the top three Blu-ray players. Don’t let the ranking fool you. You are going to get great quality video and plenty of features packed into a small and sleekly designed box.","The F7500 ranks among the best Blu-ray players in terms of video quality. It is the newest model in the Samsung F series of Blu-ray players and features UHD 4K upscaling, which ups the resolution of your Blu-ray by four times. This player will also upscale lower-resolution video formats such as DVD to 1080p. Samsung has also installed an extremely fast processor in the F7500 to get past the slow loading speeds that have plagued some Blu-ray players.","The F7500 can play 3D Blu-rays along with an array of video formats, including BD-R/RE, DVD-R/RW, CD-R/RW and AVCHD. Even though this player is capable of playing 3D Blu-rays, it does not have the 2D to 3D conversion feature that is found on other Blu-ray players we reviewed.","This player does include built-in Wi-Fi and is DLNA certified, so you can get all of your mobile devices to work in-network using Samsung&#39;s AllShare technology with your Blu-ray player, which is a feature we liked. With AllShare, you can stream music and movies and view photos from your computer or other mobile devices.","There are a multitude of features on the new F7500. You can even surf the web using the remote as the mouse using its web browser. One great feature on the F7500 is the ability to mirror your smartphone display on your big screen. Innovations like this make it apparent that the gaps between different technologies are becoming slimmer.","If you are going to have first-class video quality, you&#39;ll want to have equally stunning audio quality. Like most Blu-ray players today, the F7500 is set up for Dolby True HD and DTS-HD audio. With the right surround sound setup, this will bring that movie theater experience to your home entertainment center.","The rear panel of the F7500 has two HDMI cable ports. This can be a useful feature if you need to send separate audio and video feeds to your TV and A/V receiver. Another great thing about the I/O’s of this player is that there are analog left/right outs, so if you have a receiver that doesn’t support HDMI, you can always route the sound to your older receiver using these ports."]},"id":"184bf59f-48b1-403c-88ad-abcb6c07e1ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5ea16716-7cc1-4478-8a85-f34268c4681d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The F7500 just slipped out of our top three products, but it&#39;s nothing short of a phenomenal Blu-ray player.
