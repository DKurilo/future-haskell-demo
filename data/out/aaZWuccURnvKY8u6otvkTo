You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Any chef knows great things happen when the guesswork removed from their cooking. The more precise a chef can be in the kitchen, the better tasting their food will become. The best tool to aid any chef&#39;s pursuit to improved cuisine is a good <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">food thermometer</a>. The Polder Classic Digital Thermometer helps to take the guesswork out of your cooking.","This digital thermometer has a leave-in probe design. You place the metal probe inside the food or liquid you want to monitor, and the cable runs to the monitoring base, allowing you to continually monitor cooking temperatures. This leave-in probe design is great for roasting meats in the oven or for making smoked meats on a barbeque. The monitoring base gives the temperature reading and includes a programmable, pre-settable alarm. You set the alarm between 32 and 392 degrees Fahrenheit, and it will sound when the temperature reaches that level. This alarm function is good for tracking rising temperatures. However, it doesn&#39;t include a function for tracking declining temperatures, a function normally sought for such things as making yogurt.","A memory function is included on the digital display. This helps you to track past temperature readings and efficiently monitor the progress of your meat. The display reads in both Fahrenheit and Celsius –a nice feature to aid you in preparing recipes written in either format. The Polder Classic Digital Thermometer includes a high-heat silicone cord that is 43 inches long. This is longer than similar leave-in food thermometer cords, so you can be sure this leave-in food thermometer will be long enough to make it outside of deeper ovens.","There is a 24-hour countdown timer built into the Polder Classic Digital Thermometer. You can use this timer independent of the thermometer. There is also a magnetic wall mount on the back of the thermometer. This allows you to double the Polder Classic Digital Thermometer as a kitchen timer that can conveniently hang from most refrigerators.","The Polder Classic Digital Thermometer temperature range is 32 to 392 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 200 degrees Celsius. A single AAA battery powers the monitoring base, which is included with the thermometer. The on/off button is useful to aid you in extending the battery life of the thermometer.","Taking the guesswork out of cooking improves your ability to produce quality food. The Polder Classic Digital Thermometer, with its leave-in capabilities, helps you to monitor your food to provide a better result."]},"id":"02128777-e623-4ff6-9f2d-b93dc8cd4b06","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58146","url":"/polder-classic-digital-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T20:51:19Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T20:51:19Z","name":"Polder Classic Digital THM-362-86RM","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-11-13T20:51:19Z","id":"aaZWuccURnvKY8u6otvkTo","meta":{"title":"Polder Classic Digital THM-362-86RM Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Polder Classic Digital Thermometer is a food thermometer with a built-in timer that serves as a very handy kitchen tool.
