Data transfer speeds can theoretically reach 300Mbps, a figure that rivals many wired Ethernet connections. Admittedly, that figure is very dependent on environmental factors and network traffic but real life performance is still notably better that before.","Inevitably, radio signals to and from the adapter bounce off furniture, walls and other obstacles. Previously, those random signals confused the Wi-Fi network, creating dead spots and reducing range. Now with Multiple-input/Multiple-output (MIMO), smart technology, those signals are exploited in such a way that they nearly eliminate dead spots and put an entire typical home within range.","Users of the adapter can prioritize various types of network traffic so that the most time sensitive information gets through without interruption from lower-priority data.","As a single band device operating in the 2.4GHz range, there are some notable drawbacks when compared to a dual band adapter that also uses the 5GHz range. Numerous products, including those that use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless technologies transmit in the 2.4GHz range so interference is a possibility. Even remote controlled toys and household appliances have the potential for interrupting this data. That possibility is virtually eliminated in the 5GHz range.","The 2.4GHz range is also less suited to transmitting high bandwidth data that is required for streaming HD entertainment content, extreme gaming and VoIP telephone and video calls."]},"id":"a5659990-6bc4-4465-90de-f28aa0d73c69","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Security"},"id":"8a0462a2-e084-4703-919b-a29b442ca098","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Wi-Fi n standard uses a number of protocols to keep data secure and to prevent unauthorized access to the network. The first generation Wired Equivalent Privacy, WEP, system is still in use. Though it remains useful, it isn’t very difficult to hack, and it shouldn’t be used alone to protect sensitive data. WPA, Wi-Fi Protected Access and its successor, WPA2, are also employed to add far more effective layers of protection. WPA2 especially, with its Advanced Encryption Standard, provides a very secure environment for even the most important information. AES is widely used by governments and major corporations to protect their networks and, to date, there is no record of it having been cracked."]},"id":"cb17fcc3-60be-41af-b908-ecb3489c3b3e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"ca9bb244-d995-4c63-87de-3ecf512cc40f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A standout feature of the Wireless N+ is its USB extension cable and mounting stand.
