Sure the price is a little high, but an absolute bargain compared to what far lesser devices cost not at all long ago. And, whether manufacturers like it or not, retailers start the competitive process of discounting them as soon as they hit the market. The JVC GZ-HM400 is not only a superb video camera but also a great still camera. It’s easy to use and is within reach financially for many consumers."]},"id":"d42afd59-b0ae-4d3c-9e05-5bcbf1f34613","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"c59112a0-66c0-451d-9645-167cc3a68452","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Not surprisingly, most comments made about the rapidly advancing characteristics in modern photography, both still and video, are based on the electronics. We don’t disagree with that, but in the case of the JVC GZ-HM400, want to start our remarks drawing attention to the excellent Konica Minolta HD lens. After all, without high quality optics, all the electronic wizardry is pretty worthless and this lens is a real winner. It’s equipped with 10x optical zoom, which is far preferable to digital zoom for maintaining image quality at high magnification and rather cleverly has an automatic lens cover that opens or closes as the device is activated or turned off. That said, the camera additionally offers 200x digital zoom for those distant shots that you want to bring close but, as with any other digital zoom, there will be increasing quality degradation as magnification increases. In addition to the two zoom methods available with these devices, we also particularly like the large zoom rocker located on the top rear of the camera. Its size and placement make it easy to make subtle adjustments adding to the professional quality of filming.","The other most critical element of the image quality lies in the electronic image sensor…that bit of hardware that actually records the image. The JVC GZ-HM400 has a 10.3-megapixel resolution which is, by any standard, a lot. It’s important to know, however, that just the number of pixels, those little dots that record the image, is important, the photography industry has generally done a disservice to the buying public by quoting ever increasing numbers of pixels. At least as important is the size of the sensor which is known as the Closed Coupling Device or CCD. Typical consumer and prosumer cameras have a CCD type called CMOS, as has the GZ-HM400. The method of measuring the size of the CCD goes back to a difficult to understand ratio system them stems from the 1950s. In the case of the GZ-HM400, that measure is 1/2.33 inches which, without going into unbearably boring detail, means that it’s big and translates into high image quality.","The image quality translates into a genuine 9-megapixel still camera which, despite ways that statistics can be manipulated, is far better than that available on most video cameras. The GZ-HM400 has a dedicated still photo button which makes taking great photos without interrupting video shooting a very simple matter.","The flip out 2.8-inch LCD viewing screen is pretty typical of others available today featuring 16:9 ratio wide angle viewing. One rather gimmicky to cool feature is that opening the screen turns the camera on and opens the integrated lens cover while closing the screen has the opposite effect. On the other hand, the screen also features a laser touch user interface which is equally gimmicky but far less inviting. Please take a look at our Expert Reviews section, below, for some more details.","The JVC GZ-HM400 has 32GB of built-in flash memory which is faster and more reliable that other recording media, such as DVDs or hard drives  in that there are no moving parts. The camera also will accommodate an addition SD/SDHC memory card up to 32GB, effectively doubling the storage size.","The JVC GZ-HM400 shoots 1920 x 1080 Full HD AVCHD format at 60 frames per second. In UXP video recording mode, it records at 24Mbps, the highest bit rate currently available for AVCHD video systems.  It features superior optical video stabilization to reduce the effects of movement and camera shake and has a built-in filming light and flash. It features a low lux/night shooting mode, face detection and multiple simple methods for transferring recorded content including one button transfer and an HDMI connector."]},"id":"2ada0972-23da-459a-a264-584f054643d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"1ca62828-5dc8-49be-aa45-a16e5596b2a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Laser Touch controls are the one feature of the JVC GZ-HM400 that consistently draws negative comments from reviews.
