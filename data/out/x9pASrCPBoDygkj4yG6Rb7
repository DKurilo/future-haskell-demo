That&#39;s pretty impressive. This is partly due to its high-efficiency cycles and partly due to its super-high spin speed (1,000 rpm), which gets the job done faster and means your clothes, having had most of their moisture already removed, will take less time in the dryer. That&#39;s good for your clothes and good for your electric bill.
