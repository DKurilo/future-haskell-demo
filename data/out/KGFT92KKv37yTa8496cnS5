In our most recent testing, we compared eight products to see which whitened most effectively, was the most comfortable to use and offered the best tools to track your progress. We paid particular attention to which gels irritated teeth and gums, and we also noted whether a gel had an unpleasant taste. We wanted the best ranking teeth whiteners to only take a small number of whitening sessions and to be comfortable. We had a tester assigned to each product so we could better understand the whitening process and how long the effects lasted for.","<strong>How We Evaluated<br/></strong>We had a tester for each product and had them track their progress and experiences. We noted each tester’s initial tooth shade and then when the treatment period ended we compared it against the final shade to see how well it worked. The best products brightened teeth by 20 percent while less powerful products only brightened by 10 percent. We scored products higher that provided better results. Additionally, after the treatments ended, we tracked each user’s teeth to see which whiteners lasted the longest. Products that provided long-term results scored higher in our testing.","Gels that cause minimal irritation and taste good scored higher than gels that create soreness or blisters or that taste unpleasant. Kits that come with whitening pens scored higher since they allow you to touch up dark spots. And products that come with shade guides also scored higher since they make it easier for you to track your progress.","We contacted each company to see how easy it was to communicate with them. Companies that responded to our inquiries quickly and respectfully scored higher. We also gave more points to companies that offered online assistance like instructions, FAQs pages and video tutorials.","<strong>Teeth Whiteners: What to Look For<br/></strong>When you are looking for the best teeth whitening options, you want a product that provides results quickly and doesn&#39;t require a large amount of effort. The best teeth whitening kits include everything you need to achieve a pearly white smile with no extra purchases. Below are the criteria we used to evaluate the best teeth whitening products.","Performance<br/>Performance and quality are vital aspects of the best teeth whitening products. Look for testimonials and satisfaction guarantees as well as products that are clinically proven. Also, make sure the product states that it is safe on your teeth&#39;s enamel, gums and other areas of your mouth, with a snug-fitting mouthpiece or strips. The best kits keep your smile looking bright longer than just a few days after treatment.","Comfort<br/>Drastically improving the color of your teeth won&#39;t happen in a matter of minutes. It will take time. However, many of the best home teeth whiteners make the teeth whitening process simple. They include mouth trays or strips that you wear for just a few minutes every day. The whitening gel should have a pleasant taste and shouldn’t cause any burning or blistering.<br/><br/>Tools<br/>Most of the teeth whitening kits we reviewed provide all the tools you need to whiten your teeth, and some kits provide many additional items beyond gel and trays. Whitening lights can add a lot more brightness, and whitening pens can help you get hard-to-reach areas under control. Some provide a shade guide so you can accurately gauge the difference the whitening kit is making. Not all the tools are essential, so you must decide which are important to you and find a product that offers the items you want.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Teeth whitening makers should provide you with the information you need to use your product safely. It should also be easy to contact them without having to break down too many walls. A phone number and email address are usually enough to keep you informed, but the best manufacturers go the extra mile by interacting via social media and putting up FAQs sections with instructions.","By using the above criteria and our in-depth reviews, you can find a high-quality teeth whitening kit that gives you a Hollywood-style smile in no time.","id:1084"]},"id":"c77619f3-fa81-4cfd-aba3-e70be209c52c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_230","url":"/best-teeth-whiteners","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-02-05T19:46:06Z","datePublished":"2018-02-05T19:46:06Z","name":"Best Teeth Whiteners of 2018","synopsis":"Teeth whitening products use bleaching chemicals to destroy stains on your teeth.
