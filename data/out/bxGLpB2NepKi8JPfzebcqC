A healthy mouth makes such a difference in a person&#39;s appearance, self esteem, as well as their overall health.","Stacy works for an independent dentist&#39;s office, where she assists the dentist and dental hygienists by cleaning and sterilizing the tools they use and by preparing exam rooms. In addition, she greets and escorts patients to exam rooms. She asks them if they have been experiencing any tooth sensitivity or pain and makes notes for the dentist regarding specific problem areas, if there are any. She often assists at the reception desk by scheduling appointments with patients. Sometimes she will make phone calls to insurance companies to verify coverage for certain types of procedures. She also assists with filing and accounts payable as needed.","One of Stacy&#39;s most important responsibilities as a dental assistant is cleaning and sterilizing the equipment and tools that the dentist and dental hygienists use in their work. She also preps stations by laying out the tools they will need for scheduled procedures. She works closely with the dentist and other staff at the office. The dentist usually gives her tasks such as developing x-rays or explaining to patients about what to expect during an upcoming procedure such as a root canal or bridge. She prepares packets of gauze and numbing medication for patients to use following procedures. She also explains to children how to properly brush and floss their teeth.","During the past six months, Stacy has been able to assist the dentist chair-side while he is performing dental work. This is a task that the dentist only assigns staff that he trusts the most. She will hand tools to the dentist, and she will keep mouths clear throughout the procedure using gauze or a suction device. Working chair-side with the dentist is the part of her vocational career that she enjoys most because it is where she learns the most about dental procedures. The work that her dentist does is truly an art form, and she is lucky to work for a very good dentist. Rarely will patients return needing a filling fixed that he has done, although he fixes many fillings that patients have had done elsewhere in the past.","Stacy is presently in the process of going back to school to become a dental hygienist, which will make her more marketable in the dental industry and increase her salary. She is pursuing a two-year program which will qualify her to perform cleanings as well as some minor dental procedures, and it will also increase her salary.","There is an emphasis on cordiality and customer service in Stacy&#39;s vocational career as a dental assistant. The office where she works is always clean and orderly, and she is never at a loss for things to do. She enjoys helping put patients at ease, and she likes working in an office where the morale is so positive and so focused on serving people. Her organizational skills and attention to detail make her an asset to her office."]},"id":"d13426ed-157c-48cd-b7c3-846743b399d1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50105","url":"/dental-assistants-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-20T18:57:12Z","datePublished":"2010-07-20T18:57:12Z","name":"Dental Assistants","synopsis":"Dental assistants have one of the shortest training periods of any of the vocational careers we reviewed.
