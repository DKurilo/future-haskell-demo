It&#39;s half as costly as others, but it lacks some of the features and capabilities of more expensive units. At 60Hz, it doesn&#39;t refresh as fast as others in our lineup, nor does it have HDR capabilities to make the picture look extra vivid, but it comes loaded with a handful of streaming apps and has an easy interface to navigate through.","We tested all of the LED TVs by watching 4K content and a number of UHD movies. We watched the TVs from straight on, left and right of center, and with the lights both on and off. Comparing TVs side by side puts a TV&#39;s shortcomings on display.","One of the first things we noted with this TV is that it does not have good off-axis viewing. When you sit left or right of center, the screen begins to wash out badly. This can be troublesome for viewing with a large party of people. People to the left and right sides of the TV will have to look at a washed-out screen.","Compared to the competition, this LED flat screen TV can&#39;t get very dark. As we watched &#34;Gravity&#34; the sky appeared a more grayish color than the absolute black that should be displayed. The lack of contrast doesn&#39;t allow the picture to pop off the screen like it does with the best LED TVs in our lineup.","When we streamed a 4K musical performance of Emi Myers, the Hisense TV could not refresh fast enough to make the picture ultra-smooth. You could see tracers when the musicians&#39; hands moved. Other TVs refresh as fast as 240Hz, but since the Hisense only refreshes at a maximum of 60Hz, the performance we streamed experienced picture problems.","The smart interface within the TV has a nice layout that makes options easy to find. The interface starts you out with 21 apps that include Netflix and YouTube. The interface is easy to navigate, but the web browser isn&#39;t as simple. You have to use the arrows on the remote to move the cursor, but the cursor on the screen is slow and not smooth. It takes too long to move the cursor from one side of the screen to another.","The TV features four HDMI ports and three USB ports. This is standard for LED TVs and is more than enough ports to connect all your HDMI devices to your TV at once. This TV is available in both 50 and 55 inches."]},"id":"d843b1cc-fc0d-4444-8321-ffe92bb6e0c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bf79b3ef-7490-422e-a9b6-856fb9b2d564","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hisense 50H8C isn&#39;t the best LED TV in our comparison, but it is decent if you are on a budget.
