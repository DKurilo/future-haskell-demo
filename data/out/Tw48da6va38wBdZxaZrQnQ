It measures 2.95 x 9.06 x 10.24 inches, which makes it the smallest player in our comparison and a great option for anyone living in a small apartment. And despite its small size, it’s still packed with all the standard features you’d expect to see in a DVD player.","In our tests, the CVD401A and its accompanying remote control were pretty easy to set up and use. It comes with everything you need to get it set up, including AV cables and batteries for the remote. There is also an HDMI connection, but not a USB port as there is with the best DVD player options, such as the <a href=\"/panasonic-dvd-s700-review\">Panasonic DVD-S700</a>. The remote control has all the buttons you need but still manages to feel intuitive and doesn’t look cluttered.","The CVD401A is capable of playing rewriteable DVDs and CDs, in addition to standard ones. It’s compatible with DVD-R, DVD-RW, CD-R AND CD-RW rewriteable formats, and CDs will work whether they contain audio or JPEG format photos. Built-in progressive scan helps smooth out your video playback for an optimal viewing experience, while the upscaling feature improves low-resolution image quality up to 1080p full HD.","If you want to watch a movie in a foreign language, such as Spanish or French, the DVD player supports both audio files and subtitles for them. The player also supports Dolby audio, so you can enjoy high-quality audio whether you’re watching a movie or listening to music. It also has a nifty feature that marks where you leave off playing the most recently used disc, so it can automatically resume playback from that exact point whenever you’re ready to.","The player ships with a 90-day warranty from the manufacturer, which is the shortest of any in our comparison. Most of the other warranties featured in our lineup are at least for one year or offer one year for parts and 90 days for labor. However, the manufacturer hosts a frequently asked questions section on its website, along with a user manual and firmware downloads, which should help you learn more about the DVD player or troubleshoot basic problems, should they occur. You can also contact the company’s customer support team via phone or email."]},"id":"993f07ef-755c-49e1-9d81-f7d4a4e076fb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70208","url":"/craig-cvd401a-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-07T15:54:26Z","datePublished":"2018-09-07T15:54:26Z","name":"Craig CVD401A","synopsis":"The Craig CVD401A is a powerful DVD player, especially considering its small size.
