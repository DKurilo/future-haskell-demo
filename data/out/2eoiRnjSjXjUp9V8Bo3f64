The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-auto-loan-services\">Auto Loans</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","myAutoloan.com is a brokerage operated by Horizon Digital Finance. It connects you with auto loan offers from dealerships and financial institutions. It rates well in terms of application, repayment and loan versatility but lacks some important customer service resources.","As a broker, there is more variance with the loans you find through myAutoloan than with services that offer you loans directly. There are some restrictions in order to be eligible for a car loan with this service. You need to earn at minimum $1,800 a month to be eligible for a loan, which is a standard that many other services we reviewed require. There is also a minimum loan amount of $8,000.","You can apply for a loan online, and most applicants are pre-approved the same day they apply. Because the true source of your loan varies, factors such as whether you can sign documents online or what other documents you need to submit alongside your application depend on the dealership or financial institution you choose to service your auto loan.","We rated every loan service on our review for the flexibility of the loans it offers. One of the advantages of using brokerages is that they rate very well on loan flexibility, and myAutoloan is no exception. This service provides you with multiple loan offers, and you can apply whether or not you have a specific car in mind. You can use loans through myAutoloan at franchised dealers and in some cases to buy a car from a private seller but not at independent dealers.","If you don&#39;t have a specific car in mind, myAutoloan has tools on its website to help you search and compare cars in your area. You can get loans for cars with up to 100,000 miles and cars as old as 2008.","This auto loan service received a 60 percent score on our customer service score. This is because it refers you to email and can&#39;t be reached by phone. Email response was not as prompt as other services and often would only reply with links to its website."]},"id":"79f68f41-41cd-4294-a933-f444bf39f567","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6fd0b5c7-329e-4ddc-89ad-1d59e85e19a1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["myAutoloan.com is a brokerage that offers an online application and connects you with loan offers from both dealerships and financial institutions.
