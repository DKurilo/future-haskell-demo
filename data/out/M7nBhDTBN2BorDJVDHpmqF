The aspect ratio of 16:9 and the decent resolution of 848 x 480 make this a handy pocket projector when you need to make a presentation on the go or want to show off some photos to friends.

The highest resolution of this pico projector is WVGA 848 x 480, which isn&#39;t necessarily bad. We were pleased to see that the aspect ratio is 16:9, with an option of 4:3. The contrast is excellent at 2000:1, but the brightness, which is one of the most import variables in a quality picture, is only 50 ANSI lumens. This only means that you have to make sure the room is dark so you can see the projected picture. The image size ranging from 9 to 85 inches is just about average. Overall, this all adds up to a reliable picture."]},"id":"616b28c3-1ff5-418d-a92b-d8d0e526be04","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Projection System"},"id":"79c44d75-d8c2-466e-9135-1542576dc377","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This mobile projector doesnâ€™t have many port options available, but the two it does have makes it very versatile.

We were pleased with the long lamp life of 20,000 hours, as well as the relatively long battery life of two hours. This portable projector also has an internal memory capacity of 128MB, and if that isn&#39;t enough, you can always use the SD card slot. This slot makes it really easy to load your presentation or photos so you can show them on the go without worrying about the hassle of bringing along extra equipment. With the built in 0.5W speaker, you don&#39;t even have to worry about packing external speakers. This is truly a pocket projector at only 5.3 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches, and it weighs half a pound (not including the battery).
