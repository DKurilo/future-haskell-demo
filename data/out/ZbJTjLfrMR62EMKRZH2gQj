Most fees and features of this card aren&#39;t that different from other prepaid credit cards, but the free calling option is a unique and important advantage.","The RushCard prepaid credit card does not charge an activation fee, but you pay a one-time fee to purchase the card. After that, you have the option of paying a monthly service fee or choosing the pay-as-you-go plan. If you use your card often, paying the monthly fee may work better for you, as the other plan requires you to pay for every transaction.","Like other prepaid cards, you can manage your RushCard account online, but you can purchase a paper statement. Other charges RushCard charges include ATM withdrawals at out-of-network cash machines, ATM balance inquiries and card-to-card transfers. If the RushCard isn&#39;t used in a 90-day period, an inactivity fee is imposed (where allowed by law).","The combined maximum amount of purchases and cash withdrawals you can make with the RushCard is in the thousands. The ATM cash withdrawal allowance is higher than with most prepaid credit cards. You can pay your bills with the RushCard and not incur any charges.","Online account management, as well as email and text message alerts of account transactions and status, are standard features and are not charged.","Daily maximum deposits are capped in the thousands for direct deposit and quite a bit less for cash transactions. In addition to direct deposit and transfers from bank accounts, you can deposit funds via MoneyGram and PayPal.","In addition to free telephone customer service to all customers, RushCard has a comprehensive FAQs section and fee chart on its website that spells out all that you may owe. They also offer an automated voice response telephone service as well as customer support by email, fax and standard mail.","When looking for a prepaid credit card, RushCard Visa is worth a look. Its pricing plans differ somewhat in their structure from other cards, but you get free customer support, text and email alerts, and a mobile app so you can track your balance and transactions."]},"id":"9dfba65e-667f-4e9e-8d15-08b582443b6e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3392","url":"/rushcard-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-07-16T20:52:44Z","datePublished":"2009-07-16T20:52:44Z","name":"RushCard","synopsis":"If you're looking for a prepaid credit card that offers customers free phone support, the RushCard prepaid Visa card is a viable option.
