With the bureaucratic nightmare that often permeates the insurance business in mind, American General claims to simplify matters for their clients. With straightforward policies, useful articles and easy online account management, American General is a good resource for your life insurance needs.","American General provides straightforward insurance policies and makes certain that you have a clear idea of any policy you purchase. With American General, you know exactly what you’re signing up for. This is far and away one of the best aspects of American General.","American General offers life insurance policies well suited for every set of needs. Their term life insurance pays out benefits only in the event of death. AG Select-a-Term life insurance is available in 10-, 12- and 15- through 30-year terms. Term life insurance doesn’t accumulate any cash value, but given that its premiums are the most affordable, it is a very popular policy choice. If you&#39;re worried about cost, term life insurance quotes are available through email or phone and are usually very affordable.","More costly life insurance policies include American General’s universal life, index universal life, variable universal life and whole life insurance policies. Premiums vary on the policies according to payout potential and the cash value of the policies. Depending on the degree to which you’re hoping to use your life insurance policy as a financial tool, American General’s non-term policies offer varying degrees of payouts and death benefits. American Elite Whole Life converts a portion of every premium to cash value, which can be cashed out at a cost to death benefit payouts. American General offers a handful of variable life insurance plans that function primarily as long-term legacy investment tools. American General Income Advantage select, for example, accumulates cash value, has flexible premium payments, includes death benefits and can be configured to contribute to a retirement fund.","If death benefits aren’t high on your list of priorities, American General also offers clients annuity plans. You have the choice of deferred annuities and immediate income annuities. Immediate income annuities require you to pay a lump sum up front and continue to pay out for the rest of your life. American General has a variety of deferred annuities tailored according to premium payments, contract length and payout.
