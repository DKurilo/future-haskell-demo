Consumers who are movie enthusiasts find this added bonus refreshing since many have tried to find a way to upload their favorite movie titles to their personal media devices and enjoy their movies on the go. They&#39;ll still want to protect their originals using <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a> though. While digital copy may not be as commonplace as the days of duplicating cassette tapes, it is becoming increasingly popular. Understanding all the ins and outs of digital copy will make its evolution much easier and more enjoyable for consumers.","Misunderstood facts regarding digital copy include its provisions and limited availability. Moviemakers provide digital copy with select movie titles as an added bonus for movie lovers who purchase their personal copy right away after its initial market release. In doing so, they limit the time this bonus is active. Digital copy downloads are usually active for one year from the initial release date. After this date, you will not be able to download your digital copy. While it is true that the digital copy is stored on the disc you have in hand from your purchased set, you can only use the redemption code provided on the insert for one year. Since you must go online and redeem your code to unlock the digital copy, it stands to reason that you will need to do so before this year expires.","Problems arise when consumers purchase DVD and Blu-ray Movies well past their initial release date and yet still think they are getting the added bonus of a digital copy. Whether they purchase their favorite movie right away upon release or some great time later, they generally still are not too concerned with downloading their digital copy right away, and this makes for great disappointment later when they try to download it and discover that their redemption codes have expired.","You can avert this issue if you understand the nature of digital copyright, and that it is a bonus with a time limit. Take just a few moments to redeem your activation codes and download your digital copy content as soon as you purchase a DVD or Blu-ray movie with a digital copy bonus.","Most manufacturers&#39; coupons have an expiration date, and it might serve us well to associate the same understanding with redemption codes. It would also thrust the evolution of digital copy usage forward if moviemakers would be clearer in their promotional materials. While expiration dates are included on the DVD and/or Blu-ray packaging, the redemption inserts, on the disk itself and on the redemption site, it doesn&#39;t appear to be clearly visible or well understood by consumers.","So what options are available for those who have expired redemption codes? The options are extremely limited, and none is guaranteed. Some people have found that if they try the activation code, it works regardless of the date. Others have approached technical support and have been able to get replacement codes, but this requires verification and is a long shot at best. Finally, if the expiration has occurred within just a few days, some consumers have found a way to beat the system by resetting their computer s internal date and time. None of these solutions is solid and may just add to your frustration if they are unsuccessful. It is far better to make a habit of enjoying your movie to the fullest extent by activating your digital copy immediately.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"fa867a8e-f88d-4228-a555-0436ddf0c0ed","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5659","url":"/the-evolution-of-digital-media","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"freelance-writer","url":"/author/freelance-writer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Freelance Writer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"Akz9KpygQ2NYjLzeacBHkK","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-28T21:06:08Z","datePublished":"2011-03-28T21:06:08Z","name":"The Evolution of Digital Media","synopsis":"Today, moviemakers across the board are starting to add the bonus feature of digital copy to their newly released DVD and Blu-ray movies.","review":{},"strapline":"Today, moviemakers across the board are starting to add the bonus feature of digital copy to their newly released DVD and Blu-ray movies.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-03-28T21:10:44Z","id":"ybEnWA4hSnQfSbqJMSCeAQ","meta":{"title":"The Evolution of Digital Media","description":"What do you do when your digital copy has expired?"},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:56:33Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ZdfvofMEBTKVN3nH7jm6eJ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:33Z","mimeType":"","name":"5659-the-evolution-of-digital-media.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5659-the-evolution-of-digital-media.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:33Z","id":"ZdfvofMEBTKVN3nH7jm6eJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZdfvofMEBTKVN3nH7jm6eJ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Evolution of Digital Media","description":"What do you do when your digital copy has expired?"},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ZdfvofMEBTKVN3nH7jm6eJ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:33Z","mimeType":"","name":"5659-the-evolution-of-digital-media.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5659-the-evolution-of-digital-media.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:33Z","id":"ZdfvofMEBTKVN3nH7jm6eJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZdfvofMEBTKVN3nH7jm6eJ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Evolution of Digital Media","description":"What do you do when your digital copy has expired?"}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/the-evolution-of-digital-media","label":"","tags":[]}
