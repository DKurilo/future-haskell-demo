You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Elite USB <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">medical alert ID bracelet</a> is a patented device from Universal Medical Data that features a 2GB waterproof flash drive that securely holds your important medical information. You can also choose to have your most critical information engraved onto the bracelet to help EMTs treat you appropriately in an emergency. This medical alert bracelet uses an exclusive micro-surfaced acrylic that allows you to engrave up to five lines on the front and five on the back, with a maximum of 15 characters per line.","This USB medical alert bracelet, whihc is similar to the <a href=\"/care-review\">CARE</a> and <a href=\"/key2life-usb-medi-chip-review\">Key2Life</a> bracelets, is both sturdy and waterproof so you can wear it anywhere. The USB is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers and requires no special software or drivers. A high-profile blue star of life symbol is on the front of the bracelet, and this universal symbol makes it easy for first responders all around the world to recognize it as a medical alert bracelet. While the primary part of the bracelet is acrylic, the clasp and accent pieces are made from stainless steel, giving it both style and durability.","The Elite USB Medical Alert ID Bracelet also features two debossed messages for EMTs: One that informs medical staff to look underneath for medical information and another that lets them know that the device may have a USB drive. These two messages help to ensure that in an emergency you get the care that you need as quickly as possible. Additionally, you have the option to engrave the bracelet with two custom messages, and these are ideal for pertinent information such as allergies and medications that require special consideration, or an emergency contact.","When you purchase this medical alert USB flash drive you also have the option to use an online registry. You can then print your information on an emergency medical card (EMC) that fits in your wallet. You will also receive a Tyvek sleeve printed with the star of life and valuable information. Information that you can put on your EMC includes name, address, phone number, organ donor information, medical conditions, medications, allergies and emergency contact information. While your online information is viewable by anyone, it cannot be changed without your password.","The Elite USB Medical Alert ID Bracelet comes at a midrange price point and offers plenty of features. The information engraved on the bracelet, included on the USB and printed on the EMC, ensure that medical personnel will know about factors that could affect your treatment, whether you are attending a regular checkup or finding yourself in an emergency."]},"id":"9d70f81e-efb8-4b0e-9ba5-b0f3288bbbd3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63671","url":"/the-elite-usb-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:10:29Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:10:29Z","name":"The Elite USB","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-24T19:10:29Z","id":"oqsFhQ6r4dioqHvBPsS8YJ","meta":{"title":"The Elite USB Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Elite USB Medical Alert ID Bracelet securely holds your medical information.
