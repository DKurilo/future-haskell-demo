Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magellan Roadmate 1700 may not have every item on our checklist, but if you have any concerns about screen size, this is the <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> unit for you. With seven inches of screen, you really can&#39;t help but get the full picture about where you are and where you need to go. If you are more likely to listen to the turn-by-turn directions coming from your navigation GPS, the screen size becomes far less important, but visual learners will really appreciate the massiveness of this screen. It&#39;s also a potential lifesaver. If you can spot something faster on a large screen, you’ll spend less time with your eyes off the roadway. That means a quicker response time to hazards. That could save lives. Or, at the very least, it will make things easier to see.","The safety perks with this navigation GPS unit continue with the highway lane assist feature. This will prepare you for your next turn by making sure you know about the turn and which lane you need to be in to keep you on course. This will save you from panicked moments on the off ramp. Keeping your cool means you will be able to use your best judgment.","The QuickSpell with SmartCity feature will save you some time by recognizing your destination, even if you spell it wrong, and helping you plot a route with multiple stops to make sure you take the most efficient way possible for your longer lists of errands.","If you belong to the American Automobile Association (AAA), you will enjoy the locator feature if you happen to break down. The feature helps AAA staffers pinpoint your location fast so you don&#39;t have to try and describe where you are to the operator. The AAA also provides a TourBook feature with this navigation GPS unit, which will offer AAA ratings and descriptions for restaurants, hotels and more. This unit also helps you on your summertime road trip, pointing out places along the highway to find gas, ATMs and restaurants.","This navigation GPS comes with a great feature called OneTouch that lets you bookmark favorite places. The unit will then help you find your way back to those places with one touch, regardless of where you are at the time.","This navigation GPS unit comes with pre-loaded maps of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. With some GPS units, the preloaded maps list usually includes Mexico, not Puerto Rico, but with the Magellan Roadmate 1700, you’ll have to buy Mexico maps separately. That may or may not be a drawback for you.","More serious drawbacks with this navigation GPS unit include lack of Bluetooth compatibility, voice recognition and short battery life. None are deal breakers on their own, but for a unit that has so many wonderful safety features we were surprised it would leave out Bluetooth and voice recognition technologies. Both can help you keep your hands on the wheel instead of pressing buttons on your phone or navigation GPS unit."]},"id":"427cdbee-7507-49b3-a015-bd04a542dec2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"26a8a566-1e51-4d13-b723-1960fd156ea0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Lack of Bluetooth, voice recognition and long battery life notwithstanding, this unit offers some good features.
