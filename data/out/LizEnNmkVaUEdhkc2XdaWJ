Energy Star products are generally 20 to 30 percent more efficient than what is required by law. This Haier unit has three fan speeds, so you can use the lowest one that is effective for cooling your room. This can offer significant savings over products that are either on full blast or off.","This window air conditioning unit can move 200 cubic feet of air per minute. That will cool a room very quickly and is second only to one other air conditioner in our comparison. It also can remove 1.5 pints of moisture per hour, which will make it feel cooler, faster. The average among products we reviewed was 1.4 so this unit is above average for fighting humidity. The impressive 11.2 energy efficiency rating (EER) means it is designed to use every watt effectively.","Size is important in your choice of window air conditioner. A unit that is too small will struggle to keep the room cool enough. A unit that is too big will cool too quickly, before it can remove humidity from the air, leaving cold and clammy air. For our review we looked specifically at the Haier ESAQ406P, which has 6,050 British thermal units (Btu).
