We wanted to find 10 excellent vacuum storage bags, but did not want them all to be the same type. Instead, we searched for a variety of top-quality bags to provide a wide-ranging selection of styles that would work for homeowners, apartment dwellers, frequent travelers, people who have plenty of soft items to store but little space, anyone who might have to close a summer house or cabin, parents storing still-usable children’s clothes (possibly for use as hand-me-downs) and basically anyone who wants to keep valued soft items safe and clean for later use.","Armed with a thorough background in how these bags work not only to save space, but also to preserve soft items, we checked further to see what consumers had written about particular brands.","We sought out good value: strong bags that are reusable, sets of bags, and those that would be economical and versatile. We wanted to find a range of bags that could be used for various purposes, as well as a range of price points.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","There’s a lot out there to learn about vacuum storage bags. We scoured the internet for information about vacuum sealer bags and watched user videos. We read specialized blogs and watched television shows that dealt with decluttering homes; checked out travel advice columns; read about the perils of <a href=\"/best-pest-control-services\">insects</a>, <a href=\"/best-mold-test-kits\">mildew and mold</a> in articles published by home economists in county extension offices throughout the United States; and examined the vacuum sealer bags now being produced by various manufacturers.","We eliminated vacuum sealer bags that many consumers denounced as too flimsy and looked for durable plastic bags that would offer the best value in terms of use and cost.","<strong>How much do vacuum sealer bags cost?</strong>","The most economical vacuum sealer bags cost about $20 for at least six bags. You can purchase packages of 14 or more bags for over $30 and a single specialty sized bag for about $10.","<strong><br/>What Features to Look for in Vacuum Sealer Bags?</strong>","Size<br/>When you have big, bulky items to store, such as puffy quilts or ski parkas, it&#39;s important to have bags big enough to handle everything. Often it’s best to get a set of bags with different sizes so you can organize your storage so, for example, you&#39;ve got sweaters in one, bedding in another and easily folded summer clothes in another. ","Durability<br/>All plastic bags can puncture or tear, but good-quality plastic bags are less likely to break. That means the extracted air stays out of the bag, it stays nice and flat, and your closet or shelf storage area looks tidy. Even more important, the things inside the bag stay protected.","Bag Reuse<br/>It can certainly save money and provide plenty of convenience if you can reuse vacuum sealer bags. Only the really strong bags are reusable, and they typically cost a bit more. However, being able to use a bag, empty it for a season, then reuse it once you need to put away those Christmas sweaters or summer capris is worth the investment.<br/> ","<strong>What are the best bags to use for vacuum sealing food?</strong>","The bags you use for vacuum sealing food are designed to withstand the heat from the sealing process, so Ziploc-type bags won’t work. They’re also much smaller than the vacuum storage bags we’ve discussed on this page. Additionally, the inside is textured instead of smooth, allowing the air to be sucked out more efficiently and drawing the bag closer to the food to prevent spoilage.","Most manufacturers recommend using the bags specifically designed for their vacuum sealer, and most machines come with several premade bags or a roll of plastic for creating your own. We did use the bags interchangeably during <a href=\"/best-vacuum-food-sealers\">our testing of the best vacuum food sealers</a>, since not all machines came with their own bags. But we also created our own bags using the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JESPZZ4/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Housable Vacuum Sealer Roll</a>, a roll of plastic specifically designed for food sealing, because we wanted to see how well a non-brand bag would work with each of the vacuum food sealers. These worked just as well as the name brand bags, and in some cases were better. Bags we made with the Housable Vacuum Sealer Roll laid flat, sealed well and didn’t smudge when we wrote on them.","<strong>Related Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"2cad8c9a-5eb7-4943-9072-ba5b9e1c5fad","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-vacuums-review\">The Best Vacuum Cleaners</a>","<a href=\"/best-moving-containers\">The Best Moving Containers</a>","<a href=\"/best-mold-test-kits\">The Best Mold Test Kits</a>","<a href=\"/best-pest-control-services\">The Best Pest Control Services</a>","<a href=\"/best-food-storage-services\">The Best Long-Term Food Storage</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"76a48ab8-f797-4dac-9a1b-13e75910d5f0","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["id:1343"]},"id":"71e3fa2e-a94c-4b69-9a76-c694d76dab19","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_51","url":"/best-vacuum-sealer-bags","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T21:56:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T21:56:00Z","name":"Best Vacuum Sealer Bags of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best vacuum storage bags including recommendations for under-bed storage, travel and general storage needs.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best vacuum storage bags including recommendations for under-bed storage, travel and general storage needs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-27T23:23:10Z","id":"HFBDuYroQsikucaLJLtiMc","meta":{"title":"Best Vacuum Storage Bags 2019 -
