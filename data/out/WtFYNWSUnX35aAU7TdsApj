Not surprisingly, <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phones</a> still have their fans.","Cell phones have zoomed to must-have status throughout the U.S. The Pew Research Center&#39;s Internet &amp; American Life Project revealed in 2013 that 91 percent of adults use cell phones.","&#34;While the adoption figures are stunning by every measure   the cell phone is the most quickly adopted consumer technology in the history of the world   there are some demographic groups whose embrace of the cell phone is somewhat less avid than others,&#34; the report said.","Those who favored other types of phones include people ages 65 and older, individuals in households earning less than $30,000, people who did not attend college and those living in rural areas, according to the survey.","The Pew Center&#39;s research also showed that as of June 2012, 35.8 percent of American households are now using cell phones exclusively while 15.9 percent get all or most of their calls wirelessly, &#34;even though they still have landlines.&#34;","It is clear that a number of people are hanging on to their landlines, but some are using them to augment wireless communication as well.","So what is the lasting appeal of traditional style phones, which would include the cordless variety?","For one thing, cordless phones are a familiar device and, no doubt, many people feel safer and more comfortable with a technology they know. Cordless phones also offer people the convenience of not racing through the house when the phone rings.","Many models now permit up to 12 handsets along with the base station, which would equip even a generously sized home with a phone in nearly every room. Many models now permit up to 12 handsets along with the base station, which would equip even a generously sized home with a phone in nearly every room. Anyone who has difficulties with mobility or who is tending several small children or who has tasks that keep them in one place will appreciate a cordless phone system with plenty of handsets. It offers the convenience of having a phone available when needed, which certainly beats scrambling around trying to locate a tiny cell phone blaring a tinny version of Beethoven&#39;s Fifth Symphony.","Parents with pre-teens who do not want to pay for cell phone family plan packages might find it cheaper to equip the house with cordless phones. In addition, parents might not want such young kids to have cell phones just yet, but still allow phone conversations about homework, friends, school and more.","There no doubt are people who love both their cell phones and their cordless models. The better quality cordless phones now are equipped with Bluetooth capability and can switch easily between cell and home phone use. This hybrid approach may be just the thing for the &#34;sandwich generation&#34; that finds itself caring for tradition-loving aging parents but who also have cell-crazy teenagers in the house.","Cordless phones also have retained a spot in many situations. Small business owners, for example, might need to communicate with employees working in different parts of a building. The owners also would need phones in the main office to communicate with customers about goods and services. For many such business owners, cordless phones are the best answer for their business communication needs."]},"id":"512bb7a9-192a-48e7-876e-8e6ca1068083","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8096","url":"/cordless-phones-why-we-still-love-them","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-02T17:50:07Z","datePublished":"2013-10-02T17:50:07Z","name":"Cordless Phones: Why We Still Love Them","synopsis":"Despite the fact that cell phone use is everywhere in the United States, traditional phones still retain a faithful consumer group that will not let their receivers be wrenched from their hands.","review":{},"strapline":"Despite the fact that cell phone use is everywhere in the United States, traditional phones still retain a faithful consumer group that will not let their receivers be wrenched from their hands.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-21T15:34:54Z","id":"WtFYNWSUnX35aAU7TdsApj","meta":{"title":"Cordless Phones: Why We Still Love Them","description":"Compare different cordless phones to find out which would work best for your family or small business.
