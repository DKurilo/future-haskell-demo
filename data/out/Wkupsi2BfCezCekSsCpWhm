They take up less space than traditional PCs and are more aesthetically pleasing, making them great for any office space or room in your home. The ThinkCentre Edge 92z all-in-one PC is no exception to the rule. It&#39;s simply beautiful. At 21.5 inches, the screen isn’t the biggest available, but it has a sleek and clean design that will have you staring.","This home PC has an HDMI-in port so you can connect external devices such as a game console. It comes with a DVD burner so you can play CDs and watch DVDs, but there is no Blu-ray drive, so you&#39;ll have to connect to it externally.","With a 1920 x 1080 display resolution, you&#39;ll be able to enjoy movies with friends and family on a crisp and clear screen. It also comes with an HDMI-out port that&#39;s useful for connecting to an extra monitor.","The 10-point touch functionality is ideal if you&#39;re playing an interactive game with a friend or collaborating with a coworker because it allows two hands to interact with the screen at once.","One thing that detracts from this all-one-one desktop&#39;s looks is the wired keyboard and mouse. However, for a small cost you can easily upgrade to the wireless version and keep the clean, wireless design.","There are two USB 3.0 ports and four USB 2.0 ports, so you have reasonable connectivity for external devices.","The HD 1080p webcam is useful for video conferencing if you&#39;re working remotely, and it also helps you keep in touch with family and friends.","At 18.5 pounds, this all-in-one desktop is fairly easy to move around inside your home. This gives you the flexibility to use a table as a multi-use area if you live in a small apartment.","If you run into a problem with your PC and need help, technical support is readily available by email or phone. And if the issue you encounter is urgent, the website also provides a live chat option that will connect you to a representative. For added assurance, the PC also comes with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"8d0959d9-f329-44b0-a6bc-05d47ddb49a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"021bc084-615a-4fd0-becc-8cdd82f659d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ThinkCentre Edge 92z is a good mid-range all-in-one PC that&#39;s great for everyday tasks.
