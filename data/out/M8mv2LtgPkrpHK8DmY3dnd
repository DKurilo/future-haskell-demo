It features large icons to represent its options, and the tools are simple and precise. This screen capture software focuses on the basics. It takes little skill to learn to use, but it also lacks some valuable tools.","Options to capture images and take screenshots include Full Screen, Active Window, Region Capture and Window Object. The Region capture method zooms in on your capture using crosshairs, giving accuracy and control. The Active Window option captures only the active windows on your screen. Window Object uses a black frame to capture any window or shape you want, and you use your mouse to wrap the frame around the desired object. You can capture images as rectangles, ellipses and circles, but not as polygons or freehand.","This screen recording software has a capture history in the File menu, should you need to access recent screenshots that you may have deleted. This saves you the time it takes to capture the shot again.","The program’s editing tools allow you to create shapes, draw freehand lines, insert straight lines and arrows, erase, add text, create stamps, and highlight certain areas. You can add, change and match colors, as well as blur, sharpen and adjust brightness, contrast and saturation. You can also invert colors and change an image to gray scale.","There are some features Easy Screen Capture lacks that are found it the <a href=\"/snagit-review\">top software we reviewed</a>. You cannot convert multiple files in one batch or capture videos. It has no timer-controlled capture. These omissions do not detract from the quality of its other capture and editing tools, their absence does limit the program, especially when compared to the best screen recorder software.","A comprehensive help section is built into the software&#39;s interface. You can view instructions to help you use the software, and screenshot images are displayed with instructions. Should you have questions or problems you can’t solve, you can read FAQs on the company’s website or email support. There are also tutorials that walk you through the program’s tools.","Easy Screen Capture is a good product if you want to complete simple projects. It has the essential editing tools and functions for capturing and altering images to use in slideshows, presentations and reports, along with ample support services. The product lacks some more advanced capture and editing features, such as video capture and timer-controlled capture, as well as some special effects tools that allow you to alter image edges and overall appearances."]},"id":"3e7ce2d4-563b-4d35-88ae-6de657353cee","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1059","url":"/easy-screen-capture-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
