Selling more than 140 million units, the PS2 <a href=\"/best-video-game-consoles\">game console</a> managed to attain a status as the most successful 6th Generation video game platform, outselling the competition. Sony has always coupled its video game consoles with multimedia capabilities. The PS1 offered audio CD compatibility, while the PS2 offers CD, DVD and other audio and video file compatibility, with some additional online and web browsing abilities. Though the PS2 is well equipped for game play and DVD viewing, the lack in memory, storage and computational power simply make the PS2 a game console of the past.","The PS2 offers full backward compatibility with PS1, requiring neither software updates nor advanced storage capabilities. With more than 1,800 game title releases in its 7 years, the PS2 stands alone for the most number of game titles issued directly to a gaming console.","PlayStation was one of the first game consoles to attempt the idea of online console gaming, and the Dynamic Network Authentication System was one of the first online gaming and web browsing programs available for video games. The Dynamic Network is no longer in use because of slow speeds, limited connection options and lack of online users. Fortunately for PlayStation users, strong improvements have been made to the initial network, and it was eventually renamed as the PlayStation Network.","PS2 offers internet connectivity through Ethernet and modem adapter connection. These wired connections greatly limit its range and location within a household. The newer PS3, however, utilizes IEEE 802.11 wireless and Bluetooth technologies to achieve connectivity. The result for the PS3 is faster CPU and GPU capabilities, increased memory and expanded storage, as well as exceptional speeds and reliability for online game play, video downloads, game rentals and web browsing. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"c2b75dbf-3365-4f61-9db1-947aebb782a8","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sony provides a number of ways for you to get in contact with help and support on their website.
