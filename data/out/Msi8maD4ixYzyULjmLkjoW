Without earhooks, the sport earbuds do not offer the same security but do promise to stay in for most types of sports.","yurbuds <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-4.html\">sport earbuds</a> use medical grade silicone and have a unique in-ear design that fits into your ear to offer a quality fit and sound. The build of the earpiece allows you to fit the sweat-resistant earbuds into your ear so that they do not fall out, even during fast-paced exercise and sports. They also have a special design to ensure that they don&#39;t brush over tender spots in your ear, which helps to ensure comfort.","A large three-button command center and microphone sits at the center of the Y-neck cord, allowing you to easily find the microphone and control as needed. The neckline is not adjustable, so you do have to leave it as is, which may not be comfortable. The buttons offer one touch control for volume, track and play for Apple devices. You can also accept calls by pushing the command button without taking your phone out. The cable features a magnetic lock that pulls the cables together to prevent tangling and to ensure that you do not lose the sport earbuds.","Two enhancers allow you to customize the fit to your ears, although with only two options, customization is basic at best. The deep in-ear canal design allows you to get quality audio with a sealed fit. The deep design also helps to keep the earbuds in place, while medical-grade silicone helps prevent bacteria. However, you do have to clean the enhancers frequently as they do go inside your ear.","The sport earbuds are sweat proof and water resistant, allowing you to take them with you on high intensity runs and workouts. You can also use them in the rain and around water without damaging them. However, they are not submersible and are not suitable for swimming.","With an in-ear canal design, nonslip locking earbuds and soft interior for comfort, the yurbuds Inspire 400 make a good choice if you intend to spend a long time at the gym or working out. The heavy-duty design is resistant to wear and tear, offers a convenient microphone, and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor exercise."]},"id":"2e162ddf-c108-4036-94d7-a01a1b56c4d7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63405","url":"/yurbuds-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T21:49:31Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T21:49:31Z","name":"Yurbuds Inspire 400","synopsis":"The yurbuds Inspire 400 are noise-isolating in-ear headphones feature a medical grade silicone tip made to twist and lock into your ear to stay in place.
