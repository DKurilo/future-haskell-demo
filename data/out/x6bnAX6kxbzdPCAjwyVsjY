The boat is gorgeous, but it will take some time and a little effort before you can get it in the water.","The RC boat has a slick red and black color scheme and is chock-full of minor details. It is molded in fiberglass and has a gel coat and painted enamel finish. It really shines and is a beauty.","The large dual sails pick up the wind and help your boat reach speeds up to almost 25 miles per hour. With a good breeze behind it, the boat is very quick, has fast turns and is very fun to drive. It would work well in a sailboat race, but it isn’t quicker than radio controlled speed boats.","The deck of the boat is quite narrow, which adds to the sleek design. The radio controlled boat measures in at almost 36 inches long. It is 6.7 inches wide and 71 inches tall. The boat is full-rigged, and both the mainsail winch and steering servo come installed. All you need to do is connect the sail and add the receiver and battery.","This RC boat would be a great project for you and your child to tackle together. It takes just a little work, but is relatively simple to put together. Once you get it set up and take it to your favorite body of water, its sleek design will turn heads.","A display stand is included with the boat and it is covered by a 30-day warranty. You can watch YouTube videos of it soaring through the water online or read customer reviews."]},"id":"4d17d436-6b58-4c1e-bb08-78f4f9bf6550","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1e5262a5-11ba-4c2f-b92d-13f1863242a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The RC Sailboat-Monsoon is an outstanding sailboat and is a great boat for the pool, lake or pond.
