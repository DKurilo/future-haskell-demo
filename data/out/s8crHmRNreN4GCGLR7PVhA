They develop everything from flight joysticks to skateboard additions for Wii&#39;s balance board. The Ferrari Universal Challenge wheel is one of their <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1338-best-racing-wheels.html\">PC steering wheels</a> that work with almost everything. Its &#34;universal&#34; claim to fame is that it works with PC, Wii, GameCube, PS3 and PS2. Be aware, however, that it is not compatible with the Xbox. This device is made for casual race fans that own several consoles and want to connect to each of them.","Thrustmaster generally makes very solid wheel and pedal combos that rank high among their competitors. Unfortunately, the Ferrari Universal Challenge steering wheel and pedal peripheral falls lower on our list because of its poor durability. The plastic feels of lesser quality than our top-ranked products. Additionally, the plastic isn&#39;t comfortable, and the design doesn&#39;t allow for a good grip on the wheel, making it harder to use. The wheel is quite small at 8 inches, and it doesn&#39;t grip to any surface with rubber or suction cups. However, the wheel can clamp to a table&#39;s edge, and the pedals have a carpet-gripping bottom.","The highlight of this gaming wheel is the bungee cord system that gives the wheel a power steering feels while it self-centers. Serious gamers look for rumble and feedback features in a steering wheel, but the Ferrari Universal Challenge wheel only provides those qualities on two outdated consoles: the PS2 and the GameCube.","Ferrari Universal Challenge wheel&#39;s customization is, just that, a challenge. The few buttons only allows for so much leeway when creating personal settings for your racing. The inclusion of a D-pad is a plus for navigating menus and options, but the button layout is so simple that it essentially gives you nothing to change or customize. There is not a stick shift, but instead there are two shifters right behind the wheel for quick shifting. The progressive pedal assembly allows for some minor adjusting of the pedals.","Thrustmaster excels in customer service. They offer a 24-month limited warranty, and this device comes packaged with an easy-to-understand user manual. Their site has general FAQs and a more specific section for each product. You can also receive technical help by email or by phone."]},"id":"1e3fbbc9-f027-4d1e-a8d7-a138368a97dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9577189a-809f-4767-8c4a-d88b83e83114","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ferrari Universal Challenge racing wheel set by Thrustmaster ranks low for us because it simply feels lower in quality construction, and it is significantly smaller than most wheels on the market.
