You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","As the name implies, White’s Coinmaster Pro is designed for coinshooting. That said, it’s an all-purpose <a href=\"/best-metal-detectors\">metal detector</a> that also detects relics, jewelry and precious metals. Despite just average results in our tests, the intuitive design and affordable price is great for beginning detectorists. You can take it out of the box and start treasure hunting without having to worry about a learning curve.","We tested each of the metal detectors in our review by seeing how well they identified buried treasure at varying depths. We did this by burying coins ranging from pennies to quarters in a grid system with holes dug at 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 12 inches. We also buried trash metals like nails and pull-tabs from soda cans, and silver and gold beads that mimic jewelry, such as long rings or necklaces. We swept across this grid twice, recording both the target ID and the indicated depth of each item.","The Coinmaster Pro detected metal in just 73 percent of the holes we dug. Every other detector found metal in more holes than this one. It’s no surprise that most of the items it missed were buried in the 10- and 12-inch end of the field. The 9-inch concentric coil is only rated for a depth of 8 inches. However, many of the detectors with similar depth ratings still detected many or most of the items buried beyond their rated depths.","It accurately identified 31 percent of the coins and metal we buried, which was about average. Even the most accurate metal detector in our review only accurately identified the treasure 40 percent of the time. However, it only came close another 16 percent of the time. When you consider both measurements, it still only leads you to treasure 47 percent of time, which is below average. The depth indication was also below average, being accurate only 32 percent of the time.","The best aspect of the Coinmaster Pro is the ease of use, which earned an A grade. Across the top of the display are pictures that correspond to coins, jewelry and trash metals. When you get a hit, an arrow points to the type of coin or jewelry that it thinks is buried. In the lower right-hand corner, the depth indicator is broken in 2-inch increments up to 8 inches. It has a pinpoint tool that’s easily accessed by your thumb, and the sensitivity and custom notching modes are easy to navigate. Beginners can expect to take this metal detector treasure hunting with no learning curve at all.","In terms of design, the Coinmaster Pro is simple and classic. A small control box is mounted just below the lower curve of its S-frame, and its adjustable shaft locks snugly into place. The entire device weighs a light 2.5 pounds. Its arm cup isn&#39;t padded, but its finish is smooth and its edges curved, so your arm won&#39;t be pinched or chafed raw after a few hours of use. It&#39;s a machine that&#39;s meant for the long haul."]},"id":"3fe3d386-ce5a-43b6-844d-0769a2cbc8a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5ae9c5dc-09df-4ddb-90ee-7d02a9069440","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["White’s Coinmaster Pro is an easy-to-use, comfortable detector that’s also affordable.
