It creates good-quality copies of your DVD movies, allows you to digitally back up your discs, and has all the support options we look for in this kind of software. However, it&#39;s missing enough of the features we look for to keep it in the middling portion of our side-by-side comparison chart.","The best thing about this program is the quality of new discs it produces. If you want to make an exact copy of a DVD, you&#39;ll have to use the larger-capacity blank DVD-9s. This produces an identical duplicate of your DVD with no quality loss. If you use the smaller-capacity and less expensive blank DVD-5s, the software compresses the contents of your DVD to fit onto the new disc.","When you compress a larger disc to fit onto a smaller one, you&#39;ll notice some quality loss in the new DVD. This is true of every product on our lineup. In our tests, we examined the quality of each compressed disc. Aimersoft DVD Copy performed better than most of the products we reviewed. We noted some minor pixelation and compression artifact in the picture, but nothing that would pull you out of the experience of watching your movie.","If you want to avoid or lessen the quality loss caused by compressing a disc, you can use the program&#39;s Main Movie copy modes (one with the DVD menu and one without). These options strip away everything on a DVD except for the feature presentation. Generally, a movie-only copy of a commercial disc is small enough to fit onto a DVD-5. If not, the compression will be of a much higher quality than if you were copying the entire DVD.","While this program has many of the tools we look for in the best DVD copy software, it&#39;s missing some of the more advanced features found in other products in our review. For example, there are no options to merge the contents of two separate DVDs onto the same disc. This would be useful if you have discs of a movie and its sequel that you want to combine onto the same blank DVD. It also lacks the ability to automatically split a commercial disc onto two DVD-5s. This option would allow you to keep all the contents of a larger disc, without compression, using the smaller-capacity discs."]},"id":"acb2bf5b-275a-4144-bb89-42284534fb01","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2c4505c4-7ea7-4c55-90ea-f7d31a21ddd5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aimersoft DVD Copy is one of the best DVD copiers you can buy.
