Active Junky testers got to try on this innovative multi-tool when it was first introduced. Between 10 links, including the clasp, the Tread offers 29 tools for a full-function multi-tool conveniently stored on your wrist.","Active Junky tests employed the Leatherman multi-tool to repair fishing reels, cut fishing line, make camp stove adjustments and complete fine-tuning of mountain bikes while on the trail, among other common adventure scenarios ranging from home use to backcountry adventures. A wide array of drivers make it a good choice in bike multi-tools.","For those with smaller wrists, you may have to leave out some links to keep it on your wrist. Active Junky found an acceptable solution for this issue, however, by attaching removed links to a standard multi-tool with knife, pliers and prying tools so all your bases are covered.","Each link is made of 17-4 corrosion resistant stainless steel, making it strong and durable but also giving it a modern and stylish look. Tools include numerous driver heads, such as multi Philips-head, flathead and hex drivers, as well as multiple box wrenches. Specialty tools such as a cutting hook, carbide glass break and even a bottle opener come in handy in certain situations.","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Versatility","<strong>Best For:</strong> On-the-go adjustment and repairs for single- and multi-sport gear.","<strong>Tester Comments:</strong> “If there’s one tool that takes practice ahead of time, this is the one. Achieving enough leverage to accomplish real-world tasks takes some meat space practice as visualization alone won’t cut it. Pure delight is the prize, being able to flow through airport security to arrive carry-on fresh and geared for action. Any human-powered or mechanized sports equipment gets handled by Tread while you amaze bystanders, Mr. Bond.”","<strong>Trial Results</strong>","As this Leatherman multi-tool does not offer typical features – including pliers, clippers or blades – Active Junky could not put it to the same trial tests as the other multi-tools tested. For scenarios where the tools were used, testers were impressed with its versatility and convenience. The Tread is not a typical multi-tool but could prove very useful for specific activities."]},"id":"7c86205a-f67a-4b8b-a989-332d81106752","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67965","url":"/leatherman-tread-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-10T18:31:29Z","datePublished":"2016-06-10T18:31:29Z","name":"Leatherman Tread","synopsis":"A multi-tool unlike any other Active Junky tested, and a different type altogether, the Leatherman Tread is a wearable multi-tool.
