It’s a great way to visualise what your new home could look like inside and out, or how that modification you’d like to make would fit in with the rest of your property. ","Once you’re done designing your dream house, you can export the plans in formats architects, contractors and construction workers can use to bring your creation to life. ","To find the best home design software, we used each program to design a single floor plan with common components like windows, doors, stairs and furniture. Our main scoring criteria was how realistic the software&#39;s images look, since the purpose of the software is to give end users an idea of what to expect as they modify and customize their homes.","In addition, we considered ease of use. This subjective evaluation was based on how long it took to learn to use each program, create a floor plan, design the menu and more. We also considered how often programs unexpectedly crashed and how many built-in support options they have. ","Finally, we compared the programs&#39; features, scoring them on whether they have features such as roofing and electrical wizards, plumbing planning tools, and object libraries, and how easy they were to use. ","After more than 180 hours of testing the best home design programs on the market, <a href=\"/virtual-architect-ultimate-review\">Virtual Architect Ultimate</a> is our top pick. It’s our favorite option for most people because it’s easy to use and learn and has advanced features to help you design every aspect of your home.","<strong>Best free home design software</strong>","If you want free home design software, <a href=\"https://www.roomsketcher.com/homedesigner/\">RoomSketcher Home Designer</a> is worth considering. It’s a basic program that boils home design down to its most basic elements. It’s easier to use than any of the for-pay programs we reviewed. Its simple drag-and-drop interface and premade home elements make it easy enough for even the most novice user to design a home.","It includes basic tools that help you make a floor plan by placing walls, windows, stairs and doors as well as allow you to furnish the home with a variety of objects. None of these tools are as powerful as those found in for-pay programs. However, they can get you by if you don’t mind generic furniture, appliances and decorations.","One way the program stands out is you can design online. You can download the app and start a design, and your project uploads to the cloud. You can then access and work on the design on the RoomSketcher website from any computer with an internet connection. Also, the program&#39;s apps work on Android and iOS mobile devices, so you can work from anywhere.","A downside of the free version is you can only save five designs, though you can purchase five more for $10. This is a theme throughout the program – it frequently tells you that you can buy advanced features such as more objects and 2D and 3D floor plans."]},"id":"659ba8bb-f9ab-49ee-bfd7-ad9ac6127cc2","type":"text"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"Virtual-Architect-Ultimate-Home-Design.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/F/6/827394/original/Virtual-Architect-Ultimate-Home-Design.jpg","id":"Kw9mnkyxaywbafvzp5YcRX","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kw9mnkyxaywbafvzp5YcRX.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"Virtual Architect Ultimate"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8900250-12272601?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novadevelopment.com%2Fsoftware%2FVirtual-Architect-Ultimate-503971%3Frs2%3D2004&cjsku=10142747&toptenreviews-ttr:en_US_43_Review_360","urlStyle":"button","name":"Virtual Architect Ultimate","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"This program earned the top spot in our review of the best home design programs.

A full-bodied program can cost up to $100 but is well worth the price if you want detailed control and are designing your entire property.","<strong>What should you look for in home design software?</strong>","To find the best home design software, we considered how difficult it is to get the hang of each application, particularly for people who don’t have experience with this type of program. ","We noted whether we needed to consult tech support or other help tools, such as video tutorials, to complete our review. Here are some other points to consider when choosing a house plan program as well as some of our insights from reviewing them.","<strong>2D &amp; 3D views</strong>","All the programs we reviewed are 3D design software. As such, you can see your finished dream home in both 2D, which is flat and looks like a blueprint, and 3D, which has dimension, texture and color. The 3D view gives you a realistic idea of what the results will look like.","We were especially impressed with <a href=\"/dreamplan-review\">DreamPlan</a> because it lets you design in 3D by dragging and dropping elements into your plan. It then automatically converts your plan into a 2D blueprint that includes dimensions. This is opposite from most programs, which require you to build structural components in the 2D view.","<a href=\"/sweet-home-3d-review\">Sweet Home 3D</a> also has a neat feature that lets you view the 2D and 3D plans simultaneously. As you place features and objects in your 2D design, you can see them automatically render in the 3D view. This makes it easy to spot floating objects – objects that should sit flush to the ground but don&#39;t. This error can happen when you build in 2D, and you can only see it in the 3D view. This feature also quickly checks that everything is balanced.","<strong>Object libraries</strong>","We counted the number of 3D objects in each program&#39;s library. Some apps, such as <a href=\"/punch-review\">Punch Home &amp; Landscape Design Premium</a>, have thousands of items in a variety of styles, including tables and windows of various lengths. Others, such as Sweet Home 3D, have basic objects, such as windows and doors, that serve mostly as stand-ins – you can add and modify them to your desired dimensions, but you can’t customize how they look. We found that programs with large libraries make it easy to set up and accurately envision your finished design, since their items serve as more than just placeholders. These programs typically include more decorative items, such as vases, as well as robust window treatment options.","Most of the programs we tested allow you to supplement their libraries with thousands more objects by importing items from popular third-party websites. SketchUp and Trimble 3D Warehouse are the most commonly used, and they have thousands of free objects. Most programs are only compatible with one third-party library, but one of our top picks, Home Designer Suite, can import objects from both databases.","Home design applications also include landscape objects in their libraries. As with the total object library, we counted the number of plants each program has. We noted whether they were legitimate outdoor plants or just indoor, potted plants. Typically, the more objects in the plant library, the easier it is to make your gardens look exactly how you want.","<strong>Import plans &amp; tracing features</strong>","Another fun feature is a floor plan tracer. With this tool, you can open a picture of a home, a sample floor plan or a blueprint and trace the aspects you want to use in your own design. This is a great way to mesh a lot of ideas into one house plan. It is also valuable if you have your existing home’s plans and hope to design an addition. Using the trace tool, it&#39;s easy to extend a wall and create another space that is proportional with the measurements and layout of your current home. ","<strong>Landscape tools</strong>","Designing your yard is just as important as creating your home. In addition to a healthy plant library, look for software with other outdoor objects, such as barbecue grills and outdoor furniture, to help create a beautiful oasis. If you choose an app like Total 3D Landscape &amp; Deck Premium, you can use garden templates that make it easy to envision and create your landscapes.","While testing, we found that DreamPlan&#39;s topography tools are the best and easiest to use. Topography tools recreate your lot&#39;s natural hills and dips, and they can help you picture what your lawn will look like if you bring in more dirt to build it up. However, you should leave most of the topography planning to the professionals.","You can also use deck and fence designer tools, which work much like home design programs’ room-building features – you can connect a deck to your home and set an exterior door as an access point. The same texture and material custom design tools used to update your home can create a deck that is aesthetically pleasing and complements the house’s exterior.","<strong>What software does your project need? </strong>","We focused on programs that covered all aspects of home design, including architecture, landscaping, interior design and more. These programs provide everything needed to create a full house plan from the foundation up.","However, there are more specific design programs available. And the best one for you depends on the type of project you’re planning. If you have more specific needs, you probably don’t have to pay extra for an all-in-one program.","For example, if you’re only interested in landscape architecture, there may be a better program for you in our <a href=\"/best-landscaping-software\">landscaping software category</a>. The programs in that category include advanced tools for designing your lawn and garden so that the outside of your home is as spectacular as the inside.","If you’re more focused on inside the home, you may want to look at our <a href=\"/best-interior-design-software\">interior design software category</a>. These programs are great and can help you renovate and remodel your existing home, whether you want to knock down walls or simply rearrange your furniture.","And while we named Home Designer Suite our best pick for Mac users, we have an entire category devoted to <a href=\"/best-home-and-interior-design-software-for-mac\">home and interior design software options for Mac</a>.","<strong>What home design software do the pros use?</strong>","When we evaluated the best home design software on the market, we asked professionals what they use in their everyday work. Whether we talked to architects, landscapers or interior designers, they all had the same answer: AutoCAD.","Autocad has been the industry standard for designers since it launched in the early 1980s. At the time, the ability to design on a computer was revolutionary. And as the years and decades went on, the program grew to make use of faster processors, new operating systems, enhanced graphics and more powerful computers. The best in the business, you pay a premium for the privilege, with yearly subscriptions costing over $1000. ","<strong>What home design software is used on HGTV&#39;s Fixer Upper?</strong>","If you’ve watched shows like Fixer Upper on HGTV, you may wonder what they use to remodel homes. Joanna uses <a href=\"https://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-pro\">SketchUp Pro</a> to make her designs. This is professional-grade software that costs about $700, which is far more expensive than the programs we reviewed. However, it includes the full spectrum of tools professionals use to create their designs. We don’t recommend this product for novices or casual users, but if you think you’re up to it, you can download a free trial to see if it’s worth the price. ","You can also try <a href=\"https://www.sketchup.com/plans-and-pricing/sketchup-free\">SketchUp Free</a>, a web application that&#39;s good for small projects or designing custom furniture, decorations and other objects. Once your object design is complete, you can upload it to <a href=\"https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/\">SketchUp 3D Warehouse</a>, then import and use it in most of the programs we reviewed.","<strong>What home design software does Property Brothers on HGTV use?</strong>","Property Brothers is another popular show on HGTV. It&#39;s a reality show about identical twin brothers who find run-down homes and renovate them. The walk-throughs they use on the show are generated by Neezo Studios at about $10,000 an episode.","The software used to create these visualizations is called Neezo Renders, which you cannot buy from Neezo Studios. Plus, it is well out of the price range and skill level of casual users. No software we reviewed even comes close to displaying the high-resolution details Neezo Studios can.","However, there are 3D walk-through features in some of the programs we reviewed, including <a href=\"/virtual-architect-ultimate-review\">Virtual Architect Ultimate</a>, <a href=\"/dreamplan-review\">DreamPlan</a>, <a href=\"/sweet-home-3d-review\">Home Designer Suite and Sweet Home 3D</a>. Even though they don&#39;t create the same eye-popping results, they can give you a good 3D approximation of your design.","<strong>Best home design software for iPad</strong>","There are several home design apps you can download on your iPad. The highest rated app in the iOS app store is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/home-design-3d-gold/id514345557?mt=8\">Home Design 3D Gold</a>. It is quite intuitive and feels more like a game than an architectural or interior design application. It allows you to create both 2D and 3D floor plans by placing doors, windows, walls and more. The app also has a sizable library of furniture, plants, decorations and other objects.","In addition to displaying a photo-realistic 3D preview of your design, this app has augmented reality features. You need the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/arkit/\">ARKit</a> to make it work, but once you have that installed, you can take a tour of your design as if it were already built. This is invaluable for spotting flaws and getting a better idea of how you want your home to look.","You can download this app for $10.99. However, if you’re reluctant to purchase the app, you can start out on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/home-design-3d/id463768717?mt=8\">Home Design 3D</a> for free. It’s a watered-down version of the program, but it still has many of the great features found in the Gold version.","<strong>How can I draw house plans?</strong>","Like any new skill, learning to draw house plans requires a great deal of practice. The amount of knowledge required to do it properly is intimidating. However, not knowing how or where to start designing shouldn’t stop you from doing it. All the home design software we reviewed have at least a few built-in training features. Some offer simple tips, while others have full-blown tutorials that walk you through the process step by step.","There’s also a plethora of ways to learn the basics and best practices of home design. For example, there are thousands of videos on YouTube about the subject, both from regular users and software manufacturers. If you’re willing to put in the time it takes to find the right information and commit to learning it, there’s little stopping you from mastering any of the programs we reviewed.","<strong>How to design your home on a budget</strong>","If you design your dream home with no limits in mind, you probably won’t be able to build it – especially if you’re on a budget or just frugal. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to make sure your design is as practical as it is beautiful. ","If you’re moving into a new space, you first need to determine what purpose each room will serve. While it may be obvious which rooms are intended to be bedrooms, dens and living rooms from the house&#39;s layout, you’ll have a much better idea of what you want when you know what each individual room will be used for, especially if it&#39;s outside of its obvious function.","The next step is to take exact measurements of your home. You can use these measurements when you rebuild your space in the home design software. Just remember, they have to be exact – if you approximate, the furniture you buy may not fit in the spaces you expected it to.","<strong>Taking your homemade plans to a professional </strong>","Once you have your plans the way you want them, it’s time to build. However, all the contractors, professional architects and designers we talked to told us they are extremely wary of homemade plans. Their chief concerns revolve around non-professionals not understanding things like spacial flow and wdesign accuracy. Contractors also told us that homemade plans generally don’t take into account local zoning ordinances and misunderstand things like plumbing and electrical work.","So, before you get too far into the building process, you need to make sure your plans stand up to professional standards. Running them past a local architect is a great idea. They can give you an idea of where you may be going wrong. You can also hire them to use your plan as a basis for a better design than you can make yourself.","<strong>Read more:<br/></strong><a href=\"/create-your-dream-home-with-home-design-software\"><br/>Create your dream home with home design software</a><br/><a href=\"/ten-tips-for-smart-home-design\">10 tips for smart home design<br/></a><br/>"]},"id":"efb30fc9-0b7c-4f17-8b13-f4c8cbe8abfb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"51f7d4c2-5ba9-4497-abeb-efc4b2103ade","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/virtual-architect-ultimate-review\">Virtual Architect Ultimate 8</a>","<a href=\"/turbofloorplan-home-landscape-pro-review\">TurboFloorPlan Home and Landscape Pro 2019</a>","<a href=\"/punch-review\">Punch Home &amp; Landscape Design Premium 20</a>","<a href=\"/turbofloorplan-home-landscape-deluxe-review\">TurboFloorPlan Home &amp; Landscape Deluxe 2019</a>","<a href=\"/home-designer-suite-review\">Home Designer Suite 2019</a>","<a href=\"/punch-home-landscape-design-standard-review\">Punch Home &amp; Landscape Design Essentials 20</a>","<a href=\"/dreamplan-review\">DreamPlan</a>","<a href=\"/total-3d-review\">Total 3D Landscape &amp; Deck Premium 12</a>","<a href=\"/sweet-home-3d-review\">Sweet Home 3D</a>","<a href=\"/total-3d-home-review\">Total 3D Home Design Deluxe</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"18e78f44-17a4-4b35-9780-9cdde9151916","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_360","url":"/best-home-design-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
