You can also follow your favorite artists through the app and receive alerts about shows in your area.            <br />\nSelling tickets with StubHub is almost as easy as buying them. You can use the computer application or mobile app to sell your tickets, and StubHub collects 10 percent of the sale price.            <br />\n            <br />\nThe site’s FanProtect guarantee makes sure you receive valid tickets before the event, and if you don’t, you will either be refunded with comparable or better tickets or receive a full refund.

We researched price, availability, website features and mobile experiences. We scored each website based on these features and compared service fees and total cost for two popular touring concerts and a well-known symphony to determine our rankings. We didn’t just compare prices, though; we walked through each step of the ticket selection process to score each website.","We’ve reviewed concert ticket websites and <a href=\"/best-sports-tickets\">sports ticket websites</a> for several years and we know what to look for in the guarantees and money-back promises that these companies offer. It can be especially difficult to navigate the world of service and convenience fees, and we took the time to compare them. We read through detailed FAQs for each website and compared the customer service options to find out how each website will work with you in case you run into a problem with your ticket purchase.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We looked for tickets to concerts for a nationally touring symphony, nationally touring pop band and regionally touring rock band that is popular enough that all the services advertised tickets for its shows. We then identified a mid-priced seating section at each concert and put two tickets in our cart to see what their final price was, including the service fee and shipping fees for electronic and ground delivery. We rank the services and make recommendations based on each one’s ordering convenience, service features, security features and customer support options, and we report our findings in each site’s review.","We also compared each service’s fees and rules regarding selling tickets. We found that online ticket brokers keep 10 to 20 percent of the selling price if you sell through their marketplaces. Although the service fee associated with selling tickets is more expensive than selling them through a local classified listing or through social media, we found that using an online ticket broker was safer and made your tickets available to a larger potential audience.","<strong>How Much Do Concert Tickets Cost?</strong>","The price of a concert ticket cost depends on who is performing and where. Service and shipping fees vary by event and by website, but our research shows the average service fee is about 23 percent, added to the cost of the ticket. Standard shipping costs also run you an additional $15, though they’re sometimes wrapped into the service fee. If you’re interested in selling tickets, most websites take about 15 percent commission. However, some websites don’t take any commission at all. ","<strong>Important Things to Consider When Buying Concert Tickets Online</strong>","Fees<br/>All the online ticket brokers we reviewed charge service fees. Some also charge convenience fees, shipping and e-ticket delivery fees. We found that e-tickets were the most cost-effective, with the delivery fees around $5 versus the $15 average fee for delivering physical tickets. Fees are unavoidable, so you might want to consider shopping around before you make your final decision.","Interactive Seating Charts<br/>All the services we reviewed allow you to click on various sections in the venue and compare prices. An interactive seating chart makes it easier to visualize where you’ll be sitting in relation to the stage. Some services offer point-of-view pictures from larger stadiums and venues so you can check out the viewing angle from the seats you’re reserving.","<strong>Concert Calendar Apps </strong>","The ticket services we reviewed have searchable calendars to help you find concerts in your area. However, if you want a more personal experience and notifications about when your favorite bands are coming to nearby venues, concert calendar mobile apps are a better option. Once you find a concert to attend, use our favorite concert ticket services to find the best price.","Songkick<br/>This concert calendar app is free and available for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/songkick-concerts/id438690886?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.songkick&amp;hl=en_US\">Android</a> devices. It searches services like Apple Music, Spotify and Deezer to find out what kind of music you listen to and curates a personalized concert guide based on your playlists. Songkick sends notifications about concerts and festivals near your current location and allows you to set a reminder to buy a ticket. This app also recommends bands and comedians that aren’t on your playlists to help you discover new and emerging artists. It displays pricing information, but we suggest using one of the licensed ticket broker sites we reviewed to ensure your transaction is secure and that you can get help and support if something goes wrong.","Bandsintown<br/>This app has similar search capabilities as Songkick – it can sync to your playlists on popular streaming services and send notifications about bands you follow. However, because it allows artists to post tour dates free of charge, Bandsintown is a better option for searching for and discovering smaller local acts. It also has better social media features. For example, you can invite friends to a concert with a Facebook post, view tour news and updates, and post photos of yourself dancing or attempting an epic stage dive. Bandsintown is available in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandsintown&amp;hl=en_US\">Google Play</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bandsintown-concerts/id471394851?mt=8\">Apple App</a> stores free of charge.","<strong><br/>More Online Marketplace Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"f2a45569-3285-4999-a4cd-b7838c19e9d1","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-sports-tickets\">The Best Sports Ticket Websites</a>","<a href=\"/best-online-auction-sites\">The Best Online Auction Sites</a>","<a href=\"/best-hotel-booking-services\">The Best Hotel Booking Sites</a>","<a href=\"/best-gift-card-exchange-sites\">The Best Gift Card Exchange Websites</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0a0cb339-2647-4324-925e-4f0796952466","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_64","url":"/best-concert-tickets","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-18T18:27:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-18T18:27:00Z","name":"Best Concert Tickets of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best concert ticket sites, based on availability, pricing and fees, refund policies and rewards for customer loyalty.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best concert ticket sites, based on availability, pricing and fees, refund policies and rewards for customer loyalty.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-12T14:49:33Z","id":"RGtxLkUy6wNEHxeNJbjKob","meta":{"title":"Best Ticket Sites 2019 -
