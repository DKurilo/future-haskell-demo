You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Minka Concept II is a <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fan</a> designed for minimalist decorators, offering a straightforward and flush body. It achieves high levels of air circulation due largely to the efficient design of its motor, which reduces its electricity consumption and increases its circulation capabilities. The end result is a unimposing fan that fully achieves its intended purpose in both lighting up your room and encouraging the flow of air throughout.","This is among the top ceiling fans due to its economic design and energy efficiency while in operation. Though the blade span on this fan is constrained to 52 inches, the unit is still capable of circulating 6300 cubic feet per minute. At its highest speed setting, the motor wattage is 59 watts, for an airflow efficiency of more than 106 cubic feet per minute per watt. It achieves this with its three-blade design, each of which is pitched at a 14-degree angle and performing up to 179 rotations per minute.","When installed, this best ceiling fan’s body has a vertical footprint of less than 12 inches, due largely to its flush mounting kit. It doesn’t come with downrods for greater drops, though it comes with additional resources to guide you through picking the ideal downrod for your ceiling height. If your ceiling is nine feet tall, however, the flush mounting kit is the best option to start with.","This quiet ceiling fan is designed with five different finishes, each of which support its overall minimalist appearance. Whether you pick polished nickel, white or mahogany, this fan will only add to the decoration theme of a room without drawing much attention to itself. The assembly kit comes with a no-light cap if you don’t want to use the lighting capabilities. In addition, it comes with a handheld remote control, a 100 watt halogen bulb and a mounting kit for quick assembly and immediate use.","The Minka Concept II is one of the best ceiling fans with lights available due to its reliable and economic performance. It has a high level of air circulation ideal for large rooms, coupled with a motor that achieves exceptional levels of energy efficiency. Its sleek design and multiple finishes lend toward a simple appearance that will only serve in complementing any room’s design, all while helping breaking up hot and cold air pockets silently."]},"id":"6618f672-caae-4ab7-97c1-dd2f23a522e5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66308","url":"/minka-concept-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:05:31Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:05:31Z","name":"Minka Concept II","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-22T17:05:31Z","id":"XvEi5EmLZkUg3BjDVNhwf6","meta":{"title":"Minka Concept II Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
