You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sometimes big things come in little packages. The Magellan RoadMate 2255T-LMB proves this by being a small navigation GPS device that is packed with many useful features. These range from safety features to options that provide extra convenience on your commute.","The RoadMate 2255T-LMB is among the smaller of Magellan car GPS units and fits into the 4.3-inch category. This means that the screen measures 4.3 inches diagonally. The small size makes this device perfect for sitting on your dash or being mounted on the windshield, as it doesn&#39;t obstruct your view when driving. However, the small screen size makes it harder to see important information. A nice feature for this unit is that you can choose between portrait mode and landscape. Landscape gives you the standard widescreen view, but portrait gives you a better idea of what is coming farther down the road. The way you mount this GPS device in your car depends on your preference.","The RoadMate 2255T-LMB has Bluetooth capabilities, which allows you to put your phone aside and focus on the road ahead. You can make and take calls, and even have text messages read back to you. The RoadMate 2255T-LMB is accurate to about 3 to 5 meters. That is particularly important when you are looking for a frontage road or small side street. This navigation GPS device will also use buildings, businesses and other landmarks to help you make the correct turn. This landmark-based service is not available everywhere, but as maps are updated and improved, this service will become more and more common. Magellan updates its maps four times a year, and this model comes with free map updates for the life of the device. This ensures that you have the most current maps available. The RoadMate 2255T-LMB also comes with free traffic updates for the lifetime of your device.","With 7 million points of interest (POIs), including restaurants, gas stations, bookstores and more, you will be able to find a route to just about anywhere. You can save your favorite, or most common, routes on your device for easier access. With OneTouch on the RoadMate 2255T-LMB, you can assign an icon to your favorite route so that it is easier to find and select later. However, if you decide to take your navigation system to the street on foot, the RoadMate 2255T-LMB can&#39;t help you, as it does not have a pedestrian mode."]},"id":"1a7151f0-ce55-400a-afea-46f6c9747c4b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"467f2780-8c82-48f1-be09-9ef781d8b670","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Magellan RoadMate 2255T-LMB is small, it comes preloaded with many valuable features.
