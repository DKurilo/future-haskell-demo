The original review is below, but check out our current top </em><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\"><em>3D Printers</em></a><em> here.</em>","3D printers usually need a computer and slicing software for developing and printing 3D models. The Fablicator has one actually built in to its chassis. You can print 3D models in both ABS and PLA using the pre-installed software.","Print speeds are pretty average with the Fablicator: 80 mm a second. Quality is also fairly normal and ranges between 0.1 and 0.3 mm layer height, or resolution. Size is another average feature on the Fablicator, as you can only print 3D designs up to 7 x 7 x 7 inches.","K&amp;L Services doesnâ€™t sell filament cartridges, so you will have to look elsewhere when you want to replenish your filament stash. The Fablicator does work with both PLA and ABS in 1.75 mm sizes, which you can find from a number of popular retailers. Only one print head is installed on the Fablicator; sorry, no multicolor printing.","If you&#39;re looking to buy a 3D printer and you have dedicated desk space, the Fablicator is a good choice. It weighs 44 pounds, so be sure you have help unboxing and moving it around. This aluminum-frame 3D printer also has a heated platform for ABS printing.","3D printing technology has come a long way since the first 3D print in the 1980s. The Fablicator may not have Wi-Fi capabilities or an SD card slot, but it does have its own computer. That&#39;s right: The Fablicator has a built-in Windows 7 computer dedicated to 3D printing. All you have to do is plug in a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and you&#39;re ready to print. The advantages of having a built-in computer are easier printing, no connectivity issues, easy updates, pre-installed software and not having to leave your personal computer plugged in for the duration of the printing process. One disadvantage is the price; you pay for the printer and a computer with the Fablicator.","K&amp;L Services offers very minimal support for the Fablicator. Email is the only way to get in contact with a support representative. FAQs are the only online resource for problem solving. The list of support options missing include phone support, a blog or forum, live chat, tutorials and a manual. However, there is no lead time, so your printer will ship as soon as you order it, and there is a six-month warranty, which is much longer than many competitors.","A power supply, maintenance tools for cleaning up your prints and a starter filament cartridge are included with the Fablicator."]},"id":"e0783e43-a5e6-40c9-a7e5-5a98031988c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a80e4f51-17e8-46ec-941f-b82389046e93","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["3D printing is made fast and easy with the Fablicator&#39;s built-in computer.
