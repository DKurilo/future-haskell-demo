Closed, it measures 4.8 in and weighs in at a hefty 9.6 oz.","Incorporated into this SOG multi-tool is SOG&#39;s compound leverage technology, an innovation that uses interlocking teeth and multiple pivot points that Active Junky testers report provide double cutting, crimping and clamping power. These functions are easily accessible, but other tools require multiple steps to access. While this offers a plus side of protecting tools, it can take some time and experience to master using this multi-tool.","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Value","<strong>Best For: </strong>Mid-level difficult tasks around the home or when traveling, and a good camping multi-tool","<strong>Tester Comments:</strong> &#34;Large and in charge is how we’d describe it. Pressure delivered to jaw-related functions was better than most thanks to the multi-tool’s brilliant leverage-inducing design. Construction is reasonably solid yet some tools were difficult to fold out and use with gusto. Active Junky likes the brand and tool and puts it in the Value category for reliability in tamer environments.”","<strong>Trial Results</strong>"]},"id":"ad997296-3445-4ed8-b77d-00428d0e7367","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Point Break: </strong>Despite the additional cutting power, this tool failed this particular trial as testers were unable to severe the metal wire after six double-handed squeezes and adjusting the cutting position.","<strong>Around the Bend:</strong> Minor jaw deflection did not deter from completing the test, bending the wire with superb hold and control.","<strong>Rope &#39;Em In:</strong> The long blade yielded clean cuts across the entire length, and the locking system remained reliable, which is important as cutting required concentrated energy and careful technique.","<strong>No Turning Back: </strong>Torque is not this multi-tool&#39;s strong suite, delivering sub-par to average results. Extra power exertion was required to keep full contact while driving, affecting transfer of power.","<strong>Eyes on the Pries:</strong> Using the file tip provided average yet constant and effective prying in trial situations.","<strong>Lumberjack Olympics:</strong> The standard multi-tool knife carved into superficial depths with minimal penetration. The serrated blade, however, is exceptional. Clearing material quickly with the power of a scaled-down chainsaw, the blade alone may back this multi-tool as a top choice for some."],"type":"ul"},"id":"52cf8e4a-432d-4c6e-b63a-cdf3acc5e9fe","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67964","url":"/sog-powerassist-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-10T18:31:11Z","datePublished":"2016-06-10T18:31:11Z","name":"SOG PowerAssist","synopsis":"For tool geeks, SOG offers tools with innovation unlike any other brand.
