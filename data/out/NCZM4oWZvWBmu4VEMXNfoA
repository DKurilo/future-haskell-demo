The push-button electric controls are flush on the cooktop, conveniently located and easy to use. You get five burners in all on this unique ceramic cooktop, with two double burners and three sizes for the middle burner.","The controls for the radiant surface elements give you 11 heat settings from warm to high. The triple element in the middle can reach 3,000 watts at the highest setting and provide temperatures up to about 800 F, giving you the option for a fast boil, with the choice of three different sizes of cookware. When any of the burners is on, a hot indicator light glows and stays on until the area is cool enough that you can safely touch it. For convenience, this GE Profile has multiple timers, with one for each of the five burners, so you can cook a complicated meal easily.","This electric cooktop has a simple, intuitive design. The optional stainless steel border gives the cooktop a clean, modern look. The heat of the dual burners can be controlled simultaneously so you can cook evenly on a griddle. The burners heat up quickly and cook evenly. The burners are nicely spaced allowing you to cook with a variety of pan sizes at the same time.","The best thing about the design of this cooktop is the controls. You won&#39;t need an instruction manual to understand the different configurations. The triple and double burners have graphic representations on the buttons, which you can push to adjust the size accordingly. While the controls are easy to access and use, they do take up a bit more space on the surface than other cooktops we looked at. If you prefer more hands-on controls, you might consider the <a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore Elite 45113</a>, which gives you knobs on the right side of the cooktop.","A good electric cooktop comes with a locking feature to protect youngsters who might try to play with the controls, and the GE Profile has one that&#39;s easy to find. The button says &#34;control lock&#34; in big, bold letters. This option not only provides extra safety if there are young children in your family, but also gives you extra counter space when the cooktop is not in use. This is one of the pricier models we looked at, but it is a quality cooktop that looks good and has all the functionality most cooks will need.","The double burner helps the GE Profile PP9036SJSS stand out. This electric cooktop is versatile, easy to understand and safe for a large family with a hot indicator light that stays lit until the burners are at a safe temperature. While it is one of the pricier cooktops in our lineup, its functionality and ease of use make it a good choice for the right household, including people with small children who will appreciate the safety features."]},"id":"861992b5-c2e3-4be5-a98c-9b49b311977d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63149","url":"/general-electric-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-02T17:23:47Z","datePublished":"2015-03-02T17:23:47Z","name":"GE Profile PP9036SJSS","synopsis":"The GE Profile PP9036SJSS is a 36-inch ceramic electric cooktop with optional stainless steel accents.
