These simple machines also allow you to carry odd-shaped boxes and containers from one place to another. When you use hand trucks, you lessen your risk of straining your back from repetitive lifting. Even if you are carrying a light load, constantly bending and lifting can result in health problems.","Hand trucks come in a variety of designs and are made from several materials. Small hand trucks made from durable plastic or aluminum are often used in home settings, while heavy-duty steel hand trucks are most often used in commercial applications. Some of the most common hand trucks include the <a href=\"/magna-cart-review\">WelCom Magna Cart</a>, the <a href=\"/milwaukee-review\">Milwaukee 49180 Hand Truck</a> and the <a href=\"/wesco-review\">Wesco Lightweight Folding Truck</a>.","<strong>Hand Trucks: What to Look For</strong>","It&#39;s important to find the right hand truck for the types of loads you will be moving. Trucks come with different designs, materials and load capacities, as well as extra features.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>There are three different hand truck designs: upright, convertible and specialty. Upright trucks are typically suited for loads that weigh less than 500 pounds, although some heavy-duty uprights can move much more. Convertible hand trucks have four wheels instead of two. These trucks are versatile because you can use them like a cart while they are laying down on all four wheels or you can use them like standard upright hand trucks. They are also designed to carry heavier loads. Specialty trucks are made to carry specific items such as machinery, bags, furniture or crates.","<strong>Construction</strong><br/>Hand trucks are made from several different materials. The strongest trucks are usually made from heavy-duty steel. Because steel hand trucks are made to withstand the heaviest loads, they are often reinforced with double welds and have added supports where they experience the most pressure. Aluminum trucks aren&#39;t quite as heavy as steel hand trucks, but they are still strong enough to carry heavy boxes and crates. Sometimes aluminum trucks are bonded with other metals to make them stronger. They are also not as expensive as steel. For very light loads, some hand trucks are made using ultra-light nylon or even fiberglass. Typically these hand trucks are designed for home or office use.","<strong>Load Capacity</strong><br/>When selecting hand trucks, it&#39;s also important to find out the load capacity. Load capacities are listed for safety reasons, and sometimes the limit is displayed somewhere on the hand truck. You should never attempt to put more weight on a hand trucks than it is rated to handle. This can cause the truck to tip over or even break, which can damage expensive items and injure people.","Hand trucks help you move items that would be too heavy otherwise. Because hand trucks have smooth-rolling wheels and durable frames, you can save your back and get the job done quickly and efficiently."]},"id":"83a94c8c-6c55-45ff-aa3d-e5645d860903","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"404e109d-7e83-444b-aea6-53951e92b420","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://store.graniteind.com/american-cart-multi-mover-xt-with-rear-wheels-p/67245.htm\">American Cart</a>","<a href=\"http://www.handtrucksrus.com/crashdetail.aspx?id=195&amp;cx=cl\">Clipper</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HOGSOPG/?&tag=ttr_hand-trucks-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1699[art|NA[pid|65821[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cosco</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GRSXLRS/?&tag=ttr_hand-trucks-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1699[art|NA[pid|65819[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Harper</a>","<a href=\"http://www.magliner.com/gemini-jr-convertible-hand-truck-10-inch-interlocked-microcellular-foam-wheels\">Magliner</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVVSDU/?&tag=ttr_hand-trucks-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1699[art|NA[pid|65815[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Magna Cart</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IYOWR0/?&tag=ttr_hand-trucks-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1699[art|NA[pid|65816[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Milwaukee</a>","<a href=\"http://www.handtrucksrus.com/crashdetail.aspx?id=1372&cx=bp\">Overland Carts</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AYL92G/?tag=ttr_hand-trucks-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1699[art|NA[pid|65820[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">RocknRoller</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H5GF4U/?&tag=ttr_hand-trucks-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1699[art|NA[pid|65817[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Wesco</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5d8ce5e8-1639-4bf6-b232-baa07c36e0b1","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1699","url":"/best-hand-trucks","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-20T15:34:33Z","datePublished":"2015-08-17T17:56:39Z","name":"Hand Trucks Review","synopsis":"Hand trucks make it easier for you to move heavy loads.
