We will evaluate and review current models from this brand when this category is updated.</em>","Pioneer is renowned for its reliable, feature-rich electronics, and its DVD and Blu-ray players continue this tradition. While the DVD-only units are more basic than the dual Blu-ray and <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD players</a>, both types of products offer good value and plenty of features.","Most Pioneer players are not region-free or multi-region. Instead, these devices are encoded to a single region, so make sure you choose a model that’s encoded to your home region, or to the country from which you’ll purchase all your DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Some players connect to the internet and support streaming, but not every model, so if that’s an essential feature for you, make sure you confirm before you purchase.","These DVD and Blu-ray players connect via HDMI, but some also have coaxial digital output, or RCA, to accommodate older home entertainment systems. You can connect to the internet on select models via an Ethernet cable, and some players let you connect to a local area network wirelessly for extra convenience. The majority of these units have a USB port that lets you connect peripherals like cameras, hard drives, flash drives and computers to access media, including still images, videos and music.","Basic Pioneer DVD players can achieve 1080p resolution, or Full HD, provided you’re using a Full HD or higher television, have the two devices connected via HDMI, and are watching a disc with at least 1080p resolution. More advanced models provide Ultra HD, or 4K, resolution when used in conjunction with a 4K screen and an HDMI connection. Some also support 3D playback. Although these players are fairly advanced, they don’t appear to have an upscaling feature, so your low-resolution discs will play in standard quality.","Internet-accessible players from Pioneer have a variety of native apps, such as catch-up TV services and streaming services, and with a stable internet connection, you can stream HDMI with little to no speed or lag issues. They also support BD-Live, letting you access bonus material, chat with other viewers and play games. Some models also support BONUSVIEW, a service that provides picture-in-picture visual and audio commentary about the show or movie you’re watching."]},"id":"9ac85c8e-2932-4dc8-afa8-5dfcf294b2dc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48426","url":"/pioneer-dv-220-k-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-01-06T17:11:37Z","datePublished":"2010-01-06T17:11:37Z","name":"Pioneer","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: The Pioneer DV-2010 has been discontinued by the manufacturer.
