The Husqvarna 125BVx gas leaf blower does a good job moving those messy leaves, and its 38.5-inch machine length puts it closer to the ground than shorter leaf blowers, which means it is easier to clear away debris, dirt and leaves. You also get a vacuum function with this leaf blower, and the machine can compress leaves into mulch at an impressive rate.","This model gives you power and performance that is about average when compared to the other blowers in our lineup. You get a power output of 1.1 horsepower from its two-cycle engine and a maximum airflow speed of 170 mph. The <a href=\"/toro-review\">Toro 51621</a> has air speeds of 250 mph, faster than any blower we reviewed. But air speed isn’t everything, and some leaf blowers can push debris a long distance despite having lower air speeds. This Husqvarna model has air speeds of 170 mph, but it can push leaves 17.5 feet, which is among the best when compared with other leaf blowers in our comparison.","This <a href=\"/best-leaf-blowers\">leaf blower</a> has the advantage of doubling as a yard or shop vacuum, and the vacuum bag can hold up to 17 gallons of yard debris. It weighs in at 9.6 pounds, which is heavier than average, so you’ll start feeling the weight as the bag fills up. This blower has a mulch ratio of approximately 16:1, which means it compresses 16 parts of debris down to one part mulch. The tiny mulching knives inside this device make quick work of leaves, and that results in you getting more room in the vacuum bag.","This leaf blower comes with interchangeable round and flat nozzles to direct airflow at two different speed levels. The inline design keeps the airstream aligned with the handle to reduce stress on your arms and wrists. The fan on the left outside of the body keeps this leaf blower balanced so it doesn&#39;t push back as you try to maneuver. It is among the most expensive leaf blowers we looked at, however.","This model can reach noise levels up to 97.9 decibels, making it louder than most of the blowers in our comparison, so ear protection is a good idea. The Husqvarna 125BVx runs on gas, which will require that you mix fuels together, and you will have to breathe fumes to some extent. It comes with a typical warranty period of two years, but that should give you plenty of time to break it in before the warranty runs out. ","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Husqvarna 125BVx is a gas-powered leaf blower that will blow leaves up to an impressive 17.5 feet. This blower also has a vacuum and mulch function so you can turn leaves into fertilizer. It’s always a good idea to wear ear protection, but that is especially important with this leaf blower, which is the loudest of any in our reviews. This blower is also heavier than average, but it is a well-balanced, high functioning machine with most of the convenience features most people will need, including anti-vibration and hand cushions."]},"id":"c2003599-cdbd-4891-8388-07969dc1c445","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56471","url":"/husqvarna-leaf-blower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-22T23:48:57Z","datePublished":"2013-05-22T23:48:57Z","name":"Husqvarna 125BVx","synopsis":"Whether you have a large or small lawn, leaf blowers can be exceptionally helpful tools for yard maintenance.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The Husqvarna 125BVx has a nice feature package and plenty of power to move a lot of leaves and debris out of the way or vacuum them up.
