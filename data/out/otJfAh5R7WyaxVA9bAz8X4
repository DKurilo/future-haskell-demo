You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Dell&#39;s XPS 18 is one of the few portable <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one computers</a> with a built-in battery. It doubles as both a desktop PC and a tablet. It has a sleek and thin design and features a bright, 18.4-inch touchscreen display.","Packed with an Intel Core-i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive, this all-in-one PC is speedy and has more than enough storage for the typical user. It really doesn&#39;t look like other all-in-one PCs. It&#39;s held up by two kickstand feet from the device&#39;s back that keep the screen upright or angled horizontally on your table. A charging stand, wireless mouse and keyboard are also included, which allow it to resemble a traditional all-in-one computer. Since the XPS 18 has a battery, you are free to move around your house with it or rest it on your lap. A rubber border wraps around the outer edge making it easy to grip. It isn&#39;t that heavy either, weighing just 5 pounds, and it is less than an inch thick.","The touchscreen display is bright and extremely clear; it has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. As attractive as the screen is though, you can&#39;t deny the bezel is just too thick. Also, since this personal computer lacks an HDMI input, you are unable to use it as a screen for your video game console or Blu-ray player.","When gaming on the machine, you may experience some lag. There are other, more powerful gaming all-in-one PCs, and this PC&#39;s integrated Intel HD 4400 graphics card can hinder your gaming experience. However, this machine isn’t intended for gaming. The touchscreen, though, is very responsive. Dell even includes some mini games that put the touchscreen to use, like an air hockey game where you lay the computer flat on a coffee table and play with a friend. There are also apps you can download that transform the PC into an instrument.","When it comes to ports, you get two USB 3.0 ports, a headset jack and an SD card reader. If you want to use an additional monitor, you&#39;ll have to purchase a WiDi adapter separately. This computer has built-in speakers on the sides of the device, but they just need a little more bass.","This all-in-one touchscreen PC has both a 1TB hard drive and a 32GB solid-state drive. The unit lacks an optical drive as well as an Ethernet jack for wired internet connections, but it supports 802.11n wireless, Bluetooth 4.0 and has a 720p webcam. The battery for the XPS 18 lasts up to four hours, which should give you enough time to surf the web, respond to email or watch a movie. The XPS 18 stays relatively cool during use, even while streaming content."]},"id":"b9bc578d-f04a-4895-9f05-32ba0faf1941","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8da523e5-ad3d-4794-a1d8-6988c6c0411c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Dell&#39;s XPS 18 is incredibly versatile.
