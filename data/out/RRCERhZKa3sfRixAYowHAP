There are advantages to both, but here we&#39;ll look mainly at real-time credit card processing. Read on to learn how this type of processing works and what situations it&#39;s best for.","When your customer hands over plastic to pay for a purchase, you can choose to gain authorization for that transaction immediately while your customer is still standing in front of you. This is real-time processing, and it ensures both you and your customer that the transaction has been authorized by the bank that issued the card. Batch processing, on the other hand, collects and stores card data for later processing as a group.","Real-time processing assures you that each transaction is approved before your customer leaves your shop with merchandise. It also ensures that goods bought online are paid for before you ship them. For these reasons, real-time processing gives you, the merchant, a great deal of security for each transaction. In addition, real-time processing is a quick process that often costs less than batch processing.","Now, there are some concerns with this near-instant card-processing approach. Since transactions are approved immediately, there&#39;s no chance to stop a thief who presents a card that has not yet been called in as lost or stolen. As the merchant, you run the risk that you&#39;re accepting a stolen card, and the immediate nature of real-time credit card processing means the true cardholder&#39;s bank will become part of the scam. With the delay of batch processing, the chances that a stolen card will be processed are reduced, since the batch delay may offer enough time for the true cardholder to report the card missing or stolen.","Keep in mind that when cards are used fraudulently, consumers are the ones who are protected. As part of the credit card processing network, merchants are expected to check IDs and do whatever else is necessary at the register to be sure that any cards handed to them are being used legally and properly.","Another concern with real-time card processing is a simpler one: the speed of your processing equipment or server. When processing in real time, you need equipment that can handle the transaction quickly and easily. Holdups in real-time processing can lead to loss of customer confidence in your payment-acceptance methods.","If you&#39;re an online merchant only, real-time processing is the preferred method. You want each customer to be able to check out quickly and easily, and typically, real-time processing allows your customers to see within seconds whether their cards have been accepted for their purchases. In addition, most real-time systems for online merchants also provide database information showing all of your online business transactions. This can be an especially useful feature if your business will be selling a high volume of goods online.","Before choosing real-time credit card processing over batch processing, be sure you understand the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as your anti-fraud responsibilities as a merchant."]},"id":"452a99e0-dc62-412b-a4b6-3f2697aea6de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7156","url":"/what-is-real-time-credit-card-processing","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-04-10T15:21:05Z","datePublished":"2012-04-10T15:21:05Z","name":"What is Real-Time Credit Card Processing?","synopsis":"Whether you sell goods online or in a retail shop, you can choose between two types of credit card processing: real-time processing and batch processing.","review":{},"strapline":"Whether you sell goods online or in a retail shop, you can choose between two types of credit card processing: real-time processing and batch processing.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-15T19:37:25Z","id":"RRCERhZKa3sfRixAYowHAP","meta":{"title":"What is Real-Time Credit Card Processing?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
