All you have to do is insert the DVD you want to copy into the optical drive. It loads directly into the application’s main interface where all of the features are located. There are no splash screens or load times to deal with when you launch the program.","This DVD copy software application for Mac has two main functions: Burn DVD and Copy to Local Disk. These features are clearly labeled to eliminate the guesswork. Burn DVD creates a copy of your disc on a new, blank one. Copy to Local Disk rips the DVD file and folder structure off the disc you&#39;re copying and saves it onto your hard drive.","Customization is identical for each option but is limited to Full Disc and Main Movie. The former  duplicates all of the content on the original disc, including the movie, menus, extra features, subtitles, etc. The latter copies only the main movie, which the software automatically selects as the file with the longest running time.","Magic Mac covers the essentials, but this Mac burning software application omits several customization options found in other similar products. For example, it doesn&#39;t allow you to select individual files to burn to your disc, and it doesn&#39;t let you split large files to two discs. The lack of features reduces Magic Mac to a simple application. Another thing to keep in mind is that when you&#39;re burning DVDs on your Mac with this program, you&#39;ll need to keep the original DVD, because Magic Mac doesn&#39;t copy the ISO file from the original DVD. The inclusion of any of these features would have earned this application a higher spot on our side-by-side comparison chart."]},"id":"87ef69d2-6523-43f4-b9a0-51e24e3e1d45","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6aa33f63-5fc3-441f-b94d-54b654c97d06","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If this program had a few more tools, it could rise above the competition.
