You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","CompuPic Pro is <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo manager software</a> that gives you basic control over the elements in your photos. This digital photo management software also allows you to organize your photos with keyword assignments. While you can share your photos with CompuPic, the sites it shares to are more obscure: Fotki and PhotoIsland.","You&#39;ll find tools to bring out the reds, blues and greens in your photos individually. You can increase the sharpness of your photos, adjust the amount of noise and remove red eye. CompuPic gives you the option to turn on its Wheel Zoom feature that allows you to zoom in and out with the wheel on our mouse. This photo manager software gives you the tools to increase the brightness of your photos while being able to adjust the black levels back to true black so they don&#39;t look over exposed.","CompuPic enables you to create slideshows from your photos. You can add text to your pictures. With CompuPic, you can add rectangular or circular vignettes to your photos. This photo manager software also has a handful of effects you can apply to your photos, such as rainbow, which adds each of the colors of the rainbow over the image.","You can organize your photos by keyword. The search option in CompuPic allows you to look for photos by file name or keyword. You can see the keywords associated with a photo by looking at the picture&#39;s properties.","You can share your photos via email, as a picture greeting card or through Photodex PictureCD.com. Once you are done editing your photos in CompuPic, you can send them to AmazingMail Postcard or Printroom for printing. You can also post your photos on Fotki or PhotoIsland; however, when we tried to access the PhotoIsland website, it wasn&#39;t working.","You can edit your photos with CompuPic&#39;s photo manager software without worrying about losing your originals or damaging the files. CompuPic also captures the metadata for image files. The metadata gives you information about the picture such as the camera settings when you took the photo and the file name with which you&#39;ve saved it.","CompuPic&#39;s photo manager software is easy to use. You&#39;ll find most of the common photo-editing tools but not many extra tools, which sometimes complicates other software navigation. Some of the symbols on the buttons for the tools in CompuPic are not self-explanatory. For instance, the CompuPic buttons for hue and color are striped with colors. We had to hover our cursor over some tool buttons to see what their functions were.","One troublesome feature we discovered with CompuPic is that when an image is open on the full screen, if you click on the photo instead of the tools, the window will close. When this happens, you lose all the alterations you&#39;ve already made. This didn&#39;t occur when we had the photo image slightly minimized, however.","All the editing you do in CompuPic is done in a preview window. This is less convenient because much of the detail is lost in the small window. Reducing noise and adjusting the sharpness were two tools with which we noticed this inconvenience most.","Photodex, the manufacturer of CompuPic Pro, has an email contact page on its website. You can also call, mail or fax Photodex. You can see your order status online. The CompuPic manual is also online, where you can find FAQs for the product too."]},"id":"ea97e976-2c3c-412e-9858-d00ff1f01b70","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2c5af9bb-4956-4db6-9bcc-fc90a43b9427","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CompuPic photo manager software has many of the basic tools you&#39;d look for in digital photo management software.
