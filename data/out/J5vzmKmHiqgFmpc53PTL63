The bass, although audibly present, is hard to distinguish. In fact, it&#39;s very monotone. The highs are crisper for vocals, but are unexciting without the sharpness unique to good bass. The performance, combined with difficult-to-use control features and an overly tight fit, keep these <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">bass headphones</a> from ranking higher on our review.","The best thing about the Denon AH-D400&#39;s performance is the 115 decibels of sensitivity, which means you can turn the volume up higher than other bass headphones. The 1,300 megawatts of power also is much higher than other models, so your solid bass headphones can handle higher volumes for longer periods. An impedance of 64 ohms prevents the AH-D400s from draining your device&#39;s battery as well.","For bass heavy headphones, it&#39;s surprising that this set does a better job at highs. The lows and bass lines blend together, getting lost among the highs and mids. Only select bass sounds tend to boom – bass drums beats sound a little clearer, but bass guitar riffs are muddy and indistinct.","Like many other headphones for good bass, the Denon AH-D600s have controls for your phone or Apple music device. However, the volume control on the right ear cup is confusing to use and you can hear the knob turning while you turning the volume up or down. The right ear cup also has a button for playing and pausing, picking up or ending calls, but in our experience, sometimes it doesn’t respond.","The Denon AH-D400 headphones fit snuggly while you listen to your bass hits like other best headphones for bass. This gives you decent sound isolation and an okay soundscape. At 11 ounces, they are a bit on the heavy side, and although the snugness helps seal in music, it does so by clamping your head. Only one cord is included, but it is single sided and short enough for easy travel.","Denon has support options, but they are a little sparse. You can either comb through the company&#39;s support pages or look to the bottom of the webpage for contact details. You can call customer service, but you can&#39;t email or chat live. To send any sort of question or inquiry you have to have a Denon account or authorize them to see information about your social media accounts. You can search through FAQs, but there are no direct questions about the AH-D400s. Denon does offer a one-year warranty and many product manuals for PDF download, which is nice."]},"id":"d9713a9d-fcef-43c6-9d86-adb7f0d7b673","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"628141da-729f-45d2-92ba-6c7fbbadc6dd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Denon AH-D400 bass headphones do produce bass like other best bass headphones, but in exchange they compromise precise sound quality.
