Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If your electronic needs require purchasing a simple remote with a simple design and simple list of features for simply controlling simple devices, then the Universal Remote Control R6, ranking number nine in our <a href=\"/best-universal-remotes\">universal remote</a> side-by-side comparison, is the universal remote for you.","Yes, this universal remote can be classified as &#34;simple&#34; in every aspect, but for some, having the options to control only six devices, and not dealing with a running list of features they must program, may be very appealing. So, if you are looking for a universal TV remote with the lowest price tag in our universal remote review, and one of the shortest feature lists, then we would recommend this remote for the simple things.","In the middle section of the universal remote lie the four favorite-channel buttons, color-coded and alphabetized for your convenience. The activity buttons are placed at the very top of the remote, along with the separate on and off buttons, which we like.","The URC R6&#39;s claim to fame is their MacroPower Total System. With just one touch, this system turns all of your programmed electronic devices on or off. We found it interesting that URC thought to include this &#34;unique&#34; feature and instructions on how to use it in its user manual. All of the other remotes also have this total system on or off capability, but because it is a feature that is just expected from universal remotes, others did not advertise it.","While the packaging tells you that the URC R6 is a universal remote, you could never tell just by looking at the façade. The simplistic design and lack of an LCD screen make the URC R6 look just like a regular TV remote. The lack of an LCD screen works for this remote, however, due to the logically placed buttons that are large enough to see and that have the right amount of spacing.","Like the other URC products, the R6 has an online PDF user manual (which is almost identical to the URC WR7 manual) and an option to call the technical support help line.","In our higher-ranked universal remote products, we have seen online setup and an on-screen wizard set up. With the URC R6 programmable remote, there are three ways to set up your remote:"]},"id":"4d5b8ff7-0446-42b3-a573-5c610d8e1aec","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Quick set up = This method is the fastest way to program your remote.
