Scotts Push Reel Lawn Mower is one of the best push mowers on the market. It cuts with consistency and has a wide cutting path, and it gives you precise control over the length of the grass you’re cutting. The handlebars on this mower are both ergonomic and padded, which makes it easy on your hands and more comfortable on your palms and fingers. It also means that you’re far less likely to develop blisters or other injuries after prolonged use.","But this <a href=\"/best-lawnmowers-review\">push lawnmower</a> is not without its flaws; running over twigs, rocks or other lawn debris can easily cause the blades to stop turning. This mower has five rotating blades that cut your grass to a uniform level. It also features a lever that you can use to easily adjust the height of your grass. You can choose between nine separate grass-cutting levels, which is the most of any mower we tested.","One thing this product lacks is a grass clippings catcher. You’ll have to rake up your grass clippings when you’re done mowing the lawn. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The mowers that include bags have limitations because they can fill up quickly and require frequent emptying.","The blades on this mower yield one of the most consistent cuts of all the mowers we reviewed. One of those tests included mowing a 10’ x 10’ portion of well-maintained grass. This mower only required us to make nine passes over the test area to yield a consistent grass length. Lesser products take as many as 20 passes to achieve the same results.","This mower has nine separate cutting-height settings that allow you to adjust the height of your cut anywhere from 2 inches to 4 inches. This alone is a longer cutting range than most of the products we reviewed. However, you can also set the cutting level to as low as 1 inch by manually adjusting the blades using the included wrench. This gives this mower an effective cutting range of three inches. This is the widest range of any push mower in our reviews.","At 20 inches, this reel mower also cuts the widest path of those we tested. However, we found that you lose about 1/4 of an inch of that width on each side, giving you an effective cutting width of 19 1/2 inches. This is a common disparity among push mowers, but it’s one you should be aware of.","One of the downsides of this mower is that while the blades are sharp enough to cut a variety of grasses, it does a terrible job at rolling over yard debris such as sticks, or even grass clippings. In just our 10’ x 10’ test area, this mower jammed three separate times. Just make sure your yard is free of foreign objects before you start mowing.","This product requires some assembly. While the mower unit itself is fully built out of the box, you have put together the handlebars and shaft that connect it all together. If you follow the instructions found in the manual, you should be able to fully assemble this mower in about 15 minutes.","An important note about assembly: The manufacturer claims you don’t need any tools to assemble this machine. This claim comes close to being true. The six wing nuts are easy to attach to their associated bolts, and you can screw them together to a point. However, we found that you’ll need a pair of needle nose pliers to hold the bolts in place to ensure a secure connection. Additionally, you need to attach some e-rings to the base of the mower to keep the shaft in place. This is a tight area, and you’ll probably need the pliers to attach the e-rings as well.","While this is reel lawnmower isn’t the easiest to push, it’s a far cry from the hardest. We met some resistance when mowing grass over 4 inches long – but it shouldn’t be anything you can’t handle.","The manufacturer of this push mower offers a limited three-year warranty in the event that you get a defective unit or encounter other problems. If your lawnmower requires repairs that are not covered by the warranty, you can order spare parts online, by phone or factory direct.","The Scotts Push Reel Lawn Mower is a powerful, consistent and reliable machine. Its wide cutting path, control over the length of the cut and ergonomic design are its chief selling points. As long as you keep your lawn well maintained and free of debris, you shouldn’t have too much difficultly achieving an evenly cut and good-looking lawn."]},"id":"4b60065c-920a-4e98-ba6b-0dd308a19794","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64519","url":"/scotts-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
