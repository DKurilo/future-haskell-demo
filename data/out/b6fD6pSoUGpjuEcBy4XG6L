You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Atomik Barbwire is one of the <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">best remote control boats</a> available. This deep V-shaped RC boat zips through the waves with ease, and it&#39;s fast. Reaching speeds up to 25 mph, this is one of the fastest boats you can get. Although the Barbwire is speedy, it has satisfactory handing and isn&#39;t too difficult to drive. There isn&#39;t a steep learning curve involved.","We were impressed at the Barbwire&#39;s ability to handle choppy water with ease. It slices through the water like a bullet. Because of its speed, the remote control boat doesn&#39;t hold close to the water; instead, it bounces off it like a skipping rock. The Barbwire boat is quite responsive, but it handles left turns better than right ones.","The boat is easy to flip though. You&#39;d be wise to ease into turns slowly rather than sharply. Fortunately, the boat has a self-righting feature so if you flip the boat, it can flip itself over. Only a handful of RC boats have this feature. We found that the boat occasionally submarines or nosedives easily. Luckily, because of its high speeds, the Barbwire hops right out of the water like a salmon swimming upstream. You should definitely seal the hatch with tape to prevent as much water as possible from entering.","This radio-controlled boat is quite durable. In our tests, it withstood crashes with other boats and was unscathed when we crashed it against the wall of a pool, so you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about the hull cracking if you run into a rock or another boat during a race. Since this RC boat is ready to run, you don&#39;t have to worry about purchasing a battery or a transmitter. The transmitter has a range of 450 feet, which is plenty long enough for you to drive it across a large pond or lake. The boat comes with a 9V battery for the transmitter, and it takes approximately 1.5 hours to charge the boat. The battery lasts for 10 minutes, which is an average run time for a remote control boat. You also get a display stand, some extra propellers and a charger.","Atomik has a 90-day warranty for its Barbwire Boat. They also sell replacement parts in the event something malfunctions. You can reach the manufacturer by telephone, email social media. On the website there are FAQs and forums where you can seek advice from other boaters or download the instruction manual. There are also several YouTube videos of the boat in action."]},"id":"6bddfbca-9f3f-4934-8552-742874f8ab32","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"61f9dab1-b3b2-4765-b99e-66a4d85a0dd7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Atomik Barbwire boat performs magnificently.
