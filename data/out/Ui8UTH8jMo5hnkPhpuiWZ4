You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.&#34;</em>","Spector Pro has its pros and cons, but it excels in the realm of recording and documenting children&#39;s online activities, even compared to a wide range of comprehensive <a href=\"/best-parental-software\">parental control software</a>. If you want to know exactly what your child has done on the internet, this application is a good choice. If you are more concerned about preventing behavior in the first place, Spector Pro is a little weaker, though it does have some filtering and blocking capabilities.","In terms of recording, you get to see just about any of your child&#39;s online activities you can imagine – any file they access or download, their keystrokes, the applications they use and more. On the blocking side of things, you will be able to specify websites your children are not allowed to access.","You will be able to run this child monitoring software in stealth mode so that your kids do not have to know they are being monitored. Telling them they are being monitored is more effective in some ways, but every child and every situation is different. Having a stealth option is nice regardless.","The company sends an email with installation instructions as soon as you buy the software. If you follow the instructions, installation is easy. You will first need to disable all antispyware and antivirus applications. A set-up wizard walks you through the configuration process and prompts you to create a password and a sequence of hot keys. These features protect the software&#39;s settings from attempts to disable it. Uninstalling the surveillance software is easy. Removal happens in the administrative interface with a few clicks of the mouse.","Within the application settings, parents can specify keywords and keyword phrases that concern them. Once a child types one of these keywords, the parental filter software automatically generates and sends a keyword alert to the parent via email. These alerts notify parents of potential problems. This useful feature provides a safeguard for children.","Unfortunately, email keyword alerts are the only remote access parents have to the software&#39;s captured information. The application captures transcripts of chat conversations, every email sent and received, social networking sites, web searches, launched applications and more. An Internet Lingo translator defines simple abbreviations such as BRB (Be Right Back), LIC (Liquor), LGH (Let&#39;s Get High) and others. When encountering an unknown acronym, rolling the mouse over the word causes Spector Pro to display definitions.","This parental control software can capture a large amount of activity. A parent could become overwhelmed with all of the information, but the reporting features are streamlined and easy to navigate. A clickable Top Ten Summary enables parents to view the top ten activities the child engaged in. The Quick Search feature is useful for viewing information that is not contained in the reports.","Each purchase of Spector Pro licenses one computer and comes with a 72-hour money-back guarantee. Support on the SpectorSoft website is outstanding. The site has a searchable knowledgebase and FAQs. Telephone and real-time chat are also available."]},"id":"660b8766-e78c-4ef2-ba3c-2fe93a1bdb77","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"44021fe4-0bb3-40a9-bc2b-3fb80142a106","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Spector Pro is reliable at capturing children&#39;s internet activity.
