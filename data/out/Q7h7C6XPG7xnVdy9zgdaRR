You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Pro Boat Impulse <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">remote control boat</a> is a great mid-range boat for any user. This 17-inch RC boat is fair priced, well designed and performs strongly. It has above-average maneuverability, and its deep V-designed body can withstand rough waters. However, the clocked speed and the run time is among the lowest in our review.","After multiple runs at the local reservoir, we gave the Impulse a B- for handling. It can easily handle the rougher waters well enough, and it&#39;s capable of making sharp turns without much problem. However, it was surprisingly easy to flip, especially considering it&#39;s one of the slowest boats in our review and requires a wider turning radius than most RC boats.","We clocked the Impulse at 15 miles per hour, which is a full 10 mph slower than the quoted speed given by the manufacturer. This was also the second slowest speed recorded in our tests. Of course, you can always upgrade parts and sharpen the propeller to make it faster, which is part of the thrill in getting into the radio control boat hobby. The slower speed also makes it an ideal RC boat for a younger novice user, as you&#39;re less likely to lose control.","One of the biggest downsides to the Pro Boat Impulse is the lack of a watertight casing. Most of the RC boats we tested took on some water (which is why we recommend using marine tape to seal the hatches), but the Impulse took on more water than other boats. This can cause it to list to one side, which greatly impacted the handling later in the runs.","The Impulse&#39;s run time was very disappointing. On a full charge, the boat&#39;s battery averaged just six minutes on the water before the battery died. There&#39;s little value in driving out to local lake or pond for a boat that only gives you a few minutes of fun. On a positive note, the battery only takes an hour to fully charge. Still, we recommend buying extra batteries so you can enjoy the boat longer than it takes to boil an egg.","The Impulse received an A for durability. Despite running it at full speed into a concrete wall and purposefully colliding it with other boats, it held up really well, only experiencing a few scratches. When you consider that some of the boats we reviewed broke down during testing, the Impulse&#39;s durability is a significant plus."]},"id":"ebcb1139-3bfa-4a71-b7d6-aaabe269981c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"01facef8-e0f3-4a9f-8c10-e1f0884bc091","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pro Boat Impulse is a solid choice in RC boat.
