You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Cajun Injector <a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\">turkey fryer</a> is a good option to consider if you’re looking for an indoor unit that allows you to fry a turkey at any time of year even if the weather is bad. You can only fry up to a 14-pound turkey in this indoor turkey fryer, which is the smallest capacity of any turkey fryer on our lineup.","This electric turkey fryer has all the safety features you’d want in a turkey fryer – most importantly an auto shut-off feature. This will automatically turn off the power to the unit if it&#39;s getting too hot. Keep in mind that in order to turn the unit back on after it’s been automatically shut off, you must reset it by following the instructions in the product manual.","This unit also has a lifter, a cooking basket and a vented lid. The vented lid allows steam to escape while the fryer is in use. The lifter and cooking basket work together to ensure you place the turkey inside and remove it from the unit safely.","You don’t get power or ready indicator lights on this unit, which are standard features on electric turkey fryers. It does, however, come with a built-in timer, a thermostat and a drain valve, all of which add convenience.","You get one year of warranty coverage with this Cajun Injector electric turkey fryer, which is fairly standard across the board with these kinds of units. You can contact the manufacturer by phone and email for any help and support you’ll need with this turkey fryer, but the website doesn&#39;t offer a user manual, instructional videos or answers to frequently asked questions. Additionally, you can’t get help via a live chat option, which is usually the fastest and most convenient way to contact the manufacturer."]},"id":"acff006b-0dec-4db3-908e-862ecd53575c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6cf3333c-318b-457d-bd5c-d46c9f8b3601","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cajun Injector turkey cooker can’t fry a super large turkey, but it can handle a turkey up to 14 pounds.
