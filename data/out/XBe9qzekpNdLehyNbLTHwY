We’ve spent hours pouring over product specifications, user reviews and professional reviews to find the best of the best blenders — and that was all before we began our own tests. We only bought high-quality blenders for our in-house tests. There are many types of blenders, but we decided to focus mostly on full-sized blenders with large pitchers and the ones that cost less than $500. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We have done multiple rounds of testing with blenders over the years, each time having them perform common tasks that demonstrate their ability to create favorite foods, quickly and easily. We used a common mixed berry recipe for smoothies, using fully frozen fruits, and used the same proportions in each blender, analyzing how smooth the texture was at the end. We made fresh tomato soup with each of them in an effort to see which ones do the best job of emulsifying and heating ingredients. We tested their temperature at the end to see which blenders could get the soup piping hot and ready to serve. We also crushed ice with each unit to see how helpful they would be in party settings for frozen drinks.","Apart from performance, we considered things like user-friendliness. We measured how much noise each blender makes so you will know if you can make your early morning smoothie without waking your family – or the neighbors. We considered dimensions and made note of abnormally tall or wide machines that might be inconvenient in different ways. We considered how easy they are to clean, including whether or not their pitchers can go in the <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> and how easy their controls are to wipe down. We took note of how long their warranties last, as well, so you know whether you can count on the companies for long-lasting support of their product. ","<strong>How Much Do Blenders Cost?</strong>","The prices of countertop blenders vary widely. The best-selling units on Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy average out to about $90. However, the best blenders on other review sites average out to about $300. In our years of testing different blenders, we have found there are decent blenders at almost every price. Once you get above $200, you will always get excellent blending capabilities, though the ones in the $400 price range are even more impressive, quieter and more powerful. Below the $200 mark is hit or miss. We did find some inexpensive gems. Our Best Value winner, <a href=\"/oster-review\">Oster Versa</a>, costs less than $200. We tested five that cost under $100 and the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nutribullet-pro-32-oz-blender-silver/4361100.p?ref=199&amp;loc=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;acampID=1&amp;siteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-dedBrPZ.aq4rfSyI.4gHqA\">NutriBullet Pro</a> was great in our experience.","<strong>Which Bullet is Best?</strong>","Personal blenders are appealing in many ways. You can blend smoothies right in the cup you will drink from, which cuts down on dishwashing duties. They also occupy very little counter space, which makes them good for smaller kitchens. There are so many of them, though, it can be tough to pick one out, especially if you want one of the Bullet-style blenders. We lined four of them up, side by side, to get a feel for their various strengths and weaknesses. We took one typical fruit smoothie recipe and made it in each blender – NutriBullet Balance, Magic Bullet, NutriBullet Rx and NutriBullet Pro. We also blended some ice to see how these might do for making frozen drinks. <br/><strong><br/>Best Bullet Overall</strong>","The <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nutribullet-pro-32-oz-blender-silver/4361100.p?ref=199&amp;loc=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;acampID=1&amp;siteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-posbpaobdKGlDtBlIXqPDg\">NutriBullet Pro</a> was the best Bullet in our comparison. It is compact enough to provide the convenience of a Bullet blender, with a tiny counter top footprint and minimal cleaning, but it’s big enough to have serious blending power. The smoothie was fantastic and it shredded ice to perfection, although we found one small chunk of banana after blending our smoothie for the allotted time. A few more pulses would have conquered it. Plus, this model is under $100. That cannot be said of many Bullet-style blenders.","<strong>Best Upgrade</strong>","The <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nutribullet-Balance-Smart-Blender/392366425?u1=toptenreviewsttrenUS43Review75&amp;oid=650884.1&amp;wmlspartner=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;sourceid=12666225813025252625&amp;affillinktype=10&amp;veh=aff\">NutriBullet Balance</a> stood out as particularly good in our tests when compared to the Magic Bullet, NutriBullet Rx and NutriBullet Pro. The NutriBullet Balance was not the easiest to use but it is more convenient that traditional blenders. The smoothie came out perfect – no chunks left over. It was also perfect for ice, coming up with perfect shreds for a daiquiri or margarita. This Bullet also adds some nice features, including a built-in scale. The associated app can help you stay on top of the number of calories you are consuming, and it offers recipe ideas and general dieting motivation. The Balance provides all of the advantages you expect from a Bullet-style blender – compact design, great smoothies and ease of use – but it also offers extras that might actually be helpful in getting healthier. It costs more than a lot of the Bullets we looked at, so it might not be for every buyer.","<strong>Can I Use a Blender Instead of a Food Processor?</strong>","It honestly depends on what you’re intending to do. You’ve seen your blender easily puree soft fruits and vegetables, and you might want to try blending some heartier foods. Keep in mind that most blenders are not equipped with the power or technology necessary to tackle all food types. Blenders are designed to create fibrous liquids. Food processors, on the other hand, come with multiple attachments to help you shred, chop, blend and slice.","Using a blender on certain foods will likely just break your motor or damage your blades. This is different for industrial-level blenders, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-Original-Professional-Grade-Pre-programmed-10-speeds/dp/B000GIGZXM?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Blendtec</a>, which can handle a wider variety of foods. However, professional-grade machines are way more expensive than the average blender. In our own testing, we only used consumer-level blenders. If you’re wanting a machine that can help you chop vegetables, potatoes, cheese and leafy greens among other foods, you should definitely consider the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DFP-14BCNY-Processor-Brushed-Stainless/dp/B01AXM4WV2/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Cuisinart DFP-14BCNY 14-Cup</a>, which was the best overall <a href=\"/best-food-processors\">food processor</a> we tested.","<strong>Foods to Avoid Blending</strong>","Many blenders struggle with leafy greens – they’re less likely to actually blend them and more likely to leave long strips of spinach in your smoothie. In addition, blending leafy greens can permanently stain your blender, giving the cup a brown or green tint.","You also must resist the urge to grind coffee beans or cocoa beans in your blender. The same goes for hard nuts. Your blender&#39;s motor is likely not strong enough to work with these hard foods and may die if you try to blend them.","Similarly, you should never make dough in your blender. When the blades spin too quickly combining water and flour, it creates a very strong gluten bond that can permanently damage your device. It’s better to use a <a href=\"/best-mixers\">mixer</a> or <a href=\"/best-bread-makers\">bread maker</a> when making dough.","As <a href=\"https://www.southernliving.com/kitchen-assistant/food-blender-tips\">Southern Living </a>states, you also shouldn&#39;t blend potatoes. Since they’re made of starch, potatoes whipped in a blender have a gross, sticky texture that&#39;s far from fluffy like mashed potatoes should be.","Also, keep in mind that strong tasting foods, such as garlic, can leave a lingering flavor in your blender that might take several washings to get rid of. Nothing&#39;s more disappointing than taking a sip of your fruit smoothie and tasting onion.","You also want to avoid blending super hot liquids. Steam rising inside the blending cup can cause the lid to blow open, raining hot liquid down on your kitchen. That being said, some blenders are designed to blend soup – for example, the <a href=\"/cuisinart-hurricane-review\">Cuisinart Hurricane</a>. Just make sure the contents aren&#39;t too hot while in the blender.","<strong>What to Make with Your Blender</strong>","A blender can make so much more than just smoothies, but you may not always have that in mind when you buy one.
