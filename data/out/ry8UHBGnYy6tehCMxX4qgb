Ironically, in the electronic age people are using more paper than ever; it s just that they re using it to print and photocopy things instead of writing things by hand. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"8b7aae34-e450-47f9-a2bc-bdfee141ca47","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Many sites distribute products made of pre- and post-consumer recycled materials including paper, ink cartridges, labels, file folders and much more. Pre-consumer recycled material is typically collected from manufacturing. For example, if a company cuts shapes out of large plastic sheets, the scraps can be melted down and re-used for other purposes. Paper products are readily recyclable and even shredded documents can be recycled. Recycled paper costs slightly more than paper made from new materials but in the long run, we re all going to have to become more conscious of our consumerism. Buying recycled and eco-friendly products is an easy way to help the office supplies industry to become more sustainable and ultimately saves trees.","A lot of manufacturing facilities are now using smarter energy sources like solar and wind energy to power machinery and regulate the temperatures of warehouses and production areas. Going green can also be as simple as buying long-lasting light bulbs and eliminating light and climate control in unused portions of a facility. Amazon.com recently decreased its energy use significantly by changing the lighting schedule in its storage spaces to eliminate energy use while the facility is closed.","Some manufacturers are finding ways of reducing or eliminating toxic chemicals from their fabrication processes. With so many advances in the market of natural chemicals, it s getting easier for companies to choose natural alternatives to traditionally used noxious chemicals.","Some stores including <a href=\"/\">Office Max</a> offer recycling of electronics. Used electronics devices can have a severe negative impact on landfills because they contain toxic chemicals and metals that are not biodegradable and therefore contaminate the soil and ground water permanently. Office Max s electronics recycling program is easy to use. Simply request a container from the Office Max website, fill it with approved devices and mail it back at no cost. In fact, before you throw away any office supplies, do a little research. Most office supply products are recyclable and/or available in recycled versions. If everyone takes small steps toward decreasing the environmental impact of the office supply industry, together we can make a huge difference."],"type":"ol"},"id":"bd0d07c9-31a1-4980-8fb3-57c9342b2df3","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Now It s Your Turn!</strong>","Companies like Office Max are trying to do their part to reduce the environmental impact of the office supplies industry, but if we re going to make an even bigger difference, we re all going to have to get involved. Most communities have recycling centers as well as curbside recycling programs where the materials can be picked up directly. All recycling programs accept aluminum, paper, cardboard, plastic and glass, at a minimum.
