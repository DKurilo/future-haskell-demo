It should surprise no one that the company&#39;s foray into the <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray player</a> market yielded it a spot on our top 10 lineup of the best products in this category. The Sharp BD-HP25U&#39;s standout features include full 1080p resolution, Wi-Fi connectivity and online apps, including Netflix, Pandora and YouTube. Furthermore, this 3D Blu-ray player has HDMI and USB connections to connect the latest devices to the player.","The most important thing in any 3D Blu-ray player is its ability to competently handle 3D movies. No player on our side-by-side comparison chart has any problems with this signature functionality. The Sharp BD-HP25U is no exception. Input any 3D Blu-ray Disc of your choosing and all the 3D content is displayed with flawless accuracy. The only thing standing in the way of flawless quality would be the monitor you choose to play the movies on.","The connection options on the Sharp BD-HP25U are somewhat limited but adequate for small home theaters. You get a single HDMI port, two USB slots and an Ethernet terminal. We normally like to see more than one HDMI port along with legacy connection methods such as coaxial and composite, which are completely absent. Analog connections may be antiquated, but they are still in wide use, and it would behoove manufacturers not to ignore their existence simply because their use is in decline.","This 3D Blu-ray player comes with Wi-Fi connectivity, so if you wish to connect this player to the internet, you don&#39;t have to physically wire your player to your modem. That&#39;s a good thing too, because the Sharp BD-HP25U has some great internet apps such as Netflix, Pandora and YouTube. Granted, none of those services stream 3D content, but it&#39;s still nice to watch streaming content on a big screen rather than a small laptop monitor."]},"id":"66dcd3de-04d7-467e-879c-80d3e2f59b1f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"18e2078d-4c3b-49eb-8b30-1970f0472b72","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Sharp BD-HP25U is a nice little 3D Blu-ray player.
