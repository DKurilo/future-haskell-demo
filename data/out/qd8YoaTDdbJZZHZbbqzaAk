This set of binoculars has 10x magnification and a wide field of view at 113 meters. This combination makes it great for tracking wildlife while hunting or on the trail, with the wide field of view making it easier to spot animals and track their movements. The objective lenses are 42 millimeters in diameter, which allows plenty of light to enter the binoculars and reach your eyes, resulting in overall brighter images. This means you can use the binoculars in low-light settings or at dawn or dusk, making them excellent hunting binoculars.","During our testing process, we conducted a survey in which our participants rated each pair of binoculars on their optical qualities. Without fail, all of our participants found the Bushnell Legend Ultra HD were very clear and produced high-quality images. This is due to the BAK-4 prisms and multicoated lenses these Bushnell binoculars have, both of which help transmit light for clear images to your eyes. This set of binoculars does not have phase correction coating on the prisms, which is unfortunate, as roof prisms generally require this coating to maintain clear images. However, we found the binoculars produced sharp images despite not having this coating.","Our survey participants also found this set of binoculars was incredibly easy to use and comfortable to hold. This is due to their relatively light weight of only 24.7 ounces, which is just below the average weight of all the binoculars we reviewed. We had no trouble adjusting the focus quickly, which means you can get objects into view without fumbling around with the optics.","The Bushnell Legend Ultra HD can survive the outdoors, as it&#39;s both waterproof and fogproof. This means you can take it with you on a hike, out hunting or on the road without fear of permanent damage to it from a little bad weather. To set the optics up for the steadiest, clearest images possible, you can use a binocular tripod adapter to hook these ones up to an available tripod. The eyecups use a twist-up design, allowing you to quickly move them in place regardless of whether you use glasses or not.","Bushnell offers a limited lifetime warranty on this set of binoculars, which protects you from manufacturer defects. The warranty does not cover any damage to the binoculars from misuse, abuse or the attempt of repairs by an unauthorized technician. If you need to contact the company for any reason, you can find email and phone support on the Bushnell website. You can also search the FAQs page to find answers to many of your questions."]},"id":"a3713647-0b01-4505-aa14-e5c74aa0dea7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cc1ef5a2-f950-42bb-97e9-cbfbc125dcb1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bushnell Legend Ultra HD is a solid set of binoculars that withstands the elements as you track game, explore the great outdoors or travel on the open road.
