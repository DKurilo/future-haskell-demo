The JackHammer, for example, costs $10,000 and is so big and powerful, they recommend you consider making vehicle modifications to handle it. Thankfully, the MTX Audio RTP8A doesn&#39;t require reinforcing the frame. This powered subwoofer is far more affordable at $149 and features an 8-inch woofer installed to a ported enclosure. Don&#39;t be fooled by the small woofer and small enclosure though, it&#39;s certainly capable of bringing the boom.","At around $150, the RTP8A is among the most affordable powered subwoofers available. Only the <a href=\"/pioneer-ts-wx1210a-review\">Pioneer TS-WX1210A</a> and <a href=\"/kenwood-ksc-sw11-review\">Kenwood KSC-SW11</a> are more affordable. However, it&#39;s the most affordable ported subwoofer.","The overall performance of the MTX Audio RTP8A received a B grade. Since this subwoofer has a ported enclosure, the performance isn&#39;t designed to be as tight and accurate as most of the subwoofers I tested. With this in mind, I compared its performance to the <a href=\"/jbl-gt-basspro12-review\">JBL GT-BassPro12</a> – the other ported subwoofers I tested. The RTP8A isn&#39;t nearly as punchy and there was some notable distortion when I isolated the bass. The JBL is the better performing subwoofer, but the MTX is still a good option, especially considering the lower price.","The size of the bass was surprising. Despite having an 8-inch subwoofer and a 120-watt amplifier, the sweet spot of the subwoofer&#39;s performance was massive. While it didn&#39;t reach the same volume as the JBL subwoofer, I could feel the bass from the same distance. The size of the bass really doesn&#39;t match the size of the enclosure and the woofer. It&#39;s like a featherweight boxer punching way above its weight.","At 13 inches high, 13 inches wide and 13.75 inches deep, the enclosure is much bigger than the under-seat subwoofers, but much smaller than the other enclosures. This means it doesn&#39;t take up as much space in your trunk, but it&#39;s far too big to fit in most other locations.","A significant concern is the lack of controls. It has just two controls – a high-pass filter you can adjust between 50 Hz and 200 Hz and a gain. While the high-pass filter control is critical for tuning the subwoofer&#39;s performance, most subwoofers had at least five or six controls to further fine-tune the performance.","The MTX Audio RTP8A packs a lot of punch into a small enclosure. Even with just an 8-inch woofer and a 120-watt amplifier, the bass is big and aggressive. If you&#39;re looking for a ported enclosure at an affordable price, this subwoofer is a good option with plenty of punch."]},"id":"75934774-594a-4475-8101-69a772c95983","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70029","url":"/mtx-audio-rtp8a-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-12T15:08:24Z","datePublished":"2018-06-12T15:08:24Z","name":"MTX Audio RTP8A","synopsis":"MTX Audio has a well-earned reputation for some of the most impressive high-end car subwoofers and car audio equipment on the market.
