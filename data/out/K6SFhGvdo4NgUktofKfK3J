Unlike <a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">portable</a> and <a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">wall air conditioners</a>, central air conditioners distribute conditioned air through a network of ducts. Here you’ll find all the essential information you need to help you pick the best central air conditioner, where we look at everything from how energy efficient an AC unit is to what kind of warranty is needed.","<strong>Best Overall – Amana</strong>","When choosing the best central air conditioner brand, we looked for the one that has the most efficient models covered by the longest warranties. A great example of this is the Amana AVXC20 central air conditioner, which can achieve up to a 24.5 SEER energy efficiency rating and carries a lifetime warranty. It isn’t quite as efficient as Lennox&#39;s top model but still performs remarkably well considering the average SEER rating of the brands we evaluated is 16.7.","Even if a top-tier Amana unit is more expensive upfront than models made by many other brands, its lifetime warranty can save you money over time. For example, if the compressor or heat exchanger, the most expensive parts, fail at any time while you own your home, Amana will replace them for free. It&#39;s important to note that the lifetime compressor coverage only comes with models that have SEER ratings of 16 or higher. Models with SEER ratings under 16, as well as the other parts on all of Amana’s units, carry a 10-year warranty.

If your unit has a lifetime warranty and the compressor fails, the company will replace it for free as long as you are the original owner and still own the home it’s installed in. This lifetime warranty is noteworthy because most other manufacturers only cover their equipment for one or two decades at most. Goodman covers other parts for 10 years, which is longer than other manufacturers. Its units also have onboard diagnostics that let you know if something&#39;s wrong with your air conditioner.","When we examined the SEER ratings for Goodman&#39;s five central AC models, we noticed the highest rating was only 18. Although this is better than the industry average of 16.7 SEER, it&#39;s not nearly as efficient as top models offered by the other nine manufacturers we researched, but that means you can safely expect your final replacement bill to be lower than other brands.

For comparison, the most efficient models from most other brands have SEER ratings around 20. Lennox also sells less efficient models, with SEER as low as 13, in case you don&#39;t have the budget for a more efficient one. Of the 11 models Lennox sells, nine are Energy Star qualified. Although Lennox makes central ACs with two-stage air compressors, some models have compressors that run at several speeds. With more speed settings, units can more precisely control the cooling in your home. It’s also a primary reason Lennox&#39;s top-tier models are more energy efficient than their competition.","Lennox’s central AC units can hold up in most weather conditions.

The company’s central air conditioners are also quiet, with some models registering only 59 decibels, which is about as loud as a normal conversation. However, some of its units are louder than average, coming in at 76 decibels.","Most Lennox Signature products have a 10-year limited warranty that covers the compressor and most components.

We pay attention to details and research thoroughly so we can better help you find the right products for your needs and budget.","As we researched for this comparison, we looked at information on central air conditioners from trade associations, such as the <a href=\"http://www.ahrinet.org/Homeowners/Indoor-Comfort-Systems/Air-Conditioners-and-Heat-Pumps\">Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute</a> (AHRI) and <a href=\"http://hvacradvice.com/site/310/Tips-and-Resources/FAQs\">North American Technician Excellence</a> (NATE). We also found excellent guides from two U.S. governmental resources: <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/products/heating_cooling/air_conditioning_central\">Energy Star</a> and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/central-air-conditioning\">Energy Saver</a>.","<strong>Are new central air conditioners more energy efficient? </strong>","Central AC units with excellent energy efficiency ratings can save you more on electricity bills than standard models. However, you can expect the highest efficiency models to be the most expensive upfront.","Air conditioners with exceptional cooling capabilities that also consume very little electricity earn high SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) ratings. Compare the unit’s upfront cost with potential energy savings over time to see if it&#39;s worth the investment.","New air conditioners are much more energy efficient than older units though. While older AC units were typically rated around 8 to 9 SEER, the U.S. Department of Energy now requires a minimum of 13 SEER or 14 SEER for central air conditioners, depending on where you live. ","Of the 98 models we looked at, only 39 rated below 16 SEER, the average of all the models we evaluated. Although the highest SEER rating we came across was a 26 on the Lennox XC25, Amana, Trane and American Standard all offer models with 22 SEER or higher. The representatives at Energy Star also recommend regular maintenance, such as replacing filters at least every three months and having your unit tuned up at least once a year to make sure it&#39;s running efficiently.","Regardless, if you’re replacing an older unit with a new one, you can already expect to get a much more energy efficient unit. ","<strong>Are new central air conditioners noisy? </strong>","Today’s central air conditioners often have noise-reducing features, such as specially designed fan blades, compressor and pan base insulation, and variable-speed fans. However, since the unit sits outside your home, it&#39;s important to choose one that won&#39;t bother you or your neighbors. The best AC units produce sound levels under 71.25 decibels – as loud as a conversation in a restaurant. We found <a href=\"/american-standard-platinum-zv-review\">American Standard</a> to be the quietest brand at 69.9 decibels. The loudest brand was <a href=\"/frigidaire-review\">Frigidaire</a>, coming in at 72.9 decibels.","<strong>Central air conditioning unit size</strong>","Many central air conditioner models come in multiple sizes, so you can choose the most appropriate one for your home’s square footage. If a central AC unit is too small, it wastes energy and struggles to produce consistent cooling on the hottest days. If it&#39;s too big, you paid extra when a smaller model would be more energy efficient – and it won&#39;t dehumidify your home as effectively. A trained technician can help you choose the ideal unit for your home, local climate conditions and budget.","<strong>Central air conditioner warranties</strong>","Each brand has a conditional warranty, which means you must register your AC within so many days of the purchase date to be covered for the full term. However, this doesn&#39;t apply in California or Quebec, where conditional warranties are not allowed. When you register your central AC unit, you can expect a warranty that lasts at least 10 years, though some brands, such as Amana, Trane, Coleman and Goodman, offer 12-year or lifetime warranties on their premium products; without registration, warranties average about five years.","<strong>A professional should install your central air conditioner</strong>","Unless you have experience with brazing, electrical work, plumbing and framing – and can handle refrigerant according to EPA regulations – it is ill-advised to install a central air conditioner yourself. Professionals have the education, skill and experience to install your central air conditioner safely and properly.","Not all contractors have the appropriate certifications and experience to work on your HVAC system. It&#39;s smart to seek out reputable, qualified contractors in your area. You can start by looking at online customer reviews on Google, Yelp, Citysearch and more, which often reflect the quality of an HVAC installer. Don’t choose the cheapest bid or closest contractor without vetting their qualifications first. AHRI specifically recommends finding a <a href=\"http://hvacradvice.com/site/324/About-NATE/Find-A-NATE-Certified-Technician\">NATE-certified technician</a>, as they have passed a nationally recognized test showing they have the knowledge to size, repair and install the proper system for your home.","Although professional HVAC installers often give specific recommendations on central air conditioners, take some time to do your own research before you call so you can explain your needs.","<strong>Choosing a thermostat for your central air conditioning unit</strong>","Central air conditioners are often only as good as the thermostats to which they are connected. When installing a new system or replacing old HVAC equipment, consider replacing your thermostat as well. We suggest a programmable thermostat that allows you to schedule when your HVAC system runs. If you want more advanced features, such as smartphone control, automatic schedules and smart home integration, consider getting a smart thermostat made by <a href=\"/nest-review\">Nest</a> or <a href=\"/ecobee4-review\">ecobee</a>. You can also check with your contractor for recommendations.","<strong>How much do central air conditioning units cost?</strong>","On average, you can expect to pay between $2,000 and $6,000 to have a central air conditioner installed in your home. Your actual costs may vary depending on the size of your home, the air conditioner brand, the unit’s SEER rating, the installer you choose and a number of other factors. It’s a good idea to get multiple quotes from multiple installers to ensure you get the best service for the best price.","Beyond a basic install, there may be other costs. For example, if your home lacks the required ductwork, you can expect to add a couple thousand dollars to your installation budget. Lastly, you can expect an increase in costs if you get a multi-zone system or replace your <a href=\"/best-gas-furnaces\">gas furnace</a> as part of the install.","<strong><strong>Central Air Conditioner or Window Air Conditioner: Which is better?</strong></strong>","<strong> </strong>","Ultimately, whether you get a window air conditioner or a central air conditioning unit will depend on your budget and your home’s layout. Based on how expensive a central air conditioner is, it’s understandable that you might want something more affordable. In our comparison of <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioners</a>, we found that the average unit costs between $100 and $300, which is definitely cheaper than a central air conditioner by a wide margin."]},"id":"f13be2f7-9ed0-4e0e-a507-05f3999fd724","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":[""],"type":"ul"},"id":"8bda1073-61a4-4a3d-8e5c-8fd32febf1b0","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Cost: </strong>Window air conditioners are more affordable to purchase and to run than central air conditioners.

As the name suggests, these machines condition the air inside your home by moving it over an interior evaporator coil, which pulls heat from the air using a refrigerant. After the air is cooled down, it is then blown back into your home. At the same time, the heat, which is now stored within the refrigerant, moves through pipes to the exterior of the unit where it’s released into the outside air.<br/>Since the cooling process involves recirculating indoor air, central AC manufacturers suggest keeping windows and doors closed while the system is in use. This is especially true when the air outside is warmer than the air in your home. Warmer outside air, especially in hot climates like the American Southwest, can negatively impact the cooling performance and energy efficiency of a central air conditioner.","<strong>Read more:</strong>","<a href=\"/best-air-conditioners-review\">Best air conditioners</a>"]},"id":"69289f69-c7b2-485c-84da-ea5e7bf90304","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a1fd6eb8-ed76-4c22-ace8-acd445043e70","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Amana</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Lennox</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Trane</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">American Standard</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Coleman</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Carrier</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Rheem</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Bryant</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Goodman</a>","<a href=\"http://www.networx.com/heating-ac?se=9807\">Frigidaire</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1a03a0e1-673c-43fa-b750-d0490a1d55ce","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1066","url":"/best-central-air-conditioning-units","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-15T13:29:31Z","datePublished":"2017-04-20T21:54:42Z","name":"Best Central Air Conditioning Brands","synopsis":"A central air conditioning unit makes your home comfortable and welcoming even on the hottest summer days.
