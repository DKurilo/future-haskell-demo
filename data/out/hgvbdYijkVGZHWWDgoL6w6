It covers nearly all of your monitoring and equipment needs, and it offers an extensive online knowledgebase so you can learn more about keeping your home and family safe. With its array of services, equipment and customer support, Frontpoint establishes itself as a good home security monitoring company.","Frontpointâ€™s three monitoring service plans are: the Protection Plan, the Interactive Plan and the Ultimate Plan. All three plans are monitored 24/7 using a dedicated cellular connection that continues to work even if a burglar cuts your landline or the power goes out. Frontpoint&#39;s Protection Plan costs $34.99 a month, but it doesn&#39;t include mobile app access to your system, so we based our scoring on the Interactive plan, which costs $44.99.","As for starting costs, Frontpoint&#39;s base equipment package costs $130.95 upfront if you agree to a three-year contract. If you want a shorter contract, the starting costs go up. If you choose to cancel your Frontpoint contract early, you can expect to pay 80 percent of your account balance, which is good compared to companies like <a href=\"/vivint-review\">Vivint</a>, which charge 100 percent.","Frontpoint uses wireless equipment, and you can customize your system to include as many or as few devices and features as you want. For home-intrusion protection, the company has cameras, door and window sensors, glass-break sensors, motion sensors, garage door sensors, and ear-piercing sirens. With a wide variety of security devices, this home monitoring company can help you create the best security system for your needs, though each additional device increases your overall costs.","This company does not offer professional installation, instead relying on customers to install equipment. This helps keep costs down and eliminates the need to wait for a technician to comes to your home. However, if you have problems with your system, you won&#39;t be able to get in-home assistance as you&#39;ll need to use Frontpoint&#39;s support website.","Frontpoint&#39;s support website has an excellent FAQs section, with thorough instructions for how to operate the equipment, an interactive walk-through of a sample home to determine what equipment you might want, and advice on how to get the greatest benefit from your home monitoring system. If you have further questions or any issues, you can contact a representative via phone and email on the company&#39;s website, and you can also get assistance on social media. However, equipment only comes with a three-year warranty; this is far shorter than the lifetime warranties most companies offer."]},"id":"02514d16-3ffb-485d-a768-b2926771368a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54247","url":"/frontpoint-security-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-01-12T16:46:20Z","datePublished":"2012-01-12T16:46:20Z","name":"Frontpoint","synopsis":"Frontpoint's home security monitoring is very reliable.
