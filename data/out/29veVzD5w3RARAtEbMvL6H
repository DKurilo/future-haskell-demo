You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The All-Power America APGG series of <a href=\"/best-portable-generators\">portable generators</a> has models that range from 1,200 watts to 10,000 watts. You can find a portable power generator to meet almost any of your needs. The series includes inverters and propane-powered generators. Since 5,000-watt generators are the most common power range for families, we reviewed the APGG6000, which has a running power rating of 5,000 watts and a surge rating of 6,000 watts. This is enough power to keep your refrigerator, microwave, heater and water pump running during a power outage.","It has a 6.6-gallon gas tank, which, combined with a 291-cc engine, results in 11 hours of running time when using 50 percent of the 5,000-watt load. This is one of the longer running times for a gas generator. For comparison, the most efficient portable generators have a running time in excess of 14 hours on a 50 percent load. Efficiency is important during a power outage, especially when fuel is difficult to acquire.","Even with a muffler, the engine is one of the loudest generators available at 76dB. That&#39;s approximately the same volume as standing 50 feet from a freeway. It&#39;s not loud enough to damage your hearing, but it&#39;s definitely loud enough to make it difficult to communicate with others while using the generator. The best 5,000-watt generator has an operating volume rating of 71dB, which is about as loud as a vacuum.","The generator&#39;s best safety feature is the low-oil shutdown. When the oil gets close to dangerously low levels, the engine automatically shuts off, saving it from potential damage. You don&#39;t have to guess when to add oil or check the oil levels before every use, because the low-oil shutdown ensures that it always has enough oil to perform.","The biggest issue with All-Power America is the lack of customer support. The generators come with a one-year warranty. The best portable generators come with three-year warranties. You can contact the company through phone, but there isn&#39;t an email address for support, a network of service centers, a FAQs page, manual downloads, maintenance tutorials or video tutorials. Since All-Power America doesn&#39;t deal directly with consumers, the bulk of the customer support is on the dealer you purchase it from."]},"id":"fdb13187-6666-46a6-8bf4-df6207407bff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2640d49f-2da6-466e-a46a-a8cb08e3bef1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The All-Power America APGG6000 features 5,000 running watts and 6,000 surge watts.
