This not only helps the iron to last longer, but keeps mineral deposits from ending up on your fabric. Additionally, its anti-drip function prevents water from leaking out of the soleplate.","The soleplate is made of stainless steel and measures 8.75 inches in length. It heats up to its lowest setting in just 26 seconds, so you aren&#39;t left waiting when you have ironing to do, and you only have to wait 10 seconds between series of steam bursts.","This self-cleaning iron has a nice size and balance. It measures 6 x 4.2 x 11.5 inches, and it feels small and sleek. Weighing in at 2.4 pounds, it is not unwieldy or difficult to maneuver. The iron feels ergonomic and has a soft-touch handle.  However, the swivel cord is somewhat short, measuring 8.17 feet, so you won&#39;t have as much freedom of movement as you get with some other irons.","The built-in water reservoir holds 9.8 ounces and is easy to fill. However, it does not have a sealed reservoir cover and will leak if it tips over. The temperature-ready alert lets you know when the iron has heated up, and the easy-to-read digital display shows you what fabric setting you have the device set to.","It is easy to forget to unplug an iron, especially if you get sidetracked, but with the Expert Finish&#39;s three-way automatic shut-off feature, you can rest assured that the iron will turn itself off. If it&#39;s on but left unused, it will itself off in 30 seconds if left face down or on its side, and in eight minutes in the upright position.","A two-year manufacturer warranty keeps you covered, and if you ever have inquiries or issues with the Expert Finish, Singer has a product manual and a FAQs section on its website. You can contact their customer service by email or phone as well."]},"id":"d4c3ad7f-38dd-4ab2-8e9b-94a785c90326","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0623fbfa-1909-4d1c-8550-6b3b91017f85","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Singer Expert Finish is a powerful unit for steaming and ironing.
