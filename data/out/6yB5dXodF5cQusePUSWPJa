You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM may not be one of the best GPS units on the market, but it works well and includes some great features for the price. It has all of the essential navigational features you’d expect to see in a <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> as well as a fairly intuitive interface and a touchscreen display with a higher-than-average resolution.","You can hit the ground running with the RoadMate 5635T-LM, thanks to the preloaded maps of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. It also boasts 7 million built-in points of interest, like gas stations, hotels and other attractions, as does a similar model, Magellan’s RoadMate 7771T-LMB. The 5635T-LM also makes it easy to program and save your favorite waypoints and create icons for them, making them accessible via Magellan’s OneTouch Favorites menu. If you need to stop at multiple places on a particular drive, you can program all of them in and the GPS system will provide you with the most efficient route.","While on the road, the car GPS gives you plenty of notice for moving into the necessary lane for an upcoming turn, and tells you the name and number of your next freeway exit. It can display 3D landmarks so that you can more easily and accurately navigate to your destination. It even tells you how fast you’re driving as well as the speed limit of the road you’re currently on. You also have the option to rotate the 5635T-LM into portrait mode if you want to see more of the route that’s ahead of you.","For the first year that you own the device, Magellan provides free traffic camera alerts, which warns you of upcoming speed cameras based on crowd-sourced data. If your destination is in a busy city, the 5365T-LM can tell you where nearby parking lots are and, wherever possible, entrance addresses and hours of operation.","The GPS has a 5-inch resistive touchscreen. Although it lacks the more responsive and crisp capacitive touchscreen, the RoadMate 5635T-LM does have better resolution than most others at this price point – 640 x 480 pixels. One of the largest downsides of the GPS is its underwhelming battery life. At just 30 minutes, it’s significantly shorter than most other devices in our comparison. The unit ships with an industry-standard one-year warranty."]},"id":"97bcc744-21d4-42b2-8aac-5f6bf3873493","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69731","url":"/magellan-roadmate-5635t-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-02-14T19:25:22Z","datePublished":"2018-02-14T19:25:22Z","name":"Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"The Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM is a powerful navigation option, though it&#8217;s missing a few premium features.","pros":["It allows for a microSD card up to 32GB."],"cons":["It has the shortest battery life of any unit in our comparison."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-02-14T19:25:22Z","id":"6yB5dXodF5cQusePUSWPJa","meta":{"title":"Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM misses the mark with battery life but offers otherwise feature-rich navigation assistance."},"products":[{"slug":"magellan-roadmate-5635t-lm","url":"/product/magellan-roadmate-5635t-lm","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","name":"Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM","dateModified":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","id":"oP9gpBkHbDSJMzH2Bsq8tS","dateImported":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/4jSMr8m4R4zBAh4hnaRT3k.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","mimeType":"","name":"5489683ec95aa48fb84bcb63fede67cc.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/5489683ec95aa48fb84bcb63fede67cc.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","id":"4jSMr8m4R4zBAh4hnaRT3k","dateImported":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4jSMr8m4R4zBAh4hnaRT3k.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM misses the mark with battery life but offers otherwise feature-rich navigation assistance."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/4jSMr8m4R4zBAh4hnaRT3k.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","mimeType":"","name":"5489683ec95aa48fb84bcb63fede67cc.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/5489683ec95aa48fb84bcb63fede67cc.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","id":"4jSMr8m4R4zBAh4hnaRT3k","dateImported":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4jSMr8m4R4zBAh4hnaRT3k.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 5635T-LM misses the mark with battery life but offers otherwise feature-rich navigation assistance."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/magellan-roadmate-5635t-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gps","url":"/electronics/gps","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","name":"GPS","dateModified":"2019-04-12T20:57:25Z","id":"PaNWioUkFhvsXZKxXS5PLR","dateImported":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
