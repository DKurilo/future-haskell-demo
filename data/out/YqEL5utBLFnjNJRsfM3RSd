You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The First Years Via is a snug <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> popular for its ability to keep a baby up to 35 pounds or 30 inches secure, and it offers some excellent safety features like side-impact protection and energy-absorbing foam. However, it does not use the best materials, and sometimes, the carrier gets stuck in the base. The Via offers some excellent safety and convenience features, but it also comes with several frustrations.","Like all retail baby car seats in the U.S., the Via meets federal crash safety regulations. The seat can support a child between 5 and 35 pounds. The cushions and harness are snug, keeping your baby secure without becoming uncomfortable. Since most premature babies are born below 5 pounds, the Via is not the best choice for preemies.","The Via&#39;s base is easy to install, and it includes LATCH connectors and instructions for seatbelt usage. Newer models are airplane compliant, but the user manual states that you should not use the carrier without its base. Installation instructions are included on the car seat, and more detailed guidance is in the manual.","The biggest problem with the Via is the poor quality of the base release lever. Sometimes the carrier gets stuck inside of the base, and you have to wrestle with the car seat. Naturally, you&#39;ll want to take your child out of the seat before you start fighting with the base for the carrier. Of course, it is better for the carrier to get stuck than to come loose too easily.","The Via is compatible with several The First Years strollers, and it includes a canopy that you can unbuckle to shield your child from the sun at multiple angles. Unfortunately, the seat&#39;s cushions are not machine washable, so you&#39;ll have to spend a little more time cleaning them. The First Years supports the Via with a one-year warranty. Customer service is available by email and telephone, but in our multiple attempts to contact representatives, we could not get a response from either."]},"id":"f917512e-ceb5-492a-889c-e8cfe9393b4e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ad4f7d1b-7db8-4778-9cef-67db3a65dac3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The First Years Via is a snug baby car seat that can keep your baby secure until he is 35 pounds or 30 inches.
