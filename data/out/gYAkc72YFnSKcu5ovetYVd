It has been in business since 2003 and specializes in buying annuities and structured settlements. It doesn&#39;t offer any additional financial services. Its website is admirably transparent about the process, but like <a href=\"/peachtree-financial-solutions-review\">Peachtree</a>, it does not disclose its rates and fees.","If you&#39;ve received a structured settlement as a result of an accident or winning a lawsuit, selling it can allow you to get a larger cash payout so you can pay down debt or pay for a significant expense you&#39;re facing. Selling a structured settlement annuity is a bad idea, though, if you rely on the monthly payments as your main source of income.","In order to learn how much you can receive from selling your settlement, you&#39;ll need to request a quote from Annuity Transfers. The amount you receive varies depending on the length of settlement, the amount of your monthly payments and whether or not you want to sell all or part of your structured settlement.","It&#39;s important to know that you won&#39;t receive the full value of your settlement when you sell to Annuity Transfers. Structured settlement companies apply a discount rate. This is a major factor that determines the amount they offer for your settlement. You can find a thorough explanation of the discount rate in the FAQs section on Annuity Transfers&#39; website.","The website also offers information about the sales process, which can take between eight to nine weeks. The sale will ultimately need to be approved by a judge, and depending on the state you live in, you may need to consult with an attorney before selling your annuity. Annuity Transfers helps you navigate the legal process. Once the sale is approved, you will receive funds in up to three business days.","There are a few types of payments that Annuity Transfers cannot purchase. These include workers&#39; compensation payments, pension payments, divorce or child support payments and payments that are part of an IRA or other retirement plan.","Annuity Transfers is a Texas-based structured settlement company. Its website is relatively transparent about its process and time frame. You will need to contact the company to get a quote if you&#39;re interested in selling a settlement."]},"id":"a7bdb169-586f-49ec-b56d-97d8aa923bbc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68622","url":"/annuity-transfers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-26T20:24:14Z","datePublished":"2016-10-26T20:24:14Z","name":"Annuity Transfers","synopsis":"Annuity Transfers is a structured settlement company based in Plano, Texas.
