We compared our results to similar evaluations done by third-party laboratories and found similar outcomes across the board.","<strong>Do you need an antivirus for Windows 10?</strong>","Windows Defender has come a long way and now scores pretty high in third-party security tests for detecting and protecting against malware. Our own tests showed that the included Windows 10 virus protections do a solid job securing PCs from internet threats. But we did see that several malware files were still able to sneak through. While no antivirus software can guarantee 100 percent virus protection (though some programs, like <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton</a>, come with such a guarantee), our tests show that there are better antivirus programs that help enhance the protection of your Windows 10 computers beyond what Windows Defender can provide. For example, <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender</a> stops threats from within your web browsers from infecting your computer in the first place, plus it comes with extra tools to secure your passwords, monitor your internet connection and scan for weak points in your system in ways Windows alone can’t. Other programs, such as <a href=\"/mcafee-all-access-review\">McAfee Total Protection</a>, include spam filters designed to monitor your incoming email messages for not only malicious links and downloads, but phishing schemes. This is something Windows Defender can’t do on its own. We also feel most standalone antivirus programs are easier to use than Windows Defender.","<strong>Antivirus vs. Internet Security vs. Computer Protection Software</strong>","Most internet security companies offer more than one protection solution. These programs often include antivirus, internet security or computer protection in their name. Here are the biggest differences between these types of programs.","Antivirus software is very bare boned. Its main function is to stop threats like viruses, ransomware and Trojans from infecting your computer through a malicious download online, an infected file sent via email or uploaded from a thumb drive, or shared through a USB-connected device, like a cellphone. The best antivirus programs, like <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus</a>, stop threats before they have a chance to open on your machine, while others wait until the threat is loose before rounding it up and placing it in quarantine. Antivirus software typically comes with just a single user license to protect one computer or mobile device.","Internet security suites build on the basic antivirus platform. Along with malware protection, internet security software also includes other tools that provide additional internet protection. These often include password managers, safe browsing features, safe banking tools and parental controls. They also include a personal firewall that is a good tool for monitoring your internet connection to ensure hackers can’t get into your computer, especially when connected to a public hotspot, and for disconnecting anyone trying to illegally piggyback on your home internet connection. Internet security suites typically come with three or five user licenses so you can protect more than one computer in your home.","Computer protection software typically is a suite, or bundle of multiple security programs, each compatible with a different device or operating system. For example, <a href=\"/kaspersky-one-universal-security-review\">Kaspersky Total Security</a> includes the internet security solution for Windows computers, its antivirus software for Mac computers, and a mobile program for cellphones and tablets. Every security feature offered by the developer, which often includes VPNs and webcam monitoring, is included in addition to the protections that come with the internet security software. Also, computer protection software comes with multiple user licenses; the best companies offer a minimum of 10 or even unlimited licenses.","<strong><br/>How much can I expect to pay for complete computer protection?</strong>","Computer protection suites include a wide range of protection tools and multiple-use licenses. and they typically include a mobile security element, so you can expect to pay between $70 and $120 for a good program. Most computer protection software comes with five to 10 user licenses that are compatible with both Windows and Mac computers and laptops as well as cell phones and tablets.","<strong>What Is the Best Computer Protection Software for Mac?</strong>","All of the computer security programs we tested work on Mac computers and laptops. But there are some programs that work a little better on this platform and offer more advanced security tools than others. <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Security Premium</a>, our pick for the best computer protection software, blocked 100 percent of the malware samples we used during our in-house tests and earned a perfect score for malware protection from other independent test labs, too. For Macs, you get a personal firewall, password manager and VPN. The only tool missing that we looked for is parental controls. Another big plus of Norton is the program you download and install on Windows machines is the same program you install on Mac devices.","Another good choice for Mac computer protection software is <a href=\"/f-secure-internet-security-mobile-security-review\">F-Secure TOTAL</a>. Unlike Norton, F-Secure is a bundle of programs that includes a component specifically designed for Macs. This program only stopped 87 percent of the threats we tested with before they could download and infect out test computer. But it did a good job of rounding up the threats once they downloaded. F-Secure comes with great parental controls for Mac desktops and laptops, as well as a firewall, VPN and safe banking tools. It is missing a vulnerability scanner that looks for outdated software and other soft spots in your system and helps you strengthen them against ransomware and hackers.","For more information on programs designed specifically to protect Mac computers, check out our reviews and test results of the best <a href=\"/best-mac-internet-security-software\">Mac internet security</a> software.","<strong>Which Free Antivirus Is Best for Windows 10?</strong>","We tested several free programs using Windows 10 computers and found <a href=\"/avira-review\">Avira Free Security Suite</a> is one of the best. Testing them against live malware, we learned that most free programs don’t stop malware as it downloads; they wait for the file to open before catching and quarantining it. And most free programs don’t include safe browser extensions to help block websites known to harbor malware or detect phishing schemes. However, Avira did stop malicious downloads and block dangerous websites, earning an overall protection score of 98 percent.","On top of decent protection, Avira comes with several extra security tools that other free antivirus programs don’t include: You get a password manager and VPN with this program. Plus, Avira doesn’t cause much slowdown on your computer while running. Because it is a free program, you can expect to see a lot of ads prompting you to purchase the ad-free program that gives you access to more features like a personal firewall and vulnerability scanner.","<strong>Which Computer Protection Software Is Best for Mobile</strong>?","Several of the computer protection programs we tested are compatible with cellphones and tablets, but not all of them include malware protection and security tools are typically limited to a password manager and blocked call capabilities. This is especially true of iOS devices. <a href=\"/kaspersky-one-universal-security-review\">Kaspersky Total Securit</a>y is one of the best for mobile devices because it works on both iOS and Android devices, scans for malware and includes security tools like parental controls in addition to phishing and spam filters, a personal firewall and a password manager. It includes antitheft tools that help you track down a device that is lost or stolen using a GPS system. You can also access sensitive information remotely and hide or delete it from the misplaced phone so it can’t be seen or used.","The majority of the computer protection programs we tested include a separate download for mobile protection. A handful, including <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Security Premium</a>, allow you to download the exact same program to your mobile devices as the one that protects your computers and laptops.","Some programs, like <a href=\"/f-secure-internet-security-mobile-security-review\">F-Secure</a>, have security tools for mobile devices but do a better job detecting and removing malware when the device is connected to your computer through a USB port. When installed on your computer, F-Secure will scan everything connected to it for threats, including cellphones and removable drives. This is a decent way to ensure your phone or tablet is threat-free.","<strong>Is Bitdefender Safe?</strong>","Kaspersky, a computer protection software developer, has been <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/is-kaspersky-safe,news-25983.html?_ga=2.49990438.1269324877.1548178529-614739746.1546559666\">accused of using its antivirus programs</a> to gather information from the computers of U.S. departments and workers, and then sharing this information with the Russian government. This has resulted in the federal government removing all Kaspersky programs from its computers and putting stricter guidelines on employees who work on personal devices. But Kaspersky is the only computer protection program accused of any wrongdoing.","Bitdefender is widely trusted and used throughout the world as a secure and safe antivirus solution. Our own, in-house tests of Bitdefender products, including <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Total Security 2019</a>, have to show Bitdefender to be one of the best at recognizing, blocking and completely removing malware threats from both Windows and Mac computers.","You can learn more about Kaspersky, including its move from Russia and the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, from our colleagues at <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/kaspersky-moves-data-russia,news-27213.html\">Tom’s Guide</a>.","<strong>How Does Malware Get Onto Your Computer?</strong>","The term “malware” encompasses any type of computer threat, including viruses, Trojans, rootkits, ransomware and hackers. Phishing schemes and spam email messages are also classified as malware, since they put you at risk of identity theft. While there are many ways for your computer to become infected with malware, according to computer security expert Mitch Stephens, the most common way is through email. Too often people click on links in emails that look safe but really send them to forms that collect personal information or pages with malicious downloads. Also, you can accidentally click on a malware file online, or someone may inadvertently share one with you through a USB drive.","The best way to lower the risk of infecting your computer with malware is to learn how to spot fake email. This includes looking closely at the sender’s email address, evaluating if correct grammar and punctuation are used, and avoiding clicking links embedded in messages. The next best defense against online threats is using an antivirus software designed to spot malware in email messages; block malware from downloading; and protect sensitive information with tools like spam filters, VPN, personal firewalls and password managers.","<strong>Can viruses steal personal information?</strong>","Viruses aren’t able to swipe any personal information on your computer; however, there are other types of malware that do. Trojans are threats that look like a legitimate program, but much like the Trojan Horse in ancient Greek mythology, threats are hidden inside. These threats are used by hackers to sneak into your computer system specifically to steal personal information. This is one reason experts suggest never saving your passwords on your computer unless you <a href=\"/best-encryption-software\">encrypt</a> the document. But even then, a hacker can use a Trojan to install a keylogger. Keyloggers capture every keystroke as you make them, even if you don’t save a document or hit the Enter key. It isn’t difficult to capture passwords using this type of program, and having one on your computer will leave you vulnerable.","We recommend using an antivirus program, like <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Security</a>, that includes a firewall. This tool monitors your internet connection and is a good way to stop Trojans from sneaking in. It also stops these, and other malware files, from downloading from the internet. Other important tools included with Norton Security are an encryptor and a password manager. This means you can encrypt documents and files on your computer without having to buy a separate, standalone program. The password manager hides all your passwords in a way that is difficult for a hacker to break through.","<strong>Important Features to Look for When Buying Computer Protection Software</strong>","Before we started testing computer protection software, we chatted with Mitchell Stephens, a security consultant with Emagined Security, to get an idea how to best test these programs. Stephens explained that antivirus software is proactive, meaning it is designed to prevent your computer from being infected in the first place. Since most threats come through the internet, that is where we chose to focus our live malware tests.","“Attackers, for the most part, are looking for sensitive information they can use for either financial gain or destructive purposes (i.e., Social Security numbers, bank account information, nonpublic company information),” Stephens said. “The best way to strengthen the overall security is to maintain safe practices online. Keeping your system patches up to date is also good, [and] make sure [you use] good password construction.”","The best computer protection software includes tools to help further secure your computer while you are online. For example, a password manager, such as the one included with <a href=\"/f-secure-internet-security-mobile-security-review\">F-Secure TOTAL</a>, keeps your credentials secure as you log into online accounts. It also helps you create long, complicated passwords you don’t have to remember each time you log in.","Vulnerability scans look for weak spots in your system, such as out-of-date software, and recommend patches or updates. <a href=\"/mcafee-all-access-review\">McAfee Total Protection</a> provides a link to these updates so you don’t have to search for them and accidentally click through to a malicious site.","<strong>Watch What You Share on Social Media</strong>","Some computer protection programs, like <a href=\"/mcafee-all-access-review\">McAfee Total Protection</a>, include tools that look for phishing schemes and malicious links posted on social media sites. However, other dangers lurk on these sites. Here are some tips for staying safe from hackers and identity thieves on social media:"]},"id":"6f979fc8-5e5a-4f4e-8242-1cc75bfe848b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Don’t share personal information. Twitter, Instagram and Facebook all ask for your birthdate, full name, email address and phone number to create your account. However, you don’t have to make this information public. In fact, even your friends and family don’t need this information. It’s safer to keep these details private so people can’t swipe them.","Use a separate email address just for social media. Some sites require you to share personal information – for example, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com\">LinkedIn</a> does because it’s a networking site intended to connect you with potential employers or employees. In that case, create a separate email account just for business purposes. Many <a href=\"/best-free-email-services\">free email services</a> let you have more than one account at a time. Also, be careful about the work history you post. You don’t have to give exact dates or share addresses for a legitimate company to find you or be impressed.","Be careful of what you click on. A lot of feel-good stories or to-good-to-be-true deals hide a phishing scheme or malware download. Only click on links you trust are from legitimate sources. If you’re not sure, type the store’s URL into your web browser or do a search for a specific news story. You will see the same information, deals, etc. if it was offered by a legitimate source.","Don’t post information that may be used in passwords or that makes it easy to identify you. For example, some people post challenge questionnaires on social media that ask for information about where you went to school, your favorite pet’s name or your nicknames. This information is often used to create passwords and armed with these details, a hacker could break into your online accounts. Other games challenge you to find your alter ego by combining words based on your birthdate. Again, this information can be used to steal your identity, so be careful about participating."],"type":"ol"},"id":"b227ff20-53a8-46d4-80f0-e0dacfa469ed","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_319","url":"/best-computer-protection-software","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole
