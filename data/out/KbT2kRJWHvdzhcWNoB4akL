You can receive your cash back as a check or on gift cards, or if you are a Wells Fargo customer, you can have the cash back deposited in your checking or savings account. Wells Fargo offers an Earn More Mall, which shows you locations where you can use your card and earn bonus cash back during promotional periods.","The Wells Fargo Cash Back College Card offers $0 liability protection, which means that if fraudulent purchases are made using your card, you aren&#39;t responsible for repayment.
