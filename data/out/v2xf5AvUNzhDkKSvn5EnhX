The continuous power rating is 100 RMS watts, which is average, but the 600 peak watt rating is among the highest. Even though the PRO series speakers don’t have the highest sensitivity ratings compared to speakers from other series we evaluated, the TS-6900PRO received an A+ in our comparative loudness test. This suggests it has the greatest volume potential of the models we reviewed.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69726-pioneer-pro16.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nBWgXdKmGUTzuUGLyMqSj4.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"nBWgXdKmGUTzuUGLyMqSj4","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nBWgXdKmGUTzuUGLyMqSj4.jpg","alt":""},"id":"fc43d54d-3a54-4c5e-a72b-ae2d4883f824","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["To test comparative loudness, I connected each speaker to the same car stereo, then placed a decibel meter 1 meter away from the speaker to measure the volume it produced with the stereo set at 10, 20, 30 and 40.
