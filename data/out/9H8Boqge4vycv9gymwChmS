This type of software keeps client data secure while allowing you to schedule appointments, easily make changes to calendar events, manage finances and client charts, generate digital images, and even keep track of insurance claims and schedule reminders. Examples of online dental practice management software include <a href=\"/dentrix-review\">Dentrix</a>, <a href=\"/dentimax-review\">DentiMax</a> and <a href=\"/curve-hero-review\">Curve Hero</a>.","Using cloud storage to maintain a dentist practice online works by keeping information secure and highly accessible from anywhere. It&#39;s particularly helpful for a large practice with offices in different locations, because you can manage the entire practice from one central location quickly and efficiently. You can also download dental practice management software and store its information on an office hard drive, which may be preferable to some clients without adequate online services.","<strong>Online Dental Practice Management Software: What to Look For</strong>","Online dental practice management software comes with a wide variety of options to choose from. Here are a few things to look for.","<strong>Account Integration</strong><br/>Account integration allows you to access all aspects of your dental practice from one program. Instead of moving from one program to another to schedule appointments, take payments, request insurance payments and manage employees, you can pull up all duties from one simple login. Integration also means you can invest time and money in new software advancement and be assured that as long as the software carries the same logo, integration and installation should be simple and effective without any downtime for your patients.","<strong>Accounts Receivable</strong><br/>Accounts receivable features allow you to generate monthly statements to patients with one click of the mouse. The payments post directly to a patient&#39;s ledger to reduce errors in balances. You can also manage invoices and credit terms and send out collection notices to keep cash flow in the black.","<strong>Appointment Management</strong><br/>Missed appointments can cost a dental practice money. Appointment management features allow your personnel to send out reminders via email. Some programs integrate a client&#39;s cell number so that text reminders can be sent automatically without the need for user intervention. Your office staff can concentrate efforts on keeping clients in the office satisfied instead of spending excessive amounts of time on the computer.","Appointment management can also give your patients the option to schedule their visits online and let your office staff make changes remotely. This features allows you to avoid putting customers on hold while you flip through a calendar, and you can also use on-screen prompts to quickly locate upcoming patient appointment information.","<strong>Calendar Management</strong><br/>Calendar management allows you to schedule and manage training and meetings. You can also keep your daily to-do list close at hand and coordinate client appointments with days off, vacations and organizational events. This type of software makes it easy to collaborate with your office teams and to assign tasks on a daily basis.","Online dental practice management software provides all the tools you need to run your practice smoothly and efficiently. By finding the software that best suits your needs, you save both time and money."]},"id":"32968905-45c2-4fec-90ea-1a1caa63d25f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"ebfe8049-d71d-41d6-8b2c-336e192f7f9d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Ace Dental</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Curve Hero</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Daisy</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Denticon</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">DentiMax</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Dentrix</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Dovetail</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Easy Dental</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Genesis</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/healthcare/dental-practice-management/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Practice-Web Dental</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7f9e3778-e916-44d0-bbe2-3784f502e49b","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1410","url":"/best-online-dental-practice-management-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-03T23:25:18Z","datePublished":"2014-12-19T22:51:20Z","name":"Online Dental Practice Management Software Review","synopsis":"Office management is key to success for any practice, and online dental practice management software can take your dental business to the next level.","review":{},"strapline":"Office management is key to success for any practice, and online dental practice management software can take your dental business to the next level.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-19T22:51:20Z","id":"9H8Boqge4vycv9gymwChmS","meta":{"title":"Best Online Dental Practice Management Software","description":"TopTenREVIEWS is the most popular review site for dental practice management software.
