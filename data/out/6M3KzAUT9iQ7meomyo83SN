You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Canon is known for its high-quality camera lenses and easy-to-use digital cameras. Now Canon has a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof digital camera</a> to add to its collection. The PowerShot D10 takes pictures in and out of water and in rainstorms, snowstorms and sunshine. It has a scratchproof lens and several other features to add to its image quality and durability.","The PowerShot D10 has a 12.1-megapixel resolution, a 3x optical zoom, a 4x digital zoom and several ISO settings. It also has a wide range of shutter speed settings so you can capture action shots as well as lightning storms and nighttime shots without the flash.","This waterproof camera takes good underwater shots, but they are not as clear as some of the other cameras we reviewed. When using it underwater, you might need to take a few test shots before you get the photo you want.","Other photography features we liked are the blink detection, panorama mode, contrast correction and scene modes that include night exposure, kids and pets, long shutter, color accent, sunset mode and color swap.","We appreciate cameras with sleek and stylish designs, but the PowerShot D10 is rather bulky. The design may be to increase the camera&#39;s durability, and although it may not look as modern as other underwater cameras, the PowerShot D10&#39;s design still looks rugged and fun. This waterproof camera definitely looks at home on the beach or by the pool.","The rounded edges may not be sleek, but they decrease the scuffs and scratches that inevitably come when you drop your new gadget. With a width of just more than 4 inches and a depth of nearly 2 inches, this camera is one of the largest on our review site. It also has a built-in flash and a 2.5-inch LCD display screen.","The PowerShot D10 is waterproof up to 33 feet below the surface. It is also shockproof from a height of 4 feet and can withstand temperatures from 14 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.","The PowerShot D10 comes with a removable and rechargeable battery, along with charging and connecting cables, software and a wrist strap. The battery will take about 220 photographs on a single charge. Unfortunately, Canon cameras do not have built-in memory. If you forget to insert a memory card, you won&#39;t be able to save any photographs.","Canon offers excellent customer support. The company protects its cameras, including the PowerShot D10, with a one-year warranty for parts and labor. If you have questions about this underwater camera or other Canon products, you can browse the FAQs section and online manuals or contact customer support by telephone or email."]},"id":"4af96382-bb41-49f3-952e-317287f0ba36","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2eeef5c5-1154-45bd-91af-396a7120f533","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it&#39;s bigger and bulkier than most waterproof cameras, the PowerShot D10 from Canon is a very durable camera.
