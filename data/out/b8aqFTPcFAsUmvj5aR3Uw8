When you buy a new car, your insurance coverage needs to be a top priority. Your comprehensive coverage is changeable by you, but the gap insurance picks up where it leaves off; when the amount you owe on a car is more than what an insurance company would give you for that car in the circumstance of a total loss, gap insurance covers the difference, or gap, between the two numbers.","Protecting yourself and your vehicle with gap insurance saves you more money down the road than if you did not select the proper coverage. Some companies that offer gap insurance include <a href=\"/nationwide-review\">Nationwide</a>, <a href=\"/allstate-review\">Allstate</a> and <a href=\"/progressive-review\">Progressive</a>.","<strong>Gap Insurance : What to Look For</strong>","As you skim through different providers, you&#39;ll notice that gap insurance includes the same type of coverage between each insurance company, so it&#39;s important to know your chosen company is a reputable one. It&#39;s also helpful to know what other coverages the company offers so you have the option of bundling to save more money. Though the coverage is similar, some of the companies have different policies on the amount of coverage and what types of vehicles they cover. Below are a few things to consider when looking for gap insurance.","<strong>Length of Establishment</strong><br/>Each insurance company has been around for a different amount of time. Though the time that it has been around is not necessarily the indicator for the ideal gap insurance coverage, it does show which trusted companies have staying power.","<strong>Other Coverage Offered</strong><br/>Along with gap insurance, most insurance providers offer many other coverages. Some can be bundled with your auto insurance to qualify for a discount or to keep all of your coverage with one company. Other coverages include motorcycle insurance, boat insurance, motorhome insurance, snowmobile/ATV insurance, home and renter&#39;s insurance, insurance for your place of business, life insurance, retirement insurance, and supplemental health insurance.","<strong>Amount of Coverage</strong><br/>The majority of the companies&#39; gap insurance coverage is for the amount that vehicle is worth minus the amount that is still due on the vehicle. However, several of the companies only cover up to 25 percent of your car&#39;s total value. The coverage kicks in when your vehicle is declared a total loss.","<strong>Vehicles Covered</strong><br/>In most instances, this type of coverage applies to new vehicles that still have a balance owed on them at the dealership. Sometimes, the dealership itself even offers the coverage with your purchase. However, some companies put stipulations on the new purchase. One requires that the vehicle be six years old or less. Others are restricted to specific states or require that the purchase was fairly recent.","Gap insurance is beneficial insurance to have when you purchase a new vehicle and want to make sure it has the most protection possible as you take it out on the road. Look through the various companies that offer this coverage to keep your and your family&#39;s finances safe in the event of an accident."]},"id":"a90d7c41-45bb-4e12-9b8d-7bfb999bd859","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"24250bd5-a7ab-4787-af65-c9649a930ba5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.21st.com/\">21st Century</a>","<a href=\"//allstate.7eer.net/c/13013/310614/4685?subId1=GapInsurance\">AllState</a>","<a href=\"https://qrf.amfam.com/?fromPage=&lang=en\">American Family</a>","<a href=\"https://www.ameriprise.com/auto-home-insurance/Ford/default.asp\">Ameriprise</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1788212-10688749\">Esurance</a>","<a href=\"http://www.farmers.com/\">Farmers Insurance</a>","<a href=\"http://www.freewayinsurance.com/\">Freeway Insurance</a>","<a href=\"http://www.nationwide.com/gap-insurance.jsp?NWOSS=gap&NWOSSPos=1\">Nationwide</a>","<a href=\"http://at.progressive.com/everything-insurance/gap-insurance\">Progressive</a>","<a href=\"https://www.travelers.com/\">Travelers Insurance</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5460c9cc-5729-4871-929e-601f4d2255e7","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1751","url":"/best-gap-insurance","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-26T16:10:28Z","datePublished":"2015-09-29T17:55:41Z","name":"Gap Insurance Review","synopsis":"Gap insurance is designed to give additional comprehensive coverage under your auto insurance policy.
