Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The last of the top ten <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TVs</a> is the Philips 55PFL7505D, which is a TV with a great deal of potential that it never fully realizes. The screen size, refresh rate, panel thickness and built-in speakers either meet or exceed expectations, but a few critical failures keep this TV from sitting higher in our rankings.","Its contrast ratio is less than one tenth of what we see in other models, coming in at a pitiful 132,000:1. The refresh rate is only average, the four built-in speakers are only half as powerful as the speakers in most of the other LED TVs on our lineup and its power consumption is extremely high for its subpar image quality. The Philips 55PFL7505D&#39;s specifications do not justify its incredible 200-watt energy consumption.","The Philips 55PFL7505D meets expectations with its 55-inch display, but things go downhill from there with its feature set. This LED TV doesn&#39;t offer local dimming or 3D capabilities, its panel is thicker than most and its four speakers combined have the same output level of sound as the two speakers in most other LED TV sets. As mentioned above, 200 watts of power seems like far too much for this LED TV – with features that are only middling (at best) – to consume. A few select improvements in this area could certainly help this Philips model rank higher in our comparison.","The Philips 55PFL7505D performs only marginally better in the display category, bringing all of the features you would expect in a high-end LED TV with the exception of its perplexingly low contrast ratio. All of the usual features are represented here, including the standard 120Hz refresh rate, 16:9 aspect ratio and 178-degree viewing angle. Its 132,000:1 contrast ratio was largely responsible for pulling this set&#39;s ranking down in this category.","This Philips LED TV also lacks an Ethernet port, though the other common connectors (HDMI, composite in, component in, PC inputs and USB connectors) are all represented in satisfying numbers.","The most positive aspect of this LED TV is its customer-support backing. A full year of parts and labor is included in the standard warranty. You can also access Philips&#39; website to browse its FAQs section or an online user manual if you have any questions about setting up or using your TV. If you have questions about the warranty, set-up process or general usage, you can contact customer-support representatives via email or phone."]},"id":"4bce03ba-023a-415f-b718-f4c0b4a8d168","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"803f6b1e-8fee-4957-97b0-c8189bd3b51a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All in all, the <strong>Philips 55PFL7505D</strong> does not compete well with the other high-end LED-backlit TVs on the market today.
