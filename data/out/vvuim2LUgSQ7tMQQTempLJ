Cigna makes comparing Medicare Part D Plans easy and efficient. You have the choice of the Cigna HealthSpring Rx Secure Plan, the Cigna HealthSpring Rx Secure-Xtra Plan or the comprehensive Cigna HealthSpring Rx Secure Max-Plan.  In order to choose the plan that best meets all your needs, Cigna asks that you consider the medications you are currently taking and your desired deductible and copay.","The Cigna HealthSpring Rx Secure Plan has low premiums and is ideal if you are looking for basic protection. The Cigna HealthSpring Rx Secure-Xtra Plan also has a low monthly premium but comes with the added benefit of no deductible.  The most inclusive Medicare Part D Plan offered by Cigna is the HealthSpring Rx Secure-Max Plan.  The Secure-Max Plan has the broadest list of prescription drug coverage, does not have a deductible and offers the added benefit of gap coverage. While the premium for the Secure-Max Plan will be a bit higher than the traditional Cigna Part D Plans, this plan is ideal for individuals that can afford a bit more and don’t want the surprise of out-of-pocket expenses.","Cigna Part D Plans cover your prescription medications through a tier program.  The tier for all three plans can be found on the company’s website. The tier table is pretty easy to understand and gives you the useful tool of a drug and pharmacy lookup before you enroll. This tool is designed to give you a better, more accurate picture of where your current medications fit into any of the Cigna Part D Plans. One of the best highlights to the Cigna Part D Plan family is the plan extras included in all three Part D Plans. These include vision and hearing discounts, preferred retail cost share and coupon savings.","It is important to remember that Cigna Part D Plans are not health insurance policies.  These plans are for prescription drug coverage only and should supplement health insurance.  To enroll in a Cigna Part D Plan, you must be eligible for Medicare and continue to pay your Part B premium.  If you decide to enroll in a Cigna Part D Plan, you can do so on their website. To learn more about Medicare Part D plans, you should consider resources like <a href=\"/medicare-review\">Medicare.gov</a> and <a href=\"/medicare-interactive-review\">Medicare Interactive</a>."]},"id":"641739a7-115c-42ae-a681-374f46a9942c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61637","url":"/cigna-medicare-rx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sabrina-rojas-weiss","url":"/author/sabrina-rojas-weiss","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sabrina Rojas Weiss","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"tVZv6ejiouijuHU3n7n49Y","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-17T16:22:26Z","datePublished":"2014-12-17T16:22:26Z","name":"Cigna Medicare Rx","synopsis":"When visiting the Cigna website to shop for Medicare Part D Plans, the first thing you will likely notice is the ease of navigation through the various plans available.
