Each time we’ve worked on this site, our reviewers have carefully researched the latest models and brands, including contacting manufacturers, scouring the internet for information, and reading consumer reviews to gain insight and opinions. Their research comparisons led them to evaluate what makes the best battery-powered ride-on toys the best. We’ve found that the best powered toy cars have excellent safety features, such as stability and immediate stopping when a child steps off the accelerator. We’ve also found that the difference between battery life is just as important and can determine how often a child uses and enjoys their vehicle.","Our reviewers at Top Ten Reviews dove into online communities and toy sites such as Amazon and Fisher-Price to see what actual owners said about their purchases and experiences. This helped us get a start on evaluating what features mattered to parents who care about their child’s safety and enjoyment. Researching this way also provided us with some tough questions to ask manufacturers about their products and they gave us good insight, for the most part, when contacted. We found that while most ride-on toys are extremely similar, there are some differences that can make it worth spending extra to ensure the vehicle lasts more than a summer. To get more insights, we spoke with a sales employee who has been working with these toys for the past 5 and a half years. We also reached out to Fisher-Price and asked them about their PowerWheels products but they didn&#39;t respond to us in time for publication.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We researched 10 ride-on toys online and visited local stores to find out what features makes the best power wheels toy. We also spoke to children and parents who own battery-powered ride-on toys to see what they liked and disliked the most about these children’s vehicles.","<strong>How Much Do Ride-on Toys Cost?</strong>","You&#39;ll find that prices vary greatly from one ride-on toy to another. If you&#39;re trying to purchase one on a budget, you might want to consider getting a motorcycle, like the Harley Rocker which sells for under $100 on Amazon. The downside to these motorcycles is that they can only carry one child at a time. The larger ride-on toys that allow two or more riders, like the <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">Ford Mustang</a>, will cost between $150 and $400. They might also include fun extras like cup holders and a working radio. Just like with adult vehicles, it is common for fancier car brands to cost more.<br/><strong><br/>Things to Consider</strong>","Kids ride-on cars may all offer the same driving experience, but there are several things you should know about them when you plan to buy one. As you are deciding on which vehicle to buy for your child, you should pay special attention to the following criteria:","Safety &amp; Speed","To make sure your child is safe and fits comfortably in the vehicle, be sure you look at the weight and height limits before making a purchase. Some vehicles come with a locking mechanism so parents can control how fast their child goes. This is an especially nice feature for younger children who might veer into others or go too fast. You can find ride-on vehicles for every age between toddler and adult.","The age range indicated on the box will coincide with how fast the vehicle can go. Typically, vehicles designed for one-year-olds, like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013ZB2PY4/?&amp;tag=ttr_rc-powerwheels-20&amp;ascsubtag=%5Bsite%7Cttr%5Bcat%7C1010%5Bart%7CNA%5Bpid%7C%5Btid%7CNA%5Bbbc%7CNA\">Kawasaki Lil&#39; Quad</a>, only go 2 mph. Kid cars like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G23LEFS/?&amp;tag=ttr_rc-powerwheels-20&amp;ascsubtag=%5Bsite%7Cttr%5Bcat%7C1010%5Bart%7CNA%5Bpid%7C%5Btid%7CNA%5Bbbc%7CNA\">Wild Thing</a>, designed for 3 to 10-year-olds, tend to go between 2.5 and 6 mph. If you&#39;re looking for something for teenagers or adventurous adults, you might be interested in the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SYKYAI6/?&amp;tag=ttr_rc-powerwheels-20&amp;ascsubtag=%5Bsite%7Cttr%5Bcat%7C1010%5Bart%7CNA%5Bpid%7C%5Btid%7CNA%5Bbbc%7CNA\">Razor Crazy Kart XL</a>, which goes up to 12 mph and holds up to 240 lbs.","Design<br/>Most children&#39;s ride-on vehicles are designed to be miniature replicas of &#34;grown-up&#34; vehicles such as a Ford Mustang, Jeep or Hummer. A toy vehicle&#39;s ability to imitate an adult driving experience for your child will make all the difference. How the vehicle looks, all the way down to the decals you can use, is indicative of its quality. The toy store employee we spoke to told us that the more inexpensive models tend to be made of cheap plastic and break easily. She told us it is better to go for one of the more standard brands like Power Wheels, &#34;you pay more, but you pay for quality.&#34; She further told us to avoid KidTrax vehicles, one of the least expensive options, as these tend to break easily either during use or during shipping because of poor design and cheap plastics. While 12-volt batteries are typically larger so you can fit two or more riders.","Battery<br/> Kids cars are powered by electric batteries, which means the strength and size of the battery will influence the vehicle&#39;s speed and power. The size of a ride-on vehicle&#39;s battery is largely indicative of its battery life and the speeds it can reach. 6-volt batteries typically allow a vehicle to travel at around 2.5 mph for just over an hour and can usually only fit one rider at a time. A 12-volt battery will allow your child to drive for upward of three hours at speeds of 5 mph and can usually fit two or more riders. Look for models that charge quickly, possibly allowing your child to enjoy their ride more than once a day. The batteries are usually stored under the hood or under the seat of the car.","The toy sales employee told us that she had seen many people purchase the wrong type of battery only to have to come back in and exchange it later. So, make sure you purchase the correct one from the get go to save you from inconveniencing yourself. She further warned us that you need to follow the battery charging instructions to the letter as deviating from the directions can result in your battery only holding a 10 to 30-minute charge for the rest of its life. Having to go out and buy a brand-new battery right after you&#39;ve purchased the vehicle is frustrating to say the least. Especially when they cost about $70 to replace.","If you&#39;re a grandparent who wants to purchase one of these vehicles for family get-togethers, you might want to invest in an extra battery so you can switch them out and allow your grandchildren to play for a longer period of time. Batteries and charging cables can typically be purchased on Amazon or at Walmart or Batteries Plus&#39;s brick and mortar stores.","Warranty<br/> Some children&#39;s ride-on cars come with longer than the standard one-year warranty. Pay attention to the warranty length, as it will help counterbalance additional future expenses. It isn&#39;t uncommon for parts within the motor or battery to fail. In these cases, the cost of replacing those parts can be quite expensive, especially if you have to pay to replace them yourself. When you open the box containing your vehicle, you should also check to make sure that none of the plastic is damaged or broken off as this sometimes happens in shipping, especially with the generic models.","Souped Up Kid Cars for Adult Riders<br/>Even when we become adults and can drive our own vehicles something about these little cars still makes us want to ride. The problem is that they are too small and don&#39;t go fast enough for our grown-up needs. You can find plenty of blogs and online videos that both teach you how to swap out the motors in your kid cars for more powerful ones and that teach you how to make riding space for adults. But if you&#39;re wanting to test your creations against others, you should check out the <a href=\"http://www.powerracingseries.org/\">Power Racing Series</a>. The company&#39;s website can help you look up the racing rules and sign up your own Frankenstein-kid-car for races. The site also claims that it can help you create a souped-up kids car for only $500. The Power Racing Series takes place in various cities and are lighthearted, family-friendly events that provide lots of fun.
