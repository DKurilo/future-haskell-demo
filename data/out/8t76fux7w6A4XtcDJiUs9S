We explored each software in order to compare the tools they offered and the creative freedoms each program allowed. Our testers have backgrounds in photo book creation and looked for anything that added convenience as well as fun to the creative process.","We chose to test programs that were compatible with both Windows and Mac computers so that more people would be able to use them. The exact same features are provided on either operating system; we double checked to make sure. We also made sure that the support services and creative features offered by these companies met our expectations.","<strong>How Much Does Photo Collage Software Cost?</strong>","You typically find photo collage programs selling between $30 and $50. What you really want to look at when deciding what software to buy is the quality of the artwork it provides. Some of the more expensive program offer beautiful, modern images, but others seem to only offer clip-art that hasn&#39;t updated since the 90s. Programs that are ridiculously expensive – over $100 – typically aren&#39;t worth the cost since you can find plenty of medium priced programs that can do the trick beautifully. You might also be interested in <a href=\"/best-digital-scrapbooking-software\">Scrapbook Software</a>, which tends to sell between $20 and $30.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Our testing started by downloading each of the programs and numbering the amount of layouts, embellishments, backgrounds, shapes and text options provided. Programs that offered more of any category scored higher than those that offered few. While quantity was a factor, we also wanted to make sure that the design elements were pleasant and usable, so we gave programs more points for having aesthetically pleasing options.","We downloaded the same set of photos onto each program and experimented with the layouts to make sure they were varied and showcased our images well. We also explored and tested the editing tools to see how well each program worked to enhance our photos. We favored software with features that made the design process easier, like an autofill option.","Since sharing your artwork is just as important as creating it, we wanted to make sure that the export and sharing options covered several areas. We gave more points to products that allowed us to burn collages onto CD and DVD or let us share our creations directly to Facebook. Programs that allowed us to save photos in a variety of the most common image file formats, namely JPEG, PDF and PNG, also scored higher.  ","As you shop for collage software, keep in mind the following elements:","Pricing<br/>Photo Collage software happens to be relatively inexpensive compared to other photo and image editing programs on the market. You will typically find these programs selling between $30 to $50, but there are some more expensive ones that cost closer to $200. However, the best programs, like MyMemories and <a href=\"/memorymixer-review\">MemoryMixer</a>, also offer hundreds of additional graphics kits that you can purchase from the manufacturer&#39;s website. These include specific backgrounds and embellishments for specific holidays, times of year and family events. For the most part, kits are relatively inexpensive giving you access to hundreds of images from as little as $2 to $15 per kit. ","Features<br/>Programs with more design options are more likely to have backgrounds and stickers for specific occasions – whether Christmas, birthday or wedding themed. Your photos might not always be collage ready, so it is best to find a program that also offers some basic editing tools. Red eye removal, rotating and cropping are essential, but some programs also offer quick filters to change the colors of your photos. If you&#39;re making your collage specifically for digital viewing, it can be nice to have a program that lets you add video and music.","Export Options<br/>Programs that export in several formats make it easier for you to do more with your projects. The most common image files are JPEG, PDF and PNG. Some programs make sharing your artwork easy by allowing you to post directly to Facebook. Another nice feature is being able to burn your creations onto CD and DVD, so you can give them away as gifts.","Help &amp; Support<br/>While these programs are typically simple and easy to use, it is nice being able to have support services to fall back on. You can find video tutorials and FAQs pages for all of the software we tested.
