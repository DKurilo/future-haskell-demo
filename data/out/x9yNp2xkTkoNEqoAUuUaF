They stay in your ears with earplug-style tips that sit firmly in your ear canal and a cable that can form ear hooks. Pairing with your phone or music playback device is a cinch.","The sound quality of the WP-250 earbuds falls short of what most users will want. These earbuds are bass heavy, but depending on how your MP3 equalizer is set, the bass can sound washed out with hip-hop or rap music.","The Bluetooth wireless range extends up to 33 feet, which is typical for these devices.","As for noise isolation, the rubber cushions offer a tight, snug fit in your ear, so you can filter the environmental noise out of your music or calls.","Controls are housed on the right earpiece, including a multifunction button for pausing, playing and answering calls. There is also a job wheel for track skipping and volume buttons. We love the wheel for skipping songs, but it would be nice to see volume and track controls on opposite earpieces.","The design of these Bluetooth earbuds is slightly bulky, but they won&#39;t slip out of your ears. The neckband can be neatly coiled for travel. One design flaw is how the actual rubber tip fits into your ear. You will need to constantly adjust the earbuds if you don&#39;t want your ear canal to hurt at the end of the day. It is hard to find a comfortable position inside your ear, even with several different rubber cushions to choose from.","Battery life is a little more than five hours, with a micro USB port for charging, and it takes almost three hours to fully charge the battery.","Creative excels at customer service. We received immediate responses to our inquiries, but it did take a while to locate a phone number on the site. The WP-250 earbuds have a one-year general warranty and a lifetime warranty against sweat damage."]},"id":"63cc6ab8-f0b7-40b3-9f1f-89e386c21a6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"45911a68-58e7-41c3-b2f2-bbda4a85a6b2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In summary, the WP-250 wireless earbuds fall short in sound quality.
