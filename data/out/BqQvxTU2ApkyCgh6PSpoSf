While you have big names to pick from such as Acuvue, Proclear and Air Optix, a lot of other brands only have one or two kinds of contacts to pick from. Contacts Direct sells Biomedics contacts, for example, but you can only get a toric lens 6-pack or a 55 Premier 6-pack of that brand. By contrast, there are 10 kinds of Biomedics contacts on <a href=\"/1800contacts-review\">1-800-Contacts</a>.","In total, there are only 24 brands to pick from at Contacts Direct, the third smallest selection of the websites we evaluated. It does have color-enhancing contacts made by FreshLook. These disposable lenses come in 12 shades intended to intensify or accent the natural color of your eyes. Contacts Direct also sells the most commonly prescribed styles of lens, including disposables, torics, multifocals and lenses for people with astigmatism, just to name a few. RGB lenses, which are a little harder-feeling, aren’t available on the site. In fact, only four of the 10 websites we evaluated have RGB lenses for sale: <a href=\"/aclens-review\">AC Lens</a>, <a href=\"/discount-contact-lenses-review\">Discount Contact Lenses</a>, 1-800-Contacts and <a href=\"/coastal-contacts-review\">Coastal</a>.","While it’s hard to compare prices across the board, we tried to be as fair as possible. To test this, we selected three specific boxes of contacts and compared them across all websites on the same day, excluding any discount or sale pricing. We compared the prices and assigned each website a corresponding grade, and Contacts Direct earned a D+ for having somewhat higher prices. This website does, however, offer free shipping on any order no matter how much you spend. There isn’t a price match program like some of the other websites offer.","There also isn’t an automatic refill option available, but you can buy an entire year’s supply of contacts at one time to receive a discount. The return policy is also good allowing returns up to a year after you’ve received them. Overall though, this website wasn’t impressive. There aren’t many eye accessories for sale though there are some eye drops and solution. Overall, the lack of selection was disappointing."]},"id":"14c8e33b-1df8-49bc-8fcc-6374f03d9b89","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69034","url":"/contacts-direct-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-01-26T18:56:21Z","datePublished":"2017-01-26T18:56:21Z","name":"Contacts Direct","synopsis":"This service has common contact brands and is, like most websites we looked at, easy to navigate.
