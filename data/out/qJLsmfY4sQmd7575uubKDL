This compact electric tankless water heater offers accurate temperature control and is self-modulating.","This water heater has a digital control panel that allows you to adjust the temperature of the water output in 1-degree increments, giving you precise control. The ECO 27 can run up to four showers and a sink at the same time, so you can run multiple applications simultaneously, which is a useful feature for a busy household. It offers a maximum flow rate of 6.5 gpm.","The flow rate and energy efficiency this model achieves depends on the climate in which you live and the temperature at which water enters the heater. The warmer the water at the inlet, the more energy-efficient the model and the higher the flow rate, as it can reach the desired temperature faster. While it doesn&#39;t have an Energy Star certification, the ECO 27 is an energy-efficient model, promising 99.8 percent energy efficiency, so only 0.2 percent of the energy consumed is lost. However, the cooler the water at the inlet, the more energy the unit draws to heat the water to the chosen temperature. This hampers its efficiency, but even in cooler climates, very little energy is wasted.","It is self-modulating, which means that this electric tankless water heater adjusts the amount of energy it draws based on how much water you&#39;re using and the temperature at which it is set. This feature ensures the temperature of the water meets your needs without wasting excessive energy. It requires a 240-volt electrical system and has thermal auto protection to prevent overheating and overloading. This model has three 9-kilowatt elements and an amperage draw of 112.5. For correct installation and operation, you need 0.75-inch NPT pipe fittings.","This tankless water heater is a compact model, measuring 18 x 17 x 3.75 inches and weighing 13.75 pounds, so it fits into tight spaces, though it&#39;s not as small as the <a href=\"/chronomite-review\">Chronomite SR-20L/240</a>. It has a sleek, contemporary design and a low-maintenance copper and stainless steel construction for longevity and simple replacement.","For a whole-house electric tankless water heater, the EcoSmart ECO 27 is energy-efficient and has an intuitive digital interface that provides precise temperature control. It can cater to a single-family home and run multiple applications simultaneously."]},"id":"bef7649d-c287-4688-a021-c74c15425297","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65896","url":"/ecosmart-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-25T15:16:37Z","datePublished":"2015-06-25T15:16:37Z","name":"EcoSmart ECO 27","synopsis":"The ECO 27, from tankless water heater brand EcoSmart, is an energy-efficient model that's suitable for an entire single-family home.
