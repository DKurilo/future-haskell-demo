features like auto defrost. It is also energy efficient. This freezer competes well in this area and will help you keep your utility bills down.","In terms of capacity this freezer has 16 cubic-feet of space, which puts it in league with some of the best upright freezers on the market. You will be able to fit food for a large family in this freezer. It has three adjustable shelves and a spacious bin that is great for storing oversized items. The door bins are also spacious and will store all types of items like ice cream, frozen dinners and vegetables that you may want quick access to.","Some of the common features of freezers in our lineup are frost-free, auto-defrost and fast-freeze capabilities, which this freezer has. This is a vast improvement over models of the past which required that you unload the freezer to defrost it.","This Whirlpool freezer has a bright LED light that will allow you to see in all corners of the freezer even if it is stored in a dark basement. It lacks some features like a power indicator light, door lock and a defrost drain. There is no alarm to alert you to the door being left open or to let you know of a rise in temperature. While it has electronic temperature controls, they are not external and you will need to adjust them with the door open. But they are nicely positioned, so it should be fast work. This freezer had a lot of space. We were able to fit several boxes of varying sizes on the shelves with plenty of room to spare.","This freezer has recessed door handles on either side of the door, eliminating the need for a handle in front and contributing to its sleek design. The recessed door handle facilitates the reversible door capabilities of this freezer, which makes it easy to fit into the space you have available. Most importantly, this is a low-maintenance freezer that functions at a high level and will keep your food fresh and tasty."]},"id":"e1a244d5-ca2f-4035-9695-f8cbff37fc01","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f8bad514-6e99-4630-9c98-62e23cf782c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool WZF34X16DW has all the essential features you need to freeze your food without maintenance hassles.
