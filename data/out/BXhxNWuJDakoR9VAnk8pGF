This <a href=\"/best-pc-system-utilities-software\">PC System Utilities</a> program can fix errors with your registry, hard drive and internet history. Even though fewer features are included with this program, if your computer just needs a bit of tweaking, Ace Utilities can make the necessary fixes.","If your PC is slow and you&#39;re wondering how to speed up your computer, you&#39;ll need repair tools to stop extraneous processes. Ace Utilities doesn’t run a traditional computer scan like other top programs do. You have to click on Clean Up, Optimize or Protect from the navigation column to access repair features and tools. You can then clean up junk files, optimize your system registry or erase your history. You can&#39;t, however, do all of these at the same time, as there is no one-click fix button.","Very few diagnostic tools are included with Ace Utilities so you&#39;ll need to figure out what&#39;s wrong on your own. You do have access to system information, system advisor and folder settings. However, important tools such as driver statistics, failure monitors for hardware, and hard-drive partition management are all missing from Ace Utilities&#39; features.","Utilities software should not only fix problems slowing down your system, but should also keep them from happening again. Unfortunately, Ace Utilities has very few optimization features to keep your system healthy. You can defrag both your hard drive and your registry, but you have limited options in managing your startup programs.","Acelogix provides a list of FAQs on the website should you need any help answering questions for your software. You can also email support for more help. The license for Ace Utilities is good for two computers, so you can install the software on both a laptop and a desktop or another family PC."]},"id":"c4182aa1-2be0-47ee-b2b3-2764c83ea523","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f68929f6-e1c4-40c3-a406-1a3e1560dd8d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, Ace Utilities isn’t the best PC optimizer because it offers so few features.
