However, owning Quicken software is not required to use its <a href=\"/best-bill-paying-services\">bill pay service</a>. The Quicken online bill payment service can use funds from up to 10 different accounts to pay your bills, and it can also transfer funds from one of your accounts to another. When you create transactions using Quicken Bill Pay, they automatically enter into your Quicken desktop software, making it easy for you to track when and where your funds have gone. Quicken Bill Pay is available for a monthly fee.","With Quicken, you don&#39;t have to worry about forgetting payment due dates, because it allows you to set up an email notification when your bills arrive and then view the amount and when they are due. It does not, however, alert you of upcoming bills. In case you are slightly confused as to how to pay your bills, it sends payment instructions through a secure internet connection with the latest in SSL encryption technology, protected with a password that Quicken issues only to you.","Quicken Bill Pay is easy to set up and use. Once you enter your account information and set up your payments schedule, Quicken starts making payments. You can set payments to be taken out automatically, up to a year in advance, or you can make the payments manually when needed if you prefer. Quicken guarantees your payments will arrive accurately and on time, or it will pay the late fee up to $50.","Quicken supports many different systems, including Windows, Mac and Mint.com. However, not all features are available with the Mac version. If you experience trouble with your software or simply need help getting started, you can go to the Quicken support tab to see if a good solution is published there. Quicken has 24-hour phone support, or you can contact support through email, online chat or phone. If you go to its contact page, there are live estimated wait times for phone and chat support so you can decide how long you want to wait.","Quicken has many other programs to complement your online bill pay service, including Set Goals, Save and Invest, and Track Growth. These programs help you keep better track of your money to start a savings system, learn how to start making investments and plan for the future."]},"id":"cc59ea00-d8ec-4123-8390-fd56f97542c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1225","url":"/quicken-bill-pay-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"mike-mcpeek","url":"/author/mike-mcpeek","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Mike McPeek","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"zHMn9cGyHw9eJCvSFXXYrJ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-02-01T21:29:21Z","name":"Quicken Bill Pay","synopsis":"Quicken Bill Pay sends payments to anyone in the United States using your Quicken software or the Quicken Bill Pay website.
