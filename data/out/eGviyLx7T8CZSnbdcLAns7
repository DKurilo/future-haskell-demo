Whenever we compare software, we create a list of each program&#39;s tools and features. Our goal is to determine which of the programs is easiest to use while giving the user freedom to create what they want. We looked for programs that would work well for professionals, programs that would be best for beginners, and programs that worked for both categories.","While we didn&#39;t test this software, we read plenty of user reviews to see which programs were the most liked and the most user-friendly. Any time users gave red flags or glowing praise, we made sure to research those areas more thoroughly to further evaluate a software&#39;s performance. We also reached out to Kym Ridl, the Marketing and Development Coordinator for the Davis Arts Council, to get insights and tips on her desktop publishing usage. Additionally, we reached out to Chris Smith, Brand Manager of Encore Software, the creator of PrintMaster Platinum, to get insights on their software but they didn’t get back to us in time for publication.","<strong>How Much Does Desktop Publishing Software Cost?</strong>","Home edition desktop publishing software usually comes with plenty of art assets, but few layout and publishing tools, whereas more professional-level programs give you more control and a smaller, good-quality amount of themes, templates and designs. The most basic, art-centered desktop publishing programs tend to sell for as little as $35 while the more business-centered software is usually around $150. Some professional programs, like Adobe InDesign, are subscription based and cost about $20 a month.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","In our most recent evaluation, we spent over 50 hours comparing the capabilities and features of 10 programs to determine which ones had the best layout, graphic design and typography tools. Programs that offered more tools typically scored better. We looked for features that made programs easier to use, including proportional snapping, master pages and the ability to import both Photoshop PSD and Microsoft Word files. We favored programs that were compatible with other programs and made the designing process easier.","We tallied up art assets available through each program to see which one provided the most. Since quantity isn&#39;t everything, we also checked to see if the designs offered were modern and stylish enough for professional and personal use. Programs with large quantities of beautiful graphics scored higher than software that offered large quantities of subpar art. Similarly, while we counted the number of templates each program came with, we also looked to see if they were classy and suited for professional as well as informal occasions. Programs that adequately covered both categories scored higher in our comparison.","Since type tools add a lot to overall creation, we looked for programs that offered everything from a spellchecker to kerning and tracking adjustments. Programs with formatting styles scored better than others since this feature allows greater productivity.","When you have questions, getting help from the company should be easy, so we looked at each software&#39;s support features. Programs that offered more points of contact for customer support, like phone, live chat and email, scored higher. We also favored companies that provided video tutorials, a FAQs page and a user forum. ","<strong>Choosing Desktop Publishing Software</strong>","The best desktop publishing software is easy to use and provides lots of beautiful templates and graphics for you to use. These programs should be useful for professional level projects or at-home creations. You&#39;ll want to make sure the program you choose has all of the features and tools you need. When we asked Kym Ridl if she had any advice for newcomers to desktop publishing software, she told us, &#34;If you don’t know how to do something, Google it. Most everything I know about any program was probably googled at some point. There are TONS of how-to videos for everything you could possibly need to do.&#34; If you get stumped you can always find answers online - whether through the program&#39;s developers or from other users.","Layout &amp; Publishing Tools<br/>Master pages are incredibly convenient, helping you create headers and footers for multiple pages. This helps you stay organized and allows you to flip through specific pages of your project quickly. Programs that use custom guides and proportional snapping help you maintain a level of professionalism in your creations. If you want a program that can print projects in colors that are similar to what you see on your screen, you will definitely want to get one that offers CMYK optimization.","It is less common for these kinds of programs to be able to make charts, graphs and tables. If these elements are important to you, make sure you find a program that offers them. Programs that allow you to import Word and PSD files can also be incredibly helpful since this increases the amount of text and image documents you can use.","Graphic Design Tools<br/>Even though some less expensive programs come with a lot of templates, art assets and fonts, we’ve found these less expensive programs often don&#39;t have many modern or professional-looking graphics compared to the more expensive programs. It’s a matter of quality versus quantity – and we prefer quality. If you plan on creating a lot of your documents from scratch, you should look for a software that offers a wide range of graphic design tools like photo correction tools, the ability to add gradients and transparency to your projects, and photo color adjustments.","Ridl told us, &#34;sometimes one program is better to use than others. I tend to use [Microsoft] Publisher for really simple projects. But for things that need to appear a bit more “corporate” looking I tend to use InDesign or Photoshop.&#34; Before making your purchase, try to determine which program best meets your needs. If you need to create more formal looking documents, you&#39;ll want to pay a little more to obtain professional-quality art assets and layout tools.","Templates<strong><br/></strong>Some programs do a better job of providing creative templates for calendars, posters and stationary sets, while others are more professional, covering business cards, letter heads, menus and resumes. The number of templates offered varies from program to program, but the best offer hundreds of choices. Remember that just because a program offers more templates, it doesn&#39;t mean that they are chic or modern enough for you to actually want to use them. Before you decide, take time to look at the sample templates offered by each program.","Typography<strong><br/></strong>Many desktop publishers come with fonts for you to use, but more importantly, they come with tools that can help you optimize your text. Most programs offer text reflow that allows you to make sure that content from one textbox gets neatly placed in a new location without losing any. Spellcheckers are also very common and will help you catch any errors that could distract from your creations.","Some programs go so far as to provide word processing tools so you can make common changes and enhancements to your text. This can include making changes to fonts and adjusting kerning and tracking directly within the program instead of needing to import it from another document.","Help &amp; Support<strong><br/></strong>The best programs offer dozens, if not hundreds, of online tutorials. Similarly, community forums can help you get answers to your questions from other users. Programs that offer multiple ways to contact customer support – email, phone or live chat – can make your life easier.","<strong>What Types of Documents Can You Create With Desktop Publishing Programs?</strong>","Desktop publishing software is used to combine typography with images in an aesthetically pleasing way. Professionals in thousands of fields use it every day to create newspapers, newsletters, pamphlets, flyers, brochures, books, magazines and more. Microsoft Publisher is the most commonly <em>owned</em> DTP, since many people already have access to it through Office 365. However, the most commonly used professional program is Adobe InDesign. You’ll find the newspaper, magazine and media industries all use InDesign to create professional work. ","You purchase InDesign as a subscription, and many home users prefer alternative software options that only require a one-time payment. So which should you use? If you’re a designer or student looking to be hired to work as a professional, it might be worth paying for the Adobe CC subscription since it also gives you access to other Adobe programs. However, if you just occasionally make school flyers or a community newsletter from home, a different software will suffice. If you fall into this second group, we recommend <a href=\"/printmaster-review\">PrintMaster V8 Platinum</a>."]},"id":"be651d24-7676-4933-8048-0141e47ece70","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_112","url":"/best-desktop-publishing-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-08T14:27:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-08T14:27:00Z","name":"Best Desktop Publishing Software of 2019","synopsis":"The best desktop publishing software balances user-friendliness with powerful capabilities and generous options.
