For example, Prism Video Converter can’t auto-transfer converted videos to iTunes, and it lacks GPU encoding, which speeds up the conversion process.

Our team of reviewers and video experts has developed a series of tests designed to gauge each application’s usability, conversion time, customization options, exported file size, ability to bypass anti-piracy encryptions and basic video editing tools, as well as to judge the overall quality of the converted videos. We ripped dozens of DVDs, customized and optimized them for various types of devices, and timed how long it takes to perform a conversion. Our video experts then spent hours examining each video, searching for imperfections in the picture and sound. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Every DVD ripper we reviewed was subjected to a battery of tests to help us determine which ones are best for certain tasks.","Usability Test<br/>We inspected each program’s interface and work flow, as well as counted the number of clicks it takes to perform common tasks such as loading a disc, starting a conversion, and accessing video editing tools and other customization features. We also evaluated whether each program is easy enough for a person with little or no DVD-ripping experience to use. ","<br/>Timing Test<br/>We timed how long it took each program to rip a DVD and convert it into a format that’s playable by other media software. Times ranged from less than 30 minutes to over two hours, and we found that the time it takes to convert a ripped file has no effect on its final quality.","Size Test<br/>After using each software, we looked at the sizes of the ripped files it created. Smaller files are better because they take up less room on your computer or other device. The best DVD rippers created files between 2GB and 3GB, and lower-performing programs bloated files up to as large as 20GB.","Quality Test<br/>We used each program we reviewed to rip and convert the same DVD. When we were done, our video experts watched the ripped files on a large screen television and searched for imperfections such as compression artifact, motion blur, ghosting and interlacing issues. The best programs produced files with minimal or no quality loss compared to the source material. ","<strong>Key Features of DVD Ripper Software</strong>","The best DVD rippers have a variety of features and tools that allow you to rip and convert DVDs, as well as edit the resulting files. Below are the criteria we used to rate and rank these applications:<br/><br/>Conversion Choices<br/>Every application we reviewed has the ability to convert DVDs into the most popular video file formats such as MP4, MOV and AVI. But the best go far beyond that. They offer a library of preprogrammed optimization profiles for specific devices such as smartphones, tablets, gaming systems, smart TVs and more. The usefulness of these programs increases as the number of options rises. For example, our top pick allows you to optimize your DVD conversions for more than 100 specific smartphone and tablets models, while our value pick only provides six. If you have multiple devices, or even a device that’s obscure or rare, there’s a much better chance our top pick will have an optimization profile for it.<br/><br/>Ripping Attributes<br/>The best DVD rippers convert quickly, and the files they convert are high quality and manageable sizes. Also, an application’s interface should be intuitive and allow you to start a rip in three steps or less. Furthermore, the best rippers can extract audio clips from discs, capture subtitles and more. When we assessed each program’s ripping attributes, we consider which features and tools it has, as well as how well they work.<br/><br/>Customization Tools<br/>Even the most exhaustive library of preprogrammed output profiles can’t cover the many ways you can customize a video. As such, the best programs allow you manually adjust codecs, aspect ratios, bit-rates, frame rates and more before you rip a DVD.","Also, most of the products we reviewed include a basic video editor you can use to trim away unwanted footage, crop video, add watermarks and edit subtitles.","How Much Does DVD Ripper Software Cost?<br/>Generally, you can expect to pay between $40 to $50 for the best DVD ripper software. This is a fair price, considering the functionality you get. If a program simply ripped videos, it might not be worth it. But the fact that they include editors, converters and optimizers make them more than worth the price tag.","Help &amp; Support<br/>No matter how easy an application is to use, you may occasionally need support. Manufacturers that provide excellent customer service make the best DVD rippers. Look for a program that comes with tutorials, FAQs and a knowledgebase on the developer’s website. In case you can’t find your answers there, manufacturers should also offer email or live chat support. ","<strong>Best Free DVD Ripper Software</strong>","If you’re short on cash or only need the bare minimum from a DVD ripper, Prism by NCH Software may suit your needs. It’s the only product we reviewed with a free home-use version, but it has several drawbacks.","The biggest problem is the enormous files it produces. When we tested this program, the average ripped file was in excess of 20GB. In addition, this software can&#39;t rip commercial discs protected by anti-piracy encryptions. As such, you can only use it on homemade discs and vanishingly rare unprotected commercial discs.","HandBrake is another alternative. It is free, open source software that’s been around for a long time. The program can rip DVDs, but like Prism, it’s limited to ripping unprotected discs. Plus, it’s a bit advanced for casual users. Unless you’re a media whiz, you’re better off paying for an easy-to-use program like the ones we reviewed."]},"id":"5f8e7bc9-91bf-456f-a53c-2e3740f088d4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_257","url":"/best-dvd-ripper-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
