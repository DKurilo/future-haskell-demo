It folds up like a briefcase and can be stored in your trunk or backseat. The solar generator also has a built-in controller that prevents your battery from overcharging. The panels can store up to 80 watts and will run all day in the sun while the battery charges. This is one of the best <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-portable-solar-power-systems\">solar power</a> kits for keeping the batteries charged on your RV during a long camping trip.","The portable solar power system is smartly designed and takes only a few minutes to set up. It starts out folded in a carrying case and you simply need to unclamp the top and set up the legs. Power is stored through a solar controller and is sent through battery clamps to your RV or car. The entire unit weighs just under 20 pounds, so it’s made for quick transport, more than a long trek. The solar power system is about 20 inches folded up and 40 inches unfolded.","You should be aware that this offers a lot of power and isn’t primarily made for small devices like phones or laptops. That doesn’t mean you aren’t able to use it for smaller items, however. You can clip a 12-volt plug to the battery clamps, similar to the power outlets you find in cars. With that, you can use an adaptor for a USB or wall socket connection.","The Go Power folding solar kit comes with a standard 15-foot cord, which might be short depending on where your RV or boat is parked. If the battery is left in the RV, simply getting the cord to the ground will take up about 4 feet. You may want to consider getting some sort of extension cord if you prefer to have the solar panel set up in the most direct sunlight.","This is a great portable kit for outdoor enthusiasts or those who are on a long-distance RV trip. It should save you in gas and is more cost effective than using a generator. While it can charge smaller devices, that’s not its main purpose. Your best option would be using it to charge the RV batteries and charging the smaller items with adaptors inside the vehicle."]},"id":"b707ad4e-dfb6-4b32-af32-75023690ec1b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61705","url":"/go-power-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:27:39Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:27:39Z","name":"Go Power 80W Solar Kit GP-PSK-80","synopsis":"The Go Power Solar Kit is made specifically to charge 12-volt batteries using the power of the sun.
