You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Rollie Eggmaster changes the regular style of scrambled eggs, forming them into a cylinder. You can even add vegetables and cheese for a rolled-up omelet. This <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a> offers a different spin on a classic breakfast food.","With this egg cooker, you can crack up to three eggs directly into the opening at the top. After six to eight minutes, they puff up out of the top and are ready to serve. The nonstick interior helps your recipes come out in a smooth cylinder shape, making them easy to cut into slices, eat them by hand like a burrito, or skewer and eat on the go.","Five wooden skewers are included to use with different recipes or to help coax the egg out. The skewers serve a dual purpose, helping to clean any stubborn residue between uses. The soft grip and cool touch of the exterior provides an easy hold as you remove your egg dishes.","When the egg cooker is on, the red power light is illuminated. Once the green light comes on, it is ready for you to fill with your ingredients. An included packer helps push down the food as you fill it so the entire recipe cooks correctly. The included instructions show a step-by-step guide with each recipe to prepare your meal quickly and easily inside this cooker.","This machine includes a 25-page booklet of recipes featuring those using basic scrambled eggs and egg whites to begin. Meals and snacks with vegetables, lunch meats and other additions are also included for you to try out or to inspire you to create your own combinations. The recipe book also helps you make classic sandwich recipes into a compact roll.","This As Seen On TV egg cooker includes a special brush designed for cleaning out the cooking chamber after it has cooled, since abrasive clothes and sponges may damage the interior lining. The pieces are not dishwasher safe and should not be submerged in water.","The Rollie Eggmaster doesn&#39;t provide your classic scrambled eggs, but it does create something a little different that may appeal to kids and people who need breakfast that can travel with them."]},"id":"d49f8eda-9321-4b5a-bf28-bc3e74ba0de9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63181","url":"/rollie-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T19:10:04Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T19:10:04Z","name":"Rollie Eggmaster","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-03T19:10:04Z","id":"CBvg55qGpGfW6siisPzoqj","meta":{"title":"Rollie Eggmaster Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Rollie.
