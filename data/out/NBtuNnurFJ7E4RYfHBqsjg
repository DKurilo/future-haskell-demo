The ability to create jobs, set your own hours and do something you truly love is undoubtedly appealing. But with all of the benefits of a small business comes pitfalls, particularly when it comes to accounting. With only one accountant in place   as is the case with many small businesses   there&#39;s a high probability of scams and fraud. Watch out for some of the most common to protect your small business.<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"f6017b98-bfe1-4209-9826-4a506a92f058","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Personal Use of Employer Funds</strong>","Many small businesses utilize business credit cards to help pay for supplies and vendors. When just one accountant is in charge of settling accounts and seeing what was spent on company cards, personal use of those cards may not be immediately apparent. It often starts with smaller purchases   a lunch here, office supplies there. But, left undetected, this behavior can snowball to include more expensive shopping trips.","<strong>Fraudulent Checks</strong>","Because small-business accountants have access to the accounts and checks for their companies, it&#39;s simple to write fraudulent checks for which the scammer is the benefactor. Take this case study, for example: A scammer accountant enters &#34;freight&#34; and the amount into the accounting software. She then uses that check number to write a check from the company to herself. Therefore, while the payment looks like a check to pay for shipping, it&#39;s actually going into a personal bank account.","<strong>Payroll Fraud</strong>","It&#39;s one of the most common issues for small businesses, and one that may not involve the accountant. Payroll fraud is when employees inflate their hours to get more pay. A project manager, for instance, could be billing for more than one project at a time or increasing his or her hours. Payroll fraud is not just fudging numbers, but a willful effort to make more money based on deceit   and a reason to put a more sophisticated timecard system into place.","<strong>Supply Fraud</strong>","One way accounting numbers can be fudged and companies can be defrauded out of funds is through supply fraud. Supply fraud usually occurs when an agent of the company   say, the office manager   purchases office supplies needed for work. Unfortunately, the person buying the supplies overbuys and can then return the excess items for a gift card or even cash back. On the books, it looks legit, but the employee walks away with hundreds or even thousands in cash and cards.","It&#39;s difficult to prevent every type of employee and small-business fraud, especially if you believe your employees are trustworthy. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the case for every small business. Even if you have the world&#39;s <a href=\"/best-online-payroll-services\">best accounting software for a small business</a> in place, keeping tabs on accounting and ensuring a double-check system can help protect you and your small business."]},"id":"a44909d7-92c4-45b9-9b02-98e9e87eb1d4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8399","url":"/small-business-accounting-popular-scams","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-curtis","url":"/author/j-curtis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.
