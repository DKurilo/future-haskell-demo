The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use. Top Ten Reviews does not endorse piracy or any other illegal activity.</em>","Although it&#39;s not packed with extra features, 4Media DVD Copy for Mac earned a spot in our review of the best <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copy software</a>. It is designed to make physical copies of your DVDs. The lack of extras keep 4Media&#39;s interface streamlined, making the DVD burning process as painless as possible. You don&#39;t have to be a computer genius to figure out how to work this application.","Before this program can begin copying a DVD, it has to first break the encryptions that protect commercial discs from illegal piracy. This application comes with a decryptor to bypass these protections and begin the copying process. Without the decryptor, you could only copy unprotected or homemade DVDs.","You would be hard-pressed to find a simpler DVD burner. 4Media&#39;s interface is contained on a single screen, and it takes as little as a single click to start the copying process. Once a DVD has been scanned, all you have to do is insert a blank DVD to begin the burning process. When the process is completed, the application ejects a newly burned disc that can work in any DVD player.","You can burn movies to DVD-5 or DVD-9 discs. The difference is the quality and compression of the output. Normally, blank DVD-5s don&#39;t have enough space to hold everything found on a commercial disc, but 4Media can compress the content so it does fit.","Unfortunately, compression results in lower video quality no matter what program you use. When our video experts compared a compressed DVD copy made with 4Media to the original commercial disc, they noticed some minor pixelation, compression artifact and motion blur. But unless you&#39;re watching the copied DVD on huge HD television, it won&#39;t distract from the viewing experience.","4Media doesn&#39;t require a blank DVD for every burn. This program will saved burnt ISO files to your Mac, allowing you to watch them directly from your computer or burn DVDs later. This conserves your Mac&#39;s battery power by playing the movie directly from the hard drive. Of course, you must have a media player that will play an ISO file, but there are free applications you can find easily on the internet that will do this."]},"id":"2e5d0cfe-a8dd-4f48-a243-8db06b4a7bb0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e0f1f751-1823-40b9-a101-5ccea46e0668","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["4Media DVD Copy doesn&#39;t reinvent the wheel, but it performs basic DVD burning functions quickly and reliably.
