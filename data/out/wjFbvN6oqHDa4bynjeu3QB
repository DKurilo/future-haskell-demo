As part of this call, you can expect them to run a soft credit check to see how much you owe and who you owe to. Only unsecured debts are eligible for inclusion in a <a href=\"/best-debt-settlement-companies\">debt settlement program</a>. We also recommend taking some time to look at your spending habits and monthly budget before making your call.","A debt settlement program requires you to stop making payments to your creditors and instead make payments into an account set up by Pacific Debt. The debt specialist you speak to will explain the impact this will have on your credit score. In the long term, a successful debt settlement program can reduce your debt-to-income ratio, but settlements will be listed on your account for several years after.","When you join a debt settlement program, you’ll have a personal representative who will keep in touch and give you updates on how the negotiations are proceeding. You will also have access to a dashboard where you can monitor your accounts.","A program through Pacific Debt lasts between two and four years and can reduce your debt by as much as 50 percent. The firm charges fees that range from 15 to 25 percent of the amount of debt you enroll in the program, which is standard for the industry but lower than <a href=\"/superior-debt-relief-services-review\">Superior</a> or <a href=\"/new-era-debt-solutions-review\">New Era</a>. Keep in mind that those fees are in addition to the settled debt, so you’ll end up paying 65 to 75 percent of your debt by the time your program ends.","To be eligible for a debt settlement program you need to have at least $7,500 worth of debt and at least $500 in each account you enroll. If your debt doesn’t meet these thresholds, Pacific Debt will recommend you to one of its credit counseling partners.","Pacific Debt Inc. has been providing debt settlement services since 2002. It is certified by the IAPDA and AFCC, which means that the debt specialists you speak to have gone through rigorous training and that Pacific Debt is audited each year to ensure it complies with the standards of those organizations."]},"id":"7b3ed0ce-0d7c-467e-ba94-643ba2cc1bc9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"82814ffe-add0-4202-8ba9-762ba04f6ad3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pacific Debt Inc. is a long-established debt settlement company that provides a dedicated account rep when you enroll in the program.
