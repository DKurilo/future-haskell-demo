The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 Pedometers </em><a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-pedometers\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em>","The Omron Alvita Wireless Activity Tracker is a good <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-pedometers\">pedometer</a> if all you want is simplicity. It doesn’t have the fancy whizbangs other step trackers do and only tracks three things: steps, distance and calories. Still, it is small and discrete.","Tracking accuracy isn’t a highlight of the Omron pedometer. During testing, we found that the battery cut out, which resulted in missed steps. When it was working, we found that it only reported about 60 percent of the steps we actually took. The distance readout was also off by a mile, which is significant when you’re tracking 2.5 miles. However, calorie tracking was almost exact. This pedometer hit within 30 calories of the total 2,000 burned in the tracking time periods. This step counter doesn’t track active minutes, which is very inconvenient.","While we did experience battery issues we hope were a fluke, the rest of the Omron Alvita Wireless Activity Tracker’s design is pretty handy. Its coin cell battery’s six-month battery life lets you go for half a year before you have to worry about replacing it. Like the best pedometers, the Omron has a tiny screen; you tap to wake it up and swipe to view data. This tiny tracker also has a built-in clip you can attach to your pants, shirt hem or pocket without worrying about losing it or having it fall off. Overall, it’s a pretty attractive little device you can hide easily with any outfit or workout gear.","This step counter pedometer is also wireless, which means you send your data via Bluetooth to the app on your phone. The Omron app has charts and you can set custom goals, so you can view your steps taken every day and motivate yourself to do better. The device has a 14-day history, but we found it easiest to sync once a day to stay up to date on our progress. It doesn’t track your sleep quality at night, but that’s ok because it would be uncomfortable to wear this solid plastic device to bed.","Pedometers for walking like the Omron Alvita usually come with a manual and support from the manufacturer. The Omron does have a manual, but it’s so easy to operate and set up that it’s unlikely you’ll even need it. A 12-month warranty from Omron covers your tracker in case of defects such as a defective original battery."]},"id":"1c3d89cb-d547-4208-af32-4945e4689aac","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"175a99c3-ed5a-413b-a2dc-61dd09966901","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want to simply track your steps every day, the Omron Alvita Wireless Activity Tracker is a simple little guy that gives you a rough estimate of your daily totals.
