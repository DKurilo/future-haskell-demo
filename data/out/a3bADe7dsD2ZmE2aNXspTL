This washer packs a lot of bang for a lot of buck. Although it is one of the most expensive <a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">portable washing machines</a> in our lineup, the GE portable washer is worth every penny.","The GE portable washer has the greatest capacity of our lineup. At up to 2.7 cubic feet, this compact washer&#39;s stainless steel tub can hold well over half the amount of laundry a normal washer can. The clear lid allows you to view your clothes roll and tumble clean, proving the innovative pulsating system really works. However, the price of the GE portable washing machine is comparable to some standard-sized washing machines. Perhaps one reason for this is the capability this washer has to operate at the same level as a standard or even industrial machine."]},"id":"e4e32f89-5548-4398-a636-f235e183fb63","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Portability"},"id":"4d7e7a3a-1ff6-48b6-8dc4-74230e14e8ec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This GE washer is the only unit from our portable washing machine lineup that has a child lock on the control panel.

To avoid losing your settings to the fingers of an excited kid, simply follow the instructions written in small print on the panel and hold the indicated buttons for three seconds to lock and unlock the controls.","Five automatic water levels, from extra small to extra large, promote efficiency and water preservation. GE also recommends using high-efficiency detergent with this portable washing machine for the best possible performance and less waste. Other convenient features include detergent and softener dispensers. Even small additions like these can ease the hassle of doing laundry and make it less of a chore.
