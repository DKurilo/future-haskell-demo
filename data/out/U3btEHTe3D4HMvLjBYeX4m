This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1338-best-racing-wheels.html\">game steering wheel</a> does have the basics necessary for these games, but it lacks the extras a racing enthusiast would want. This device is updated enough to work with PC games, but can only support a handful of PS2 racing sims. The developer, Genius, has created this wheel with an apparent Formula One (F1) racer design. It does have quick buttons that change gameplay at any time, but it looks like every other wheel on the market and does not stand out as an F1 gaming option because it doesn&#39;t give you the experience of effectively simulating some of the best racing cars out there.","The features of this gaming steering wheel are a mixed bag. Along with the wheel, you get the gas and brake pedals. The two pedals are both stiff and feel sturdy on the carpet-gripping platform, but for the immersive experience, it would have helped to have stronger resistance on the brake instead of both pedals feeling the same. There is no clutch or stick shift; instead, there is a lever under the steering wheel for quick shifting. A big benefit of the Twin Wheel F1 is the D-pad, which makes it easy to navigate game menus, tracks and auto options.","The Twin Wheel F1 is bare bones when it comes to customization. What you see is what you get, which doesn’t leave you much room to program the buttons or adjust the brake or steering sensitivity. It does come with a lap attachment, but it works best on a solid base like a table or small desk. It uses friction grips and a suction cup, which hold nicely.","The Twin Wheel F1 suffers because of software issues, particularly with downloading the syncing software in Windows 7. Occasionally driver isn&#39;t recognized and the wheel doesn&#39;t always give consistent feedback. However, with Windows XP, the controller provides a good deal of feedback and it handles more realistically. It is very lightweight and has short cables, so it&#39;s incredibly easy to store.","Don&#39;t expect much support. There is a one-month warranty and Genius can be reached by email or phone, but after more than a week, we have not received a response to our email."]},"id":"920d8849-cef2-4fc1-ad8a-036abc9960a5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"004e74ec-24e9-49ef-b0ec-7245d991d6b2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Twin Wheel F1 is a fine gaming steering wheel for first time racing game fans, but if you&#39;re looking for a complete experience and some durability, this device falls short of the best products.
