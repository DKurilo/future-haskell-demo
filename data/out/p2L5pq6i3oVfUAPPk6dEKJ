Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Electrolux Ergorapido Lithium Ion Brushroll Clean Xtra offers a lot of the qualities that people value most in a <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vacuum cleaner</a>, including a compact and lightweight design. It is also very quiet, tying for the quietest unit we tested in our stick vacuum reviews.","This unit offers less suction than a full-sized upright, which is pretty typical of a stick vac. It also offers less suction than most of the stick vacuum cleaners we tested, though, and that is a definite drawback. It was able to clear our test messes eventually but struggled more than other vacuums to clear the sawdust off of carpeting and hardwood flooring. It tended to push the mess around for a while before sucking it up. Lots of it got stuck in crevices during that process, which made the floor even harder to clean.","The dirt cup is relatively small so you have to empty it pretty often. We were unable to empty it without making a pretty big mess. There are other stick vacs that make it easier to empty without making a mess.","The Ergorapido Lithium Ion was one of the easier ones to maneuver during our testing. Its swivel steering made for smooth turns and it can lie almost flat to get under furniture, too. The detachable hand vac is a nice bonus. Since the Ion is relatively expensive it is not exactly like getting two vacuum cleaners for the price of one, but it is nice for compact storage, and both will help you keep things tidy around your home. The hand vac can also help you maintain smaller spaces like your car and RV. This vacuum cleaner had a relatively short run time. We only got about 16 minutes out of it – the second shortest run time in our comparison.  Since most of the time you just use a stick vac for quick jobs, this is not a huge problem. However, if you wanted to do a little more complete clean-up,  that isn’t an option with this vac."]},"id":"21214984-67e4-4766-8c4a-18018b5180bc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"676f7b39-c449-4ce1-a3b6-34134e2b7a01","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ergorapido Lithium Ion was out-cleaned by most units in our comparison, but it was able to clear all our test messes eventually.
