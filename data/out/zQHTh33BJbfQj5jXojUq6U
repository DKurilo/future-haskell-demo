It has a solid 14 MP resolution, and captured images can be viewed on the built-in 2.5-inch TFT color display screen. This unit has no internal memory, so you do need to use an SD card to save pictures. Images are easily transferred to a PC or Mac using the included USB cable. If you do not want to use a computer, you can view your photos directly on your television.","With a 14 MP image sensor, this device boasts a resolution on the high end of the slide converters we reviewed. Most modern smartphones take pictures with sensors between 8 MP and 16 MP; the 14 MP here churns out digitized photos with enough fidelity to capture fine details in old photographs, like the grain on a fencepost or tiny faces in a big family picture. Since this compact converter has automatic exposure and balance controls, the results are rarely blown out or tinted odd colors.","Compared to other digital converters, the Superior&#39;s included photo-editing software is a standout feature. Although being able to alter your own photos is a bonus, the software can be complicated â€“ it requires an understanding of Photoshop-style image editing tools or a willingness to learn the basics of colorizing and spot repair. If you are new to photo editing, you may be initially overwhelmed.","This slide converter is easy to use and the buttons are conveniently located on the top of the unit. Its rechargeable battery provides up to three hours of operation and takes three and a half hours to charge. The included trays hold slides as well as 135 mm, 126 mm and 100 mm negatives. However, there is no mechanism for converting printed photos.","One of Hammacher Schlemmer&#39;s biggest appeals is its lifetime warranty. Where every other slide scanner we reviewed offers a one-year warranty at best, the Superior&#39;s support lets you get the device serviced should it ever stop performing, as long as Hammacher Schlemmer is still in business."]},"id":"0574bddd-f7d7-4377-abfd-d5123a480ed9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"043f9b03-c83e-4292-aa7e-61f7df8ab0d5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although this unit does not convert photos, the Hammacher Schlemmer Superior is a good device for digitizing slides and film.
