He said toy-grade vehicles usually break after a while, but if you’re willing to spend $300 to $400 on a hobby-grade vehicle, you can fix and customize it yourself.","“There are ones you put together and then buy the electronics for,” he said. “They’re more expensive but they’re more customizable.”","Whether it’s hyper-competitive speed racing or a low-key hike with an RC rock crawler, Slynn said the community is what has kept him interested in the hobby. Utah, for instance, is home to the 801 RCC club.","“Everybody is super friendly and willing to help and give pointers on how to tune trucks to perform better,” he said.","<strong>Hobby Cars</strong>","Hobby-grade cars are customizable, which makes them a lot of fun. If you want more speed or a less bulky frame, you can simply tweak the vehicle yourself. You need small tools to do this and lots of concentration. There’s also the possibility of taking your car apart and not being able to get it working again, so make sure to consult the internet or experienced hobbyists before you start. You can add or remove battery power to increase your car’s speed as well as change out tires and other moving mechanisms for more control around curves.
