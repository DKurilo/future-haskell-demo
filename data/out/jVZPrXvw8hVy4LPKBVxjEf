In Europe, the company is a market leader in lawn and garden products and accessories. This model is being sold in the United States, both online and in retail stores like Walmart and other hardware chains. This is a solid mower that scored among the best in our usability and consistency tests. However, it also has a narrow cutting path of less than 15 inches and a very narrow cutting range. The shortest it can cut grass is an inch and the longest is 1.65 inches.","When you receive the box containing your new <a href=\"/best-lawnmowers-review\">push mower</a>, you’ll find several components to assemble before you can get to cutting grass: the handle, the two-pronged shaft and the mower unit itself. Of all the products we evaluated, this one was the easiest and fastest to assemble. It only requires four bolts to attach the parts together. When you follow the exact instructions found in the user manual, it should only take you about 10 minutes to fully assemble the entire machine. This is the quickest assembly time of any product in our review.","This is a push lawnmower with five blades, which the company advertises has a 15-inch cutting path. However, in our tests, the effective cutting width of this push mower was 14.5 inches. The discrepancy is most likely due to the wheels pushing down the edges of the grass. This was common among the mowers we tested. It does mean you’ll have to make overlapping passes to avoid narrow strips of uncut grass.","During our testing of this mower, we found it relatively easy to push. It cut grass as well as most of its competition. However, it’s really only useful when used on a lawn that is already in decent shape. If your grass is taller than 5 inches, you either have to find another way to shorten it or make several passes to get the desired result. We also found that if individual blades of grass are overgrown, they won’t be cut, the mower simply pushes them flat – another reason to make sure your lawn is in good shape before you start using this mower.","In our testing, this mower (when properly calibrated) took about 18 passes to achieve a level cut over a 10’ x 10’ area. This is the second highest number of passes needed to achieve similar results in our review of the best reel lawnmowers. With the GARDENA lawnmower, expect to retrace your steps a number of times before you’re done mowing.","One big plus with this hand cylinder lawnmower is that it did not jam a single time during our tests. This is not an insignificant. Only one other product we reviewed was able to complete our test with no mechanical failures.","There are a couple of things to be aware of when you’re adjusting the cutting level of this reel mower. First, while GARDENA makes it easy to loosen the bolts by turning the locking screws located near the wheels, there are no notches or other indicators to show how much you are raising or lowering the blades. And since you have to loosen both sides, you have to eyeball each side to see if your setting is level. This can be tricky, and if you set different cutting heights on each side, the result is uneven grass. Additionally, the measurement guides located above the adjustment slider are in metric, which might cause some difficulty for American users, unless they can do metric-to-imperial conversions.","One interesting side note, the instruction manual for this machine includes 10 languages. That’s far more than any other instruction manual in our review, and it’s probably a result of the European heritage of the mower.","Despite its drawbacks, the GARDENA Cylinder Lawnmower is worthy of your consideration. It&#39;s a reliable machine that is easy to assemble and use, and it doesn’t require much maintenance. The only real concern is the difficulty of precisely adjusting the mowing height."]},"id":"337f21d7-a545-4410-a466-c8b8a6933541","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64523","url":"/gardena-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
