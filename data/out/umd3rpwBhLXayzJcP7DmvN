Even nonprofits are finding that the ability to process credit card transactions leads to an increase in contributions. However, credit card processing services cost money to use, and if you choose the wrong service for your business, it can be expensive and take a heavy toll on your profits.","We&#39;ve reviewed <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">the best credit card processing companies</a>, but in addition to choosing a reputable credit card processing service, you can save money in other ways. Here are five tips that can help you save money on your credit card processing.","<strong>1.\tRead the Contract</strong><br/>Credit card processing companies are notorious for hidden fees. Often, these fees are listed in the program guide or terms of service – both of which are actually considered part of the contract. Fees may be renamed to avoid setting off alarm bells. For example, a credit card processing company may say it doesn&#39;t have an &#34;early termination fee,&#34; but if it charges an &#34;early deconversion fee,&#34; it&#39;s essentially the same thing. You should also watch for additional service clauses that you have to opt out of rather than enroll in. Be sure you read all three parts of the contract (the application, the program guide and the terms of service) and that you understand each expense and fee: what it means, when it&#39;s in effect, how much it runs.","Additionally, you should pay attention to the length of the contract. Some credit card processing companies require three-year contracts that automatically renew for two-year terms, but the best companies provide service on a month-to-month basis.","<strong>2.\tChoose the Right Pricing Model </strong><br/>Many credit card processing companies quote tiered rates, which initially appear attractive, because most advertise a very low rate for swiped debit cards. However, unless you process a high volume of debit cards, this pricing model can be more expensive than other options.","Industry experts recommend interchange-plus pricing for most businesses (also referred to as cost-plus pricing) because it&#39;s the most transparent and cost-effective pricing model. You may have to specifically request a quote for this pricing model, as some processors are reluctant to offer it.","If you process less than $3,000 per month or your average transactions are small, a flat-rate pricing model may be more affordable for your business. Even though the percentage you pay for each transaction is higher, there&#39;s often no per-transaction fee. Plus, these plans typically don&#39;t charge many of the fees you would otherwise pay with other pricing models, such as a monthly statement fee, gateway fee or an annual PCI-compliance fee.","<strong>3.\tCut to the Chase (or Bank of America, or Fifth Third…)</strong><br/>There are still some banks that process of credit cards directly. Working with them instead of a smaller bank or a credit card processing service cuts out the middle man, which may save you money. If the bank also handles your business banking, it may offer you some sort of perk such as a faster turnaround on transaction deposits.","<strong>4.\tShop Around &amp; Negotiate</strong><br/>Don&#39;t settle on the first credit card processing service you find. Instead, call several companies for quotes.

Compare the rates, fees and contract length that each company quotes you. Read through the contracts to make sure that you&#39;re aware of all fees and charges. Ask about setup fees, PCI-compliance fees, contract length and early termination fees and ask if they can be waived for you (and be sure to get the waiver in writing).","<strong>5.\tBuy Your Equipment</strong><br/>Leasing might sound like a great idea, but in the long run, you&#39;ll pay more for your equipment, even if the company offers a discounted leasing rate. You may receive a tempting free equipment offer only to find there&#39;s a monthly &#34;maintenance fee&#34; or a lengthy contractual requirement attached to the deal. Many leasing contracts are non-cancelable, which means that even if you go out of business, you&#39;re still on the hook for the full amount of your lease.","Instead, consider purchasing used equipment as you can often find good used terminals or point-of-sale systems at a discount price. Look for &#34;unlocked&#34; terminals that can be programmed to work with any credit card processing company, which means that if you change credit card processing services, you can keep using your equipment. Some credit card processing companies charge a fee for reprogramming equipment, so you want to ask before signing up how much it costs.","Credit card processing is a competitive business.
