When you bring your own <a href=\"/best-alarm-clocks\">alarm clock</a> when you travel, you know how dependable your wake up is. Something that combines the function of several devices is even better. The Geneva Sound System Model XS is a compact and portable system that functions as an alarm clock, radio and sound system. It can pair with any smart device, and it folds into a built-in case perfect for tossing into a bag or pocket.","The Model XS runs on either AC power or a rechargeable battery. The battery life will last longer when on standby mode, enough to get through the night and wake you up the next morning. You have to install the included battery when you get the Model XS.","The clock is not backlit, but the red LED showing the time is a soft light that won&#39;t disturb your eyes when you look at it at night. It&#39;s still clear and bright enough to see during the day. This radio alarm clock system does not have many features found in other alarm clocks on our list. It lacks a dual alarm and a snooze. For the alarm, you have a choice between using a buzzer or the FM radio.","Turning the alarm off in the morning is difficult if you&#39;re only partially awake. The off control is a small dimple at the top of the device. All the controls at the top are part of a touch-sensitive panel that lights up. All the controls are close together, so you might accidentally hit the wrong ones. The only way to tell which control you&#39;re hitting is by looking at the device.","This unit gets great radio reception. You can also pull out a telescoping antenna hidden in the side of the device to get better reception if you need to. Another feature is the 3.5mm auxiliary input jack and included cord that let you hook up a device to listen to music. You can also pair a device like an iPod or Android smartphone with the Model XS using Bluetooth to stream music. The sound system part of the Model XS is clear and loud and sounds great for a portable speaker.","Geneva Labs offers a one-year warranty on the Model XS. If you need further support, you can download the manual from the company&#39;s main website. You can also find contact information like a phone number and email address on the site."]},"id":"b8f31673-25a2-43e4-a943-2f3bb97fd860","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3f9fe925-64b2-4f96-92dd-c91e47a069a6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Geneva Sound System Model XS is a great travel alarm clock radio.
