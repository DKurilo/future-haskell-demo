Each control is labeled and easy to understand, which makes for simple usage. The Mode control is labeled for four different settings: Photo, Video, Set/test and View. The Delay control allows you to select one-minute, three-minute, five-minute or 15-minute delays during motion.","The Multi-shot/Video Length switch is clearly labeled for both photos and videos. When you are taking photos, you can select M1, M2, M3 or M4 – providing you with up to four shots taken consecutively after movement is detected. The video lengths are clearly labeled: 10, 30, 60 and 90 seconds. There are also three buttons at the bottom of the camera labeled Down, Menu/OK, and Up. These provide clear navigation and allow you to use the screen for setting the date and time, to erase a photo or to format a memory card.
