It&#39;s a simple piece of equipment that only measures your aerobic and walking steps, so you can take this pedometer on runs, walks and errands to track your daily routines. Its 94-percent accuracy rate is impressive.","This pedometer works best when fastened to your hip. Its wearability is limited because the pendulum sensor works best when it can closely measure the swing of your hips as you walk. The large display screen shows your step count in large numbers, so it&#39;s easy to check your progress. With durable plastic clips, it&#39;s easy to attach the SM2000 to your belt or pocket."]},"id":"16f1c316-a3f3-45a6-86d4-9cd98dd01a0a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/T2788oDh7b5kXELbPzssvJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"You can track up to 99,999 steps with the SM2000. Unlike other basic pedometers, the SM2000 does not have a memory, so you have to reset the device manually. Though it has no automatic reset like most pedometers, the manual reset has its advantages. If you&#39;d like to reach a high number of steps over a short period or track your total step count over several days, the SM2000 will keep your data until you wish to wipe it clean. When you do want to clear your data, simply press the Clear button for two seconds until the display shows all zeroes.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58469-sm20002.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2788oDh7b5kXELbPzssvJ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"T2788oDh7b5kXELbPzssvJ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2788oDh7b5kXELbPzssvJ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7ad7fa03-f5bd-4eae-873f-51c134cbcd1b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SM2000 has the most color options of all the pedometers we reviewed.
