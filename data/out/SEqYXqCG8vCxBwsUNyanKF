The ceramic element is combined with ionic technology to project negative ions and reduce hair frizz while also getting the conditioning, moisturizing and strengthening needed to keep your hair healthy. Andis claims that the 1875W Ceramic Professional better penetrates hair shafts to seal hair cuticles while still preserving the natural oils of your scalp and restoring moisture balance to hair for an even healthier head.","This combination heating element helps to create a device capable of drying hair at a speed on par with even the best blow dryers used by salon professionals. Individuals with thick hair will be interested in this drier&#39;s ability to dry thicker hair quickly, as well as rejuvenate the look and feel of it. The Andis 1875W Ceramic Professional is able to reduce the length of time it takes to dry your hair with a common hair dryer by an average of 10 minutes.","The Andis 1875W Ceramic Professional is rated for 1875 Watts, the equivalent of professional-grade hair blowers. However, the unit is quite compact, with a folding handle for travel-size storage. The durable design is further complemented by the inclusion of a five-year warranty that covers both the heating element and the electrical wiring.","When it comes to competing with standard and portable hair dryers, the Andis 1875W Ceramic Professional puts up a good fight. The heating element makes it possible to dry hair quickly without damaging it, and it comes with multiple heat and air settings to address the individualized needs of its users, without sacrificing focus on the quality of internal parts."]},"id":"db53e6e6-b914-42fe-b2f5-e2816de38a82","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58178","url":"/andis-1875w-ceramic-professional-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:58:50Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:58:50Z","name":"Andis Professional 1875W Ionic Ceramic","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
