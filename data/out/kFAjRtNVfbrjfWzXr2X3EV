In today’s world of laptops, tablets and phones, it’s more important than ever for manufacturers to make it simple to connect to a printer.","After looking at the printer’s output quality, we evaluated the printers in other areas to make sure they limit frustration: printing speed, cost of ink, paper handling and versatility."]},"id":"7daa46a9-fe96-4e99-8cdb-6ee9b9872ad3","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ALp7fZVLWjXEC7mWN9zZ8m.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/all-in-one-printers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9VL0kvNzg1MTc4L29yaWdpbmFsL0FsbC1pbi1vbmUtcHJpbnRlcnMtQ2Fub24tTUc3NzIwLTAwNi5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ALp7fZVLWjXEC7mWN9zZ8m.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ALp7fZVLWjXEC7mWN9zZ8m","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ALp7fZVLWjXEC7mWN9zZ8m.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1f6d6152-4f3c-41b4-9c58-f8e19d5bc84a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For an outside perspective, we reached out to <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/articles/?author_name=Brian%20Westover\">Brian Westover</a>, the editor at Tom’s Guide over printer coverage. We asked him about the most important thing to look for in an all-in-one printer. “The same with any tech, the first question is what you want to do with it, and that will determine what you end up getting,” Westover said. He added that “with an all-in-one printer, you’re looking at multiple functionality options. In addition to printing, you’ve got scanning, copying, sometimes fax capability, sometimes photo printing … use case is really the first thing to figure out.”","Westover also pointed out other considerations that people often overlook. “One of the big things to watch for is cost per page. A lot of people don’t think beyond the purchase price of the printer. But printers, more than perhaps any other piece of tech, have ongoing costs associated with them.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We ran each printer through a battery of printing tests, going through nearly 80 pages of documents. We then examined every page of these print samples, evaluating text clarity and color blending and watching for errors like ink spotting, streaking and print head misalignment. We also printed photos, using high-resolution images to test image reproduction and color quality.","If you’re looking to digitize documents to move toward a paperless office, scan and copy quality is paramount. Whether you’re duplicating pages from a book or doing some digital scrapbooking, printers with top-rated scanning do the job quickly without losing any important details.","You may not care about all of these, but they’re worth considering as you make your buying decision. Whatever your specific use case is, we’re here to help you find not only the best wireless printer on the market but the best wireless printer for you."]},"id":"44e18000-0604-497b-b487-6069704a8abb","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Y2EBt9m9CgRkhukdNHYXHH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/all-in-one-printers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9VL0cvNzg1MTc2L29yaWdpbmFsL0FsbC1pbi1vbmUtcHJpbnRlcnMtQ2Fub24tTUc3NzIwLTAwOS5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2EBt9m9CgRkhukdNHYXHH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Y2EBt9m9CgRkhukdNHYXHH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2EBt9m9CgRkhukdNHYXHH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c5f5bd49-db21-43b0-b5f4-8dc79ebfc098","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Features to Look for When Choosing an All-in-One Printer</strong>","The best all-in-one printers produce high-quality documents and photos, have easy-to-use functions, and are easy to connect. Aside from price, you should pay close attention to each printer’s list of features, since specific functions like fax capability and compatibility with certain mobile devices varies from one model to the next. Some are built with businesses in mind, with extra-durable designs and high-capacity inks, while printers for the home often have sleeker, compact designs and more media features. For more information about these devices, check out our articles on inkjet printers.","Output<br/>Our print quality scores put most of the focus on document printing, but many printers actually do better with photos than they do with basic documents. If you want a printer that prints high-quality photos, look at any of our reviews that have an A or B rating for photo print quality. These printers stood out in our testing with near-professional-quality photo prints that had sharp detail and good color reproduction.","Frustration-Free Devices<br/>Printers can be tricky devices. There will always be at least a few setup steps between you and your first printed page, so we look for printers that make that process as frustration-free as possible. We look for high-capacity trays so you don’t need to change the paper in your device as often. We also look at speed so you don’t have to stand around waiting for something important to print. So that you can keep a handle on future and not just upfront costs, we calculated the average price of ink for each of the printers we tested. Pay attention to these cost comparisons when assessing your short-term and long-term budget.","Connectivity &amp; Features<br/>Top-rated wireless printers have mobile compatibility for your smartphone or tablet, connectivity that plays nicely with Wi-Fi or wired networks, and a variety of built-in features that once required a specialized device such as a scanner or copier. Pair all of this capability with inkjet technology for affordable printing and refills and you’ve got a multifunction device that covers all of your document needs.","Scan Quality<br/>Making digital copies of physical documents is a critical feature of any all-in-one printer. A high quality scan makes all the difference when you pull a document out of the archive. A subpar scanner will produce documents that are fuzzy and distorted, which can make documents hard to read and in some cases, completely unusable.","We used each printer we reviewed to scan black-and-white as well as color documents and examined the results.

Does it support photo printing? What’s the scan and copy quality like? Is there easy access to support services? These may not be everyone’s focus when buying an all-in-one printer, but all are significant concerns if they speak to what you need.","<strong>Should You Get an All-in-One Printer?</strong>","Even though we’re printing less and storing more digitally, there’s still reason to have these devices in your home and office settings, especially for their scanning and copying abilities and their ability to print photos and projects.","Printers aren’t stuck with one or two functions anymore, as once-exotic functions like color printing, photo printing, scan and copy capability, and mobile connectivity have gone mainstream and can be found in the top all-in-one printers. At this point, finding a printer without these functions takes some real hunting, and multifunction designs are the name of the game as printing becomes less prevalent. But not all printers have the same capabilities, and quality differs from one model to another, so keep your eye out for the features you need.","<strong>Portable Photo Printers </strong><br/>","If you want a more portable option than those in our comparison, so that you can print photos from your phone or social media feed, a portable photo printer is a better option.

It’s small enough to fit in your pocket and works with iOS and Android devices. The Zip prints 2 x 3 inch, full-color photos with a sticky back to attach to any hard surface. The Polaroid companion app allows you to perform simple edits and print the finalized photos in less than a minute. The unique zero ink design means you never have to replace a cartridge, and the replacement paper is readily available at popular retail websites.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HP-Sprocket-Portable-Photo-Printer/dp/B07NFTCZZS/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">HP Sprocket 2nd Edition</a><br/>This portable photo printer is a bit larger than the Polaroid Zip, but it has a better companion app and allows several people to connect and print at the same time. It uses the same sticky-back, 2 x 3 inch paper as the Zip, and the companion app is available for Android and iOS mobile devices. The HP app has custom stickers with emojis, fun frame options and a photobooth feature that takes four photos to create a collage on a single sheet. There’s a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HP-Sprocket-Instant-Printer-Sticky-Backed/dp/B07M7DLRBJ\">Sprocket Plus</a> edition with all the same features as the Sprocket, but it prints 30 percent larger photos.","<strong>Best Compact Printers </strong>","The all-in-one printers we tested are best for copying, scanning and faxing documents, in addition to normal printing duties. If you don’t plan to use the extended functionality of an all-in-one printer, a <a href=\"/best-compact-printers\">compact printer</a> is a more cost-effective option. We used the same protocol as we did with all-in-one printers to test print quality and functionality. Here are our favorite compact printers.","<a href=\"/hp-officejet-mobile-review\">HP OfficeJet Mobile 200</a><br/>This was the best performer in our print quality test. It has a small footprint and rechargeable battery for printing up to 500 documents without plugging into a wall socket. At a cost of 16 cents per page, the OfficeJet Mobile is also one of the most cost-efficient printers we tested. Inkjet cartridge replacements are readily available at big-box retailers and on HP’s website, or, if you want to save some money, remanufactured cartridges are in stock at our favorite <a href=\"/best-discount-ink-cartridges-stores\">discount ink cartridge stores</a>.","<a href=\"/hp-deskjet-review\">HP DeskJet 3755</a><br/>If you want a printer for under $100, this is the best option. It didn’t perform as well as the best printers we tested in terms of speed and print quality, but the wireless direct printing features and compact design make it a good candidate for apartments and small dorm rooms. The DeskJet 3755 is compatible with the HP Instant Ink service that automatically orders ink and ships it to you before you run out. The HP ePrint app allows you to connect mobile devices and print documents from your email or photos from your social network feed.","<strong>How to Know If an Ink Cartridge Is Compatible With Your Printer</strong>","Before you buy an ink cartridge, you need to make sure it’s compatible with your all-in-one printer. If you get the wrong type, you’ll be stuck with an out-of-commission printer while you deal with the return and exchange process.","First, you need to find out what model printer you have. The model name and number are usually displayed on the front panel of your printer. If it’s not there, check the top of the printer, then the cartridge access area or inside the ink access door. In the rare case you can’t find it anywhere on your printer, it will definitely be printed in the owner’s manual.","Then go to the manufacturer’s website. Big names, such as <a href=\"https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c01766411\">HP</a>, <a href=\"https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/inkfinder\">Canon</a> and <a href=\"https://epson.com/InkFinder\">Epson</a>, all have complete lists of all the printer models they sell. Searching for your printer is easy when have the model number. Once you’ve found your model, you’ll see a list of compatible ink cartridges. When we searched for our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HP-Wireless-Printing-Replenishment-F0V69A/dp/B013SKI4LU/?&amp;tag=ttr_all-in-one_printers-20\">HP Envy 4520</a>, we found that it accepts <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-Black-Original-Cartridge-F6U66AE/dp/B00VYAWIRS/?tag=ttr_all-in-one_printers-20\">HP 302 Black</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-Black-Original-Cartridge-F6U66AE/dp/B00VYAWN5U/?tag=ttr_all-in-one_printers-20\">HP 302 Tri-color</a> cartridges.","Once you know the type of cartridge your printer takes, you can buy directly from the manufacturer or Amazon or search for deals at the <a href=\"/best-discount-ink-cartridges-stores\">best discount ink cartridge stores</a>.","<strong>Does Printer Ink Go Bad?</strong>","When you purchase an ink cartridge, make sure you check the expiration date. Most ink cartridges will be usable from 18 to 24 months after you install them. If you use your printer regularly, this shouldn’t be a problem. But if you’re only an occasional user, old/dry ink can potentially harm your printer.","“Often the problem is not the ink in the cartridge but the ink in the outlet valve to come out of the cartridge. It can dry and create a blockage.” Westover said.  He added that HP printers stand a greater chance of clogging due to dry ink because the cartridge also has the print head in there.","So, just like your car needs an oil change, your printer will need fresh ink, even if there’s plenty left in the tank. The difference is that you only have to do it once every year or two.","<strong>How Much Does an All-in-One Printer Cost?</strong> ","Inkjet printers tend to be less expensive than their laser counterparts. The low upfront cost makes them an ideal choice for a home office, and all-in-one models come with convenient features like a copier, scanner and fax machine. On average, the machines we tested cost just over $150, though there are printers with basic features that cost even less. We recommend models that cost above $100, since those that cost less usually work out to be expensive over time.","We also considered the ongoing costs of maintaining an all-in-one printer. Inkjet cartridges tend to cost more than those used in laser printers. On average, it costs 12 cents per page to print with the printers we tested. The per-page printing cost often goes down when you purchase high-capacity cartridges – they cost more upfront, but they drop the printing price to about 9 cents per page.","<strong>Best Places to Buy or Refill Ink Cartridges </strong>","Replenishing ink is the most expensive part of maintaining a printer. The fastest, most cost-effective option is to have empty cartridges refilled at one of the big box retail stores that offer the service. If you aren’t in a hurry and want a remanufactured or OEM cartridge that’s guaranteed to work and delivered to your doorstep, try one of the best online <a href=\"/best-discount-ink-cartridges-stores\">discount ink cartridge</a> stores we reviewed. Here are our favorite places to replace an empty ink cartridge.","<a href=\"/4inkjets-review\">4inkjets<br/></a>This discount ink cartridge website has the best selection of replacement cartridges of all the services we reviewed. Its prices are lower than average –about 3 cents per printed page for remanufactured cartridges and 7 cents per page for OEM cartridges. You can also add paper, cables and other printing supplies to break the free shipping price threshold. Shipping is fast and free for any order over $50. 4inkjets has a two-year guarantee for remanufactured cartridges and discounts for buying in bulk. After buying the ink cartridge you need once, you can use the service&#39;s reorder button to quickly place the same order again.","<a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/topic/printer-cartridge-refills-info.jsp\">Walgreens</a><br/>With more than 3,000 brick-and-mortar locations in the U.S., Walgreens is the best same-day option for refilling ink cartridges. It costs $13 to refill black or color cartridges, and the process takes less than an hour. You can call ahead to check on wait time for your preferred location. Walgreens uses the same high-quality ink you get in remanufactured cartridges and offers a money back guarantee if it doesn’t print at the same quality as a new cartridge. Printer maintenance professionals suggest refilling a cartridge a maximum of four times for optimal results.","<strong>OEM vs. Third-Party Ink Cartridges</strong>","When buying an all-in-one printer, it’s good to know about the machine&#39;s ongoing costs. The biggest part of that cost is ink. You can visit <a href=\"/best-discount-ink-cartridges-stores\">discount ink cartridge stores</a> to save some money when it’s time to refill the tank. Most discount ink cartridge stores sell both OEM and third-party ink cartridges.","We asked Westover to explain the difference between the two types of ink cartridges. “An OEM ink cartridge is one made by the manufacturer of the printer. So, if it’s an HP printer it’s going to be HP ink. The alternative to OEM is third-party, which just means it’s made by someone else,” said Westover.","<strong>Refillable Ink Tanks vs. Refillable Cartridges</strong>","Some all-in-one printer manufacturers make models with refillable ink tanks rather than replaceable cartridges. We asked Westover about the benefits of buying a tank model. He said, “The biggest benefit with refillable ink tanks is that you’re paying for ink rather than the cartridge,” adding that, “More of your money is going to the liquid that lands on the page.”","Some third-party companies create refillable cartridges that are compatible with printers that don’t use tanks. Of those Westover said, “It will be cheaper – it may not always be as high of quality.” He emphasized that, “You don’t have the manufacturer’s quality control, and that’s part of what you give up in order to get those savings.”","Further, he said you can get away with cheaper ink if you print more text than anything, but it is harder to get away with when attempting to print higher quality images. “Ink isn’t just a liquid – it’s the end result of just as much engineering, if not more, than the rest of the printer,” said Westover.","<strong>Can You Use Expired Ink?</strong>","Ink cartridges made by printer manufacturers all have expiration dates. It works like any other expiration date, and if you choose to use expired ink, you run the risk of damaging your printer. Ink that’s too dry can clog the printer’s parts and cause flow problems, resulting in inferior print quality.","A good way to avoid this problem is to not buy more ink than you generally use. You may want to stock up to save time, but if you don’t use your printer very much, you could end up with nothing but expired cartridges when the machine runs out of ink. However, most printer ink cartridges expire about two years after they’re manufactured. So, it should be easy to figure out how often you should order more.<br/><strong><br/>Warranty</strong>","As with any expensive electronics purchase, you want to check out the warranty before you buy an all-in-one printer. Printers made by the four top brands almost always come with a one-year warranty. The exception is Brother – its printers have two-year warranties.","Although you can probably count on any printer made by these brands to go the distance with few problems, there’s always a chance you’ll get a defective one and have to exchange it.","Some printer manufacturers sell augments to their warranties with services such as HP’s <a href=\"https://store.hp.com/us/en/mlp/printer-carepacks\">Printer Care Packs</a>. These packs offer perks like telephone and chat support along with replacement parts and prepaid shipping for your printer in case it breaks down or needs to be replaced."]},"id":"4c6fec68-4cb6-4203-8d4c-6386e125bfd1","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/7Ps6tLtx8sUyTP446jGTQ5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/all-in-one-printers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9VL0ovNzg1MTc5L29yaWdpbmFsL0FsbC1pbi1vbmUtcHJpbnRlcnMtQ2Fub24tTUc3NzIwLTAwNC5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Ps6tLtx8sUyTP446jGTQ5.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"7Ps6tLtx8sUyTP446jGTQ5","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Ps6tLtx8sUyTP446jGTQ5.jpg","alt":""},"id":"0cda5b2e-7d5b-4e84-ab62-9ba21eacac68","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What Are Printer Drivers?</strong>","Just like a car, without a driver, a printer just won&#39;t go. The difference is that instead of a human driver, your printer needs a software one. Drivers are the bit of software that allows your computer to communicate with your printer. Most printers come with an installation CD with the necessary drivers. You should always install drivers before you connect your printer to your computer.","If you don’t have an optical drive on your computer, you can go to the printer manufacturer&#39;s website to download the appropriate ones for your model. Drivers periodically update, and you need to make sure you stay on top of them. Some may update automatically, but you should check every few months to make sure you have the latest drivers so you can take full advantage of all the features your printer has to offer.","<strong>What’s the Fastest Printer?</strong>","When we tested the printers in this category our top overall pick, HP OfficeJet Pro, scored the highest. It printed out black-and-white documents at 16 pages per minute and color documents at 20. When testing was completed we graded this printer an A+ for color print speed, an A for black-and-white and an A- for photos.","<strong>What’s the Difference Between Ink and Toner?</strong>","If you’re unfamiliar with printers, you may accidentally pick up toner instead of ink, or vice versa. Because ink and toner represent the major ongoing costs of having a printer, you should check which one your printer uses before you buy.","So, how do they differ? “The difference between ink and toner, primarily, is that one is a liquid and one is a powder,&#34; Westover said. &#34;Ink is used in inkjet printers, which physically deposit the ink onto the page. Toner is used in laser printers, where it is statically adhered to the page and then usually thermally bonded to the paper – slightly different printing processes, different physical characteristics, the end result being the same: letters on the page.” ","<em>Contributing Reviewer: J.

It includes a special, deeper black in addition to the standard black, cyan, magenta and yellow. The superior results in our tests speak for themselves.   \n   \nHowever, the ink setup and increased usage also make the printer more expensive to operate, and the ink costs more as well. All told, you’ll pay about 18 to 20 cents per page you print. The all-in-one printer with the lowest printing price was the Brother Business TK – it only costs about 2 cents per page. Additionally, the Epson Expression Premium XP-830 Small-in-One's paper tray holds only 100 sheets, so you have to refill it more frequently than other printers'.   \n   \nAnother trade-off is its subpar results when it prints regular documents. It scored a C+ in our test because we found ink spotting and alignment issues.    \n   \nAlso, this machine lacks several of the connectivity features we look for.
