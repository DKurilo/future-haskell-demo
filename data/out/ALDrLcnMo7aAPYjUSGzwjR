It also prevents children from typing these words into search fields and chat messages.

Because you can set up an account for each child, older children can be given longer time limits for school projects, online games or streaming videos.

Over the last 15 years we have tested and reviewed parental control software, including internet filters and <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-parental-control-software\">cell phone monitoring</a> programs, that offer great tools that lets parents to know what their kids are up to in the cyberworld.","As part of our research, we subscribe to news outlets and security bloggers that focus on internet security, online privacy and parental control, so we stay on top of the dangers lurking online and changes in the industry. We are interested in how well the tools of these programs help parents keep children safe online, and we enjoy the opportunity to thoroughly test these programs so we can give you good – and safe – internet filter options.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We tested each internet filter by downloading it to both out test lab computers and to our home computers used by our children. We tested the filter categories by purposely attempting to go to sites we knew fell under these categories, including pornography, news outlets, drugs and alcohol, and sites on suicide. For some of the filter categories, such as social media and online gaming sites, we waited for our children to try and access them during their allotted computer times.","It became clear that a program was effective when we heard the frustrating grumbles of kids as they tried to access blocked social media or gaming sites or when their allotted screen time was up and they were blocked internet access.","You can bypass the blocks on a specific website by entering the parent password. This lets kids access a site while still blocking others under the filter category.","We tested time controls in a similar way. We first set short limits on our test computers to get a feel of how each program works, then took the programs home to test in a family environment. All the programs let us block large chunks of time and those with individual profiles let us set time limits for each child. The programs notified kids when their time was up and blocked them from accessing the internet afterwards.","We were really impressed with Qustodio’s time controls because it could both block out times when children couldn’t be online, such as during school hours, and also set a time limit once they were online.","<strong>What to Look for in Internet Filtering Software</strong>","Blocking and Filtering<br/>When we tested internet filter software, we looked at exactly what each program blocked. This included the number of filter categories, if websites slipped through the cracks and if the program included a blacklist where we could add specific site URLs to block. We gave extra credit to programs, such as <a href=\"/spyagent-review\">SpyAgent</a> and <a href=\"/norton-family-review\">Norton Family</a>, that include tools designed specifically for tracking activity on social media and for blocking cyberbullying. Other programs have tools, such as screenshots and social media blocking, that can be used for similar purposes, but these require you to be more proactive for it to be effective.","Activity Recording and Parent Notification<br/>It seemed to us that anything a program recorded would also be reported to the parents, but we found this isn’t necessarily the case. Some programs only report the date and URL of a site a child visited by our children but don’t record more information than that. The best programs, including Qustodio, record and report in-depth information about how long your children are on specific websites, both sides of chat messages and words they search for in search engines. You can also see if your kids attempted to go to a blocked site and which activated filter category restricted their access to it. Some programs take screenshots while your child is online so you physically see what they saw during their computer time.","Notification is just as important as reading activity reports. We appreciated when a program, such as <a href=\"/mcafee-review\">McAfee</a>, sent us a text message as soon as our children attempted to access a restricted site. Other programs, such as Surfie, sent us email notices when our kids typed tagged words, such as “alcohol” or “home alone,” into search engines or in chat messages. Being notified quickly is important for stepping in and stopping your children from getting into a dangerous situation."]},"id":"3a212c5d-529e-4eae-b8a6-0ff36b539cdc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_344","url":"/best-internet-filter-software","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-08T19:55:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-08T19:55:00Z","name":"Best Internet Filter Software of 2019","synopsis":"The value of an internet filter relies on its dependability at blocking offensive websites and filtering content based on age-appropriateness.","review":{},"strapline":"The value of an internet filter relies on its dependability at blocking offensive websites and filtering content based on age-appropriateness.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-09T00:35:39Z","id":"ALDrLcnMo7aAPYjUSGzwjR","meta":{"title":"Best Internet Filters 2019 -
