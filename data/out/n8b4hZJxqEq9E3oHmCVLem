You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For vocabulary building software to be effective, it needs to engage you to the point where you are motivated to continue to improve your vocabulary. Vocaboly has more than 12,000 vocabulary words pre-loaded in the application, and you can add additional words if you choose. That said, its interface looks quite dated, which could be troublesome if you favor a sleeker, more modern look.","The Word Ticket feature of Vocaboly works like flash cards. This <a href=\"/best-vocabulary-software\">vocabulary building software</a> presents new words along with brief definitions, and you can scroll through the words and learn them at your own pace. There is also a multiple-choice section, a spelling quiz and a word recall section. In each of these sections, the software offers audible pronunciations of the vocabulary words.","The Vocaboly memory game seems old fashioned. It even uses the old Windows chimes sound effect when you get a correct answer. The Star War game is quite basic since you simply type a word to destroy it before it damages your ship. The Type Training and Spelling rounds of Star War don&#39;t really improve your vocabulary, because the definitions disappear too quickly. However, the Meaning Recall round requires you to know the definition of the words. Unlike some products, Vocaboly doesn’t offer word matching or sentence completion exercises.","You undoubtedly will like the fact that you can add your own words and create your own word lists. Vocaboly offers word lists for people who are preparing to take the TOEFL, GMAT, SAT or GRE tests. This application also includes the Voice of America (VOA) word list for ESL learners. The software includes first definitions, parts of speech, a sample sentence and pronunciations, but it is missing word origins, antonyms and synonyms.","Unfortunately, the only customer support you can get is through email, though there is a support forum on the website. However, you don&#39;t get a phone number or FAQs page.","Vocaboly&#39;s software is flexible. You get lists of words to prepare you to take standardized tests, and you can add words. Overall, this vocabulary software has a number of good qualities, but the interface is outdated and the customer support is severely limited."]},"id":"5f1fb6b1-e097-4ddc-a07c-859ad0338cbd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2433","url":"/vocaboly-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-05-24T19:03:00Z","name":"Vocaboly","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":73,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"n8b4hZJxqEq9E3oHmCVLem","meta":{"title":"Vocaboly Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Vocaboly provides 12,000 vocabulary words as well as preparation material for numerous tests.
