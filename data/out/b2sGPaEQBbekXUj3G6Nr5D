While print quality isn’t up to par with more powerful 3D printers, this little guy is still capable of producing fun models.","With a maximum print capacity of 4.6 x 4.2 x 4.4 inches, you won’t be building skyscrapers any time soon. However, for small toys, models and do-dads, this compact 3D printer has plenty of room. The software allows you to choose the quality of each print ranging from .05 to .35 millimeter, but we found printing higher-quality prints took far too long to be useful. This affordable 3D printer is best for draft-quality projects. The machine auto levels and calibrates before each and every print, which ensures your print is more successful than if you printed without calibrating first.","The Micro 3D printer is one of the best 3D printers under $500 because of its tiny size and simple structure. This plastic printer only weighs 2 pounds and is available in a variety of colors, including lime green, white, blue, orange and more. If you’re looking for a simply designed 3D printer without cords, wires and lots of moving parts, the Micro 3D is great. However, if you’re a more advanced user, you’ll mourn the loss of standard features like a heated print bed and an onboard screen. During testing, we found setup to be easy and uncomplicated, but we did run into some filament loading issues that required some maintenance. If you have the know-how and patience, this little box is a great companion for all your 3D printing projects.","The most unique aspect of the Micro 3D is the hidden filament holder underneath the print plate. Your filament sits below, completely out of sight, while you’re printing your objects. It’s incredibly convenient to never have to worry about knocking over a filament cartridge or getting tangles in the line. However, only tiny proprietary filament spools are compatible with the Micro 3D, so you can’t use universal cartridges from another retailer. The compatible cartridges are relatively inexpensive though, so they are definitely a value buy. While both PLA and ABS are compatible, since the print plate isn’t heated, you could run into warping issues when printing with ABS.","The included M3D software is very simple to use and perfect for a classroom or learning environment. It doesn’t have the functionality of more expert programs, but you can always import compatible files from other programs to print with the Micro 3D. The standard edition of the Micro 3D doesn&#39;t come with any filament, but the higher-priced retail edition comes with 220 grams and an extended warranty.","When you’re looking to buy a 3D printer, a major consideration is how convenient it is to use. A large downfall of the Micro 3D is that you can only print when tethered to your computer via the included USB cable. While other printers have Wi-Fi or allow you to print using a removable device, the Micro 3D doesn’t have such functionality. If you have a dedicated computer you can leave next to your printer for the hours it takes to print a part, it won’t be a problem for you.","The Micro 3D comes with a three-month warranty which is significantly shy of the 12-month warranties standard with most 3D printers. However, M3D offers plenty of support options on its website such as email and phone contact information, tutorials, and a manual to walk you through each step of setup and use. The Micro 3D has more support options than many of the best home 3D printers."]},"id":"e5587397-9742-436d-953e-7ff4fa55638f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91efd265-5681-4da5-a86f-46f3cbc7c856","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Micro 3D is one of the cheaper 3D printers we reviewed, it still has quality features and a very easy-to-use infrastructure.
