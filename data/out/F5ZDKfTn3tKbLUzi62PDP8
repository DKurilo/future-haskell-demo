Matter MOD-t has a unique design for such a cost-effective <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">budget 3D printer</a>. The completely see-through chassis lets you inspect your models while they print. You&#39;ll also find its Wi-Fi capabilities convenient and future filament purchases cheap. The MOD-t is perfect for making small, high-quality items and learning how to 3D print for the first time.","Resolution is a major consideration when buying a budget 3D printer. Saving on cost shouldn&#39;t equal skimming on quality. This machine has a 0.1 to 0.4-millimeter print layer height, allowing you to create both high-quality and draft models. You can also auto level the build plate so each 3D model has a solid foundation, starting with the first few layers. However, the print size is on the smaller end of the scale, with a maximum of about 6 x 5 x 4 inches for each printed item. If you&#39;re looking to make small models that are high quality, the MOD-t is an excellent choice.","This inexpensive 3D printer’s most unique feature is its chassis. The printing space is not only fully enclosed, it&#39;s also fully viewable. The transparent cover lets you view all angles of your model while protecting you and young children from the hot elements underneath. This plastic printer only weighs 11 pounds, making it very easy to port around your home or office.","While the MOD-t has many attractive features, you won&#39;t find a heated print plate or an onboard navigation screen on this printer. Without the heated bed, you can&#39;t print with ABS, and since it doesn’t have a screen, you can only control the printer via your computer or other device and a Wi-Fi connection.","The best affordable 3D printers keep your future filament costs low. The MOD-t is a PLA-only printer that accepts proprietary and universal 1.75-millimeter filament cartridges. New Matter provides two cartridge sizes and 13 different colors to choose from. Since this machine doesn’t require proprietary filament, shopping around for universal filament gives you the freedom to purchase more colors at prices that fit your budget.","This low-cost 3D printer has some advanced features not commonly found in such inexpensive machines. Wi-Fi capabilities are built in, so you can print straight from your computer or mobile device without any wires or cords. Traditional software isn&#39;t compatible with the MOD-t, as the controls are all in your browser. You log in to the website and control your printer from the cloud. Along with your printer shipment, you receive 500 grams of filament, maintenance tools and a USB cable. All these components make your purchase a great value.","This budget 3D printer comes with a 90-day warranty, which is considerably shorter than the 12 months offered on other machines.  An email address is available on the website for technical support, and New Matter also offers phone and live chat support. A manual comes with your printer, and FAQs and tutorials are available on the website."]},"id":"7b912125-fcc3-4fe3-9646-9d06245ba9b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aef210ec-40c1-4400-8c4b-4391ff5831e9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MOD-t is one of the best budget 3D printers because it has a cost-effective design and low-cost replacement filament cartridges.
