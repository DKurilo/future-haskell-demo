You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The ActiveForever Signature Walk-In A16762x is a <a href=\"/best-walk-in-tubs\">walk-in bathtub</a> with air jets, so it provides you a safe and comfortable alternative to a traditional bathtub and adds a massage to the experience. The safety features of this ActiveForever model include a grab bar to stabilize you as you get in or out of the bathtub and an anti-slip textured floor that prevents falls. The low threshold makes it easy for you to step in and out, but this isn&#39;t considered a handicap bathtub because the narrow door does not open wide enough for wheelchair access.","The built-in contoured seat in this tub is about 17 inches high, which is the ADA-approved height for walk-in tubs. This safe step tub&#39;s threshold is only 5 inches high, which is standard for walk-in tubs. It holds about 50 to 60 gallons of water, so it&#39;s a bit smaller than most similar tubs. What makes this tub different from the basic walk-in tub is the 18-jet air massage system. This aerotherapy system doesn&#39;t recirculate your bathwater, which makes for a more sanitary tub.","This ActiveForever model is available in white or soft cream, so you can choose the one that best matches your bathroom. You also have the choice of water jets for this tub, and either therapy system – aero or hydro – you choose comes with an in-line heater, so your bathwater stays warm throughout your soak. The heater also reduces the chills you might have while waiting for the bathtub to fill or empty. In addition to the air or water jets and heater, ActiveForever includes a shower rod curtain and an extendable shower head, so you can rinse off before or after your bath.","The cost of a safe step tub can be high, but this model is competitively priced, even compared to basic soaker walk-in tubs. Although this is a smaller walk-in tub than most at 54 x 30 inches, it still fits comfortably in standard bathtub alcoves.","The ActiveForever Signature has a sturdy stainless steel frame, and the tub shell is made of a high-grade fiberglass. There&#39;s a lifetime warranty on the frame, tub shell, door and door seal, so you won&#39;t have to worry about costly repairs later."]},"id":"e51af420-9983-410e-be37-6b1a4b13eabb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68019","url":"/active-forever-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
