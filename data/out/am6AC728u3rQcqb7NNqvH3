It’s also one of the most expensive machines we reviewed. With a more affordable price tag, it would have ranked higher in our review. While it’s comparable in many ways to our top pick, the <a href=\"/nordictrack-commercial-review\">NordicTrack Commercial 1750</a>, it has some notable upgrades, including its 22-inch HD touchscreen and its Runners Flex cushioning. Its full color interactive display is the largest we’ve seen, and its cushioning is the most versatile. Runners Flex allows you to choose either a soft, cushioned deck or a workout surface that simulates running on the road. This allows you to customize your training based on your personal fitness goals.","The Commercial 2950 has a self-cooling motor with an auto-adjusting drive system engineered for quiet, responsive operation. Some industry experts may consider its 4.25 continuous-duty horsepower overkill in the home treadmill market, but it’s one of the upgrades that distinguishes NordicTrack’s Commercial series from the competition. This treadmill also has a commercial-grade belt with a non-stretch, two-ply tread. Its running surface is 22 by 60 inches, and its 2.5-inch non-flex rollers are balanced and precision-machined.","The heaviest machine we reviewed, the Commercial 2950 weighs 364 pounds. It outweighs the lightest machine in our lineup, the <a href=\"/lifespan-tr4000i-review\">LifeSpan TR4000i</a>, by 138 pounds. Interestingly, the LifeSpan treadmill can accommodate a maximum user weight of 350 pounds, but the Commercial 2950’s maximum user weight is only 300 pounds.","The Commercial 2950 measures 72.25 x 34 x 61 inches (length, width and height) and features NordicTrack’s SpaceSaver Design with EasyLift Assist. This means it lifts and folds easily with the assistance of a hydraulic shock. It accommodates a maximum exercise speed of 12 mph and has a both a 15 percent incline and a three percent decline. Providing this negative grade is unique to higher-end NordicTrack and ProForm treadmills, both of which are brands of Icon Fitness.","Like the NordicTrack Commercial 1750, the <a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm SMART Pro 5000</a> and the <a href=\"/proform-smart-pro-9000-review\">ProForm SMART Pro 9000</a>, the Commercial 2950 comes with a one-year membership to iFit. This connectivity allows you to live-stream thousands of studio workouts to the machine’s console, run anywhere in the world with Google Maps and receive coaching from world-class trainers. Because you can create up to four user profiles with each membership, the Commercial 2950 is ideal for family use.","If you’re looking for customizable preprogrammed workouts, the Commercial 2950 has 40 onboard and provides real-time performance stat tracking. You can monitor your heart rate with EKG grip pulses, and a NordicTrack iFit Bluetooth Chest Strap is included with your purchase.","Additional features of the Commercial 2950 include an integrated accessory tray, dual workout fans, an auxiliary music port and two digitally amplified speakers. NordicTrack covers the frame and motor for a lifetime, parts and electronics for five years and labor for two years. Customer service is available by phone and live chat."]},"id":"ac28868c-4074-487e-a70f-778748c8724e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70011","url":"/nordictrack-commercial-2950-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-04T19:47:44Z","datePublished":"2018-06-04T19:47:44Z","name":"NordicTrack Commercial 2950","synopsis":"The NordicTrack Commercial 2950 is one of the most impressive treadmills on the home fitness market.
