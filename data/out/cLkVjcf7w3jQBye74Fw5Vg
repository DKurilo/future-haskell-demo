It has many desirable features, earns high consumer ratings and is competitively priced. Along with comfort, performance and durability, it also incorporates the perks of the <a href=\"https://www.ifit.com/ifit-membership/equipment\">iFit Coach</a> experience – workouts with elite personal trainers from around the world, including Europe, Africa and Australia. You can also enjoy 12,000-plus on-demand video workouts, Google Maps workout technology and real-time tracking of your personal fitness data. From high-intensity interval training to cardio and strength training workouts, you can select options designed by professionals to help you reach your goals.","The Commercial 1750 is powered by a quiet, self-cooling motor that delivers 3.6 continuous-duty horsepower. Continuous duty motors are considered a commercial grade standard, and they’re also the best quality motors available for home treadmills. Each machine we reviewed has one.","“CHP is a better indicator of motor overall performance,” we learned from <a href=\"https://www.lifespanfitness.com/\">LifeSpan Fitness</a>. “One indication of a good motor – and a convenient in-store test – is the ease in which it can pull a user from a dead stop.”","If you’d like to learn more about treadmill horsepower, rpm and electrical requirements, <a href=\"https://www.johnsonfitness.com/blog/treadmill_drive_motors_and_the_question_of_horsepower/\">Johnson Fitness sent us a great article</a>.","Like nine of the 10 treadmills we evaluated, the Commercial 1750 has a space-saving folding design. It lifts and folds with a telescoping shock for convenient storage when not in use. The machine itself weighs 310 pounds and measures 72.25 x 34 x 61 inches (length, width and height). It can accommodate users weighing up to 300 pounds, but it’s usually a good idea to think lighter. NordicTrack customer service told us that treadmills last longer if you don’t max them out. It’s typically smart to choose a machine with a weight limit at least 50 pounds above the weight of the heaviest person who will use it.","It’s also important to think about incline and speed. The Commercial 1750’s maximum speed is 12 mph, and it has incline settings ranging from 15 to -3 percent. Having both incline and decline options gives you the advantages of both uphill and downhill exercise and enhances your experience as you run or walk trails charted by Google Maps. This lets you tone different muscle groups and can keep your workout more interesting.","Along with its streaming workout programs, the Commercial 1750 has 38 pre-programmed workouts, and you can store up to four individual user IDs. This machine has one-touch controls with an EKG grip pulse, and an iFit Bluetooth chest strap is included.","The running surface is 22 inches by 60 inches, and its high-quality two-ply belt rotates over 2.5-inch precision-machined rollers. The machine’s belt is made of non-stretch material, and its deck has adjustable shock absorption. This means you can select either a cushioned exercise surface designed to be easy on your joints or choose one that simulates running on the road.","For added convenience and comfort, the Commercial 1750 has dual workout fans you can adjust based on the intensity of your workout. It also has an integrated accessory tray with an auxiliary music port, a tablet holder and dual 3-inch digitally amplified speakers.","The main difference between this treadmill and the more expensive <a href=\"/nordictrack-commercial-2950-review\">NordicTrack Commercial 2950</a> is the size of its display. Both machines have full-color HD touchscreens, but the 1750’s is only 7 inches wide, compared with the 2950’s 22 inches – which is by far the largest display in our lineup. Both NordicTrack treadmills we reviewed come with a one-year iFit membership. The <a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm SMART Pro 5000</a> and <a href=\"/proform-smart-pro-9000-review\">SMART Pro 9000</a> also include this benefit. NordicTrack and ProForm are both <a href=\"https://www.iconfitness.com/\">ICON Health &amp; Fitness</a> brands, and their treadmills have many similar features.","During a workout, the Commercial 1750 tracks fitness stats such as elapsed time, time remaining, calories burned and distance. It also monitors vertical feet climbed, speed, heartrate, pace and number of loops around a quarter-mile track. Your iFit membership gives you added advantages of monitoring your daily activity level, nutrition and sleep. You’ll need to renew this membership annually after the first year.","NordicTrack backs the Commercial 1750 with a lifetime warranty on its frame and motor, five years on parts and electronics, and two years on labor. If you have questions or concerns with assembly or use, you can contact customer service by phone and live chat."]},"id":"a6d65605-e43a-43f5-9dd1-89c9d4efbf3b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58722","url":"/nordictrack-commercial-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-29T18:00:54Z","datePublished":"2014-01-29T18:00:54Z","name":"NordicTrack Commercial 1750","synopsis":"The NordicTrack Commercial 1750 is a consistent top pick in the home treadmill market.
