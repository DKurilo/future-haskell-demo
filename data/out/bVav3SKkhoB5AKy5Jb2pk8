It has a 30-pound flywheel and a 22-inch stride length. Like the <a href=\"/bowflex-review\">Bowflex BXE216</a>, it has multi-position handlebars with integrated controls that let you adjust the machine’s incline and resistance as you exercise. You can angle its footplate from 0 to 10 degrees, which gives the pedals customized heel support. Also, its moving and static handlebars are ergonomically placed, and they’re padded to help you find the most comfortable hand position. Some of our reviewers really like the cushy grips, but they weren’t a favorite for everyone.","“I don’t like the foamy hand holds,” said one of our testers. “I feel like they’d get gross. I think a plastic grip would be easier to clean.”","If you test ellipticals before you make a purchase, you’ll get a feel for your own design preferences. You’ll also be able to test fans, speakers, media racks and other features to find a machine you’ll enjoy using.","It’s also important to think about heart rate monitoring. Like each elliptical machine in our lineup, the E618 has pulse grips to help you keep your heart rate in your target exercise zone. It also comes with a wireless chest strap.","This elliptical machine weighs 210 pounds, with a maximum user weight of 350 pounds. The ceiling height you’ll need in your exercise space should be at least 21 inches more than the height of the machine’s tallest user. Like each elliptical we reviewed, the E618 has transport wheels. However, only one of them, <a href=\"/horizon-evolve-5-review\">Horizon Evolve 5</a>, folds for storage. The Horizon is also the only model we tested with no incline. By contrast, the E618 has a 0-to-10-degree motorized incline that can help keeps your workouts more challenging, realistic and motivating. It also has 25 levels of resistance.","If you like a variety of workout presets, the E618 has 29, and you can customize programming and store data for up to four users. Its console has dual screens and can be adjusted to the viewing angles you like best. The dual screens are designed to help you view workout metrics even when you’re using the media tray, but this design got mixed reviews from our testers.  Although the displays are illuminated, they are the smallest screens in our lineup. Also, you can lose your place as you look back and forth. At only five inches wide, they are half the width of the <a href=\"/sole-e95-review\">Sole E95’s</a> 10.1-inch display, and they aren’t touchscreens like the NordicTrack and ProForm displays we evaluated.","Like most of the machines we reviewed, the Nautilus E618 has Bluetooth connectivity. This lets you sync the machine and your mobile device with five compatible apps, including Nautilus Trainer 2, which provides free fitness tracking, and <a href=\"https://www.runsocial.com/\">RunSocial</a>, a popular running app that creates a <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mike-colagrossi/future-of-mixed-reality-how-augmented-virtual-worlds-will-collide\">mixed-reality workout experience</a> with runners around the world.","The E618 is warrantied with 15/5/5/2-year consumer protection on its frame, parts, electronics and labor. This elliptical’s dimensions are 73 x 27 x 67 inches (length, width and height). Nautilus will ship the machine to your home for $99 and offers a $249 assembly service. If you need help with DIY assembly or have other questions about your machine, customer service is available by phone and email. However, telephone support is limited to weekday business hours, and Nautilus asks you to allow up to two days for an email reply. If you’d like an immediate response, look for manufacturers like Bowflex, NordicTrack and ProForm who offer live chat."]},"id":"f6870c3f-b4b2-4972-ba1d-4fac287c2ad5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70057","url":"/nautilus-e618-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-27T18:29:13Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T18:29:13Z","name":"Nautilus E618","synopsis":"The Nautilus E618 is priced hundreds of dollars below comparably equipped ellipticals in our lineup.
