Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When you hear the term &#34;high definition,&#34; quality, clarity and visual impact probably come to mind. HD professional movies are flooding the market, which leads to the question, why is it limited to only professionals? The answer – it&#39;s not. With <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HDV camcorders</a>, you can make your own high-definition home movies. The Canon VIXIA HF S20 offers a basic HD camcorder solution if you want to make home movies that look just as good as the professionals.","The term HD means you will have a quality image, but there is still a lot of variation between the different camcorders. With this camcorder you get an OK optical zoom of 10x and a good digital zoom of 200x. We were pleased that it comes with an image stabilizer so you don&#39;t have to suffer from shaky cam syndrome if you don&#39;t want to. The still camera resolution is a little less than we would like, but it is still fairly good at 8MP.","There are three other factors that play into the final video quality of your film. The first is the focal length. The Canon VIXIA HF S20 has a focal length of 6.4-64 mm. This falls in the range of a standard lens. The LUX rating of the camera is 0.3, which means that you can record even using the light of a full moon. The recording speed of this HDV camcorder is 24 Mbps which means that the smoothness of the video is good, but we like to have 28Mbps for a smoother picture.","There are a few extra features with the Canon VIXIA HF S20 but not as many as we would like to see with a product of this caliber. It comes with a 3.5-inch touchscreen which makes it easy to navigate through the various menu options. We would have liked to see an embedded GPS so you can keep tag the locations of each picture or video. As for its physical dimensions, this HDV camcorder is 2.9 inches high, 3 inches wide and 5.5 inches long. It weighs 16 ounces, which isn&#39;t too heavy. Canon provides a year warranty with the product to cover any manufacturer defects.","The memory options with this camcorder are what disappointed us most. It only has an internal memory of 32GB, which isn&#39;t much when you are filming in HD. On the lowest video setting you can fit just over 12 hours on the device. There are two options when it comes to memory cards (and you will need one on with this camera); you can use an SD card or an SDHC card. We would like more memory so you don&#39;t need to continually change out your memory cards."]},"id":"8840f61f-fa31-41df-b624-c796fc250d8c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"95558111-a551-42c7-ba20-94f6e18007a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the <strong>Canon VIXIA HF S20</strong> doesn&#39;t offer anything we haven&#39;t seen in other HDV camcorders.
