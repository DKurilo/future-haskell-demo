It allows for easy sharing of encyclopedic-sized volumes of information between people, computers and other devices. DVD technology is an ideal medium for transporting, storing and sharing large digital files, including photos, video, music and other materials. Sharing the content on an unencrypted DVD is a fairly simple process for anyone with a basic understanding of a personal computer&#39;s operating system. However, copying a DVD that has encrypted technology requires the use of ripping or <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a>.","Let&#39;s say you want to copy a DVD to your computer&#39;s hard drive. Many people assume that making a backup copy of a DVD is as simple as inserting the DVD into a computer&#39;s slot-loading DVD drive and copying the contents of the DVD to the hard drive. What&#39;s far from simple is the divided <strong>legal opinion regarding the DVD&#39;s content</strong> if that content happens to fall under copyright laws. Many people assume it&#39;s okay to copy encrypted content as long as they legally obtained at least one original copy and are only making one backup copy for archival purposes.","However, others say that if you have purchased movies or digital content that is protected under U.S. copyright laws, copying that content is technically against the law, whether the content is digitally encrypted or not. A 2009 case presented before a U.S. district court resulted in Judge Marilyn Patel issuing an injunction that blocked the sale of RealDVD, an application specifically designed to block antipiracy measures on commercial DVDs.","While it&#39;s clearly against the law to copy and sell a pirated DVD, opinion is still divided on the issue of backup copies. Some have argued that the owner of a purchased DVD with premium content should have the right to make a backup copy to protect that person s investment in the content. A severely scratched or damaged DVD prevents the owner from accessing content they have legally purchased. Others have said that making even one copy entails the use of illegal pirating software and is therefore in violation of antipiracy laws, even if the person is using the copy solely for personal use and is not distributing the content in violation of copyright and piracy laws. Regardless of the controversy, it is both ethically wrong and illegal to make and distribute copies of creative content that another person or legal entity has protected under copyright provisions.","If you want to copy the content of a DVD that you have purchased to your hard drive and that DVD has no encryption, then it is a simple process to copy the content from the files to your computer using the appropriate command from your operating system. However, to copy a DVD that has been copy-protected with encryption to your hard drive, you will have to use a DVD ripper software tool. One free DVD ripper is DVD43 (version 4.6.0) or, the DVD43 Plug-in (version 1.0.0.5) for 32- and 64-bit Windows operating systems. A free version of similar software for Mac OS 10.2 or later is MacTheRipper (version 3.0).","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"bfcd0590-2853-4129-be6f-57188d9637af","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6062","url":"/backing-up-dvds-is-fraught-with-legal-controversy","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jan-fletcher","url":"/author/jan-fletcher","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jan Fletcher","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"JEjpFFYrmjEnxG2r6icv89","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-01T18:51:31Z","datePublished":"2011-06-01T18:51:31Z","name":"Backing Up DVDs Is Fraught with  Legal Controversy","synopsis":"DVD is an acronym for digital versatile disc, and it is aptly named because the DVD medium has proven to be quite versatile.","review":{},"strapline":"DVD is an acronym for digital versatile disc, and it is aptly named because the DVD medium has proven to be quite versatile.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-06-01T18:53:07Z","id":"6UBZt6KGYnxNn55wFPMKJM","meta":{"title":"Backing Up DVDs Is Fraught with  Legal Controversy","description":"Opinion is still divided over backup DVD copies for personal use."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:57:35Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FnKFTtE2KCZGQQ3z9fJPg4.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:35Z","mimeType":"","name":"6062-backing-up-dvds-is-fraught-with-legal-controversy.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6062-backing-up-dvds-is-fraught-with-legal-controversy.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:35Z","id":"FnKFTtE2KCZGQQ3z9fJPg4","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FnKFTtE2KCZGQQ3z9fJPg4.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Backing Up DVDs Is Fraught with  Legal Controversy","description":"Opinion is still divided over backup DVD copies for personal use."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FnKFTtE2KCZGQQ3z9fJPg4.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:35Z","mimeType":"","name":"6062-backing-up-dvds-is-fraught-with-legal-controversy.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6062-backing-up-dvds-is-fraught-with-legal-controversy.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:35Z","id":"FnKFTtE2KCZGQQ3z9fJPg4","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FnKFTtE2KCZGQQ3z9fJPg4.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Backing Up DVDs Is Fraught with  Legal Controversy","description":"Opinion is still divided over backup DVD copies for personal use."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/backing-up-dvds-is-fraught-with-legal-controversy","label":"","tags":[]}
