You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Solidoodle Press <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">budget 3D printer</a> has a large print capacity and very inexpensive filament. However, our test prints with this machine were plagued by an unleveled print bed and misaligned design. If you&#39;re willing to perform many manual calibrations, the Solidoodle Press could potentially be a solid 3D printer.","A large 8 x 8 x 8-inch print bed accommodates larger models than many comparable budget 3D printers. Using the software, you can also specify the print quality, which ranges from 0.1 to 0.4 millimeters resolution. Although the Solidoodle Press has calibration features, we found it difficult to perfectly level the print bed and adjust Z-height. This resulted in very few accurate 3D designs and many aborted prints.","The Solidoodle Press is extremely easy to install; all you really have to do is pop in the filament. All the right components are in place such as a heated platform and auto leveling. However, we found that the print plate on our test unit was slanted just enough to prevent the printing of any accurate models. The bed sat higher in the back of the printer where it was connected and lower in the front like it was sagging from too much weight. Since the bed only had one support connection, it was impossible to completely level the bed. The only successful prints we created occurred when we physically held the front of print bed up about a centimeter for the first few layers of a model.","This 3D printer design is not conducive to creating perfectly precise models with little user interaction. This might have been a problem unique to only a few Solidoodle Press units, but be advised that extensive modifications might be needed to level the print bed after many uses.","When you buy a 3D printer, future costs are important to consider. Since each filament cartridge adds up over time, you want to make sure you get the most for your money. While the cartridges may seem much more costly than those sold by competitors, they include much more filament, 900 grams to be exact. Many of the average filament cartridges only provide about 500 to 600 grams. Also, both ABS and PLA 1.75 millimeter filaments are compatible with the Solidoodle Press, and you can purchase universal cartridges from other retailers as well. For a cheap 3D printer, the Solidoodle Press comes with a lot of starter filament. You receive a 900 gram filament cartridge with your shipment, which is significantly more than other competing printers.","Soliprint is the free provided software, and while the program isn&#39;t super intuitive, it has many of the functions you need to scale models, change the print quality and control the temperature. A USB cable is provided since the printer can’t complete your models unless your computer is plugged in for the duration of the print.","A two-month warranty is provided by Solidoodle for the Press. There are also many resources available on the website, including email and phone support, a blog, tutorials, and an included manual, should you have any issues. If you order from the manufacturer instead of via a retailer or supplier, there is a three to four week lead time on top of the shipping time estimate."]},"id":"09098eb3-6c06-4cfa-83d1-ec3aadd31e9e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"12801dfd-283f-487f-8f9c-2ae165461934","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While this affordable 3D printer has some calibration and design problems, it&#39;s still a very affordable option for your 3D printing needs.
