This particular line is particularly memorable for the unique cabinet design that pleased customers affectionately refer to as the &#34;egg.&#34;","Like many other compact surround sound systems, these speakers do an excellent job with high frequencies. Not surprisingly, however, the lower range is more limited, bottoming out at 38 Hz. Other comparable systems may reach all the way down to 20 Hz. A sensitivity of 86 decibels also places this system on the lower end of the efficiency spectrum. These speakers will sip a bit more juice for the same volume when compared to other home theater speakers.

The curved cabinet structure helps to keep the chamber resonant-free, which improves the integrity of the sound produced. The non sequitur appearance is also trendy and attractive. The speakers are small enough to keep them out of sight, but you probably won&#39;t want to hide them. Unfortunately, this trendy cabinet design also makes the speakers top heavy and more prone to tipping over. The instruction manual included with the speakers advises against placing the speakers on the ground, as much for sound clarity as to minimize the potential for tipping over. The grilles are non-removable, but that is probably for the best. If the speakers do tip over, the grille will protect the drivers from damage.","These speakers produce excellent audio detail and flaunt excellent sound consistency at different volume settings. Audio junkies may note that the sound is somewhat restrained and find themselves longing for a more powerful system. Naturally, these speakers will sound best in a smaller room.","The setup process for wall mounting is a little bit complicated. The package includes the necessary wall braces, but you&#39;ll have to screw them in before you can mount your speakers. Wiring should be relatively simple and the speakers come with high quality binding posts that admit banana plugs and bare wires.","This home theater speaker system includes a five-year warranty on parts and labor. Electrical components like the amplifier receive warranty coverage for one year following the date of purchase from an authorized vendor.","Accidental damage and damage incurred during shipping are not covered by the warranty. Be sure to package the speakers well if you send them back for repair.
