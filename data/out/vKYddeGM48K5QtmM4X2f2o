They are known for creating innovative technology and high-quality products. The <strong>TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award </strong>winning <strong>Pioneer DEH-P4200UB</strong> <a href=\"/best-car-audio-systems\">car audio head unit</a> offers a wide range of audio options in a well-designed package. It doesn&#39;t have built-in Bluetooth, like the Kenwood KDC-BT645U and, unlike the JVC KD-A615, it needs an additional accessory to play satellite radio. Nonetheless, this is one of the top three best car stereo receivers we reviewed."]},"id":"0a8e91e1-4534-451b-ab9d-772939151e90","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"88ff96cd-e56c-4ead-bcfc-4479cee84a04","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For your listening enjoyment you can either put in a CD or plug in your MP3 player. The CD player supports MP3, WMA, WAV and iTunes AAC codecs, and it will play CD-R and CD-RW formats. While playing, the large Organic Electroluminescent (OEL) display will display the disc title and track list. You can plug your MP3 player into the car audio receiver by using the front panel auxiliary input or the USB port. If your iPod is connected through the USB port, it will charge your iPod, but you won&#39;t be able to control your iPod through the in-dash head unit unless you use the required CD-IU50 interface cable.","This car audio head unit also employs a feature called iTunes tagging. When using this feature, you can press the rotary control on the receiver and &#34;tag&#34; a song that is playing on the radio. This puts it on a list on your iPod (which needs to be connected in order for iTunes tagging to work) and later you can pull it up on your iPod and figure out what song it was and purchase it, if desired.","If you want to sync a Bluetooth device with the Pioneer DEH-P4200UB, you&#39;ll need the additional CD-BTB200 adapter. Once you get the adapter you can sync the receiver to your Bluetooth-enabled phone and talk hands-free. The adapter has a built-in microphone. You&#39;ll be able to hear the caller through your car speakers.","You can deter theft of your new car stereo by taking advantage of the detachable face plate. Removing the face plate when you are leaving the car unattended will deter would-be thieves from smashing your window. However, the DEH-P4200UB does not seem to come with a carrying case for the detachable front panel.","This car audio receiver comes with a remote control. This remote control only does simple functions, like control volume levels and select tracks or scan radio stations, which is good because you don&#39;t want to be fumbling around for controls while you&#39;re driving. The simplistic interface of the remote control allows for safer driving."]},"id":"d1c8f16c-585d-4365-b8e7-f363b7e3cee7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"cc99d0da-3e56-4cf2-a753-9194758948ae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Pioneer car stereo has a 24-station/6-button preset interface.

This should cover most, if not all of the radio stations you&#39;d want to listen to on your car audio system.","In order to listen to HD Radio or satellite radio, such as XM Radio or Sirius Radio you&#39;ll need an additional adapter.

A single DIN car radio can fit into a double DIN slot with the addition of a spacer, but double DIN radios will not fit into a single DIN slot. Please make sure your car is compatible with the DIN size you are purchasing.","Three preamp outputs, or preouts, can be found on this car audio head unit. While many receivers have built-in amplifiers, preouts allow you to connect to external amplifiers, giving you higher-quality sound backed with more power.
