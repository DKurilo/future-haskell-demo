Its MSRP of $84.95 falls at the midpoint of our testing price range, and it ranks fifth among our top 10 hair dryers.","This brightly colored, turquoise hair dryer would be easy to spot in a jumble of toiletry items. Like the <a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic Nanoe</a>, The BaByliss dryer uses nano titanium technology, which emits negative ions to close your hair’s cuticle and eliminate frizz. Nano titanium is a stable heat conductor that yields far-infrared heat to penetrate and dry the hair shaft from within so that hair dries faster with less damage.","The BaByliss Pro comes with a concentrator to help you create smooth hairstyles. It doesn’t come with a diffuser, however, so we didn’t test it on curly hair. Also, while titanium is good for thick, heavy hair, it’s not recommended if your hair is damage-prone. If you’re looking for a hair dryer with more accessories and gentler heat, the <a href=\"/remington-review\">Remington Pro Thermaluxe</a> is our first choice – and it costs less than $40.","The BaByliss dryer’s cord is 9 feet long to give you plenty of mobility while you’re drying your hair. Like every hair dryer we tested, it has a cord guard and a hanging ring, along with an ALCI safety plug. At 1.4 pounds, it’s not the lightest dryer we reviewed (<a href=\"/revlon-perfect-heat-review\">Revlon’s Perfect Heat Fast Dry Travel Styler</a> weighs just a pound), but its weight is comfortably distributed.","“For me, this one had the nicest balance of design and professional build quality,” our lab manager said during testing. “Someone seemed to care about what it looked like.”","The Nano Titanium has three temperature settings and two air speed settings. The dryer also has a cool-shot button, but in testing it didn’t blast completely unheated air with the button depressed. Its lowest temperature is 86 degrees and its highest is 177 degrees. Its air speed ranges from 21.5 feet per second on low to 30.6 feet per second on high. Its sound volume ranges from 75.2 to 80.6 decibels, making it one of the quietest dryers we tested. Only the Panasonic Nanoe and the <a href=\"/chi-review\">CHI PRO</a> are quieter.","One member of our testing panel thought the BaByliss Pro’s buttons were “clicky” and said its instructional markings weren’t clear, but another tester had a more positive experience.","“I like this one,” she said. “It’s a good size, it’s quiet and it’s easy to maneuver.”","BaByliss backs the Nano Titanium with a four-year warranty, which is one of the best warranties we found. (The Remington Pro Thermaluxe and the <a href=\"/conair-review\">Conair InfinitiPRO</a> also are covered for four years.) Customer service is available by phone and email."]},"id":"60a5b001-7c6f-4051-96e9-9889691cebe1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62776","url":"/babylisspro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-17T22:28:07Z","datePublished":"2015-02-17T22:28:07Z","name":"BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium","synopsis":"The BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium is a bestselling blower with a powerful, 2,000-watt motor, the highest wattage in our lineup.
