You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Roxio has been a first stop when it comes to CD and DVD burning for nearly a decade now. Their latest family of DVD copying software, the MyDVD series combines the traditional simplicity of Roxio’s burning programs with basic video editing features ideal for home movies editing and DVD creation or copying. Despite its presence on our <a href=\"/best-dvd-ripper-software\">DVD ripper software</a> review site, MyDVD 10 Premier isn’t solely a DVD ripper.  In fact, Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier is better characterized as a versatile multimedia suite.","Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier supports mainstream media file formats found on typical computer and handheld media players. Popular supported input formats on Roxio MyDVD 10 premier include AVI, DV, MPEG, VOB, Divx, MOV, 3GP and DVR formats. And for users with mobile devices, MyDVD 10 Premier supports converting video to formats for iPod and PSP playback (H.264, MP4, 3GP). DVRs are becoming ubiquitous in homes across the country for good reason. If you use your PC as a DVR or a Tivo subscriber, you can use MyDVD 10 Premier to burn TV shows to DVD in their entirety—and thanks to MyDVD 10’s editing tools you can even remove the commercials.","One feature that is sure to appeal more to family movie makers is a tool to build photo slideshows for DVD playback complete with music and transition effects. Please note that, in accordance with the law as specified under the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act), Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier does not decrypt copyrighted materials with DRM or other protection measures. We like the fact, that while Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier will not modify copyrighted material, it will permit the use of ISO DVD images you may have created with other programs.","For all but the greenest of newcomers, Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier is very user friendly. Some DVD rippers and burning software expects you to understand the intricacies of technical jargon. MyDVD 10 Premier subdivides its audio, video, slideshow and editing functions into tabs to avoid confusion. Copying a DVD, for example, is literally a matter of clicking “copy DVD,” selecting the appropriate disc drives and sitting back to relax while the process takes care of itself.","On the whole Roxio MyDVD 10 is a well balanced and intuitive program. Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier performed perfectly well on our test runs—upon playback the bitrate and resolution designations we assigned to burns and rips were reflected accurately. It warrants mention that users interested in converting home movies to Blu-ray or that want to backup HD video might want to look at another program. Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier does not have native support for Blu-ray. You’ll want to see Roxio’s more expensive multimedia command center, Roxio Creator 2011, for full Blu-ray authoring capabilities. MyDVD 10 Premier comes with the support network, community forums and knowledge base of Roxio. We had no issue addressing technical problems, licensing issues or finding helpful “how to” information on Roxio.com."]},"id":"d7e4c146-d77c-4ae3-a29d-7143a9914151","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Customization Tools"},"id":"8502334c-8bd1-47ff-be8e-81e7c8704103","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/> "]},"id":"6ef9afe4-cdf6-4df2-bf8d-34ead3969fd2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"65398ac5-4e52-4bce-8a64-d8c3f28fbe4d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MyDVD 10 Premier is an all around effective multimedia tool with an intuitive DVD ripper onboard.
