The closed cabinet is available in two color options and is compact, designed for tight spaces. It has all the connectivity options we look for, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Chromecast, AirPlay and a 3.5 mm auxiliary input. The 3.75-inch woofer and 1.75-inch tweeter are powered by their own 40-watt amplifiers that project danceable volumes loud enough for any size room in your house.","We tested the sound quality of each speaker we reviewed by wiring an iPhone into the auxiliary jack and playing lossless music files for a panel of evaluators. The Beoplay M3 received the highest marks for overall sound quality, vocal clarity and treble clarity. The panel was comprised of reviewers with a wide range of experience evaluating speakers. The fact that this speaker was the consensus best overall is rare for a diverse panel, and a sure sign that it projects the perfect combination of accurate and pleasant tones. One of our reviewers remarked, “The bass is poppin’ and the overall sound quality makes my ears feel like they&#39;re being wrapped in a warm blanket of music. This is lovely.”","The Beoplay M3 also has an intuitive app with the most comprehensive audio controls we reviewed. Choose from a list of one-touch room presets or customize the EQ curve with the TouchTone pad. The <a href=\"/sonos-review\">Sonos</a> app is the only other companion app we tested with comparable audio controls. The Beoplay app has an intuitive process for connecting the speaker to your wireless network. It only took a few minutes to connect a couple streaming services and sync the music. The app also has controls for turning up the volume from across the room. The only disappointing omission is the lack of voice control interaction with smart speakers.","The Bang &amp; Olufsen M3 looks as good as it sounds. There are two color options: black and a light grey color the manufacturer calls natural. The black speaker comes with a black aluminum grille and the natural one has an attractive wool grille. The manufacturer’s website has additional grey aluminum and black wool grilles available to customize the look of your speaker. The enclosure is compact and has physical controls for volume, Bluetooth syncing, playing and pausing music and a button to mute all speakers if it’s part of a multi-room setup.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay M3 is the perfect wireless speaker for audiophile-level expectations. It is easy to control with the app and has the best audio and aesthetic customization options. It’s expensive, but the build quality and sound quality are future proof."]},"id":"95cac66a-e0d3-4d50-858c-8145d8b9fe93","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70160","url":"/bang-and-olufsen-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-20T14:40:36Z","datePublished":"2018-08-20T14:40:36Z","name":"Bang & Olufsen Beoplay M3","synopsis":"This wireless speaker from Bang & Olufsen has an incredibly detailed sound stage controlled with the best companion app we tested.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"If you are serious about audio quality, the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay M3 is the best wireless speaker for less than $400.","pros":["The speaker had the highest audio quality during our tests."],"cons":["It doesn&#8217;t have voice-control capability."]},"strapline":"This wireless speaker from Bang & Olufsen has an incredibly detailed sound stage controlled with the best companion app we tested.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-08-27T00:00:00Z","id":"VGeSBoiw5fwt9xxkdmCXZm","meta":{"title":"Bang & Olufsen Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
