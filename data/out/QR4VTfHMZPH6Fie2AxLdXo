Unless you were sitting completely still, there was often some playback static. The sound was slight and only present occasionally, but we found it to be extremely distracting at times. After we settled in with the earphones and sat down to watch a DVD, the sound went away and the product performed well.  We recommend this model only for stationary listening, which almost defeats the purpose of wireless headphones.","We also found this model to be extraordinarily loud. The noise does help cancel all outside noise and can be very helpful when trying to tune out the world around you. However, when we wanted to turn down the wireless headphones, even the quietest volume setting was quite loud."]},"id":"441efcc2-f37e-4e7e-9c7a-7de998915dd9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"13fbc78f-0f56-4828-ba38-9ed950f32913","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Koss JR900 wireless headphones have rechargeable batteries. Simply connect the transmitter to the audio output device and turn on the wireless stereo headphones. The transmitter has five different radio channels that will allow you to flip through each to find the one with the best reception. Switching channels can allow you to manually find the station with the least amount of interference and produce the best possible sound quality.","The transmitter will connect to nearly any audio output source. Simply plug the source into the transmitter tower and the wireless headphones will automatically recognize the audio source. The transmitter does not hold the wireless headphones easily, but it does recharge the batteries. We liked the transmitter’s sleek design, but it wasn’t very practical.
