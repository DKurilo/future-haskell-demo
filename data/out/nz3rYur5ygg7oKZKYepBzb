You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The All-Clad brand <a href=\"/best-slow-cookers\">slow cookers</a> would look good on any kitchen counter with their shiny, stainless steel exterior, black ceramic insert and clear glass lid. These programmable slow cookers offer more extensive capabilities for setting cooking times than many other similar cookers.","There have been many reports of All-Clad slow cookers&#39; ceramic inserts cracking after very little use. This cracking, called &#34;crazing,&#34; is small, spider-like cracks in the glaze of the ceramic. Otherwise, the brand does a very good job of keeping food moist and cooking evenly.","You can program these slow cookers for up to 26 hours in advance of when you and your family will be eating. This means that even if you have a schedule that changes wildly from day to day, you can always be assured that the food you have in this slow cooker will be prepared by the time you are ready to eat. The large display and buttons on these units make programing easy.","Like some of the best slow cookers on the market, if your day runs late, the All-Clad slow cookers will change to its warm setting on its own, so you do not need to worry about it. Having a slow cooker with a timer can be a genuine asset.","They come with other features, too. This brand of slow cookers also comes with heatproof handles to protect your hands. The inserts and lids can be washed in the dishwasher, which is a real boon for anyone who leads a hectic life. These slow cookers shut themselves off, too, so you can worry less about it causing kitchen fires.","When you buy an All-Clad slow cooker, it comes with a one-year warranty that is typical in the industry. If you want a longer warranty, you might investigate the <a href=\"/cuisinart-programmable-review\">Cuisinart Programmable PSC-650</a> that comes with a three-year warranty on defective parts and workmanship. You also can check with the manufacturer if you have questions via email and phone. The All-Clad site does not provide you with an online user manual.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"e4f7f3a9-4b35-4d66-b0d5-73069e80af1d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66325","url":"/all-clad-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-23T16:21:48Z","datePublished":"2015-07-23T16:21:48Z","name":"All-Clad","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":53,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-23T16:21:48Z","id":"nz3rYur5ygg7oKZKYepBzb","meta":{"title":"All-Clad Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"All-Clad slow cookers are programmable and many other useful features.
