You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","In recent years, Boss Audio has focused more on in-dash DVD players, amplifiers and speakers than on <a href=\"/best-car-audio-systems\">car stereo</a> receivers, and it shows in the Boss Audio 752UAB. While it doesn&#39;t have all the features of the best car stereos, it&#39;s an excellent way to upgrade your factory-installed car sound system on a budget, because the power ratings rival those of more expensive car stereos. However, the audio quality and playback options are better suited to its price range.","The best feature of the 752UAB is the power output. The maximum power output is 240 watts, which is 40 watts more than most car stereos. The continuous power output is 80 RMS watts, which is also above average. This means that it&#39;s louder than most car stereos. However, higher volumes don&#39;t equate to audio quality.","The biggest downside to the 752UAB is the audio quality. It&#39;s good for the price range, but it doesn&#39;t compare to the best car audio receivers on the market, like the <a href=\"/sony-mex-review\">Sony MEX</a> or the <a href=\"/kenwood-excelon-review\">Kenwood eXcelon</a>. The pre-out voltage is only 2 volts, which means that the audio signal is among the weakest we reviewed. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio for the CD player, which has the highest S/N ratio of all the playback options, is only 50 dB. For comparison, the best car stereos have an S/N ratio well over 100 dB. This means that the signal is only 50 dB greater than any unwanted signals or noise outputted to the speakers.","The playback options are standard. In addition to the AM and FM radio stations, you can play music on CDs or plug music players and mobile devices into a USB port, though it can only support MP3 and WMA files from devices plugged into the USB port. You can play any music player through the 3.5 mm AUX port. However, you can&#39;t control any devices plugged into the AUX port from the dash as you can with the USB port. You can stream audio through Bluetooth from your phone, though. The only playback options it lacks are an HD Radio receiver and SiriusXM satellite radio compatibility.","The smartphone integration is below average. The 752UAB comes with a Boss Audio app designed to expand the control features of the entire stereo, like the EQ presets. However, this requires you to access your phone while you&#39;re driving, which we don&#39;t recommend. While you can stream any of your favorite internet radio apps like Pandora, it lacks control features for any of them. You can answer and end calls, but it doesn&#39;t have a caller ID feature. It also lacks a noise-canceling microphone, which means the call quality isn&#39;t very good. Your caller won&#39;t want to carry long conversations on it."]},"id":"138492d7-6538-4542-a5f8-f206cb68e52e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c30cdc94-9128-4263-b203-2613a9e6effc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Boss Audio 752UAB has good power ratings with a max power output of 240 watts and a continuous power output of 80 RMS watts, but the audio quality is only average.
