While lightweight enough to wear on a shirt or small harness, the body camera only features a maximum two-hour battery life, which is not enough for recording most parties, sports or events.","A built-in HD camera is capable of 1080p video recording at 30 frames per second or 720p HD recording at 60 frames per second. It also takes stills and features several special modes, including burst mode and time-lapse mode, with multiple settings for each; you can take photos two seconds to one minute apart depending on preference. You can also use the MeCam HD app to remotely snap photos using your phone, which is ideal for selfies, group photos and distance shots. An internal three-axis gyroscope stabilizes the camera while a low-light sensor automatically adjusts for different light levels.","You also have the option to turn the timestamp on or off. The camera&#39;s Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to sync with your phone over the internet. Outside, the device has a 50-meter Wi-Fi range, allowing you to take it some distance from your Wi-Fi source. The MeCam HD app allows you to control the wearable camera as well as set features and functions from your iOS or Android phone.","While lightweight, weighing only 2.5 ounces, the MeCam HD body camera does sacrifice battery life. Recording at 1080p with the Wi-Fi function on, you only get 60 minutes of battery life. You can extend battery life to 120 minutes by using 720p recording and turning the Wi-Fi off. The battery life is too short if you want to record most sports. This wearable camera comes with a clip bracket and detachable stand, a safety pin bracket, and a neck strap that allow you to wear it almost anywhere. However, it is not waterproof and not suitable for use in heavy rain or around water.","Lack of waterproofing, a short battery life and only two on-device buttons mean that it is not the best wearable camera for adventure sports. However, with quality video, light design and a versatile body, it works well for recording pieces of everyday life."]},"id":"f621aaf6-d591-48e4-978d-fd27258e3b31","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64259","url":"/mecam-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T19:35:04Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T19:35:04Z","name":"MeCam HD","synopsis":"The MeCam HD wearable camera can capture HD videos and still photo.
