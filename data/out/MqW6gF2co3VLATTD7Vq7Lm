In our tests, we had to reduce the size of one test photo repeatedly to get it to play on this frame. That was inconvenient compared to the frames that played everything automatically on the first try. A couple of our expert panelists wrote that this frame also crops photos badly, even cropping out the top and bottom of large pictures.","However, once all our test photos were in rotation on the screen, they looked really nice. One reviewer declared it had the best picture quality of the digital frames in our review, saying it had &#34;great colors&#34; and a &#34;good, crisp quality, no grain.&#34;","The internal gyroscope means the frame automatically rotates pictures to their most natural orientation â vertical or horizontal â as you turn the frame on its side. This adds to the frame&#39;s ease of use, especially since some of the frames require you to specifically tell them which way to display your photo.","You can also see your videos with this frame, which can be nice for sharing favorites with friends and family. You can also share videos on your smartphone, of course, but a more permanent place to watch them can be a nice addition to your home. The NIX X08D beats a small smartphone screen every time, and we were testing the smallest of this model. The sizes go all the way up to 18 inches, making it fun to watch your video and photo memories."]},"id":"c4ce3b15-1a3a-4bc1-84e4-70a7257b8d0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"User Experience"},"id":"21048a2a-08e0-41d1-aee3-6d64b831fac2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/kNqurMQBhdAc4RYRAQniqM.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The frame&#39;s motion sensor is very responsive.
