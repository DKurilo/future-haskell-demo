In this year&#39;s testing, we spent 85 hours using nine different programs. Our testers have backgrounds in photography and graphic design, so they were able to thoroughly evaluate each product using their previous experience.","As always, we created a fair testing environment for our photo manager reviews. To get additional insights beyond our testing, we reached out to Alex Brazeau with Corel PaintShop Pro to see what features the company found most important when creating its photo managing software. We also contacted Felicia Lee, a local professional photographer of 10 years, who gave us insights on her own photo manager preferences and uses. Quotes and details from these interviews are found lower on the page. Our purpose in contacting these individuals was to obtain unbiased information that could help us understand the best uses of photo manager software for both the experienced photographer and the novice.","<strong>How Much Does Photo Manager Software Cost?</strong>","The best photo management software will land between $50 and $100. Typically, the more expensive programs will include editing tools and sharing features in addition to the organizational tools, while the least expensive will only focus on photo management and might provide a few basic editing tools. You don&#39;t have to pay the most to get the best software for you. Look at what each program offers and determine which one fits your managing and editing styles best.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We took photo management programs that had high user ratings and then compared them against each other to see which ones were the best. We personally tested each of the programs in this comparison to better understand how easy they were to use and what photo organization features they offered. Our intention was to find software that was simple enough for beginners to learn while offering advanced features that experienced users and professionals could appreciate. We used the same group of photos on each program and tested their tools to see how many organizational options each offered.","We wanted to make sure that the programs we ranked most favorably were easy to use, so we gave each program a score based on how intuitive the user interface is. We awarded higher scores to programs that make it easy to share your photos directly to social media sites like Facebook, Flickr and YouTube. Programs that let you burn your photos or slideshows to CD or DVD also received higher scores.","While editing tools are not the main focus of photo managing software, it is important that you can enhance your photos as well as organize them. We tested each program’s color-adjustment, auto-adjustment and cosmetic retouching abilities to see how well each program performed. The ones that easily made good edits scored highest.","Here are some additional things to consider when looking for photo manager software:","<strong>The Industry Standard</strong>","We would be remiss not to mention <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html?promoid=Q75XPVHK\">Adobe Lightroom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/bridge.html\">Adobe Bridge</a> or <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.html?promoid=DJDWS&amp;s_cid=70114000002CfGJAA0&amp;s_iid=70114000002ChdJAAS\">Adobe Photoshop Elements</a> in this comparison. Their advanced organizing, metadata and editing tools set the bar when it comes to photo manager software. There are a few reasons why we didn&#39;t include these programs in our testing:","1) Since Lightroom and Photoshop are now only available in the Creative Cloud, you would have to subscribe for either a monthly or yearly payment to use them – a feature many users find off-putting. Adobe Bridge, on the other hand, is completely free to use. While definitely preferred by professionals, Lightroom and Bridge are designed to work in conjunction with Adobe Photoshop, which makes them more technical and gives them a steeper learning curve than the programs we tested.","2) Photoshop Elements, a simpler version of Photoshop, comes with additional photo management software. However, the program itself technically doesn&#39;t provide managing tools.","If you plan on using Adobe software regularly and you already know how to use it or don&#39;t mind taking the time to learn it, we still recommend it as one of the best options on the market.","If Adobe doesn&#39;t seem like the right fit for you, here are some additional things to consider about the programs we tested:","File Management<br/>When we asked local photographer Felicia Lee about photo management software, she told us that the most important features for her are organization options and editing tools: &#34;I need to be able to see all of my photos, have different ways to catalog and organize them. I need an easy, simple way to edit as well.&#34;","Managing your photo files definitely should be a simple, intuitive process. These programs allow you to view and edit metadata, as well as tag your photos in a variety of ways. Some programs have standout organizing features. For instance, Alex Brazeau, from Corel, told us that you can &#34;access Google Maps in PaintShop Pro’s Map Mode to view, add, and edit location information (GPS metadata) embedded in [your] images. You can then sort photos by location.&#34; The best programs also allow you to completely customize your organizing methods by letting you add new category titles and offering an easy search tool. Being able to back up files is also incredibly important, so look for a program that not only allows you to do this but also lets you schedule frequent reminders about it.","Sharing<br/>Being able to show off your favorite photos is an important part of photo managing software. The rep from Corel emphasized the importance of being able to share projects directly to social media sites: &#34;Having this ability helps a user become more efficient by uploading their images to their chosen platform directly instead of exporting, opening a browser, and then taking several steps to upload and share the same photo natively.&#34; We couldn&#39;t agree more; good photo manager software should be all about saving you time.","Most programs allow you to share photos directly to Facebook and Flickr. Some even allow you to make and share slideshows. If you plan on taking a lot of pictures and find yourself running out of room on your hard drive, keep an eye out for a program that comes with free online storage. While some companies offer cloud storage for an additional fee, there are many services that provide some storage to upload your photos for free.","Editing &amp; Extras<br/>Editing tools allow you to get the perfect look from your snapshots. As Brazeau told us, &#34;Having the ability to edit photos directly within your photo management software is a crucial feature because it allows a user to own, learn, and use a single program for all their photo management and editing needs. A comprehensive, all-in-one photo editor provides photographers of any skill level the tools they need make a minor edit or create complex composited photos.&#34;","Most programs make non-destructive edits, which means they make edits on a copy of your photo and save the original from changes. These editing tools can help you brighten a dark image, adjust the colors of your shots or simply crop your photo. Some programs even feature cosmetic tools for smoothing out blemishes in skin or whitening teeth. If you want to make the editing process easier on yourself, make sure to take the time to get the right settings and positioning on your camera to begin with. It will save you a lot of time later on.","Most programs will work with a variety of file types, but the file type you choose should depend on what you&#39;re wanting to do with your image. Brazeau told us why he prefers to use RAW files when making edits: &#34;When shooting RAW, a lossless file format, your camera records more image data than with a JPEG. This gives editors more freedom to correct problem areas in post-production, such as recovering blown highlights or adjusting shadows, which results in a higher quality final image.&#34; If you want to get the most out of editing your photos, you just might want to consider using your camera’s RAW format. RAW does take up more room on your memory card and hard drive, so stay aware of your storage capabilities.<br/><strong><br/>What is Metadata?</strong>","All image files have metadata – information that stays with the image wherever it goes and helps you catalog the visual information of your image. Exif metadata tells you the shutter speed, dimensions, resolution, exposure time and other camera information at the time you took your shot. More advanced cameras can even tell you which camera took the shot, what lens was used, what the focal length was and where the image was taken. This is incredibly helpful if they ever wanted to duplicate the shot or its settings. Metadata can be especially helpful for sorting your images or correcting information. You can usually add or remove metadata to your images, like the name of the picture, through <a href=\"/best-photo-organizing-software\">photo organizing software</a> or <a href=\"/best-photo-editing-software\">photo editing software</a>.
