You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Samsung’s HT-J5500W system is one of the few <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater in a box</a> systems that has wireless speakers. Featuring a built-in Blu-ray player that supports 3D video and support for Wi-Fi, you&#39;ll have access to hours of entertainment. However, its audio performance is slightly lacking.","The HT-J5500W frequency response isn&#39;t as wide as other systems, including the <a href=\"/jbl-cinema-review\">JBL Cinema 610</a>. It does have impressive bass that can hit the low end – 20 Hz. However, it struggles on the high end, reaching only 20 kHz. By comparison, our number-one pick, the Onkyo HT-S7700, can reach sounds as low as 25 Hz and as high as 50 kHz, nearly twice as high as this Samsung. This isn&#39;t to say that the Samsung&#39;s sound quality is poor; it&#39;s just not as impressive as other sound systems.","One major downfall of this system is its complete lack of HDMI inputs. You will not be able to plug in any additional devices by HDMI. Fortunately, it does have a USB port where you can plug in an external hard drive or flash drive for playing stored video and music or looking through photos. The system also has a built-in disc player that plays CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, including 3D discs. You can also &#34;cast&#34; music wirelessly by Bluetooth, or if you prefer, just listen to the onboard FM radio.","Each speaker has a colored label on its back that you match with various colored speaker cables that you plug into the corresponding spot on the back of the receiver. This makes setup extremely easy. One downside though, these speakers only work with the included receiver since their wires have unique connectors.","You can reach Samsung by telephone, email, social media and even live chat. This home theater speaker system has a one-year warranty if you need to get a speaker or the receiver serviced.","With Samsung&#39;s HT-J5500W system, you are trading convenience for sound quality. It isn&#39;t an impressive speaker system, but it isn&#39;t a bad one either. It does have some nice features like Wi-Fi support and 3D Blu-ray capabilities, but its lack of HDMI ports could be a turnoff for some."]},"id":"515776a8-be93-4031-ac61-cf23260e56a4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67346","url":"/samsung-ht-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-29T23:26:00Z","datePublished":"2015-10-29T23:26:00Z","name":"Samsung HT-J5500W","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":20,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-29T23:26:00Z","id":"KNN39z48d5bsxNBkCg6J5j","meta":{"title":"Samsung HT-J5500W Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Samsung HT-J5500W home theater in a box system plays Blu-ray discs and has apps.
