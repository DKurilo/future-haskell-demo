The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\"><em>top-load washing machines</em></a><em> here.</em>","The LG Large Capacity WT1101CW top-loading washing machine doesn&#39;t have the largest capacity compared to other washers we&#39;ve reviewed, but its 4.3-cubic feet capacity is still larger than many. With more room for laundry per load, you can save energy and time by running fewer loads.","This top-load washer is one of the few we reviewed where there were more wash options than cycles, but many overlap to give you a great combination of features. Of the eight wash cycles, you get convenient settings like a speed wash for a few items you need quickly and a tub clean cycle to keep your washer clean.","The nine options let you add an extra rinse or fabric softener. There&#39;s also a delay wash setting in case you need to take advantage of lower energy rates or an emptier house. You can set the start of a cycle for up to 19 hours later. There are also four soil levels and five temperature settings, including eco warm.","The control panel is on the front of the washer instead of the back, like on many other top-load washers. The front control panel is easier to reach and read than back panels. If you&#39;re worried about damaging it by spilling water or detergent, the worry is unfounded. The LED screen is waterproof, and all you have to do to clean it off is wipe it.","Some other additional features include vibration control, so you&#39;ll be able to install anywhere in the house without worrying about noise, and an automatic water level, which adjusts the water according to the load size.","In terms of energy efficiency, this top loader isn&#39;t the best of all the Energy Star-qualified units we&#39;ve reviewed, but it&#39;ll still save you energy and money. You can expect to pay about $24 on operating costs and 230-kilowatt hour of energy on a yearly basis. You also have the option to run a cold wash to save on energy.","This top-load washer has a one-year warranty on the overall machine that includes parts and labor. There is also a separate 10-year warranty for the motor and a lifetime warranty on the drum.","If you need to contact LG for help and support, you can call, email or use the website&#39;s live chat option. You can also troubleshoot any problems you run into by using an app or phone to transfer information from your machine to help and support. This process is as easy as holding your phone next to the machine&#39;s power button and following a set of simple instructions. You won&#39;t have to waste time trying to explain to a customer service representative what&#39;s going on, meaning you get faster and better troubleshooting."]},"id":"68edd45d-281f-475f-b847-8d2566feb272","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ceca517b-e2b3-4d1e-a843-65f8c9b61fa3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG Large Capacity WT1101CW top-load washing machine has a large capacity in its stainless steel drum.
