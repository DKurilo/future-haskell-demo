This <a href=\"/best-fondue-pots\">fondue set</a> stay true to the traditional way of preparing fondue, with fuel instead of electricity.","This set features a cast-iron pot, six color-coded forks, a stand and a burner. The set&#39;s design maximizes your fondue quality and makes cleanup easy. The stand elevates the reservoir above the burner, giving it enough space to properly heat the entire pot. The two integrated side handles give you a tight, secure grip when you transport the pot. Washing by hand is recommended for this specific pot, which is easy enough but not as efficient as putting it in the dishwasher would be.","Thanks to its cast-iron construction, this fondue pot retains heat well. Its colorful interior and exterior enamel are both durable, long-lasting, and resistant to chipping and cracking. The pot&#39;s ability to withstand high heats allows you to use it for all types of dips, entrees, hors d&#39;oeuvres, meats, hot oil and broths. It distributes heat evenly and has impressive heat retention.","This traditional fondue set is available in red, yellow, orange, blue and green. Having so many color options makes it easy for you to find a fondue set that goes well with your other small appliances and kitchen.","The six forks are color-coded, which helps eliminate confusion among your guests. It will be easier for you to keep track of which fork belongs to whom.","This pot isn&#39;t electric, so you have to spend extra time and money buying fuel or gel packs to heat the pot. However, you can use the stovetop to heat the pot, and it is also safe to put it in the oven. This may seem like a great alternative to buying fuel for the burner, but using the stovetop limits where you can place the fondue pot during a party. It also means that the fondue won&#39;t be constantly heated throughout your dining experience.","The Le Creuset Traditional Fondue Set gives you the vintage fondue dining experience, relying on a burner and fuel instead of electricity. It is safe to use in the oven, though not in the dishwasher, and its cast-iron construction is excellent at heat retention to keep your fondue tasting hot and fresh throughout a party."]},"id":"7941b262-6f9c-4318-bd27-56f3b3e62f17","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61616","url":"/le-creuset-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-16T17:18:19Z","datePublished":"2014-12-16T17:18:19Z","name":"Le Creuset Traditional Heritage Fondue Pot","synopsis":"The Le Creuset Traditional Fondue Set is a good option for anyone looking to enjoy fondue the traditional way.
