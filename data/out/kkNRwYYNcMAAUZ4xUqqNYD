You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Aiseesoft DVD Ripper for Mac is a great application for copying the contents of your DVDs onto your computer. However, that’s only half the story when it comes to <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copy software</a>; the other half is the ability to burn that content onto a new DVD. Aiseesoft lacks any burning capability whatsoever. This is why it ranks so low in our review of the best Mac DVD copy software.","That being said, the lack of disc burning features shouldn’t make you reject this Mac DVD copy application outright. If you’re a gamer or prefer to watch movies on the go, this program may have a place in your dock.  That’s because this application creates comprehensive video and audio profiles that enable you to export to your movies onto gaming consoles and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.","When you’re selecting which content you want to copy from your DVD, the preview screen allows you to watch what you plan to rip. This ensures that you set your parameters correctly. All copy parameters can be manipulated through the main interface. They have even included video editing tools to make your rip truly your own, adjusting picture quality, trimming runtimes and cropping the picture.","The batch conversion feature does stand out. If you are behind on your DVD ripping, you can set up a queue and process all those DVDs in one fell swoop. Once you insert a DVD and it is scanned into the Mac DVD copy software, you can eject the disc and add another to the list. While this isn’t revolutionary, it is a nice feature to help Aiseesoft DVD Ripper step out from the shadows.","This program had a slight learning curve out of the box. Aiseesoft  combats this by providing help tips at the bottom of the interface. These tips give definitions and explain what each program feature is for. This is a great for those who are still learning the lingo of Mac DVD copy applications."]},"id":"aaab0c1f-7a83-40c3-aeaf-202bb857e46b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f5910447-2067-4762-aaf6-a7ae611fd70e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, if you’re not worried about burning your movies onto a new DVD, Aiseesoft DVD Ripper is worth considering.
