It has a patented vacuum technology that gives it more power than other robotic vacuum cleaners.

Its ability to pick up dirt and debris exceeds that of the competition, in part because of its cleaning pattern. It will make several passes over the same spot picking up everything in its path. The Roomba can even clean under furniture. It has an operating time of four hours, so it cleans longer than the competition before returning to its charging base. The Roomba can be scheduled to clean while you are away. You can schedule it to clean up to seven times per week.","The iRobot 760 is equipped with an automatic height adjustment feature that gives it the ability to adjust itself to clean different flooring types. It can clean hardwood, tile floors and throw rugs. It is not designed for use on high-pile rugs and does not easily roll over them. Be aware that its sensors do not function well when cleaning dark colors. The machine will go around rather than over dark pigments, so it won’t clean carpets with navy blue or black hues."]},"id":"02453ed8-b4b9-4c59-81bf-02ad5d7cf0ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"0bd8b81a-d451-427d-9704-c50cbb61f1f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/a7Fz9FcXjqZsSPAjgofXGL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"We like this cleaner’s built-in anti-tangle system.
