This smart home system gives you a simple, ingenious way to add some smart features to your home. SmartThings also provides responsive technical support at the touch of a button.","With much of the same functionality of other home automation systems, SmartThings gives you several ways to take control of your smart home. The user interface is easy to use and operates within either an Android or iOS smartphone app. These apps help the system stay simple but also make remote access using a PC or Mac impossible; luckily, smartphones are a better medium for this function anyway.","SmartThings gives you the ability to set simple triggers that work with many types of sensors and devices. For example, when the system detects a key fob presence by the front door, it will unlock a compatible deadbolt without the need for you to use a key. The triggers can also be activated manually, randomly or on a schedule. SmartThings is fully compatible with a variety of security system components such as cameras and alarms. SmartThings does not support home audio functionality with iTunes or Windows Media player at this time. SmartThings also does not have voice control or home security monitoring features.","The SmartThings Hub is a hardware controller that is compatible with both Z-Wave and ZigBee wireless peripherals. If you choose to purchase a SmartThings starter kit, every device in the box will be ZigBee-compatible. The system has Wi-Fi capability when plugged into a wireless router. SmartThings also works with compatible security systems and HVAC systems. Much like many of the other DIY systems in our review, SmartThings doesn&#39;t support Bluetooth, Insteon, KNX, UPB or X10 home control technologies.","The strong technical support for SmartThings provides you with helpful user manuals, FAQs, email support, live chat, tutorials and a user forum. The live-chat support is particularly amazing as you can access this support directly within the smartphone apps, almost like a text message. SmartThings doesn&#39;t offer telephone support. Installing SmartThings in your home is an easy task that doesn&#39;t require professional assistance."]},"id":"4a521ded-dd4d-43d5-9482-a51d258013cd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"964e295e-f80e-4961-a3b1-6d0f921779ba","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This intelligent home system is well designed and boasts a sleek interface on Android and iOS smartphones.
