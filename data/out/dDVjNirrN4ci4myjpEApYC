Panasonic chose bamboo since it is lightweight yet strong. This is an ideal material for a speaker, since you want a speaker cone that is both lightweight and strong. These bamboo cone speakers can reproduce every sound detail to better recreate the movie going experience.","The rear speakers are wireless. No more running long runs of cable from the front of your living room, under the rug, and ultimately to the rear speakers. Panasonic even has a 7.1 option available, although separate equipment is required to make this possible.","The built-in Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD decoders will also help ensure that you hear the movie the way it was intended.","One cool feature on the Panasonic SC-BT 100 is the built-in iPod dock. This is located right in the center of the main unit. This makes it easy to listen to your favorite tunes without the hassle of connecting wires or buying separate proprietary cables.","With the VIERA link the menu is displayed on compatible Panasonic TV screens making controlling the Blu-ray player, or your iPod even easier.","<strong>Summary of Reviews from Across the Internet</strong>","The expert reviewers were impressed with the built-in Blu-ray player and overall ease of use of the system. The iPod dock on the front was also noteworthy.","Users liked the superb picture quality provided by the Blu-ray player. The on screen menus also made controlling things like an iPod even easier. Setup was also relatively easy and straight forward.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Panasonic SC-BT 100 narrows the gap between lousy, low-end home theater systems and the ultra high end sound you can only hear in the movie theater."]},"id":"04cd717a-86bc-445b-88c0-91d675c366dc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_27359","url":"/panasonic-sc-bt100-24145-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-03-21T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-03-21T06:00:00Z","name":"Panasonic SC-BT100 SC-BT100","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":75,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-12-05T18:42:08Z","id":"dDVjNirrN4ci4myjpEApYC","meta":{"title":"Panasonic SC-BT100 SC-BT100 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
