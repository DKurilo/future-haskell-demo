Cuisine EGC-007 Maxi-Matic cooks up to seven eggs at once and can make soft-, medium- or hard-boiled eggs, as well as an omelet or two poached eggs.","During our testing, we had difficulty getting hard-cooked eggs with a completely cooked yolk that was firm throughout, with a somewhat crumbly texture, which is the desired result for completely hard-cooked eggs. Despite following instructions exactly as the user manual stated, our test eggs ended up with orange-colored, rather soft and runny yolk centers, although the whites were nicely firm. If you&#39;re in the market for a somewhat greater level of consistency in your hard-cooked eggs and still want an affordable machine, try the <a href=\"/dash-go-review\">Dash Rapid Egg Cooker</a>.","Our test eggs tasted just fine – if you wanted something that ranged between soft-cooked and medium-cooked – but they did not have the taste or texture of hard-cooked eggs. If you opt for this kitchen appliance, you’ll no doubt want to experiment with water levels to get hard-boiled eggs.","With this <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a>, you pierce the eggs with a tiny egg piercing tool located on the bottom of the plastic measuring cup that comes with the set. Unlike some electric egg cookers that simply provide a tiny, rather dull pin that can break raw eggs before you even begin cooking, the Elite Cuisine piercing tool is quite sharp and didn’t break any eggs in our tests. The piercing tool also comes with a cover so you won&#39;t end up pricking your finger on it.","After piercing the eggs, you simply add the water you’ve measured in the included cup according to how well-done you want the eggs cooked, position the eggs on a rack and push the power button. An indicator light will show that it is working. The machine turns off once cooking is done, but unfortunately there is no beeper or audible alert, so you&#39;ll have to stay near the machine and watch the eggs yourself. Our egg cooking took 12 minutes, but given the results we got, it seems we would need to try different water levels to get the machine to cook longer.","As a fun extra, this egg cooker comes in seven different colors or color combinations so you can find something attractive for your kitchen. At 7.3 inches wide and 6.5 inches high, this egg cooker is small enough to store without any difficulty on a kitchen shelf or in a cupboard. It comes with a limited lifetime warranty, and if a machine does not work properly due to defects, the company will repair or replace it."]},"id":"1fcb6683-6d25-4d16-87ec-62563aed3bff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69759","url":"/elite-cuisine-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-03-02T13:54:43Z","datePublished":"2018-03-02T13:54:43Z","name":"Elite Cuisine EGC-007","synopsis":"The Elite Cuisine EGC-007 Maxi-Matic cooks up to seven eggs at once and can make soft-, medium- or hard-boiled eggs, as well as an omelet or two poached eggs.","review":{"rating":70,"verdict":"The Elite Cuisine EGC-007 Maxi-Matic lets you cook seven eggs in various ways with oil or fat, offers a lifetime warranty and comes in seven color combinations to complement your kitchen d&#233;cor.","pros":["This electric egg cooker is easy to use."],"cons":["We had trouble getting thoroughly cooked yolks for hard-boiled eggs."]},"strapline":"The Elite Cuisine EGC-007 Maxi-Matic cooks up to seven eggs at once and can make soft-, medium- or hard-boiled eggs, as well as an omelet or two poached eggs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","id":"XhSuCSnMtTFrgeVRnvtQUj","meta":{"title":"Elite Cuisine Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Elite Cuisine EGC-007 Maxi-Matic egg cooker makes seven eggs soft-, medium- or hard-boiled eggs at once, lets you make an omelet or two poached eggs, and comes in seven colors."},"products":[{"slug":"elite-cuisine-egc-007","url":"/product/elite-cuisine-egc-007","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","name":"Elite Cuisine EGC-007","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","id":"WcXGMH5yZkTSpBVfUQQNAM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LzE4UFmnaLrgEwB9xCXfyd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"c05ae64c75845316f488b95d78224e8e.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/c05ae64c75845316f488b95d78224e8e.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","id":"LzE4UFmnaLrgEwB9xCXfyd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzE4UFmnaLrgEwB9xCXfyd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Elite Cuisine Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Elite Cuisine EGC-007 Maxi-Matic egg cooker makes seven eggs soft-, medium- or hard-boiled eggs at once, lets you make an omelet or two poached eggs, and comes in seven colors."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LzE4UFmnaLrgEwB9xCXfyd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"c05ae64c75845316f488b95d78224e8e.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/c05ae64c75845316f488b95d78224e8e.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","id":"LzE4UFmnaLrgEwB9xCXfyd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzE4UFmnaLrgEwB9xCXfyd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Elite Cuisine Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Elite Cuisine EGC-007 Maxi-Matic egg cooker makes seven eggs soft-, medium- or hard-boiled eggs at once, lets you make an omelet or two poached eggs, and comes in seven colors."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/elite-cuisine-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"specialty-appliances","url":"/kitchen/specialty-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","name":"Specialty Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:38Z","id":"pjGYR2Qzeeo67PAvh7vTML","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
