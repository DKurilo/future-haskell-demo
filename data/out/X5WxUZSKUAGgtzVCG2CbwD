You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The TRENDnet AC1200 <a href=\"http://staging.toptenreviews.com/best-wi-fi-boosters\">Wi-Fi booster</a> isn’t going to win any awards for looking pretty, but it’s an excellent value for the price. In performance tests, it proved to have an excellent range and an above-average throughput, so long as you’re close to it. For a medium-sized home, this is a good option for blanketing dead spots, though it isn’t without flaws.","Our colleagues at Tom’s Guide thoroughly tested the TRENDnet AC1200 in both home and office settings. They tested the range, the data throughput and the ease of setup. In these tests, the AC1200 had the second longest range with 150 feet. It also had the second fastest average throughput with a rate of 360.3 Mbps. However, the throughput was measured at 5 feet. The throughput failed to maintain as they moved away from the booster. At 50 feet, the throughput had decreased to 228.4 Mbps. This steep drop-off wasn’t nearly as apparent with other Wi-Fi boosters.","With a boxy white body, the design isn’t as sleek as most of the Wi-Fi range extenders on the market, especially the <a href=\"/eero-review\">Eero</a>, but it is very small compared to many boosters with this type of output. The tiny size allows it to plug directly into any wall outlet without taking up both plugs. You don’t have to worry about finding a desk or shelf for it. The antennas are adjustable, but not replaceable. That said, at its affordable price point, replacing ineffective antennas seems unnecessary.","The setup is straightforward and easy. As mentioned, you simply plug it into a wall outlet. Then you hit the WPS button on the side. This allows you to quickly connect to your main wireless signal. Then you use TRENDnet’s Setup Wizard to walk you through the rest of the steps. It sets up both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands at the same time.","One downside to the AC1200 is the single Ethernet port. This means you can only connect one wired device to it – a printer or a gaming console or a smart TV. Other Wi-Fi boosters for medium-sized homes have up to four Ethernet ports.","For a medium-sized home on a budget, the TRENDnet AC1200 is a good bet. Despite the steep drop in data throughput as you move farther away, the range is good enough to cover your dead zones, and the setup is quick and easy."]},"id":"67efb90f-53a0-43ea-8cea-4d8c00ed1d65","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54348","url":"/trendnet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-01-31T03:07:38Z","datePublished":"2012-01-31T03:07:38Z","name":"TRENDnet TEW-822DRE AC1200","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":27,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-01-31T03:07:38Z","id":"X5WxUZSKUAGgtzVCG2CbwD","meta":{"title":"TRENDnet TEW-822DRE AC1200 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TRENDnet AC1200 is a range extender with a tested range of 150 feet.
