You can choose among a variety of reloadable cards with either the Visa or MasterCard logo, but all of them include fees, just like any <a href=\"/best-prepaid-credit-cards\">prepaid credit card</a>.","Green Dot also offers a branded prepaid credit card through Wal-Mart. The Wal-Mart MoneyCard works in the same way as the other Green Dot prepaid cards, but it may have different fees and services, such as early direct deposit. Also, three of the ways you reload your Wal-Mart MoneyCard involve doing so at a Wal-Mart retail location.","The purchase price of this card varies by retailer, but it includes a monthly service charge, unless you load a minimum set amount or have a certain number of posted transactions within the monthly billing cycle. Comparatively, the monthly fee is lower than other prepaid credit cards.","Green Dot does not charge an ATM withdrawal fee for in-network ATMs, but terms and fees can change at any time. You can find a list of in-network ATMs on Green Dot&#39;s website. Other fees you may incur: when you check your balance at a non-network ATM, if you need to replace a lost or stolen card or when you want to expedite delivery of a card to you.","You can upgrade to VIP membership for an additional cost, which means you receive free ATM usage at any ATM across the U.S., and you are also entitled to free card replacement should you lose your card. VIP perks also come with preferred customer service support when calling Green Dot&#39;s help line.","You have the option of giving a second card to a family member or friend. Keep in mind that to activate this card, you must be at least 18 years old or have a parent or legal guardian on the phone to grant permission during the setup and approval process. The secondary card has the same account number as the primary card, so both cardholders have access to the funds.","With Green Dot, you have the option of choosing a prepaid MasterCard or Visa card. You can access your balance anytime and anywhere using Green Dot Mobile. This app is available for iOS and Android mobile devices.","You can load money onto your Green Dot card with direct deposit, a MoneyPak card or bank transfers. Some of these options are free and others may incur a charge.","Green Dot gives you the option of a Visa or MasterCard prepaid credit card, and you have several options for loading money onto your card. However, Green Dot charges several fees for everything, from purchasing a card in a retail store to ATM and reloading fees."]},"id":"f087dd13-5cf7-40ef-84c9-1f2e155ea9da","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54113","url":"/green-dot-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-12-19T18:14:30Z","datePublished":"2011-12-19T18:14:30Z","name":"Green Dot","synopsis":"Green Dot is a functional and easy-to-use prepaid credit card.
