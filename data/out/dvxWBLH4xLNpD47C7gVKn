You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The AAXA P300 features a strong mix of business-friendly features and home-user design elements that make it a multifaceted <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">mini portable projector</a>. Externally, the projector sports dimensions of 5.9 x 3.8 x 1.5 inches and weighs 0.97 pounds. The P300’s build quality falls in line with typical LED-based projectors, and in our testing, we found it to be a well-built and highly portable model.","The mini projector features a strong suite of connectivity options that appeal to business and home users. On the rear, you have choices like a full HDMI port for video output, USB storage support, VGA output and composite video connectivity. The P300 also comes with a compact remote that’s helpful when using the projector as part of a home theater system or in meetings.","During our testing, we found the P300 to be a value mini projector option with steady performance, though it is occasionally limited. In both dark environments and daytime ones with some light, the P300’s image wasn’t exceptional, but it was usable with consistent quality.","The P300’s marks in our benchmarking fell into a similar pattern, as it produced a color accuracy score of 25.2 in our testing. While not exceptional, the P300’s score was comparable to other midrange pico projectors. For reference, scores closer to zero are considered better and highlight how accurately the projector renders a range of colors. The P300’s onscreen brightness was also a slight step behind other comparably priced projectors in our measurements.","Elsewhere, the P300’s fan regularly ran noisily when we played video in our air-conditioned room. And while the projector comes with an internal battery, it’s not built for much besides light use, as it lasted for only 55 minutes in our testing. That said, its mark does fall in line with AAXA’s manufacturer battery rating of around 60 minutes.","AAXA offers a one-year warranty on the P300 and provides support through channels including phone, email and an online resource section."]},"id":"4fcb5f66-910f-4f3e-a342-90714fef237c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0266e889-90f9-4460-a184-175b12da6b06","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the AAXA P300’s age places it a step behind the best and most current mini projectors, it still has a lot to offer home and business users.
