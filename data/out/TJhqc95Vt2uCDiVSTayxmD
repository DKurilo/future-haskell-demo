The software operates best when viewed from the Recipes mode, though the Browser mode makes scanning and sorting recipes much easier. Editing a recipe is as easy as double-clicking the field to edit, and the tabs at the bottom of the screen display information better than any other program we reviewed. Users can view and edit which cookbooks, courses, main ingredients, sources and complementary recipes the viewed recipe can be paired with, as well as view user-specified nutritional information and notes or substitutions.","Also accessible from this view are various menus, such as print layouts, user preferences, cooking view and tools. The cooking view displays the recipe with larger text, but not so large that a user could keep his or her computer on the opposite side of the kitchen.","The Browser mode enables users to see the entire collection of recipes, sorted by cookbook (basics, casseroles, pickling, diabetic, dinner for one, and many others), main ingredient, course, cuisine/region or complementary beverage (varieties of wine and beer only). The Browser mode can also display duplicate recipes so users can view double-entered recipes and eliminate clutter from their collection.","Additionally, CookWare allows users to create and print cookbooks with specific recipes; a feature found almost nowhere else. This is a great way to store and hand down traditional family recipes, or to distribute collections of favorite recipes to friends and relatives.","Unfortunately, CookWare does not scale recipes to adjust serving sizes (according to the user guide, this is a result of its drag and drop functionality, though MacGourmet Deluxe offers recipe scaling alongside its drag and drop features), but the included conversions tool helps users to scale recipes by hand. The scaled recipe can then be saved as an alternate (with a slightly changed name, so it doesn’t appear in the duplicate recipes list), but this method does add a certain amount of clutter back into the database."]},"id":"33f162e4-9be4-4747-b7b1-0a8239594385","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience Tools"},"id":"70a9b677-1bad-41ee-965c-3f79a6416b2c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CookWare’s menu planner is viewed primarily on a monthly basis, though daily and weekly menus can be made and viewed individually. Daily meals include breakfast, lunch, dinner, AM snack, PM snack and dessert, and cannot be deleted or added to (unlike other Mac recipe software programs, which allow users to specify particular meals). Adding a recipe to a meal is as simple as clicking edit, then selecting a recipe from the database. Users can perform searches within the list to help find the right recipe.","Adding meals in this manner can be a bit tedious compared to MacGourmet Deluxe’s simple drag and drop method of adding recipes to a meal and meals to a menu, but the overall display method of CookWare’s weekly menu is generally more attractive and easier to read than that of MacGourmet.","Although the shopping list does not integrate with the meal planner, individual recipes can be added to the list; doing so adds all the ingredients in the recipe to the shopping list. Individual items can be added or deleted by the user as necessary. The Market List view categorizes all the shopping list items by type, grouping like items together and making shopping easier.
