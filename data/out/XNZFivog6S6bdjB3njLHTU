However, it is the only<a href=\"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters\"> VHS to DVD converter</a> in our review that doesn’t contain any tools to burn discs. All it can do is capture footage from your tapes and convert it into a digital format. You’ll need to buy separate burning software to complete the VHS to DVD transformation.","This program is relatively simple to use. The interface walks you through the VHS capture process, so there’s no guesswork when it comes to transferring your tapes to your hard drive. Once the capture process is complete, the program gives you the opportunity to trim away unwanted footage. However, if you want more control over your finished product, we recommend investing in video editing software, which has the tools you need to get exactly what you want out of your conversion.","Aside from its inability to burn discs, Elgato is missing several of the key features we look for in the best VHS to DVD converters. For example, it has no options to customize the look and feel of your video. Other programs allow you to add transitions, titles, outside audio and more to your project. These omissions are what kept this program ranked at the bottom of our side-by-side comparison chart.","During our testing phase, we transferred a VHS tape to a digital format using this product. But because it has no burning capacities, we used a third-party program to create a new disc. When our video experts examined the converted disc and compared it to the original, they found that the quality was comparable to the source footage. There were some slight problems with pixelation and minor distortion. The only time this becomes a problem is if you’re watching on a large high-definition screen. But that’s to be expected when you’re watching VHS footage in HD."]},"id":"fe57043f-e18f-445b-b949-d69edc539edc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"87973b28-8857-4b9c-8867-e954fd9664e7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Elgato Video Capture is a good tool for digitizing your old VHS tapes.
