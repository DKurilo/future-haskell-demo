We contacted manufacturers, professionals and industry insiders to get informed opinions and gather information that would lend more authority to our recommendations.","<strong>How We Researched Induction Cooktops<br/></strong>We first did extensive online research to find some of the best models available. We were looking for common features as well as those that set certain models apart. All of the cooktops in our lineup are 30 inches wide. We only evaluated cooktops that feature four burners; however, many of these cooktops provide a bridge element that allows you to combine two burners to create one large heating element. Induction cooktops are more costly than electric or gas cooktops. The ones on our lineup fall within a price range of $800 to $2,500.","After finding some of the best cooktops out there we continued our research, comparing features to determine which are the best for different types of cooking. Our findings are included in our side-by-side comparison chart and our in-depth reviews and will help you find the best cooktop for your needs. ","<strong>How Does Induction Cooking Work?</strong>","Induction cooktops provide faster and more energy-efficient results because they distribute the heat directly to your cookware, instead of to a burner that then heats up your pot or pan. The heating element or burner on an induction cooktop is an electromagnet, and when a magnetic metal such as your cookware is on it, it creates an electric current, which results in heat. This allows heat to be directly transferred to the cookware and its contents.<br/><br/>Pros &amp; Cons of Induction Cooking<br/>There are numerous benefits to this type of technology, but one great advantage is how quickly it heats up food and water in your cooking vessels. With an electric stove, for example, the electric coil must first heat up, and heat is then transferred to the pot. With induction cooktops, you don&#39;t have to heat up any coil – the heat is directly transferred to the pot. This makes these cooktops much more energy-efficient compared to its gas and electric counterparts. Furthermore, this allows you to quickly adjust the temperature of the element without waiting for the coil to heat up or cool down.","<br/>However, one drawback to this cooktop technology is that these products are known to be much louder than electric or gas stovetops. They can make a loud hum due to the magnetic currents, and the frequency of the sound varies depending on several factors, including the setting and the material and quality of the cookware you use.","Do I Need New Pots and Pans?<br/>Induction cooktops require special cookware. To use this advanced technology, you must be able to create an electronic current for the cooking vessel to heat up. Induction cooktops only work with cookware made with magnetic materials, such as stainless steel or cast iron. To ensure your cookware works on the cooktop, you can perform a magnet test. If a magnet sticks to the bottom of your cooking vessel, it&#39;s most likely to work well with your induction cooktop. If a magnet does not stick, you may need to invest in new cookware made from different material in order to use the cooktop.","<br/>However, if you are determined to use stainless steel cookware with your induction cooktop, remember that not all stainless steel is created the same. Some works better than others on an induction cooktop. It is important to use the magnet test before making any purchases to ensure the cookware will work.","<strong>What Else Is Important?</strong>","When searching for the right cooktop, there are several things you should consider, such as the size of cooktop you desire, how many burners you need, and even the design and finish of the product. Here are a few additional characteristics that you should not forget when looking for the right induction cooktop for your home.","Power<br/>Induction cooktops are just as powerful as any gas or electric cooktop. Most cooktops range in power from 1,400 watts to 3,700 watts of power. Furthermore, some of the best cooktops offer a power-boost feature. With this feature, the heating element provides maximum power to heat up your dish, whether it is boiling water or searing food, to provide the fastest and most powerful results. Products with this feature ranked higher on our lineup than those that did not.","However, on some induction cooktops, elements are paired together and share an induction generator. This means that neither burner in the pair can use the maximum amount of power. If one burner is using a high amount of power, the other element can only use the remaining amount. Cooktops that feature four induction generators scored higher in this area than those with only two.","Pricing<br/>You can purchase a basic, compact induction cooktop for about $350. The cooktops in that price range have two burners and a maximum of about 1,800 watts. The least expensive model in our comparison, the Frigidaire FGIC3066TB, was priced at $729 at the time of this writing. It has four burners and is full-featured with power boost technology and other nice features. It doesn’t have the power of some more expensive models, but it’s still a great option for its price range. If you want all the power and features an induction cooktop can provide, you’ll usually spend well over $1,000.","Installation<br/>Most induction cooktops drop right into your countertop. Aside from the product dimensions, you should also take a look at the cutout dimensions to ensure you have the right cutout space for it to fit properly. Induction cooktops&#39; energy source is electricity, and if you are installing a new induction cooktop in your home, you may need the guidance of a professional electrician to ensure the electrical circuit can handle the power of the product.","Design<br/>Induction cooktops are flat. They don&#39;t feature any type of coil or grate that you have to remove and regularly clean. These units feature glass or ceramic surfaces, and all of the ones on our lineup boast touch controls so you can easily and quickly adjust the temperatures and settings. The flat surface means there are no drip pans or coils for food to fall into, which makes it simple to clean. Additionally, because the cooktop itself doesn&#39;t heat up, you don&#39;t have to spend time every night scraping off burnt food.","Ventilation<br/>Even though little excess heat and hot air escapes from induction cooktops, odors, smoke and grease are still present, resulting in the need for a ventilation system. Range hoods, ventilation hoods and exhaust fans are all options. Few induction cooktops provide any type of ventilation system built into the device, so you will have to purchase a ventilation system separately."]},"id":"cb2a9cd8-6419-45dd-8845-ff5406f5c827","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_173","url":"/best-induction-cooktops","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-28T18:12:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-28T18:12:00Z","name":"Best Induction Cooktops of 2019","synopsis":"We evaluated 30-inch induction cooktops that feature four burners and cost between $1,000 to $2,500 (a reasonable price for this technology).","review":{},"strapline":"We evaluated 30-inch induction cooktops that feature four burners and cost between $1,000 to $2,500 (a reasonable price for this technology).","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-13T17:17:04Z","id":"Yd9RSworqNeLjCh3tih5mm","meta":{"title":"Best Induction Cooktops of 2019 - Reviews of 30-Inch Stove Tops","description":"We evaluated 30-inch induction cooktops that feature four burners and cost between $1,000 to $2,500 (a reasonable price for this technology)."},"products":[{"slug":"bosch-flexinduction-nitp068uc","url":"/product/bosch-flexinduction-nitp068uc","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","name":"Bosch FlexInduction NITP068UC","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"5acH3Nu2rKFQJ4FBPY5kaN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"frigidaire-fgic3067mb","url":"/product/frigidaire-fgic3067mb","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","name":"Frigidaire FGIC3067MB","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"ZfXAE5E3GQBHvuiW22zqUJ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"kitchenaid-kicu509xss","url":"/product/kitchenaid-kicu509xss","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","name":"KitchenAid KICU509XSS","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"7GbBh8aapn6BeMDjqcDExf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"ge-profile-php9030djbb","url":"/product/ge-profile-php9030djbb","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","name":"GE Profile PHP9030DJBB","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"27U6FyryKjaCHWeK7467r5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"wolf-ci304-c-b","url":"/product/wolf-ci304-c-b","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","name":"Wolf CI304 C/B","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"vqPNSturDiHoizasRPEirX","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6U6AoygvSuBad4VCzkkwwf.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Induction-Cooktop-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/7/J/823231/original/_Hero-Induction-Cooktop-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"6U6AoygvSuBad4VCzkkwwf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6U6AoygvSuBad4VCzkkwwf.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Induction Cooktops of 2019","description":"We evaluated 30-inch induction cooktops that feature four burners and cost between $1,000 to $2,500 (a reasonable price for this technology)."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6U6AoygvSuBad4VCzkkwwf.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Induction-Cooktop-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/7/J/823231/original/_Hero-Induction-Cooktop-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"6U6AoygvSuBad4VCzkkwwf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6U6AoygvSuBad4VCzkkwwf.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Induction Cooktops of 2019","description":"We evaluated 30-inch induction cooktops that feature four burners and cost between $1,000 to $2,500 (a reasonable price for this technology)."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"cooktops","url":"/kitchen/cooktops","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","name":"Cooktops","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:09Z","id":"jemnMYzb6AiSzYYFPLLdMY","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
