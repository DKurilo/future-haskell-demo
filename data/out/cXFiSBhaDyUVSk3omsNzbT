Whether or not an SEO product offers search engine submission doesn t tell the entire story. Their submission practices must also be evaluated.","Not all SEO submission tools are created equally.","An SEO product that includes solid submission features will save you significant time and money. The best products allow you to submit an unlimited number of pages to search engines and directories. And the top products do it with credible, white hat SEO methods that are approved by search engines. This way they safeguard your website s credibility and drive the kind of traffic you want.","In our SEO Software product review, we analyzed these eight sub-categories for submission tools: Search Engine Submission Tool, Article Submission Tool, Submission Website Locator, Submission to Directories, Submission Status Reporting, Automated Submissions, Manual Submission Options and Submission Tips.","<strong>Replicating Human Behavior</strong>","For SEO submission practices to be safe, they must replicate human behavior. If they don t, search engine directories regard them as spam and will even block the perceived offender s website IP address. If this happens to you, it s bad for your SEO.","Here a few black hat (bad guy) submission tactics that may give you a short-term spike, but will hurt you in the long run.","<em>Invisible keywords<br/></em> This is using hidden  invisible  keywords that can t be seen by the naked human eye. Theoretically, this optimizes keywords. But in reality, it can get you penalized. And if you re using keywords that aren t relevant to what the people who mistakenly land on your site are searching for, how does that help you?","<em>Keyword stuffing</em><br/>This is the gross abuse of keywords in an attempt to drive traffic to your site. Effective SEO copywriting is an art. Keyword stuffing, over-saturation and phrase repetition is clumsy, irritating to would-be buyers, and will get your site banned. <br/><em><br/>Using link farms</em><br/>We ve all seen these pages of irrelevant links on a website. The theory most often used by tiny companies, is that this will boost linking popularity and therefore site popularity. While a careful linkback strategy is good SEO, link farms are not. These send a negative impression to visitors. Again, why would they want to land on a site that s irrelevant to their search?<br/><em><br/>Repetitive submission</em><br/>This is a common pitfall those inexperienced in SEO can succumb to. It s also used by black hat SEO professionals. Once your site is being indexed, you don t need to repeatedly re-submit it. This is a waste of effort and is poor reflection on your website by the search engines and directories. There plenty of more beneficial ways to spend your time marketing online.","Remember these SEO submission pitfalls when choosing an SEO software product. And if you opt for a do-it-yourself approach to directory submission, remember to use caution and approach it the right way.","<strong>One More Interesting Note</strong>","It s interesting to note that across the board, the SEO products that received the lower scores from Top Ten RS do not offer search engine submission tools. This is a complicated subject and should not be dealt with lightly. SEO submission involves finesse and has a certain amount of risk associated with it.","For more on web marketing, visit <a href=\"/money\">TopTenREVIEWS  Search Engine Submission Services site</a> or <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">Top Ten Reviews  Online Marketing Services site</a>."]},"id":"5e686466-ab1e-4208-9b60-d40ce3a5b3df","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4505","url":"/search-engine-submission-pitfalls","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"becky-sheetz-runkle","url":"/author/becky-sheetz-runkle","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Becky Sheetz-Runkle","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"237HigvJqt9DW93qktfagF","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-15T16:56:56Z","datePublished":"2010-06-15T16:56:56Z","name":"Search Engine Submission Pitfalls","synopsis":"One of the categories included in Top Ten Reviews’ evaluation of the top SEO software companies was search engine “submission tools.” This is a tricky topic.","review":{},"strapline":"One of the categories included in Top Ten Reviews’ evaluation of the top SEO software companies was search engine “submission tools.” This is a tricky topic.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-13T22:56:45Z","id":"cXFiSBhaDyUVSk3omsNzbT","meta":{"title":"Search Engine Submission Pitfalls","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
