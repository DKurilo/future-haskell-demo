The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-audio-converter-software\">Audio Converter Software</a> here.</em>","From top to bottom, all of the music converters that we reviewed are straightforward and simple to use. Protected Music Converter is no exception. The main toolbar across the top has a button to import a single file and a button to import an entire folder. You can also start and stop conversions from the toolbar. You can easily import audio in just a couple clicks and get to converting audio just as quickly.","The reason you will find this audio conversion software at the bottom of our lineup is the limited number of output file formats and the technical difficulty we experienced while converting our WAV file to an MP3.","We tested every MP3 music converter by timing how long it took to convert a 625MB WAV file to a 128kbps, 44.1k sample fate MP3 file. During our test, we kept running into the same error. As soon as the file would get to 99 percent converted we would receive an error message, but the file would be in the output folder successfully converted. Our tests concluded that Protected Music Converter is the third-slowest converter available. This extra time will add up as you continually convert larger audio files to smaller condensed files.","Overall, this software is basic and exceptionally easy to use. You can achieve audio conversion, change the bitrate and change the output folder in a just a few clicks of the mouse. Your audio format and output path (where your converted audio will end up) are both clearly labeled below your input library. The layout is convenient and simple. You can also go into the settings and change the channel setup for your converted audio. In fact, this is the only software we reviewed that allows you to change the audio a 7.1-channel setup. This means that the audio can be set up to send certain frequencies to specific speakers in your sound system, to optimize your multi-speaker setup.","The one major advantage to using this audio converter is it&#39;s compatible with 45 different audio formats. This is tied with our number one product. The downfall is that you are only able to convert those files to MP3, WAV, WMA and OGG Vorbis. Other software in our lineup gives you many more file conversion options.","All of the products we tested were able to extract audio data from video files to some extent. Protected Music Converter was able to extract audio data from both M4V and MP4 video files, but was unable to extract the audio from MOV, MPG and WMV video files."]},"id":"e33652be-5831-41db-9ef8-e1d0953bf7a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f542034f-ee48-4b59-aab5-e67e7d205608","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although we experienced technical difficulties with Protected Music Converter, the software still comes with some benefits, like compatibility with many file formats and its ability to extract audio from video files – something iTunes can&#39;t achieve.
