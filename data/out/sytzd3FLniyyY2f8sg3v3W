You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","TomTom offers a world traveler edition of some of its navigation GPS devices. The Via 1505 M WTE is one such device. This means that the Via 1505 M WTE comes preloaded with maps of the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. This is great for vacationing or for the frequent-flying business professional. The small design and folding mount make it easy to pack away in your luggage.","The Via 1505 M WTE has a 5-inch touchscreen, and the body is less than one-half of an inch wider than the screen. The display is a plastic resistive screen that is not capable of multitouch and requires you to press the screen to make changes. The display also uses the standard resolution of 480 x 272 pixels, and is only capable of displaying in the widescreen landscape position.","This model includes a subscription to map updates for the life of your device. You can download new updates up to four times per year. This includes the accompanying maps outside of the U.S. The navigation system, however, does not include a traffic updates subscription. The device is compatible with traffic updates and you can purchase the antenna and subscription separately, but the lack of a free traffic update subscription is frustrating because even free apps on smartphones offer this service. Additionally, this car GPS unit doesn&#39;t have Bluetooth capability or the option to use voice commands. Those upgrades would have been useful in making this model hands free.","As a car navigation system, this device offers route options and the ability to avoid toll roads and highways, as well as the ability to recalculate your route automatically should you leave the designated route. You will also find a speed limit indicator on this GPS unit that will show the posted speed limit on most streets, and inform you when you are speeding. Additionally, this device is capable of providing lane guidance when approaching an exit or junction, and uses a realistic 3D view to assist you further in making the correct maneuver. However, this model doesn&#39;t have programmable routes, doesn&#39;t auto-sort multiple destination and doesn&#39;t provide an alternate route to avoid traffic without a subscription – a few of the more advanced features we expect in a model like this."]},"id":"6b913dfb-0d9b-4a68-a42d-68213a48e6f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cd17afe2-1c5d-4b0d-9979-2d007fd888a6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Via 1505 M WTE comes preloaded with enough maps to make the casual explorer and the business professional happy, but it lacks an included traffic subscription, which would be very helpful.
