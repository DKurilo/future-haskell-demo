It is, however, compatible with Google’s Project Fi. It isn’t revolutionary by any means, but it is a solid flagship <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> with a super bright LCD screen, headphone jack, expandable storage, AI-enhanced camera and Google Assistant integration.","<strong>Design</strong>","The G7 ThinQ is a tall, slender phone with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and 6.1-inch LCD display. It comes in four colors: Platinum Grey, Aurora Black, Moroccan Blue and Raspberry Rose, though the last two are only available from specific carriers. The display follows the full-front screen and notch trend set by the iPhone X, though you can choose to hide the notch with a black bar across the top sliver of screen instead. LG advertises its max screen brightness at 1,000 nits, but tests performed by our sister site, Tom’s Guide, found the actual brightness maxed out around 900. Still, that’s brighter than any other smartphone we tested by nearly 300 nits. This makes it easier to see and use in bright sunlight. It also has a higher resolution and pixel density than the iPhone Xs.","While the LG Smartphone doesn’t have any particularly stunning features, it does have fan favorites like a headphone jack, expandable storage and an IP68 rating. It houses a fingerprint scanner on the back under the dual cameras. The four buttons along the sides of the device are for power, volume and Google Assistant. While slightly more universal than the Samsung S9’s dedicated Bixby button, the Google Assistant button is similarly incapable routing to a different app. You can tap the button to summon the assistant or long press it to open Google Lens.","<strong>Camera</strong>","Like most other current flagships, the G7 ThinQ utilizes a dual-camera setup. It uses a 16 MP main shooter accompanied by a 16 MP wide-angle shooter. The G7 also employs what LG calls AI Cam, which recognizes what you’re taking a photo of and optimizes settings and suggests filters to get the best possible photo. In our hands-on testing, this feature was hit or miss, sometimes getting a great shot and sometimes taking forever to figure out what it was looking at. Even without the smarts, however, the phone takes good photos, particularly in low-light conditions.","<strong>Performance Specs</strong>","The LG G7 ThinQ uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, the same that’s currently running most flagship Android phones. It comes with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, with expandable storage possible up to 2 TB. It runs on the Android Oreo 8.0 operating system.","The phone’s battery life is rather disappointing compared to other smartphones we tested. We tested each phone’s endurance by continuously surfing the web over LTE while the phone was set to 150 nits brightness (about 50 percent). The G7 died after 8 hours and 35 minutes, while the <a href=\"/google-pixel-2-review\">Google Pixel 2</a> lasted over 11 hours. The LG phone could probably get you through an average day of use, but if you’re a heavy smartphone-user, you may find yourself needing a midday charge to keep you going. Thankfully, the G7 ThinQ is compatible with fast charging and comes with appropriate accessories. It supports wireless charging as well, though wired charging is faster.","Overall, the LG G7 ThinQ is a solid flagship phone with a good camera, super bright screen and Google Assistant integration. It’s inoffensive and easy to use, but it doesn’t have the same wow factor as phones from more-popular manufacturers like Apple and Samsung."]},"id":"d5ba128d-e3e5-43e7-87fa-6a0d196ab40c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70271","url":"/lg-g7-thinq-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-04T17:46:01Z","datePublished":"2018-10-04T17:46:01Z","name":"LG G7 ThinQ","synopsis":"The LG G7 ThinQ was first available in June of 2018 and is available from three of the four major wireless carriers, AT&T excluded.
