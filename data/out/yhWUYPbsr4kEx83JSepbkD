You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The MTX Audio FPR <a href=\"/best-car-subwoofers\">car subwoofers</a> have a shallow-mount design that allows you to maximize your space. Of all the subwoofers we reviewed, the FPR&#39;s 12-inch subwoofer has the shallowest mount at just 3.325 inches. Many car speakers have a bigger mounting depth. Such a shallow-mount design allows you to use a much smaller enclosure than most subwoofers require, which equals less space. However, one of the downsides is the shallow-mount design doesn&#39;t work very well with ported enclosures. To optimize the performance, you only need a sealed enclosure with .75 cubic feet.","The audio quality is very good, especially when you consider the shallow-mount design. You&#39;d expect that it wouldn&#39;t have good frequency response because it&#39;s not designed to shovel the air like the deeper subs, but it&#39;s capable of reaching down to 22Hz. Only the <a href=\"/pioneer-car-subwoofer-review\">Pioneer Champion</a> can reach lower. The bass is well rounded and lacks distortion, making this an excellent car subwoofer for the clean bass notes you hear in jazz, classical and reggae.","The only major downside to the audio is that it lacks the output capabilities of other subwoofers. With a very inefficient sensitivity rating of 83dB, the MTX Audio FPR subwoofer requires a lot more power to rattle your windows. For comparison, the highest sensitivity in our review is 96dB (<a href=\"/infinity-review\">Infinity Reference</a>), and for every 3dB increase in a sensitivity rating, only half the power is required to produce the same volume output. This means that the FPR 12-inch subwoofer would need 100 watts to produce the same volume as a 96dB-rated sub using less than 6 watts.","The continuous power handling is 400 watts, and the peak is 800 watts, which is average for a car subwoofer. However, since the sensitivity is so low, these power-handling specs don&#39;t give you a lot of room for pushing the limits of what this subwoofer can do. The FPR&#39;s 10-inch car subwoofer doesn&#39;t fare much better. With a sensitivity of 81.4dB and a continuous power handling of 300 watts, you&#39;re better off with the bigger subwoofer.","One of the best features of this car subwoofer is the five-year warranty. The industry standard warranty is only one year. As long as you don&#39;t try to push the subwoofer beyond its limits, you can have it replaced if the woofer wears out."]},"id":"dc18808c-e153-40c0-ba23-dbea247868e8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"74dd0442-6ec7-4221-8ee4-3f7fd1e1b436","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MTX Audio FPR car subwoofers have a shallow-mount design that is ultra-thin at 3.325 inches, which makes it a space-saving sub with a small sealed enclosure.
