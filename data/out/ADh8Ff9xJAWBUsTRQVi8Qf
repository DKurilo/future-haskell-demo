You can block websites, receive alerts of inappropriate activities, and review employees&#39; emails and chats.","<strong>Ethical &amp; Legal Considerations</strong>","You might worry that tracking your employees’ internet usage violates their right to privacy. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that it is legal to record employee activities while they are on the clock and when they are using company property. However, certain states have laws regulating what you must tell your employees about the information you gather. Make sure to check the laws in your state so you know what you are liable for and what you are required to tell your employees.","There are also ethical considerations when implementing this software. For example, since you will be recording keystrokes, you will potentially be recording employees&#39; passwords. If they are permitted to access private accounts, like email or bank accounts, during work hours, make sure they know the company retains all keystrokes, even the passwords they enter.","Some website monitoring software companies offer both transparent and stealth monitoring options. When you run the program in transparent mode, your employees can clearly see their actions are monitored. Stealth mode runs in the background, giving employees no indication that they are being monitored.","Companies looking to increase productivity, safeguard company information and data, or keep records of electronic communications for legal or other purposes should invest in internet management software. Doing so can protect your business and ensure a healthy workplace free of internet abuse, data theft and inefficiency.","If you are looking for even more protection – like, for example, your company is in the healthcare industry and must meet HIPAA standards – consider <a href=\"/money/small-business\">email encryption software</a> to protect highly sensitive information. And, while internet management software flags any suspicious emails, it is always a good idea to use <a href=\"/money/small-business\">antivirus software</a> to protect the health and security of your computers.","When you choose internet management software, you should take some or all of these factors into consideration. Being mindful of these and whatever legal or ethical concerns you are bound by will help you find the best software for your company.
