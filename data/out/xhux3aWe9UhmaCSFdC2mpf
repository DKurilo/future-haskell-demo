It was designed to have 50 percent less drag than other devices, to help save you time and energy in a race. It weighs just 2.1 ounces and has a small display so you won’t be unnecessarily slowed down. It even tracks multiple metrics and has decent battery life.","The Elemnt Bolt has all the features you need in a GPS-enabled <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-bike-gps\">bike computer</a>. It displays your speed, distance traveled, trip time, elevation and more in real time. You can also pair the Bolt with ANT+ sensors that can detect your heart rate, pedal cadence and pedal power, meaning you can monitor your stats in real time and ensure you’re working at optimum efficiency.","The Bolt is fairly easy to use. Initially, however, its buttons weren’t intuitive. You may even look at the three on the front and think they’re vents or speakers, as they don’t have any sort of label to identify them as anything. The small 2.2-inch screen has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels, but it doesn’t let you manually adjust brightness.","The Bolt’s software is also decently easy to use, though not quite as intuitive as the best bike GPS units. The buttons on the side of the device let you zoom in up to five times for easy viewing at a glance. The battery life of the bike GPS is rated for up to 15 hours. You can download the free companion app to get the device set up initially and to link it to external sensors.","You can also record and store up to 2,000 hours of your ride data, an impressive amount when compared to most other cycle computers. This makes it easy for you to review your past metrics and compete against them in future training sessions. One of the best benefits of the device is that it lets you download maps and sync ride data wirelessly, without ever having to sit down at a computer.","The Bolt can download new maps, letting you start riding quickly. Its unique Take Me Anywhere feature shows you a list of nearby trails and locations such as a restaurant or brewpub for a post-training celebration. Additionally, the Bolt’s turn-by-turn navigation guides you one step at a time toward your destination, making it easy to explore new trails without getting lost.","If you have a question about the Bolt, you can contact the manufacturer’s customer support team via live chat, phone or email, or you can peruse the few informational resources on the Wahoo Fitness website. The bike GPS ships with a one-year warranty in case there are defects."]},"id":"f3a2794f-6bf0-4ddd-88d2-ff9c5bafffcf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a83e2884-5148-4141-999c-6c6c11a06f66","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Besides its clean, aerodynamic design, the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt offers powerful metric tracking and sensor compatibility.
