This new design looks more like what you would see on many keypad locks and is slightly smaller than the original August Smart Lock. This lock comes with an innovative universal adapter plate that makes installation fast and easy. August also added a sensor to the lock that uses a magnet on or in your doorframe to tell if the door is open. No other smart lock maker has such as useful feature to boost security. August's mobile app is among the best we looked at. While August Smart Lock has some of the best smart home compatibility of the locks we tested, you need to buy the $79 August Connect before it works with a smart home system and allows remote access. Another concern we have is that August is a retrofit lock, so it's only as effective as the deadbolt you attach it to. The lock’s one-year warranty matches the industry average, but it doesn't compete with Schlage's three-year warranty.","<a href=\"/august-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"b74e1b4a-d640-4205-8db1-774d836ed756","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Z-Wave Lock"},"id":"13bcf40c-79c3-4a54-9740-ccab613bff5d","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/metiXUhAqUhrFQeoBYVGCK.jpg","link":{"href":"/schlage-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/J/T/738137/original/Smart-Locks-Schlage-Connect.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/metiXUhAqUhrFQeoBYVGCK.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"metiXUhAqUhrFQeoBYVGCK","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/metiXUhAqUhrFQeoBYVGCK.jpg","alt":"Schlage Connect BE469NX"},"id":"e08e4d80-c927-4dd1-b8d1-31d794b5cb75","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Schlage Connect BE469NX\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":90,"url":"/schlage-review","name":"Schlage Connect BE469NX","id":"336"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/schlage-review\">Schlage Connect BE469NX</a>","pros":["Unique alarm functions","Three-year electronics warranty","Z-Wave smart home compatibility"],"cons":["Remote access requires smart home system","No smartphone app","Must program codes by hand"]},"id":"55d800f5-d5f3-4e57-ba63-e093bfa68b0c","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Schlage Connect has two advantages over most of the smart locks we tested: It's the best Z-Wave lock we looked at and the fifth-most secure smart lock.","On the security front, we like that the Connect has a unique tamper alarm that detects lock picking attempts, not just forced entry like some other smart locks. The lock replaces your current deadbolt and meets standards for ANSI/BHMA Grade 1, which is the highest level of physical security a lock can achieve. It also has an auto-lock feature that locks your door after 30 seconds, but you need to activate it since it's off by default. Because the Schlage Connect uses Z-Wave technology, you need a smart hub to unlock most of its features, including remote access and smartphone control. In our tests, we used the Wink Hub and found the Schlage Connect worked better than the other Z-Wave locks we reviewed. You can program up to 30 key codes, though you must do it by hand without a compatible smart home system. As with most smart door locks, the Connect works for up to 12 months on four AA batteries. This lock comes in six finishes, more than any other model we tested, so it can likely match your existing décor. As with Schlage's normal locks, you get a lifetime warranty on the mechanical components and exterior finish.

While you can buy the August Smart Lock Pro as a standalone product, you're more likely to see it bundled with the August Connect, a device that adds remote access over the internet.

Considering this is already an expensive lock at $279, upgrading your deadbolt makes it even more expensive. The battery life on this smart door lock is shorter than other brands we reviewed, and the one-year warranty isn't great, but the smart home functions and easy controls help make up for that.","<a href=\"/august-smart-lock-pro-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"884a4c79-8fd0-4b9c-8878-57d7805646e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Latest News &amp; Updates (January 2019)</strong>","In September 2018, Yale announced <a href=\"https://www.yalehome.com/en/yale/yalehome/residential/yale-real-living/assure-lock/connect-august/\">Connected by August</a>, a module that’s compatible with the <a href=\"/yale-assure-sl-review\">Yale Assure SL</a> and the August Home smartphone app. The module comes with the August Connect Wi-Fi adapter and adds helpful features, such as DoorSense and compatibility with the August Doorbell Cam Pro.
