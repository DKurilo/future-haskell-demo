The CRKT Woods Chogan T-Hawk is a hardy, tomahawk-style camp axe with an impressive 19-inch handle that works for two-handed swings or one-handed swipes.","The design of this camping tomahawk would fit perfectly in any early frontier home back in the 19th century, but modern technology gives it durability and balance that&#39;s perfectly at home in the campsite of the 21st century. The 1055 carbon steel head is hot-forged to a 50-55 hardness. This is on the high end of average for axes. Further, CRKT flat-grinds the primary and secondary edges of the blade. The result is tree-splitting power able to take down Douglas Firs. Our testers found the axe not only had all-day chopping power, but, by choking up on the handle, they could easily shave, carve, and score wood as well.","The head itself lacks some of the nifty tools found with other camping hatchets on our lineup, but the poll has an excellent hammer head. With a more traditional, rounder shape, it provides excellent surface area and drove stakes and spikes and nudged logs and lumber into position with the ease of a light sledge. If you think your needs run more toward splitting wood than pounding spikes, you can find a similar model with a spike head that offers a narrow, double-bladed poll.","The handle is 19 inches of Tennessee hickory that makes for an easy swing, but not-so-easy packing into a backpack. In addition, our testers found that that the head loosened over time. When this happens, you can reseat it by holding the axe upside down and tapping the top of the handle against a hard surface. The handle is replaceable.","Weighing over 2 pounds, it probably doesn&#39;t qualify for an ultralight hike, but it is an excellent tool for camping, the family cabin or taking to a fur trade rendezvous. In fact, the overall shape and hickory handle make it perfectly at home with a coonskin cap.","The CRKT Woods Chogan T-Hawk has an optional leather sheath. While the sheath isn&#39;t included, it is worth the investment for protecting the blade. CRKT provides a standard lifetime warranty to the original axe owner, which covers materials and workmanship."]},"id":"5bae9618-3d07-41dd-b7f9-b7c869bc965e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68365","url":"/columbia-river-knife-and-tool-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T19:05:31Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T19:05:31Z","name":"CRKT Woods Chogan T-Hawk","synopsis":"Sometimes, you want a camping axe that's an axe.
