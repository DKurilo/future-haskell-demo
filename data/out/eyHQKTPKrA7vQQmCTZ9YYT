It doesn&#39;t have a color display, but it does have a large screen with adjustable contrast. There is plenty of storage for upgrades and applications, and it comes with an equation library. While it&#39;s useful for students and professionals, this calculator is permitted for use on only a few standardized tests.","<strong>Types of Graph Calculators</strong>","Finding the right calculator to help you solve mathematical and scientific equations in the classroom or at work depends on the features you might need. First, understand that these are different from scientific calculators, which offer an easy way of finding answers to basic equations. Scientific calculators typically have smaller screens than graphing calculators do, and they perform basic scientific notation, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions.","While the biggest difference between a scientific and a graphing calculator is the screen size, other features, such as graphing capabilities, color displays, and the ability to write and store algorithms and programs set graphing options apart from scientific ones. Graphing calculators can also be used for drawing scatter plots, calculating probability and creating tables.","<strong>CAS vs. Non-CAS Models</strong>","There are two different kinds of graphing devices available: Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and non-CAS. Both CAS and non-CAS calculators include advanced features that let you manipulate variables and solve equations. Some non-CAS versions, however, are suitable for only basic math problems.","One of the biggest differences in using these two types of calculators is how they display an equation. CAS calculators let you enter variables and then simplify them into a format known as Pretty Print or Natural Display. The result is a mathematical equation similar to what you see in textbooks. Pretty Print often makes an equation easier to understand for both students and teachers. Calculators of this type are also capable of evaluating symbolic expressions, making them useful for scientists and professionals. The addition of this capability also increases the price of the calculator. Non-CAS graph calculators display expressions in syntax format but are usually less expensive.","<strong>RPN vs. Algebraic Modes</strong>","If you use your graphing calculator or scientific calculator for advanced calculations, you may want a choice when it comes to the type of mode you use to input equations and functions for electrical engineering, chemistry, physics and even astronomy. There are two basic modes: algebraic and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN.) Most calculators use the algebraic input method, which uses the order of operations in a way naturally taught to students by professors in school.","Some, like the HP 50g, give you the option of using RPN. RPN makes complex calculations easier by removing the parenthesis and brackets in the equation. It then places the calculation in the correct order of operation. This saves steps and reduces the amount of storage space each calculation uses.","<strong>Online Options</strong>","<strong>What About Online Graphing Calculators?</strong><br/>A cost-saving alternative to a hand-held calculator is an online version. There are many available, both free and with paid subscriptions. Some, such as the Calculator+ app, are free but require a small purchase to unlock all modes, while others, such as Tydlig, have upfront costs.","One of the most popular free online options is the Desmos graphing calculator. Students, professionals and teachers can use this application on PC and Mac as well as Apple and Android devices such as tablets or smartphones. The application lets you plot tables, graph functions and find quick answers to equations. You can also create an account and save your past equations.","There are drawbacks to using a free or paid online graphing calculator because internet access is necessary at all times and not all are capable of handling complex equations. You also need a computer, tablet or smartphone when using the graph calculator online, and these are often banned from testing sites and in most classrooms.","<strong>Common Graphing Calculator Apps</strong><br/>Both CAS and non-CAS calculator graphing options, like the TI-Nspire CX CAS, the <a href=\"/ti-84-plus-review\">TI-84 Plus</a> and the <a href=\"/fx-9860gii-review\">Casio FX-9860GII S</a>, include apps that make learning, teaching and working easier. Some devices include NoteFolio, which lets you use the calculator&#39;s keyboard to take notes in any class and transfer them to Microsoft Word files. StudyCards is an app that lets you create digital flash cards for any class – even those not related to math or science. Many calculators also feature LearningCheck, an app that lets students and teachers create their own review questions and practice tests and share them with others. There&#39;s also the Spreadsheet app, which lets you analyze statistics using rows and columns and the eActivity app, which helps teachers create discovery-based lessons for their students. While many graphing calculator apps come preloaded, most calculators are compatible with additional applications.","<strong>Tips For Students</strong>","Many calculators provide similar functions, but not all provide those needed for every course you take in high school or college. Some, like the <a href=\"/ti-83-review\">TI-83 Plus</a>, are appropriate for courses like pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, business and finance, and AP calculus. However, other graphing calculators, like the TI-Nspire CX, TI-84 Plus or <a href=\"/ti-89-titanium-review\">TI-89 Titanium</a>, tackle the needs of these courses and are also better suited for geometric calculations, like finding the area of a triangle using Heron&#39;s Formula.","Some calculators work well for high school classes, but these may not always translate well into college classes. When looking for the best graphing calculator for your needs, pay close attention to what the calculator does. Basic options for high school courses like algebra and statistics may not offer functions for creating scatter plots, finding absolute values or basic graphing.","In addition to these capabilities, advanced graphing calculators offer other scientific and mathematical functions, like graphing derivatives, finding the min and max, and comparing exponential and power dispersion. These capabilities are necessary for advanced high school and college courses.","Before purchasing any graph calculator as a student, always check with your school and see what devices they allow in the classroom. Some schools don&#39;t allow certain advanced versions. Due to their popularity, many classes allow Texas Instrument calculators. Also, consider whether the graphing calculator is usable on AP tests or standardized like the PSAT, SAT, ACT, IB or Praxis. As of this writing, using the TI-83 Plus and Casio FX 9860GII S on the ACT and SAT is acceptable, but the TI-Nspire CAS and HP Prime are not permissible for most exams.","<strong>Tips For Teachers</strong>","When using calculator graphing devices in the classroom, teachers must understand how the calculators work.
