Instead, it has a specific microdermabrasion emphasis. We like the Neutrogena better than the other microdermabrasion system we tested – the <a href=\"/olay-review\">Olay ProX</a> – because the Neutrogena leaves less exfoliate material on your face after use, and its disposable Rejuvenating Pads are less abrasive than the Olay device’s crystal polishing formula.","As a microdermabrasion system, the Neutrogena is not a tool for daily skincare. It is designed to replace exfoliating scrubs and should be used only three times per week. <br/>The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System comes with an applicator, a month’s supply of Rejuvenating Puffs and two AA batteries. Its MSRP is $22.99, and replacement puffs cost $14.75 for a two-month supply.","Potential benefits of using this system include brighter, smoother and firmer skin, along with a reduction in the appearance of fine lines, age spots and wrinkles. You use the device by placing a puff on its Velcro applicator and then moistening the puff. It foams as you apply it to your face.","The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System is not designed for sensitive skin. If you’re worried about skin irritation, the <a href=\"/foreo-luna-review\">Foreo Luna Mini 2</a>, might be your best bet. The Mini 2 provides exfoliation without microdermabrasion and is gentle enough for twice daily use.","Regardless of your skin type, you should only use the Neutrogena device for a microdermabrasion cycle of one minute. Using it for a longer period can make your skin feel raw. Because it is waterproof, you can use this device at the sink and in the shower. After you’re done, you should rinse your face and the device with warm water and dispose of the used puff.","Our testers gave the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System a B+ score for user experience. While the Velcro that holds the Rejuvenating Pads in place has a solid initial hold, our testers wondered how well it would wear over time. Also, the handle may feel too small if you have larger hands. On the plus side, the device operates quietly, and you can tell a definite difference between its two speeds.","“My face feels softer and looks brighter,” one tester said. “The cleaner on the pads foams nicely on your face, and my face feels smoother after just one use.”<br/>If you’re looking for similarly-priced device with more attachments, the <a href=\"/etereauty-review\">Etereauty 5 in 1 Beauty Care Massager</a> is the best value. Priced at $24.99, the Etereauty comes with five attachments – two facial cleansing brushes, a larger body brush, a crude polish accessory and a pumice applicator.","Although the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System does not come with a formal manufacturer’s warranty, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Neutrogena’s parent company, told us by email that they stand by the product and will assist consumers if problems arise. Customer service is available by phone and email."]},"id":"c91261d0-b01e-4914-b008-6a1cfe54f91c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70246","url":"/neutrogena-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-20T15:50:29Z","datePublished":"2018-09-20T15:50:29Z","name":"Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System","synopsis":"The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System isn’t a traditional facial cleansing brush.
