According to NETGEAR, this switch was designed to help increase Ethernet speeds by up to 10 times over Fast Ethernet devices.","This eight-port <a href=\"/best-ethernet-switches\">Ethernet switch</a> features a plug-and-play design, similar to the <a href=\"/d-link-review\">D-Link DGS-1008G</a> and <a href=\"/tp-link-review\">TP Link TL-SG1005D</a>, so you can instantly start using this switch with any network. This switch comes in a durable plastic packaging and features eight, clearly numbered LED lights on the front that indicate port activity, power status and link speeds, while cables can connect to the back of the switch. These ports are meant to be versatile, meaning you can plug any cable into any of the ports. There is no set “source port” or “outlet port” that brings in more flexibility with this switch, particularly if you are worried about cables getting crossed or tangled.","This NETGEAR network switch comes in a compact package, making it ideal for desktop use or for mounting. The switch also comes in a fanless design that allows for quiet operational noise, while still keeping the switch from overheating.","If you run a small business that wants to expand their network, or are just looking to boost internet speeds for streaming and online gaming, then this versatile switch can help.","This network switch has traffic-prioritization features that manage data delivery based on data type and priority for fewer interruptions and faster speed. The switch also supports the latest IEEE standards and Energy-Efficient Ethernet, which lower energy consumption during light traffic times or when there is little to no activity detected.","This simple, budget-friendly switch also features non-blocking design and supports jumbo frames to help ensure proper data distribution and speed. NETGEAR also designed this Ethernet switch with an auto MDI/MDIX feature, which means there is no need for crossover cables.","Overall, this switch is compact and versatile and is an ideal solution if you don’t want to pay a great deal for a switch, especially if you need something compact to fit on your desk."]},"id":"833ace3e-788c-43dd-b899-dbbc6da3ceae","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66481","url":"/netgear-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-07T15:36:05Z","datePublished":"2015-08-07T15:36:05Z","name":"NETGEAR ProSAFE GS208","synopsis":"The NETGEAR ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Switch was designed to work with a variety of networking equipment and offers Gigabit Ethernet speeds.
