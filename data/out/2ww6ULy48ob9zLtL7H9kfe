Of course, this is ridiculously low compared to normal imaging. But those who know a thing or two about infrared cameras recognize that this is actually quite high. Infrared sensors are different from typical point and shoot camera sensors and simply cannot be made at higher resolutions without becoming exorbitantly expensive.","Many thermal imaging cameras combine standard digital photographs with their infrared images to supplement the detail of their low-resolution images. These images come from an onboard digital camera. While the primary purpose of these cameras is to provide supplemental images, they can also be used to capture regular photographs that provide some overall context of the scene. The resolution of the E60&#39;s digital camera is among the highest at 3.1 megapixels.","Focus type plays a large role in how you can capture images with an infrared camera. While similarly priced imagers have autofocus systems that take care of this for you, the E60 is strictly manual focus. Once you get the hang of focusing with your camera, this shouldn&#39;t be a big problem – just a small ding in the overall convenience.","The device&#39;s thermal image format, however, is the most convenient available, so perhaps the E60 makes up for lost ground here. While some cameras force you to use proprietary file types in order to save thermographic data, the E60 stores all of its information in radiometric JPGs. Unlike unusual proprietary file types, these files can be opened and viewed on virtually any platform."]},"id":"fd1683a6-4a3b-457e-a19e-e43e5b8278f6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Thermal Precision"},"id":"6d2868d8-4a5d-4a45-b318-0d0e6f5966aa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/urLqqzVYUanUBVrQpTL5sN.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60684-flir-e601.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/urLqqzVYUanUBVrQpTL5sN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"urLqqzVYUanUBVrQpTL5sN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/urLqqzVYUanUBVrQpTL5sN.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c73bf422-0567-4043-8b0b-4aa751509f12","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ability to accurately measure and represent temperatures is crucial for an infrared camera and is influenced by combination of factors. When evaluating infrared cameras, we focused on sensitivity, temperature range, accuracy and emissivity correction.","The sensitivity of an infrared camera refers to its ability to discern subtle differences in temperature. The E60 has a sensitivity of 0.05 degrees Celsius, which means the camera can distinguish temperatures that are only 0.05 degrees apart. No camera we reviewed has a better sensitivity rating than this.","Temperature range is the recommended temperatures within which your infrared camera can dependably operate. The recommended range for the E60 is -20 to 650 degrees Celsius – the second largest range available. While some Fluke brand cameras offer an even wider range of -20 to 1200 degrees, The E60&#39;s range should be sufficient for the vast majority of applications.","The final two influencers of thermal precision are accuracy and emissivity correction. These factors are secondary to range and sensitivity, not because accuracy isn&#39;t important, but because they&#39;re virtually the same across the board.
