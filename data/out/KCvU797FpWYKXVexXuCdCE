This handy application gives Mac users the ability to create backup copies of their DVD movies. All you have to do is insert the disc you want to copy into the optical drive, select what you want to copy and click Start.","The quality of the copied content depends on the type of recordable DVD you use. Nearly all commercial DVDs are on DVD-9 discs, meaning they hold 9GB of information. However, the majority of blank discs only hold 5GB. ImTOO understands this and has included a convenient button labeled Auto-Fit to Disc. Whenever you select this option, the application compresses the movie to fit onto whatever blank disc you happen to have. Just know that if you use this option, you&#39;ll notice some quality loss in the copied video.","When this application is done ripping your DVD, all you have to do is insert a blank DVD and the burning process begins. Once it&#39;s finished burning your DVD,  the application pops out the newly created movie. The software does the work for you, making it a good application for users of all skill levels.","ImTOO lets you choose which elements you want to copy, and it makes this process simple. This is especially useful if you want to keep some bonus features but not all of them. These options require little technical knowledge to operate, but if you&#39;ve  used a Mac before, you should be able to use the software without any difficulties.","There are three options on the main menu to choose from: Full Copy, Main Movie and Customize. Full Copy is a straight duplication of all the content found on the original DVD. Main Movie selects the longest video file found on the disc and leaves out things like special features and menus. Customize lets you pick the specific files you want to copy.","In our tests, it took ImTOO DVD Copy for Mac 90 minutes to create a new, uncompressed copy. The best DVD burning software completed the same task in under an hour, which kept ImTOO out of the top tier."]},"id":"27d54872-8fcf-46fa-9a41-133274d11c18","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"88c9a835-5c70-4122-9327-441544f059a1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ImTOO DVD Copy for Mac delivers on its most basic promise: burning DVDs.
