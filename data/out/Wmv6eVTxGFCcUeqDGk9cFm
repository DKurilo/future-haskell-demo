You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Philips goLITE BLU HF3429/60 Light Therapy Lamp creates blue light that matches the power and efficacy of a white light. It has a rechargeable battery and is compact, which makes it travel-friendly. This small light therapy lamp has convenient features, such as a variety of intensity settings and an app, that enhance your light therapy sessions.","This lamp generates blue light that has the same effect as 10,000-lux, full-spectrum white light, and you can use the goLITE BLU the same way you would any other <a href=\"/best-light-therapy-lamps\">therapy lamp</a>. It is usually recommended that you do light therapy sessions in the morning, as soon as you wake up.","Because the goLITE is so compact, it is easy to travel with and can stave off jetlag when you take it on the road. This light measures 5.63 inches tall by 5.63 inches wide, so it can fit in a purse or carry-on luggage. It also comes with a storage pouch for a little extra protection when you pack it, and it uses a rechargeable battery – unlike plug-in sunlight lamps, the goLITE does not need a power outlet to work. The battery lasts for up to 60 minutes, which is more than enough time for most morning therapy sessions.","This light therapy lamp has five brightness levels. It does not have a timer or a clock – you simply turn the switch on or off when you want to use it. If you&#39;d prefer a light that runs on a timer and automatically turns off, you might be interested in <a href=\"/lightphoria-review\">Lightphoria</a>. You can also download the Philips Energy Light app to figure out the best settings and set reminders for upcoming sessions.","If your sessions go longer than an hour, the goLITE has an AC adapter. The light works best when it can reach your eyes from about an arm&#39;s length away, but you don&#39;t need to constantly stare at the light source for it to be effective. You can prop the lamp up using the included kickstand and set it on your desk.","Blue LED lights have two unique benefits: They do not generate heat and are UV-free. Because this sunlight lamp doesn’t get hot, you can use it in bed. In addition, while the body absorbs some UV rays to generate vitamin D, they can also damage your skin. The goLITE&#39;s LED lights have the same benefits as traditional white-light therapy lamps but without the harmful UV rays.","The Philips goLITE BLU Light Therapy Lamp is a good choice if you travel a lot because it doesn’t need an outlet to run. This unit comes with a rechargeable battery and light settings that accommodate individual therapy preferences."]},"id":"aff47a19-e82b-46ba-9ca0-ad314409097e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64165","url":"/golite-blu-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-14T21:07:02Z","datePublished":"2015-04-14T21:07:02Z","name":"goLITE BLU HF3429/60","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":38,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-11T00:00:00Z","id":"Wmv6eVTxGFCcUeqDGk9cFm","meta":{"title":"GoLITE BLU Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The goLITE BLU by Philips uses blue light to fight SAD.
