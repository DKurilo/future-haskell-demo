By using a <a href=\"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters\">VHS to DVD converter</a>, like the August VGB200 Capture Cable, you can save your videos from deteriorating and being lost forever.","This VHS to DVD converter features an input composite video cable that lets you connect your VCR or other composite compatible camcorder  or device through the USB 2.0 output to your computer. The composite connections include two channel RCA stereo audio inputs, an RCA video input and an S-Video input.","The August VGB200 is compatible with Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7. It is also compatible with Mac computers running OS X version 10.5 and higher. This VHS to DVD converter does not need much processing power to run, and with its plug-n-play compatibility, it is easy to install.","This VHS converter doesn’t come with many extra features or accessories, but all of the essentials are there. An RCA cable and capturing software are included. While the RCA cord is a bit short, it is nice that it is included. The included capturing software is ArcSoft ShowBiz, a barebones video editing software that will let you capture your videos and edit them. While it is not as powerful as other software that comes with our higher-ranking VHS to DVD converters, it is enough to get you started.","The August VGB200 exports captured video footage in MPEG1, MPEG2, AVI, WMV, ASF, MP4 and QTMOV formats. This is a good range of file types, and we are glad to see popular mobile formats available with this device, such as MP4. This converter can also capture still images from your videos in BMP format. You can capture your videos in NTSC or PAL formats, but make sure that you set the output to the correct type, or you may be disappointed with the results.","Beyond the short installation guide, there is no direct support available for this device. While you can contact August International by email, there is no product page on their site to give you any help. You can find drivers on the August International site, but you have to use a search engine to locate them. We are disappointed in the level of help available for this converter, but since it is sold mainly through third party dealers, you may be able to turn to them for help."]},"id":"787a18d5-8d7d-4fc0-a1ba-a74d3c80b268","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f88ceb15-704d-41cb-8b1b-70747cb6dc6e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the August VGB200 Capture Cable can capture your video footage from your VHS and camcorder tapes, it isn’t the best option for quality.
