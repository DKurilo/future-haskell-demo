You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","My First Digital Camera created by Sakar International is - very basic and designed for children. We believe the camera functions more like a toy camera than it does as a real digital camera made for kids. Although it is an inexpensive camera, it is not our top choice in regards to the best <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital camera for kids</a>. Other products such as the KidiZoom Plus, Fisher Price Kid Tough Digital Camera and Disney’s Pix Jr. Digital Camera offer more resolution, a more durable design and a better business backing the product.","Sakar’s My First Digital Camera for kids comes in a unique kit that allows kids to change the face from blue or red to yellow and create stickers with a software kit. The child-friendly model has a low resolution offering only 0.3 megapixels and lacks features such as a flash, zoom and timer. But, unlike toy cameras for kids this real digital cameras for children takes pictures that can be uploaded to a computer and edited with computer software. The low-quality resolution of the pictures and the lack of a flash make this camera very frustrating – especially for young kids.","Although the digital camera for children was designed specifically for young kids,   it doesn’t provide any extra grips or handles that make it easy for them to hold on to it. It takes AAA batteries and although it is durable, it is not built to survive all the drops a kid may inflict upon it. It was built for kids aged five years and older who can better utilize the face-changing templates and the sticker factory software. However, there is no slot for additional memory through an external card, which limits pictures on a trip or holiday outing.","The simplicity makes it very easy for kids to use. It is easy to point and shoot. But the model provides no LCD screen on the back, so kids must look through the viewfinder to target the area they would like to capture a picture of. The software is easy to use and the 0.3 megapixel pictures turn out great when printed as a 4- by 6-inch picture, but the quality goes down when the pictures are printed as larger images.","Sakar International, the creators of My First Digital Camera for kids, has a contact email address and telephone number posted on their website for their technical support team. However, they did not respond to our emails and the average waiting time to reach a customer service rep over the phone was five to ten minutes. In addition, the customer support team was not very friendly towards us, and they did not seem to be knowledgeable about their products. Unfortunately, after contacting them, we had gained no new or additional information to help us."]},"id":"a88380a8-5d46-4659-b8c8-42566457c45e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b928f140-a8cf-4a1a-bb69-7ad8a3214c5f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, My First Digital Camera works well for a point-and-shoot toy.
