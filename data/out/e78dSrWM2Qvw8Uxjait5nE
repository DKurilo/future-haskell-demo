To save time, prevent accidents, and theft, you need to take a few steps before the cleaning technician arrives.","Â Here are five things you can do to optimize your cleaning experience.","<strong>Declutter</strong><br/>Using a professional carpet cleaning service requires the use of long heavy hoses and cords. That means anything on your floor such as a pair of boots can serve as a tripping hazard and just get in the way. It is important to remove all objects such as children&#39;s toys, socks and dog bones before the cleaning technician arrives. Many carpet cleaners do not require that you vacuum first but it is a good idea to remove the top layer of dirt and hair so they can do the deep cleaning.","<strong>Remove Light Furniture</strong><br/>Be aware that carpet-cleaning technicians come to your home to clean your carpets; they are not licensed to move furniture. It is your responsibility to prepare for their arrival. Plant stands; coffee tables and floor lamps are difficult to clean around and are sometimes damaged in the cleaning process. The more furniture you get out of each room the better cleaning results you are going to get. Consider putting your light furniture in the garage and leaving it there until your carpets are dry.","<strong>Protect Your Walls</strong><br/>As the technicians pulls hoses throughout your home, you will find that there is friction on the corners and baseboards throughout your house. To avoid the unsightly black marks caused by the cords and hoses rubbing the corners, consider applying a high quality painter&#39;s tape where the cords are going to rub, such as the base of stairways. Painters tape does not damage or leave marks on you wall when you apply it and it is easy to remove.","<strong>Lock Up Valuables</strong><br/>Do not leave jewelry or portable electronics out in the open. Although the majority of carpet cleaning technicians are honest, unless you know them personally, there is always a small risk that something could turn up missing. If you have, expensive jewelry put it in a safe place. If you have breakable, knick-knacks sitting on shelves remove them so they are not broken.","<strong>Pets</strong><br/>Always keep you pets contained in a safe out of the way place. If you have cats, dogs or birds, the loud noise from the machine can frighten them. Because most carpet cleaners use truck-mounted cleaning systems, a door to the outside will need to remain open, which means if your pets are startled they can escape.","Carpet cleaning technicians are ready to work hard for you. To get the best cleaning results and prevent accidents, follow the simple steps above for a positive experience. The more time each carpet-cleaning professional has to focus on getting your carpets clean without distractions the better job they will do."]},"id":"597da23a-39f5-4be7-8187-8ff09a230885","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8544","url":"/five-tips-to-prepare-your-home-for-professional-carpet-cleaning","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"leah-stone","url":"/author/leah-stone","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Leah Stone","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"LSCnXVFEk3MkJutB5Jiugm","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-27T18:24:57Z","datePublished":"2014-06-27T18:24:57Z","name":"Five Tips to Prepare Your Home for Professional Carpet Cleaning","synopsis":"When you use a professional carpet cleaning service there are several things that you can do to get the most out of each visit.","review":{},"strapline":"When you use a professional carpet cleaning service there are several things that you can do to get the most out of each visit.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-06-30T20:00:43Z","id":"e78dSrWM2Qvw8Uxjait5nE","meta":{"title":"Five Tips to Prepare Your Home for Professional Carpet Cleaning","description":"Professional carpet cleaning services do the hard work so you don&#039;t have to.
