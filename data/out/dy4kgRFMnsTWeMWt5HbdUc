The simple, versatile design involves a string of lights that you can use for pathways, decks and walkways. You can also install them in flower beds, gardens, fountains or other sections of your yard. These lights are relatively inexpensive and versatile. It takes time and effort to install them, but an included installation guide offers step-by-step instructions.","With this solar outdoor lighting set, you receive an adjustable stake-and-bracket set, a spade bit, and five solar lights powered by LEDs. The design of this set lets you bury the lights in the ground with just the top sticking out so they are inobtrusive. You can bury just the lights themselves, or you can make a small trench to also bury the wiring. You can use these lights in gravel, grass or mulched areas, since they are water-resistant.","While normal installation does not require any tools other than what you need to place the lights in the ground, you may need a power drill if you are installing these outdoor solar lights on surfaces such as decks. To do so, drill holes where you want to place your lights and then pass the wires underneath to be out of the way and prevent trip hazards. The included spade bit attaches to your drill for convenience and makes the correct size hole to insert the lights. When putting the lights through the holes from underneath, you remove the lenses first and put them back on once the body of the light is in place. Another stud-type solar light we looked at was the <a href=\"/frontgate-review\">Frontgate Solar Stud</a>.","The solar panel comes with a timer and power switch. It lets you set the amount of time you want these solar lights to stay on by accessing the timer button. The lights flash on and off to let you know how many hours they will be illuminated, one flash for each hour. You can choose four-, five- or six-hour periods that start at dusk. The solar panel replenishes a set of rechargeable 3.6-volt batteries. The LEDs are 0.1 watt each. The wiring between each solar powered string light is eight feet, giving you plenty of room to place them the way you want without crowding."]},"id":"e85e7bc0-7dd3-47fe-a899-a4c3de249a74","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"289df48c-8083-4318-89e4-413b4ad3bed9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Kenroy Home KEH-60503 solar lights can be recessed in the ground or on your deck for illumination and out-of-the-way convenience.
