The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">TV Wall Mount Reviews</a> here.</em>","The Tilt M43 is one of VideoSecu&#39;s best TV wall mounts. This mount can support a flat-screen TV measuring 32 to 60 inches and weighing up to 165 pounds. It is equipped with all the mounting hardware you could ask for, and the mount even has a built-in bubble level to aid in installation. However, it has no warranty and mediocre supplemental materials.","If you look on the back of the VideoSecu Tilt M43, you&#39;ll see that it meets VESA standards for patterns 100 x 100 all the way up to 710 x 450. A large VESA pattern is indicative of a versatile TV wall mount. As long as your TV is at least 32 inches, the mount should accompany it nicely. A TV smaller than 32 inches may still fit on the wall brackets, but the mount will show behind the TV. An appropriately sized TV should hide the wall mount from view completely.","As is apparent from its name, the VideoSecu Tilt M43 can tilt up to 15 degrees. The tilting adjustment is perfect for a waiting-room setting or a home entertainment system. If you choose to keep the mount in a fixed, non-tilted position, the mount and TV&#39;s profile is quite small, at 2.2 inches from the wall. This gives you enough room to attach any necessary cables while keeping a streamlined look. Whether the frame is tilted or fixed, its lift-and-lock feature secures your TV&#39;s position.","Once attached to the wall, the M43&#39;s rail design makes attaching the TV and brackets a cinch. There should be just enough room to connect the brackets to the rails and insert the necessary power cords as well. If the TV isn&#39;t centered, the horizontal adjustment feature allows you to slide it into place.","VideoSecu does not excel in the help and support department. The company has a minimal website with a phone number but nothing else. There are no FAQs to review or online installation guides. A user manual does come with the mount, but that is where the support ends. VideoSecu doesn&#39;t include a warranty either."]},"id":"13e28a79-2499-4c89-ac00-8cf916fcb19c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"da46f65f-6461-480d-9135-c5ded89d48da","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are several aspects of the VideoSecu Tilt M43 that any user will enjoy, such as the option for a 15-degree tilt or a stationary TV and the mount&#39;s heavy-duty steel construction.
