Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This Sony 7” Digital Photo Frame, model number DPF-D710, is a fairly basic <a href=\"/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital photo frame</a>. It offers remote control navigation, internal memory, portrait or landscape orientation and a timer for automatic shut-off.  Although it may seem insignificant to some, the digital frame lacks a rechargeable battery, which makes the frame e immobile and difficult to pass around a room for people to view. The display has a slightly lower resolution than other comparable digital picture frames, but it still provides a crisp display with vibrant colors.","This digital picture frame can be displayed in portrait orientation or in landscape orientation. The frame is equipped with an automatic orientation sensor (AOS) which will automatically adjust the pictures to the orientation of the frame. This feature adds versatility to the frame, and since it&#39;s built into the frame, there is nothing special you have to do to access it.","Although the Sony specs page indicates that there is 128MB of internal storage, you have to read closely to see that only 80MB of that is available for photo storage. The digital frame still has the capacity to store approximately 200 photos, but it won’t be the countless variety you may have initially thought.","You can navigate your way around the Sony digital photo frame with the remote or with the buttons found on the back of the frame. The button placement is a little awkward since it requires that you look at the buttons to see what they are, and then to the front of the frame to see the display of where you are in the menu. We found that the buttons became easier to use the more we played with them, but for greater ease and usability, we suggest using the remote. The digital picture frame is compatible with MS, MS Duo, SD and SDHC memory cards. It will also connect directly to your PC with a mini USB cable.","Once you reach the product page on Sony’s website, you can access the product specifications, an owner’s manual and the product warranty information. Although Sony claims to provide customer support through chat, we were never able to get it to function properly and always ended up resorting to email. We received a response to our email in less than four hours, and each of our product inquires were answered very effectively.","The product comes with an AC adapter for power, a manual (also accessible online), a remote control, a CD-ROM and a stand. The product has a 1-year warranty should anything stop working due to a manufacturing error.<br/> "]},"id":"a20278c7-1e33-461f-8206-8ef965f8b57b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"04d9d8f5-b829-41f1-871d-09598ccb826b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This basic frame supplies all of the design aspects and features that many users are looking for.
