A soda or coffee later in your shift could keep you awake when you get home. Avoid alcohol after work, which can also disrupt your sleep patterns.","<strong>2. Stick to a Schedule</strong><br/>Ideally, you&#39;ll work a shift with consistent <a href=\"/money/small-business\">scheduling</a>. Stick to your sleep patterns every day of the week to help your body adjust to its new rhythms. If you don&#39;t want to sleep away all your daylight hours, consider a schedule with two long naps rather than a single chunk of sleep.

Eat Well</strong><br/>Don&#39;t live on fast food and vending machine fare just because you&#39;re up during unconventional hours. A healthy diet with plenty of fresh produce, whole grains, and lean meats will help you stay healthy working nights.","<strong>4. Snack Often</strong><br/>Eating regularly is essential for diabetics, but it can help anyone maintain steady blood sugar levels. A healthy snack every few hours will ward off the mid-work-shift slump.","<strong>5. Schedule Social Activities</strong><br/>Night shift workers often feel isolated from the waking world. Go out for breakfast with your coworkers after your shift, or schedule family activities for times when you&#39;re awake.","<strong>6. Light Your Workspace</strong><br/>Working in a dimly lit space at night will just make it harder to stay awake. Keep your workspace lit to simulate a daytime atmosphere.","<strong>7. Limit Lighting After Work</strong><br/>Conversely, help your body adjust to a daylight sleep schedule by limiting light in your environment when you get home. Put blackout drapes on your windows, wear sunglasses on the way home, and don&#39;t watch TV or look at your phone just before bed.","<strong>8. Deal With Noise Disturbances</strong><br/>Soundproof your bedroom, invest in earplugs, or play soothing background music while you&#39;re sleeping. These strategies will help block out daytime noises like lawnmowers and children so you can get plenty of sleep.","<strong>9. Battle Wakefulness</strong><br/>If you&#39;re lying awake after work, try getting up instead of staying there staring at the ceiling. Do something else, such as read a book, for 20 minutes to help yourself reset before trying to sleep again.","<strong>10. Seek Medical Help When Necessary</strong><br/>Don&#39;t hesitate to ask a doctor for help if you&#39;re having trouble adjusting to the night shift. Lack of sleep can lead to serious medical conditions. It&#39;s better to get assistance early.","If you&#39;re on the clock all night, these working night shift tips can make the difference between an ongoing struggle and long-term success. Adjust accordingly, and you can become a night shift pro."]},"id":"7fb5f7a8-86e0-4540-adee-051e54ab32a6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9355","url":"/10-tips-for-working-the-night-shift","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-09T02:14:34Z","datePublished":"2015-04-09T02:14:34Z","name":"10 Tips for Working the Night Shift","synopsis":"Nearly 15 million Americans work the night shift some or all of the time, but it's easy for these workers to feel isolated and alone.","review":{},"strapline":"Nearly 15 million Americans work the night shift some or all of the time, but it's easy for these workers to feel isolated and alone.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-09T02:18:49Z","id":"BXUcmpdFGgKzSfLvoW6e3F","meta":{"title":"10 Tips for Working the Night Shift","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
