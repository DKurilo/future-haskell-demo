Clarivue screen protector for iPhone 6, 5 and 4 is made of a thin, tempered glass that will protect your phone from minor bumps and scratches. It has a fingerprint-resistant coating that makes it easy to keep clean. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1204-best-iphone-7-screen-protectors.html\">iPhone screen protector</a> is easy to install, as long as you take a little bit of time to apply it carefully.","This iPhone 6 screen protector is hard compared to many of the other, thinner screen protectors we reviewed. In the pencil hardness test, 9H is the hardest and 9B is the softest. Although the Clarivue screen protector is only 0.3mm thick, it still has a hardness level of 9H. This makes it comparable in hardness to the glass iPhone screen protectors we reviewed.","Another nice thing about this iPhone screen protector is that the surface isn&#39;t tacky. It&#39;s an unobtrusive solution for keeping your screen safe from scratches. Plus, it has an oleophobic coating on it that makes it resist oil from your face and fingertips.","The Clarivue iPhone screen protector goes on dry. All you have to do is peel off the protective backing and stick it on your phone. If you don&#39;t get it on right the first time, it&#39;s difficult to reposition. However, Clarivue&#39;s adhesive doesn&#39;t bond immediately, so it&#39;s easy to wiggle it into position before it fully adheres. Within 48 hours, any little bubbles under the iPhone screen protector should disappearâ€”unless there&#39;s dust under the screen protector. Removing the Clarivue shield is simple. It doesn&#39;t leave an adhesive residue on the screen.","The clear and anti-glare screen protectors are safe under a lifetime replacement warranty, but this protection doesn&#39;t extend to the XT Glass, specialized mirror and privacy-filter screen guards.","Clarivue has five different types of iPhone screen protectors and four for the iPhone 4. It also supports the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You can choose from a variety of protectors, including the standard transparent skin, a specialized glare-reducing protector and a dark privacy-filter shield."]},"id":"72b55883-a7ed-4030-aff0-752292098a00","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7fd64114-f2b4-49d3-8547-9898569f3b9b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Clarivue&#39;s screen protector is impressively easy to apply and extremely durable.
