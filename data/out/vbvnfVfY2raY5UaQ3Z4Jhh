These solar modules come with tempered glass covers and anodized aluminum alloy frames. The 60 monocrystaline cells contained in each panel can produce a solar efficiency at 15.62 percent, certainly a reasonable standard within the solar industry.","Each panel can produce 250 watts of power during maximum output. Each can offer 30.5 volts of power at maximum levels, as well as 8.2 amps of current at the maximum power current level.","These panels have sufficient resistance when it comes to impact situations, especially the ever-worrisome hailstorms. The specifications for the Samsung LPC250SM panels indicate they can withstand hail that is just slightly less than 1 inch in diameter being blown by winds at approximately 52 mph. These panels can withstand temperature changes that range from 40 degrees below zero to 185 degrees F. The panels offer good quality resistance to pressure and are capable of handling a load equivalent of 113 pounds of snow per square foot.","The manufacturer recommends cleaning these panels once or twice yearly, using water and a soft cloth or sponge.","With these solar panels, you get only a five-year limited warranty on the materials and workmanship. While this is not an unusually short period of time for the materials and workmanship portion of a solar panel warranty, it is not among the best compared to others on the market that offer10 years of coverage.","Samsungâ€™s warranty also promises 90 percent of the guaranteed power for a period of 10 years and an 80 percent power level output for 25 years. Each module is 64.17 inches long, 36.66 inches wide and 1.85 inches deep. Each weighs 41.9 pounds. If you need any help from the company, you can call or email to get answers to questions."]},"id":"496cf788-b7e9-4a5f-b385-2bb101ca6c73","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5ede6e0b-3df3-4c69-8e38-700fc1dd827e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung LPC250SM solar panels feature a good solar efficiency percentage and a respectable amount of wattage.
