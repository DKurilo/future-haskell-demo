You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Lava was started by a small group of engineers who wanted to build high quality subwoofers and deliver them exclusively through their website. Although any of their subwoofers are solid pieces of equipment, for this list of entry-level <a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">powered subwoofers</a>, the Lava LSP12 delivers the best sound for the best price.","Lava sets itself apart as a manufacturer-direct company by shipping directly to your home free of charge. Better than that, though, every Lava sub comes with a 30-day in-home trial period. In other words, after you purchase the sub, if you don&#39;t like it within the first month, you can return it for a full refund with no questions asked.","The Lava LSP12 has a frequency-response range of 24Hz to 200Hz, with a crossover range of 40Hz to 200Hz. This sub powers through cinematic low-frequency effects (LFE) like an ox plowing a field. With a continuous power output of 250 watts, this sub can work for a long time, delivering dynamic sounds well above 100dB.","The Lava LSP12 features a unique design with a 12-inch front-firing speaker and two front-firing ports below it. This sub will easily fit into any home theater setup, but what makes it truly impressive is its ability to handle music. Smooth jazz melodies are lost on the speaker, but harder rock and bass-heavy hip-hop are crisp and pounding. The two-front firing ports add to the thumping effect by pushing even more air out the front of the speaker. The design is slightly less efficient than a rear-firing port would be, but it offers a nice physical effect while you listen. The subwoofer comes with a speaker grill, but this unique design begs to be seen and shown.","The features of the Lava LSP12 home subwoofer include adjustable volume and crossover-frequency dials, a zero or 180 phase setting, and a signal-sensing automatic on/off setting in addition to separate on and off power settings. The subwoofer has one LFE input, one stereo RCA low-level input, and two left and right speaker-level binding post inputs.","Lava LSP12 home subwoofers are covered by an unconditional five-year warranty for parts and labor. Lava&#39;s website has some useful information and a downloadable user manual, but no FAQs page. The company provides technical support by phone and email. Although we contacted them for more information by email, we never heard back beyond an automatically generated reply stating that they had received our email."]},"id":"7886e401-85b4-4496-aa5d-48f193020d4d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f6a03e89-eac1-47f1-b69c-0956684bd4ef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are many reasons to consider a Lava LSP12 home subwoofer if you are planning to get a home theater sub, including the excellent price-point value and satisfaction guarantee.
