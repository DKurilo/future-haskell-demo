It s not the lack of features or tools? It s not from a dearth of templates and design options? In fact, few if any complaints are related to the software program and design interface at all. Virtually all negative reviews and complaints are addressed at a seemingly contrary element of these software programs: a monthly or recurring fee.","The fee itself has nothing to do with the program or its tools and features. Instead, the fee is typically charged to cover the costs related to hosting, bandwidth and security. Since most small businesses and others that use programs like Web Easy Professional, Web Plus and Intuit Website Creator would likely need to make use of another, more-powerful and secure server. This, too, has its advantages, as small business owners and personal users don t have to invest in physical and environmental equipment to house server equipment.","While the differences between website construction and <a href=\"/best-web-hosting\">website hosting</a> are often blurred with Website Creation software programs, the truth is that both elements are necessary to build a viable, safe and reliable site that can be accessed at anytime, by anyone.","<strong></strong>"]},"id":"ce350670-008b-491a-a5bf-db21bbd1a12c","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Bandwidth Limits</strong><br/>Many Website Creation services have caps or limits to the amount of bandwidth that can be used, meaning use of audio, video and animation could be limited or even made unviable.","<strong>Storage Capacity</strong><br/>It is practically a standard to receive an <a href=\"/best-free-email-services\">email account</a> related to your website domain name. With client lists, stored documents and other important information often saved in email accounts, users should be aware if their chosen service has a storage limit and, if so, its size.","<strong>Site Generation Time</strong><br/>Though it is less common now, early Website Creation and Web Hosting services ran on servers that reflected changes only at certain times, meaning that errors, changes and new developments would be unseen quite possibly for hours, a problem for sites that don t receive heavy or regular traffic. Users should find out whether or not changes and developments will be reflected in real-time or not.","<strong>Shopping Cart/Credit Card Processing Integration</strong><br/>Many Website Creation software programs and services include optional <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-payment-gateway-services/\">credit card processing</a> and shopping cart integration, such as PayPal. This greatly reduces the amount of time necessary to get a good or service online and to customers.","All of these factors are generally what account for the monthly or recurring subscription fee or cost. Nevertheless, arguably all of these are necessary to run a stable and viable site.","To see side-by-side comparisons of the best Website Creation software programs available, please visit the Top Ten Reviews <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Website Creation software review site</a>."]},"id":"73e7e8ea-6363-4dee-b643-b439f2fbef59","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_856","url":"/why-do-i-have-to-pay-a-monthly-fee-website-creation-software-and-services-explained","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-04-30T20:14:29Z","datePublished":"2009-04-30T20:14:29Z","name":"Why Do I Have to Pay a Monthly Fee?
