You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Hamilton Beach injected instant adaptability to its classic <a href=\"/best-mixers\">stand mixer</a> by making it double as a hand mixer. This lightweight electric mixer uses the center-style rotation to mix batters, frostings and dough, which means the beaters turn while the bowl spins on a turntable-style disk. However, this means that if ingredients get pushed to one side or the other, they won’t be incorporated. You can use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, but this defeats the purpose of having a stand mixer.","We put this mixer through the same tests as the best stand mixers on our lineup, and it almost kept up with the planetary-style mixers. In the egg-white test, it produced big, fluffy egg whites that were at least six times the starting volume. The cookie dough test proved to be too much for this mixer. It stalled a few times as it trudged through the dough, and as the dough came together and got thicker, the mixer eventually shook off the base.","In the user manual, which is also available on the manufacturer’s website, we read that bread dough should not be kneaded on the stand mixer, so we removed the mixer from the base and used it for 10 minutes by hand. It was almost pointless and after the allotted time, we tossed the dough into one of the better dough mixers to finish the job.","The 4-quart stainless steel bowl seems large enough to handle a couple batches of dough, but we weren’t able to get the manufacturer to tell us what the cup capacity of the machine is – and without overload protection, it’s best to play it safe with this mixer. In fact, this mixer is best for those who mix lighter batters, doughs and icings.","You get a whisk attachment with this machine and it aerates well, so you can create big, beautiful meringues and fluffy, whipped frostings with this mixer. There are no other  attachments included with this hybrid mixer, though, that can replace your other appliances. So, the flexibility of this mixer ends at its ability to be used in a separate bowl apart from the mixer base.","Hamilton Beach offers the standard one-year warranty that covers defects, but nothing else beyond that. The manufacturer’s website has customer support, including FAQs, warranty information, user manuals and contact information such as email and phone numbers."]},"id":"210d40e0-9736-4fe7-a9b9-f0a96d9f2f8e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ac1f47a4-8392-471f-b93b-a922e450f2d6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although this mixer offers flexibility – you can use it on the base or as a hand mixer – it just doesn’t perform as a stand mixer as well as the other mixers we tested.
