It is photo-ready, features variable temperature and speed, and has a six-roller system that automatically adjusts to the material and pouch you are using.","This laminating machine uses a six-roller system. Four of the rollers are used for thermal lamination and two of the rollers are for cold lamination, applying pressure to seal and eliminate bubbles and provide a clear finish. The system allows the rollers to adjust automatically to changes in the thickness of the material you are using, providing the right amount of pressure needed.","The laminator features an 8-bit microprocessor control system, which lets you set the temperature the speed you need. An auto memory function will store the last speed and temperature you use before turning off the machine, so you can use it again the next time you need to laminate something. This control system works with any standard pouch thickness, from 3 millimeters to 10 millimeters. Changing to a different pouch doesn&#39;t require any waiting time, either. You can press a button and move on to your next laminating project.","When not in use, the machine enters stand-by mode, which helps to conserve the amount of electricity used and helps to prevent the machine from overheating. It is also equipped with a protection system that prevents overheating. It will turn off automatically if the temperature rises above 160 degrees Fahrenheit.","The machine has a user-friendly LED screen and an indicator light that let you know when the document laminating machine is ready to use. It takes about five minutes for this device to warm up, and the machine has a laminating range of 32 degrees to 320 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat it emits for laminating purposes is balanced, however, making it suitable for laminating photographs and other materials that are typically hard to laminate.","One feature not included with this laminating machine is heat guard technology, which keeps the outside of the device cool to the touch while using thermal lamination. Because of this, you need to be careful to avoid touching the machine while it is operating. If you&#39;d prefer a machine that stays cool to the touch, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/fellowes-review\">Fellowes</a> laminator. ","The Akiles may not have protective technology to keep the exterior of the device cool during use, but it does have several beneficial features. It has six rollers, lets you perform both hot and cold lamination, has advanced temperature control settings, and protects itself from overheating with an auto-shutoff feature."]},"id":"f2bb2b6a-ce70-482c-a06f-7d706159f889","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63394","url":"/akiles-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T21:00:03Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T21:00:03Z","name":"Akiles ProLam Photo 6 Roller","synopsis":"The ProLam Photo from Akiles is a professional laminating machine that uses hot and cold technology.
