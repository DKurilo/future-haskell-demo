You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","GiftCardSwapping.com is a site that accepts most gift cards, whether they are standard or electronic. This gift card exchange service does not have many restrictions, and there is no minimum or maximum exchange amount. Likewise, it accepts gift cards with an expiration date. You can also trade for gift cards of equal value and eliminate fees.","While this <a href=\"/best-gift-card-exchange-sites\">gift card exchange</a> service accepts most cards, it has a preferred merchant list that determines how much the service will pay for each card. The cards with most demand are offered 80 percent of the card’s balance, while lower-ranking cards receive 75, 70 or 65 percent of the card’s balance. This is significantly less than what most other exchange services offer. However, the service also allows you to set your own price and sell your gift cards directly to customers.","If you sell your gift cards, the service charges a seller’s fee of 90 cents plus an additional 3.9 percent of the sale price. While this significantly reduces your profit, the service does allow you to trade your gift card for another of equal value, and it does not charge any fees. Additionally, you can buy and sell electronic gift cards as well as standard gift cards.","The service does not list a maximum discount that it offers. With sellers setting their own prices, discounts vary. Once you sell your card to the service, you must download a form and mail it to GiftCardSwapping.com along with your gift card. After it receives your card, it will pay you via PayPal. The service does not offer free shipping nor will not reimburse you for that additional cost.","Although it offers several gift cards available for purchase, the website features limited search capabilities. It only has a general search tool you can use to search for retailers. Otherwise, you have to scroll through the gift cards until you find the one you want.","While the site lacks many features that other gift card exchange sites have, it includes several technical-support options. Aside from FAQs, the service lists an email and online contact form to communicate should you have questions or problems. Additionally, each gift card comes with a guarantee.","GiftCardSwapping.com is one of the only gift card exchange sites to still offer gift card trades. It carries gift cards to most major retailers and accepts most cards. However, the mail-in process, selling fees and lower payout for gift cards make the service perhaps not the best gift card exchange service if you do not want to deal with selling fees and the payment structure it offers."]},"id":"26bfc217-1cad-40cd-91d0-d8099cb07484","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50066","url":"/giftcardswapping-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-13T15:35:24Z","datePublished":"2010-07-13T15:35:24Z","name":"GiftCardSwapping.com","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer offers multiple gift cards for sale.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer offers multiple gift cards for sale.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","id":"QydzQEEBsEqcooYEHg8eBc","meta":{"title":"GiftCardSwapping.com Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"GiftCardSwapping.com charges sellers fees with its gift card exchange service.
