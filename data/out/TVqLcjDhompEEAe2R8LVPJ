The Razer Ripsaw is no exception. This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/elgato-stream-deck,review-4513.html\">game capture device</a> can record all of your best gaming moments in HD video. And true to Razer&#39;s style, it doesn&#39;t just look like just another black box â€“ it&#39;s a black box with flair.","The main mission of the Ripsaw is to provide you with the best gameplay recording possible and then share your footage. It delivers on the first point. This game capture device can record 1080p video at 60 fps, and it doesn&#39;t compress the video at all. That leaves you with some great-looking video that&#39;s ready to stream or to edit and upload later.","This brings us to the second point: sharing. The Ripsaw doesn&#39;t give you much in the way of tools to share your new content. Instead, you need to rely on your own streaming software, like Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). You&#39;ll also need your own video editing software, as you don&#39;t get any of that from the Ripsaw.","Still, this is one of the best game capture devices in regards to performance. Thanks to its USB 3.0 connection, you get basically zero latency. When you press forward on your controller, you move forward on the screen. There isn&#39;t any delay while your computer or the Ripsaw processes recording and saving your video.","One of the best features of the Ripsaw is the two 3.5 mm audio-in jacks on front of the box. These are mic-in and auxiliary-in ports. They give you a place to plug in your audio, making the entire streaming and recording process easier. It&#39;s one less thing for you to think about while trying to get the best recording.","The Ripsaw is compatible with just about every game console you can think of. It even comes with all of the cables you might need to get running. That means one less trip to the store or Amazon, getting you to the game faster. However, it only works with Windows computers. Mac users are out of luck here.","Many HD game capture devices look like little black boxes, nothing special. The Razer aesthetic appeals to some more than others, but in the case of the Ripsaw, it definitely helps. Rounded edges, a low profile and an understated green accent help the Ripsaw stand apart from its fellow game capture devices.","In case you have any trouble setting the Ripsaw up, there are several tutorial videos on Razer&#39;s website. You can also browse the FAQs section or contact technical support through email or by phone. While some other manufacturers have more support resources for their game capture devices, there should be enough here for most people.","The Razer Ripsaw is a powerful HD game capture device with several useful features that are difficult to find elsewhere. The low-latency connection via USB 3.0 is a major boon, and the audio-in ports are nice as well. This is one of the best game capture devices on the market, but the lack of helpful software puts it at a bit of a disadvantage."]},"id":"97097859-f4a3-4ad5-b28f-d9918497ae7e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68321","url":"/razer-ripsaw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-06T20:01:47Z","datePublished":"2016-09-06T20:01:47Z","name":"Razer Ripsaw","synopsis":"Razer is known for providing gaming peripherals that look sleek and work well most of the time.
