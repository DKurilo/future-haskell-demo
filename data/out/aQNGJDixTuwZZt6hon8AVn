You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Solaire Anywhere is a convenient, portable <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared grill</a>. This grill is one of the most powerful in our review, with 14,000 Btu devoted to a single ceramic infrared burner. Its heat consistency, grilling experience and durability are just average, though.","This infrared gas grill&#39;s single burner preheats to 500 degrees Fahrenheit in less than two minutes. However, it requires three minutes of preheating on high for the ceramic plate to absorb enough heat to keep propane burning at lower temperatures. If you switch to a lower heat setting before the preheating process is done, the burner goes out. This highlights the need to read the user manual before use.","Once the burner preheats, the grill&#39;s extreme heat is not very consistent across the grilling surface. As with most ceramic burners, there is a hot spot directly over the burner, while the edges of the grill receive only light heating. Our long test revealed that the temperature climbed over 100 degrees within 20 minutes, with a final temperature of 675 degrees. This means the grill is not suited for slow-cooking projects such as roasts. This grill performs best when the 1-pound propane fuel tank hangs vertically over the edge of a table to keep the gas flowing. The <a href=\"/tec-cherokee-review\">TEC Cherokee</a> has much better heat consistency. ","Despite the heat, the grill produced good results cooking steak, chicken, hamburgers and even fish in our tests. The Solaire Anywhere provides a good infrared barbecue experience as long as you keep your eyes on it. This infrared gas grill can use a natural gas fuel source with the optional conversion kit.","However, it does not have a temperature gauge, a warming rack for meat that&#39;s done and items such as buns, or a self-cleaning function, making it less convenient and versatile than the best grills. Its cooking area of 155 square inches is the smallest in our review. The Solaire Anywhere Mini, a variant of this model, has a surface area of 48 square inches, which makes it the smallest ceramic infrared grill around. The small size makes it conveniently portable for trips, but it&#39;s not well suited to cooking for crowds.","The Solaire Anywhere has two construction options. There&#39;s a standard stainless steel design, which we used in our tests. There&#39;s also a marine-grade model that is more expensive but also more durable. We found this to be a durable design that doesn&#39;t feel fragile, but it doesn&#39;t match the quality of cast-aluminum grills. The grill has a stainless steel cooking grate with V-shaped bars and a flat surface that&#39;s easy to clean.","The Solaire Anywhere carries a one-year warranty, which is average for tabletop grills. This warranty doesn&#39;t compare to those of the best infrared grills. In contrast, Solaire&#39;s full-size freestanding grills carry a lifetime warranty on all components except the ignition system, which has two-year protection. Rasmussen Iron Works, the Solaire&#39;s manufacturer, offers email and phone support as well as online FAQs and user manuals."]},"id":"4921cd36-c34e-4cac-a061-3349a0727d8f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d417749f-b45a-4279-ae36-ddf8b6dc3bdd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Solaire Anywhere is a powerful infrared barbecue grill.
