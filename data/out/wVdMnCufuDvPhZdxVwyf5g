And that&#39;s what matters. As with most <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-systems\">medical alert services</a>, there is an in-home landline, in-home cellular and mobile package. We ordered and tested the in-home landline and mobile devices. That said, it&#39;s worth noting the in-home cellular system is the MyTrex MXD-3G, a very common and high-quality system.","<strong>Pricing</strong>","The most notable feature of Medical Alert is the monthly cost of the base package, the in-home landline system. Similar base packages cost between $28 and $30 per month, but this service costs just $19.95 per month. And if you pay annually, the monthly cost lowers to $18.29 per month, making this the most affordable PERS device on the market.","The in-home cellular system is also very affordable at $29.95 per month and can be lowered to $25.62 per month if you pay annually. On average, similar systems – even ones using the same MyTrex system – cost about $38 per month.","The mobile GPS medical alert package costs $37.95 per month, and can cost as low as $32.04 per month if you make annual payments. The month-to-month price is more in line with the market average, but the annual payments makes it a lot more competitive, so long as you&#39;re willing to make larger upfront payments.","In comparison, the next best value is <a href=\"/greatcall-review\">GreatCall</a>. The Lively Mobile starts out at about $25 per month. While this is $5 more per month than Medical Alert&#39;s base package, it is a mobile GPS device, a system with limitless range and far greater communication quality than an in-home system.","<strong>Emergency Response Performance</strong>","Medical Alert earned an A- grade for call response speed. It was tied with <a href=\"/medical-guardian-review\">Medical Guardian</a> and <a href=\"/acadian-oncall-review\">Acadian OnCall</a> with an average response time between 26 and 28 seconds. Only GreatCall was faster, averaging 14 seconds. These response times, gathered over several weeks of testing every day, are excellent compared to the 47-second market average. Some services had response times exceeding five minutes. By comparison, Medical Alert&#39;s slowest time was just 35 seconds, and it had several calls answered in 22 seconds.","The quality of the emergency responders was also good, earning Medical Alert a B grade. The tone of the operators was better than most, though there were a few operators who sounded rushed. In most of the calls, the responders either confirmed my name and asked for my name, which I preferred They were a little inconsistent with how many times they asked if I was okay. About half of the time, the responders confirmed I was okay twice, but most of the time they only asked once.","The call-in-progress experience with Medical Alert&#39;s mobile alert system was the best I tested. When you press the help button, you&#39;re greeted by a female voice telling you a call is in progress. The voice provides instructions on how to cancel the call if you don&#39;t need an emergency and it repeatedly assures you a call is in progress. I found the voice guidance system to have a calming effect. This is exactly what you need when you&#39;re in an emergency. The voice helps keep you from panicking.","By comparison, several other mobile devices made no sound whatsoever. They vibrated when I pushed the help button, but there was nothing indicating a call was in progress. In at least one case, when the call went unanswered for over five minutes, my anxiety over the silence amplified by multiple degrees because I didn&#39;t know if the call was placed or not. I didn&#39;t know what was happening, whether I had used the device correctly or not.","<strong>System Performance</strong>","Medical Alert&#39;s mobile system is a little larger than most mobile alert systems, but the speaker is among the best. Only GreatCall&#39;s speaker received a higher grade, and even then, the quality and clarity is arguably no different. It comes with a leather case to clip to your belt and you can wear around your neck on a lanyard. If you&#39;re okay with the size, it&#39;s a very good mobile system.","The in-home landline system had a good speaker, earning it a B grade for quality. It wasn&#39;t the clearest speaker, as it tended to distort a little in the highest frequency range, but considering it&#39;s the most affordable medical alert system on the market and it looks like it was made in the 1980&#39;s, the performance is about as good you&#39;d expect. That said, the average maximum volume output was among the loudest, as it averaged 89-dB. This is especially critical with an in-home system, as you may have to communicate with emergency responders from rooms away.","<strong>Additional Services &amp; Add-Ons</strong>","Medical Alert&#39;s only significant downside is the lack of additional packages and add-ons. Many medical alert services are expanding to smartwatch technology or driving medical alert systems.","I tested the fall detection pendant with a range of simulated falls and sensitivity tests. Medical Alert&#39;s fall detection pendant earned a B+ grade. It detects falls, but it&#39;s also very sensitive and results in false alerts. It&#39;s better than most fall detections, as many didn&#39;t work unless I literally threw them into the ground, but at about $10 per month in addition to your medical alert system, you must decide whether the peace of mind is worth the additional cost and potential false alerts.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>Medical Alert earned my pick for the best value because this service offers the most affordable medical alert system with very good emergency response. It&#39;s among the fastest at answering calls and the mobile device&#39;s call-in-progress experience is matched by other services.  "]},"id":"a2fb6e32-983e-4a73-8fdd-b5e2b7dbe39c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70199","url":"/medical-alert-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-04T12:21:09Z","datePublished":"2018-09-04T12:21:09Z","name":"Medical Alert","synopsis":"Owned and operated by Connect America, Medical Alert isn’t a particularly memorable brand name (I've lost count of the times co-workers have asked me if I miss-capitalized \"medical alert&qu","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"While the available medical alert systems aren&#039;t impressive, Medical Alert&#039;s emergency response performed well, and the pricing makes it one of the most affordable services.","pros":["The base package is the most affordable PERS (Personal Emergency Response System) device on the market."],"cons":["There is a dearth of additional services and add-ons."]},"strapline":"Owned and operated by Connect America, Medical Alert isn’t a particularly memorable brand name (I've lost count of the times co-workers have asked me if I miss-capitalized \"medical alert&qu","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-09-18T00:00:00Z","id":"wVdMnCufuDvPhZdxVwyf5g","meta":{"title":"Medical Alert Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
