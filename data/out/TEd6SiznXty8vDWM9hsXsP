First and foremost, there is a big difference between email blasting SPAM and sending effective marketing emails. SPAM uses the shotgun marketing strategy where you blast thousands of emails into cyberspace, hoping to get a few responses.","In contrast, an effective email blast targets an audience with whom you already have a relationship, the email is expected, and with a good campaign, readily welcomed. Here are just a few tips to help you create an excellent email with a marketing message."]},"id":"d2b6dd9e-1ca3-43b0-be21-35dc4e424839","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Target Your Audience"},"id":"3bd57b62-a58b-4d59-b595-c3cc3f8e31d3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Your best audience is your current, satisfied customers, people with whom you have already developed a relationship of trust.

All of your emails should have a familiar look with your company&#39;s logo and be identifiable by the subject line. It&#39;s a good idea to send your emails the same time each month, week or day, and be consistent so your customers know when to expect the message.","Offer more than one way for the recipients to enter your website to investigate the product or service. Many people stay away from direct links to sites and would prefer to enter your address in the browser. Never ask for personal information via an email. This is a familiar sign of a phishing fraud rather than legitimate marketing email. Additionally, use an identifiable sender name, customers may not want to open mail from &#34;customer care&#34; or &#34;special offer&#34; use your company name, for example &#34;Classic Designs Inc.
