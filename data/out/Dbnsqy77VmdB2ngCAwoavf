With a 16 megapixel resolution, you can expect clear photos that you can view on your computer, print or share online. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TF1 is well suited for outdoor enthusiasts looking for a freeze-resistant and <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof camera</a>. This device will operate in water down to 33 feet and can be used in temperatures down to 14 degrees. It is shockproof up to 5 feet so it can endure accidental drops better than most electronic devices.","It comes with an image stabilization mode that corrects vertical and horizontal motion. That means you can take a photo while you are walking or running, and the camera can help prevent the image from being blurry.","The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TF1has a 4X optical zoom allows you to capture detailed images of flowers and coral reefs. It comes with a CCD image sensor that regulates how much light is used by each pixel and it helps prevent grainy photos from occurring. It is also equipped with a built-in flash for taking photos in the dark or in deep water.","This camera includes picture effects like panorama, pop color, partial color and toy camera. Convenient features such as white balance control, red-eye reduction and a self-timer are included. Although this camera takes good photos, it has fewer shooting options compared to others waterproof its class. It does not have manual controls, so you don’t have the artistic control you get with other cameras.","A standout feature with this camera is its dedicated mode button that makes it easy to access and change the camera’s mode setting. Although the best waterproof cameras are equipped with built in video recorders and panorama modes, to access them you usually have to access the menu first. Since the mode button is located on the body of camera, you can easily record unexpected shots. Additionally, we are impressed with the camera’s ability to zoom in and out while shooting video. Although we are impressed with the video quality, we found the audio quality falls short of expectations.","This camera is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Although the manufacturer does not disclose how many photos and hours of video you get, we estimate that you will get approximately 200 shots per charge or five hours of video. You will need to purchase an SD, SDHC or SDXC memory card for storage since you will not get a card with your purchase.","The cameras is constructed of a tough plastic material. The compartments of the camera are sealed to prevent leaking. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TF1does not have any notable design features like a rubber surface for easy gripping or extra waterproofing elements. Make sure to take precautionary measures by attaching yourself to the camera when you are using it in the water. It does not float.","Sony cameras come with a one year warranty. You will find email and telephone support information on the company’s site. Accessing help by telephone can be frustrating, as there is a survey that you have to go through before you can speak with an agent. The online manual and FAQs page provide information for troubleshooting and operating questions."]},"id":"6b300824-4195-40e2-9327-034f10af4cb6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"227e9706-1022-4a15-9351-3d0f8d5ef086","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TF1 is a good companion for outdoor and underwater excursions.
