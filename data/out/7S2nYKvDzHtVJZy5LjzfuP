It is impossible to create a quality, ready-for-print comic book with just one program. This is because comic book software focuses either on illustration or on script. Final Draft is the best software for creating the dialogue for your comic books and graphic novels.","Since this comic software focuses on script, Final Draft doesn&#39;t have illustration tools. Still, it is a valuable program if you want to make a comic or graphic novel. In fact, Final Draft has comic book and graphic novel templates to help you get started. You can place dialogue from multiple characters side by side to more easily see the flow of the script from character to character, from scene to scene and from page to page. If you&#39;d prefer a program that allows you to work with illustrations, you might want to consider <a href=\"/comic-creator-review\">Comic Creator</a>.","Final Draft has index cards and script notes to help you quickly record ideas without having to stop in the middle of your creative writing. These are also helpful if you are using software that animates your comic book characters. Using the script tools, such as panels and sticky notes, lets you line up dialogue with action points.","Final Draft is the only comic book software that includes a dictionary. You can check your spelling and grammar, change font styles and sizes, and even import text from other programs. When you are finished, you can easily upload content from Final Draft into emails or share it on Facebook directly from the software.","Since this is a comic book script program, Final Draft cannot save files in image formats, such as BMP, JPEG or PNG. However, it will support PDF, TXT and XML files.","Final Draft is a simple program to install and use. If you discover that you need more help, you have many support options available. Email and online chat are both accessible through the Final Draft website. You can also browse through the FAQs section online."]},"id":"e19ca9c2-0bb9-4041-977d-9fc1b6170b14","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7c33507a-9f30-4a4d-881d-2ef799140eaf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Final Draft is the best script program for adding text to your comic books and graphic novels.
