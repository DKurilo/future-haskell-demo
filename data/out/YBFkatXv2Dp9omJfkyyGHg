Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you work from home or have a small business, the Epson WorkForce 3620 can print, copy, scan and fax, and it has a myriad of wireless connectivity options. ","The WorkForce is an inkjet printer, which means it uses ink cartridges to print text and images onto paper. You can wirelessly send print jobs to it using several wireless solutions. With your Windows computer, you use Epson Remote Print, which is a simple program that enables you to easily send projects to the printer as if you were plugged into it with a USB cable.","This all-in-one printer has a black-and-white print speed of 19 pages per minute. It can also print color at 10 pages per minute, which is slightly above average among the printers we reviewed.","It has a resolution of 4800 x 2400 dots per inch (dpi). This means that the prints the WorkForce produces excellent quality. In fact, you can also print detailed photos using this printer.","The WorkForce has scan, copy and fax features. This makes it useful for a small office or a home office. There is an automatic document feeder (ADF) for the faxing and scanning part of the printer, so you won&#39;t have to manually feed each page of a multi-page document into the scanner. It can hold up to 25 sheets. This feature is somewhat rare in a printer at this price point.","The printer can handle a workload of 20,000 pages per month. This is exceptional for an inkjet; most high-workload printers are expensive laser printers. The paper tray is on the small side for such a workhorse; it can only hold 250 sheets.","It uses four ink cartridges that you can buy from Epson or an office supply retailer. The standard-capacity cartridges yield around 350 pages, but you can also buy high-capacity tanks that give you 1,100 pages.","It has a scanning resolution of 2,400 dpi, which is a high enough resolution to scan photos as well as documents. Additionally, it can send faxes at up to three pages per minute. It makes black-and-white copies at 17 pages per minute and color copies at nine pages per minute. Both of these speeds are excellent for a printer at this price point.","If you&#39;re a Mac user, you can connect to the WorkForce using AirPrint, which is an Apple utility that lets you print wirelessly from a Mac computer. You can also use iPrint, Epson&#39;s app for Android and Apple devices, to send print jobs to the WorkForce from your mobile device.","Like many newer wireless all-in-one printers, the WorkForce has a touchscreen you can use to cycle through commands. It has physical buttons as well. It comes in a modern black-and-gray color scheme that fits in most office decors. Because it weighs over 21 pounds and is 22 inches deep, you&#39;ll need a large area to put it in.","Epson offers phone and email support. We were a bit disappointed with the quality of phone support we received when we called to talk about the printer. The representative was friendly and professional but had only minimal knowledge of the printer. We were placed on hold while the representative researched a fairly basic question.","The company ships the WorkForce 3620 with a one-year warranty. You can also buy an upgraded warranty to expand your coverage. "]},"id":"67ff9e28-6d85-4c54-af5e-bb28fceb9fca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e2f614ad-95bb-4261-8e09-71641cfe151f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Epson WorkForce 3620 has excellent resolution and high enough speed to handle the workload of most small offices.
