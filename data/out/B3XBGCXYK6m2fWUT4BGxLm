Only one other camera in our review produced similar results, the <a href=\"/nest-cam-review\">Nest Cam Indoor</a>. Overall, the daytime video is clear and captures movement without any visible distortion or lag.","The D-Link DCS-2630&#39;s field of view is 180 degrees, the widest in our review. This lets you see everything in front of the camera&#39;s lens, though there is a slight distortion at the edge of the video frame, as the camera&#39;s lens has a fisheye effect.","At night, the camera lost much of the quality we saw during the day. We could identify people closer than 10 feet, but we had difficulty seeing details past that. While the camera&#39;s infrared LEDs are very bright, they tend to wash out objects close to the lens. Similarly, the sound quality doesn&#39;t compare well with that of other cameras, making it harder to understand what people are saying."]},"id":"348c9ee1-5bc9-4119-86c8-956b4d949453","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience &amp; Operation"},"id":"cfd92a5d-5a1f-4ff6-9855-95d3785d0ae1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/2afTGBfgs5KWg5guDzFvih.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68483-dlink7.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2afTGBfgs5KWg5guDzFvih.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"2afTGBfgs5KWg5guDzFvih","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2afTGBfgs5KWg5guDzFvih.jpg","alt":""},"id":"af292c18-dea7-4303-92eb-068e06ef7ce4","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This wireless security camera is easy to set up and use.
