The target audience Rockwell markets this device to is individuals in need of a truly portable circular saw, and they deliver quite magnificently.","As a miniature circular power saw, it has a blade diameter of 3 3/8 inches, which means a maximum cutting depth of 1 1/16 inches. While this reduces its application to smaller or thinner material projects, this doesn’t detract from its overall power and ability. It has a 4-amp motor that easily competes with larger and bulkier machines. It can fit into small spaces that larger tools cannot, and it makes rip and plunge cuts with astonishingly accurate results.","At the front of this power tool is the Laserguide, a proprietary technology used by Rockwell that projects a triangle-shaped line of light onto the surface ahead of your cutting path. This gives you a longer line of sight on the cutting path without needing to see the blade path directly. This laser projects a beam of light several inches long onto whatever surface you’re cutting to provide even greater accuracy when performing a job.","The Rockwell RK3440K VersaCut is designed ergonomically to reduce user fatigue, largely by placing the motor at the rear of the device along the handle rather than to the side. This not only disperses the weight of the device, but it also reduces cutting vibrations that would normally strain arm and hand muscles. By extending the motor and handle behind the blade, this also allows the power cord to remain out of the way when cutting – almost like you’re using a cordless circular saw.","This device succeeds largely in its goal of providing a low-weight and high-performance circular saw for DIYers and professional carpenters. Because of its small size, it may not provide the greatest cutting depth, but it still proves more than capable of cutting even the toughest materials."]},"id":"39d60fde-1512-447b-a4e2-b6f5527e245b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57503","url":"/rockwell-circular-saw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
