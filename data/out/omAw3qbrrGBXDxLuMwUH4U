Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Based on the delightfully wacky Nickelodeon character, SpongeBob SquarePants Typing is a basic learn-to-type application that teaches essential keyboarding skills. This <a href=\"/best-typing-software\">typing software</a> is tailored more for children than adults, with minimal functionality and bright, colorful graphics.","However, SpongeBob SquarePants is a viable option if you are an adult looking for game-based typing instruction to help you learn to type.","SpongeBob SquarePants Typing consists of 20 typing lessons. While most typing software aims to increase both your typing speed and your accuracy, this one is primarily focused on accuracy. It teaches proper finger-to-key movement to ensure accurate typing, though it does track your words-per-minute (WPM) rate, too. In addition to the lessons, the typing software provides game and practice areas where you can gain additional keyboard practice. This application does an excellent job of making typing instruction seem more like fun than like actual work.","There is no question that this typing software makes learning to type more enjoyable than many other applications do, but it is not nearly as feature-rich as other products on the market. The software does not offer any learning tools beyond its lessons, such as dictation practice, video instruction or numeric keypad instruction. SpongeBob SquarePants Typing also has limited reporting capabilities. The software only tracks your progress by keys and does not show progress reports for individual fingers or hands. It also does not display a total number of errors after testing, and only text progress reports – no graphs – are provided. The software does not place much emphasis on goal setting, either; you cannot input typing goals you want to reach, and this typing test software does not recommend performance goals for you.","Although it may not be expansive in its features, SpongeBob SquarePants Typing is intuitive and easy to use. You get a helpful user guide that explains how this typing software works. You get a neatly organized index of the contents and, for additional help, the company&#39;s website offers phone and email help, along with answers to commonly asked questions."]},"id":"5a3ca960-290e-483a-945f-f75b9e2d30cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4355ce84-11b6-4355-88b1-8e5face7aba0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SpongeBob SquarePants Typing is a fine product for youngsters, and somewhat surprisingly, adults with rudimentary typing skills can learn a great deal from this typing application as well.

A colorful keyboard, basic instruction and some lighthearted games all add up to an enjoyable experience that gets your fingers on the keys and gets them moving."]},"id":"06f82909-00d7-479b-9f10-4d51e2a733c8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54382","url":"/spongebob-squarepants-typing-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-02-07T16:56:25Z","datePublished":"2012-02-07T16:56:25Z","name":"SpongeBob SquarePants Typing","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":60,"verdict":"Although it is intended primarily for children, adults with rudimentary typing skills can learn something and be entertained in the process with SpongeBob SquarePants Typing.
