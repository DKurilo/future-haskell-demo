Shockwave is an appropriate name. As with any <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">RC electric boats</a>, the smoother the water, the better the boat will maneuver over it. However, with its deep-V design, which simply means that the boat has a distinctive V-shaped design from all angles, even its bullet-like profile, it can plow through the waves like a champ, at 20 miles an hour or more, regardless of the conditions. The Pro Boat Shockwave racing boat encompasses a little bit of everything, which is one of the best remote control boats available."]},"id":"ba2f0769-eec2-4ef9-91fe-db52a589d945","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a118b00d-fec4-486b-b015-cc3d55ca3944","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pro Boat Shockwave is a great boat that maneuvers well in the water in any kind of conditions.
