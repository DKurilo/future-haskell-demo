They are trying to position themselves as one of the key players in the market with models such as the HL47XT1. The Haier HL47XT1 looks like just about every other LCD TV on the market. It is plain black with the Haier logo centered below the screen. The speakers are bottom mounted which allows for a narrower cabinet design. The TV comes with a matching pedestal base which also swivels allowing the TV to be positioned for optimal viewing angles.<br/> "]},"id":"77419cef-3c1c-4155-92c0-49c47d16596b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"1a7226f9-597b-4223-b964-18c46f46fcb2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["LED lighting is becoming more commonplace on LCD televisions. Using an LED backlight allows the TV to more faithfully reproduce the brightest whites while still maintaining detail in the darker scenes.

Having a faster refresh rate means there will be less motion blur. Motion blur can be noticed on anything from scrolling credits to sporting events. With 120 Hz the images will appear to remain focused.","The included 4 HDMI connections provide ample connectivity options for just about anyone. It is no longer necessary to unplug one device to plug another in.
