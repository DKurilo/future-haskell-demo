Walkers such as the <a href=\"/carex-review\">Carex Rollator</a>, <a href=\"/hugo-review\">Hugo Explore</a> or <a href=\"/invacare-review\">Invacare Rollite</a> make it possible for individuals with both diminished balance and decreased upper body strength to move around inside and outside of the home.","In addition to wheels, many rolling walkers come with accessories that increase your ability to enjoy mobility outside of the home. Seats and backrests let you rest while waiting in lines or catch your breath when no bench or chair is nearby. Storage options, such as baskets or bags, keep your personal or medical items handy.","<strong>Rolling Walkers: What to Look For</strong>","Walkers   with or without wheels   come in a range of types and sizes. Optimal safety and comfort require a walker that fits your height and weight. Here are a few more criteria to take in to consideration as you shop around:","<strong>Sizing &amp; Weight Requirements</strong><br/>Both wheeled walkers and those without wheels come with weight restrictions. Standard walkers tend to support between 250 to 300 pounds, depending on the model. Individuals weighing over 300 pounds might want to look for a walker classified as a bariatric walker. Walkers feature push-button adjustments for height, letting regular models serve most adults. Extremely short adults may need to opt for a youth walker for maximum comfort.","<strong>Two or Four Wheels</strong><br/>Although some specialty rollators feature three-wheel construction, most rolling walker options come with two or four wheels. Two-wheeled walkers look just like standard walkers, except they feature wheels on the front two bars. This lets you lift lightly on the back end and push the walker forward easily. Two-wheeled walkers are covered by many insurance plans; even when the wheels aren&#39;t covered, the walker is, and you can pay a small additional price to upgrade to a walker with wheels.","Walkers with four wheels don&#39;t require any lifting to move across level ground and feature more accessory options than two-wheeled varieties. However, rollators and other similar models are not always covered under insurance plans, as they are seen as luxury items.","<strong>Safety Features</strong><br/>The most important safety feature on a 4-wheel walker is the handbrake, which provides control during operation. Look for models that include locking wheels, especially if you intend to use the seat on a regular basis. Optimal seated stability usually requires both the seat and a backrest.","<strong>Personalized Options</strong><br/>Two-wheeled walkers may be available in several colors, but they are limited when it comes to other options. Walkers with four wheels often come in a variety of colors or patterns, letting you select a product that matches your personality. Wheel options include standard or rugged wheels, and accessories include seats, backrests, handles, storage devices and decorative items.","Select the walker that is right for your needs and size for maximum comfort. You&#39;ll use a walker with a proper fit more often, increasing mobility and overall physical exercise for better health."]},"id":"276093c7-62e1-43b0-ac12-30062948f793","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"691b9fe2-5ebc-49ae-8bc5-b552900f623d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AEGC9Y/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66840[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Carex</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HXZWR10/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66846[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Comodità</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWK07I/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66842[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Drive Deluxe 2-button</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005S1CHKC/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66841[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Drive Medical 4-wheel</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NGUD76/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66848[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Duro-Med</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3ECRCQ/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66843[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Healthline</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IV0AB0/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66844[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Hugo Explore</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DR00DO/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66845[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Invacare</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VNZT0/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66847[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Medline</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016JDB8W/?&tag=ttr_rolling-walkers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1521[art|NA[pid|66849[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Nova</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0ae17b02-e0b1-476f-9f09-740c8c57783c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1521","url":"/best-rolling-walkers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-10T21:36:02Z","datePublished":"2015-09-23T18:52:45Z","name":"Rolling Walkers Review","synopsis":"Rolling walkers help increase mobility for injured, recovering or elderly individuals.
