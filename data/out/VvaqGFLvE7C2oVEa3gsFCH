For example, the FCRA allows employers to consider bankruptcies only within the previous 10 years. Other factors, such as civil judgments and collection accounts, remain usable for only seven years.","Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sets forth stringent requirements for employers who run criminal background checks. Employers cannot discriminate against potential employees based on their criminal records. For example, businesses must treat all applicants equally; they cannot deny an application based on criminal convictions for one candidate, then approve another with the same background.","However, some industries require special consideration. People who work in finance, healthcare, childcare, education, and other sensitive industries undergo more thorough background checks. Employers can use criminal records to deny employment applications in these industries because of the potential dangers.","For example, a bank might not hire a candidate with a criminal record for theft or other financial crimes, while a school might decline to hire a teacher with a history of violent offenses. This protects the people and assets with which those candidates would otherwise work.","Conducting a background check protects businesses, landlords, parents, and numerous other interested parties. Using a top-rated background check service allows you to rely on the information you uncover and to trust the efficacy of the data in your report. If you discover negative information about a potential employee or associate, follow the laws of your state to make an appropriate decision."]},"id":"33053b2e-c65f-4a54-a6a5-5a2b3f1b9f8f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9357","url":"/how-far-back-do-background-checks-go","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-09T02:28:55Z","datePublished":"2015-04-09T02:28:55Z","name":"How Far Back Do Background Checks Go?","synopsis":"Employers, landlords, and parents in need of childcare for their kids represent just a few of the groups of people who conduct background checks on a regular basis.","review":{},"strapline":"Employers, landlords, and parents in need of childcare for their kids represent just a few of the groups of people who conduct background checks on a regular basis.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-09T02:33:18Z","id":"VvaqGFLvE7C2oVEa3gsFCH","meta":{"title":"How Far Back Do Background Checks Go?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
