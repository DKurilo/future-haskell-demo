You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Horizon Fitness T101 is the most inexpensive <a href=\"/best-treadmills\">treadmill</a> on our lineup, though it has many tools that compete with the best treadmills. This folding treadmills offers various workout programs and built-in speakers. However, it lacks the motor power and other features of the best running treadmills.","The Horizon Fitness T101 is sufficient for few runners, as the treadmill is not as stable as heavier models in our review when you’re running at full speed, but it’s ideal for walking or light jogging. This treadmill’s 2.25-horsepower motor can maintain a speed of 10 mph, which is slightly lower than the industry standard of a 3.0 continuous-duty horsepower motor with a max speed of 12 mph.","The tread surface is 55 inches long, which is shorter than average and may be problematic for tall runners or those with a long stride. You can adjust the incline up to 10 percent for a more challenging workout, but many other treadmills go up to a 12-15 percent incline. The weight limit is 300 pounds, which falls about 50 pounds short of the average limit.","The workout programs for this walking treadmill are a great addition and give you a lot of value. The programs included are steps, calories, distance and intervals. The speed and incline controls are easy to use, and there are quick-touch controls as well, which is a necessary feature when doing intervals. Additionally, it features 30 workout programs, though only for a single user profile, so different members of your household can’t customize them to their needs. The built-in speakers and fan are especially nice to have, letting you listen to music and stay cool while you exercise. You can even monitor your heart rate and basic workout state on the display.","This treadmill folds away when not in use and has a small footprint in the storage position. It weighs 165 pounds, which is about 100 pounds lighter than most other treadmills on our lineup, making it more manageable. This is especially important if you are elderly or need to regularly move it in and out of storage. It measures 70 x 34 x 55 inches, which is about average.","The Horizon Fitness T101 has decent warranties. In case the frame or motor needs to be replaced, they are covered by a lifetime warranty. The parts and electronics are each protected for two years, and labor has a one-year warranty. These warranties aren’t quite as extensive as those of other treadmills. You can contact the company by email, phone or live chat. You can also download a PDF user manual and view FAQs on its website."]},"id":"244093ca-6d72-4d58-abc8-8b2e61c6ec38","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"89109e3e-f5bd-4aeb-9859-19c706b3027a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In terms of quality and warranty, the Horizon Fitness T101 treadmill falls short of those at a higher price point.
