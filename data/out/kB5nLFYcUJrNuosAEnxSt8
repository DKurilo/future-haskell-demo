Our testers agreed that MyMemories offers quality designs that look modern and are varied enough to work for many different occasions. This software allows you to work with different page sizes so you can determine how large or small you want the scrapbook to be. However, you cannot add videos, links or music to your albums. You can also use the Color Picker to see a preview of your image or pick a color you want to match elsewhere on the page. Aside from page design you can also edit photos. This includes red-eye reduction and cropping but not the detailed editing you would get from another application like Photoshop.","Read the full review here: <a href=\"/mymemories-suite-review\">MyMemories Suite 9</a>"]},"id":"0c09a8b9-52fe-4348-bafd-17d6e4eb8f45","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Pro: It works with Mac and PC","Con: You can’t add music or video clips to your projects."],"type":"ul"},"id":"32f95ba7-301f-4b39-92da-42f232cb977d","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Memory Mixer 4 - Best Budget</strong>"]},"id":"7f7a4d6e-e313-4227-9978-b4551667965e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/nsj9ugJXWh3gSscJNLnFt9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/ttr/comparison/89/Digital-Scrapbook-Software-Memory-Mixer-4-001.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsj9ugJXWh3gSscJNLnFt9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"nsj9ugJXWh3gSscJNLnFt9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsj9ugJXWh3gSscJNLnFt9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b9916a0a-f73f-4914-b671-d831fadb03f4","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Memory Mixer 4 gives you a lot of tools and convenience for your money.

We had in-house design experts evaluate the quality of graphics available from each software publisher. The designs that come with each program represent raw materials only, so the designs you create with them will depend on skill level, personal taste and other factors. For truly professional-level designs you would want to hire a professional.","Editing tools can make a big difference in terms of convenience because you can edit and make your layout in one place rather than switching back and forth.

The best software makes features and tools easy to find. Most of them took just a few clicks to download, but some were not that simple. A few programs take a long time or make the process difficult, which we note in the side-by-side comparison.

The most recent methods of digital scrapbooking can make it seem less feasible to showcase anything besides photos, but some software makes allowances for things you don&#39;t want to scan in, or that would look silly as a scan.","You can still attach three-dimensional items like mementos and embellishments after you print your electronic scrapbook if the digital versions are not quite enough to quench your creativity. You can glue a real button over the top of a digital one, for instance, or just save a spot in your layout where you want to put one when you print. You can attach an actual program of a child&#39;s Christmas pageant to your printed digital layout after the fact, for example, instead of scanning it in or leaving it out of the book altogether. Or if you prefer to leave your memories in a fully digital format, some software lets you add video and music to create a multimedia digital scrapbook. ","<strong>Sharing Your Designs Online</strong>","After spending hours editing photos and designing beautiful layouts for your cherished memories, you may want to share your efforts with friends and family. However, this can be difficult if they don’t live near you or if you primarily share snapshots of your work through email. By turning to social media, you can share an image, or even a handful of them, in an instant; then, anyone can look at your stylish scrapbook layouts and enjoy them wherever they are.","<u>Photo storage sites</u>. You can opt to save your digital images on a website specifically designed to handle photo storage, such as <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shutterfly.com/photos/\">Shutterfly</a> or <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/\">Google Photos</a>, among others. These sites make it easy to store, organize and share your photos whenever you want. You can keep groups of photos together, label them, tag people and sort through all your photos without any fuss.","It’s worth noting that many of these sites offer basic free services as well as mid-tier and premium plans. Typically, premium plans include unlimited storage and access to all of the service’s features.","<u>Social media</u>. Once you’ve figured out how to store your photos online, you may want a place to share them with your family, friends and followers. We recommend using social media sites. Instagram is a great site for visual media, and it has myriad thriving art, photography and scrapbooking communities. You can also share your digital layouts on sites like <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\">Snapchat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>, <a href=\"https://ello.co/\">Ello</a>, <a href=\"https://visual.ly/\">Visual.ly</a> or <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>.
