You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","MSI has several all-in-one PC models, including the new MSI Wind Top AE2240. The MSI (Micro-Star International) Wind Top line of all-in-one computers are collectively impressive, and vary slightly in design, processor, monitor size and other specs. The Wind Top AE2240 has a healthy balance of physical design, hardware specs and additional features. The MSI Wind Top all-in-one PC features a multi-touch full HD display and versatile connectivity options. It’s an all-around performer with a particularly strong showing for multimedia applications.","While it’s not the biggest, fastest or most powerful all-in-one PC, the MSI Wind Top AE2240 is one of the most all-inclusive AIO (all in one) desktop computers in the sub-$1000 price range. The 21.5-inch LCD easel-stand all-in-one computer has all the right features built in, including:","8X Super Multi DVD drive<br/>6-in-1 card reader<br/>Microphone<br/>1.3 megapixel webcam<br/>5.1 channel speakers","The MSI Wind Top AE2240 also features the proprietary MSI touchscreen interface. While it’s not the best multi-touch implementation we’ve used, the innovative controls are worth consideration.","System Features<br/>The all-in-one PC is equipped with an Intel dual-core processor, specifically the Pentium P6100 or i3 350M. This processor is commonly used in notebook computers and is the sixth generation of the Centrino platform (aka Calpella). The all-in-one computer comes installed with the 64-bit platform of Windows 7 Home Premium.","With 2GB of DDR3 system RAM (expandable up to 8GB) and an impressive 640GB hard drive, the MSI Wind Top AE2240 clocks in at 2GHz. The monitor is a 21.5-inch LCD (1920 x 1082) display with full HD, 16:9 aspect ratio and touchscreen capabilities (optional). The easel-stand design features white and clear plastic (black also available) with connection ports discreetly located on the side and in the back.","Input and Output Features<br/>The MSI Wind Top All-in-One PC has all the connectivity options you need, including HDMI and VGA. The all-in-one supports wireless networking (802.11 b/g and n) but also comes equipped with the traditional Giga LAN (Ethernet) port.","The all-in-one PC has a 6-in-1 card reader for XD, SD, MMC, MS, SDHC and MS Pro cards. It also features an eSATA port for file transferring at the speed of 3GB/s. There are also six USB 2.0 ports. The keyboard and mouse are wireless.","The integrated stereo speakers are two 3W 5.1 channel speakers with THX TruStudio PRO technology for optimum sound and simulated surround sound capabilities.","Help &amp; Support<br/>MSI’s online service center is the best place to start for help and support. There you can find answers to common questions, warranty information, troubleshooting tips and driver downloads. Technical support is available through email."," "]},"id":"870f47c6-265b-4012-84db-e683d574f3b8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5d01cfb-8d66-40ba-a3be-2651f21ba5aa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MSI Wind Top AE2240 is an impressive all-in-one computer with a good combination of features.
