You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you’ve recently had all your company’s vital information scanned into a document-management system and want to remain paperless, the powerful Epson Workforce DS-560 is a viable option for your business and among the best <a href=\"/best-document-scanners\">document scanners</a> on the market.","The Epson Workforce DS-560 is compatible with most document-management systems, so scans from the machine can be seamlessly added to any existing document repository. It was also one of the faster scanners we reviewed, with a page scan rate slightly over the company’s stated 26 pages per minute.","The automatic document feeder (ADF) holds 50 sheets of paper at a time. You can scan letter-size paper, legal-size paper, business cards and plastic credit cards effortlessly, thanks to a system that straightens skewed documents, removes blank pages, recognizes receipts and scans to searchable text documents automatically. At 11.7 x 6 x 6.1 inches and 5.5 pounds, the machine is small and portable, and it fits on almost any work surface without being intrusive.","In addition to being small, the Epson Workforce DS-560 desktop scanner is wireless and can sync to all of your mobile devices. This means you are not tied to your computer when scanning, and you can even activate your scanner with a mobile device and look at your finished scans on your phone or tablet. You can also save your scans to a long list of cloud applications or storage destinations like SharePoint, Evernote, Google Drive, SugarSync and more. A networking router is available as an optional purchase, but it costs almost as much as the scanner and you need additional software to use it.","While Epson doesn’t offer help over live chat, phone numbers for the company’s scanner support reps are clearly posted the website. Emailing the company takes a little more effort – you have to go to Support, choose your model number and press Contact Support, where you will finally find an email address. When we made contact, our emails were answered by well-informed agents in a prompt and courteous fashion. Drivers, downloads, FAQs, support videos and more are found on the website. The warranty on the Epson Workforce DS-560 is the standard one year, although you can purchase one of Epson’s extended service plans."]},"id":"5902bd13-fd24-4432-a9ef-ed25d02987da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"673c18e3-9f88-4781-947a-d90f9b2c04d9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Epson Workforce DS-560 is a fast and reliable document scanner that can send scans directly to an existing document-management system, as well as a vast array of cloud services.
