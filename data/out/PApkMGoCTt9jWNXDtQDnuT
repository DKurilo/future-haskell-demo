The suite embraces interactive design tools that will enable you to pump out professional results in the following design areas: Vector illustration, Page layout, Digital editing, Web graphics and animation.","<strong>Pricing</strong>","This is one of the most expensive programs we tested, costing $400. Considering it comes with five other programs it’s a pretty good deal — as long as you are willing to pay that much. Fortunately, you can determine if you like the software using the 15-day free trial before making the purchasing decision.","When we downloaded CorelDRAW Graphic Suite, the following five programs were loaded on our computer: CorelDRAW - vector illustration and page layout software, Corel Capture - screen capture software, Corel Connect - a content browser and file management program, Corel Font Manager - font library manager and Corel Photo-Paint - a photo editing software. With these programs at your disposal you’ll be able to create just about any graphic design project you can think of.","Although you must open each of these applications separately to access their individual tools, all include similar elements that build upon one another, not unlike Adobe’s Creative Suite. For example, if you are using CorelDRAW but need to edit an image, you can use Corel Photo-Paint. Once you have tweaked your images in this application, you can open the file in CorelDRAW to add vector elements.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong>","While testing this software, we found that CorelDRAW Suite offers many of the advanced tools you’d get with the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite so you can create professional-level work. Yes, CorelDRAW Graphics Suite is a bit difficult to use if you have never used design software before, but honestly, all of the best graphic design software packages have a vast number of tools, which is actually a good thing. You won&#39;t be overwhelmed forever. Just read the manuals, watch the video tutorials and visit community forums. You will become an expert soon enough. If you’d prefer something more beginner friendly, we recommend <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/adobe-photoshop-elements-review\">Photoshop Elements</a>.","<strong>Illustration Tools</strong>","Included in the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite is Photo-Paint. This raster-based application (meaning it works with pixels instead of vectors) is an excellent solution for editing photos. Industry standard tools, such as layers and color management, as well as a full menu of filters and effects, ensure quality editing and retouching. The Smart Carver tool, for example, allows you to remove unwanted elements from any photo, and the application will automatically adjust the aspect ratio of the edited photo. There are also a number of other notable tools and features, including 3D imaging, masks, panoramas, retouching, smart filter effects, RAW camera support, drawing, painting and filling","<strong>Photo &amp; Image Editing</strong>","When you first open this graphic design software to create a new document, a window will appear asking you what kind of document you would like to create. You can choose the typical page size, 8.5 x 11 inches, or choose from a list of options, including letter, tabloid, envelope, broadsheet, web page, web banner and more. You can also set your own custom dimensions if you&#39;d like.","This graphic design suite has innumerable tools and features for you to use to create an eye-popping graphic layout, but it is missing some of the basic elements, including initial setup options. We are disappointed in the lack of column setup that would be common in a DTP graphic software program. Other graphic design applications allow you to choose a layout with two, three, four (or more) columns, ideal for newspapers and magazines.","CorelDRAW graphic design software will allow you to import text sources from most major document formats, including Microsoft Word and Excel. You can make the textual elements on your page come to life with images, and you can easily and gracefully wrap text around any object or shape.","When it comes to multi page projects like magazines, newspapers and the like, you can place page numbers, graphics copyright or any other desired information on your master page. The application will then apply the information from the master to every page, saving you time (and a headache).","A large library of templates set to industry specs and laid out by trained graphic designers is available for you to use. We love the idea of templates because they will help you achieve the results that you crave and allow you the freedom to exercise your creativity, while still helping you learn the ins and outs of the design software.","CorelDRAW offers a very clean and usable interface. All the standard tools are available to let you create sleek, smooth and colorful graphics, including logos, cartoons and interface designs. Plus, this application features an alignment guide that will help you position objects quickly and efficiently. CorelDRAW also offers raster-based effects without requiring that you open a separate raster-based application.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>","Corel provides forums and video tutorials online as well as in-program help. Navigate to the Learn section of the program’s welcome screen to access these features. You can also contact a customer representative through email, phone or live chat should you need additional help.","CorelDRAW, like many of the best graphic design software applications, has an overwhelming amount of features in its arsenal – so many, in fact, that it takes hundreds of pages in the user guide just to explain them all. And remember, this is just one of the applications you have access to in the CorelDRAW Design Suite. You can access the Learning Center and detailed user guides online at Corel.com. Here, you will find online tutorials, live training, webinars, tips and tricks to get you started.","CorelDRAW Graphics Suite brings some real graphic designer solutions to the table. You can use this design software if you are a professional graphic designer quite easily. If you are new to the world of graphic design, you will experience a steep learning curve. However, Corel does offer a huge array of training materials that will make the process less painful."]},"id":"9ac03412-f72c-4d01-a869-07a3ea9c611d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70379","url":"/coreldraw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-05T21:51:55Z","datePublished":"2019-03-05T21:51:55Z","name":"Do not use 2019","synopsis":"When it comes to graphic design software, CorelDRAW is a jack of all trades.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"Once you become familiar with this application, CorelDRAW Graphics Suite has some of the best and most powerful offerings, coupled with an easy-to-navigate interface.
