You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With hidden hinges, a contoured door, and a smooth finish, the <strong>LG LSC27914SW</strong> is an eye-catching <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a>. It comes in smooth white, smooth black and stainless steel. The refrigerator has 26.5 cubic feet of storage available to accommodate food for up to six people. Users have commented that they always have plenty of room, even during Thanksgiving and Christmas.","The LG LSC27914SW has three adjustable shelves, two of which are slide-out shelves. Each of the shelves is spill-proof, which helps users by preventing small spills from spreading to other areas of the side-by-side refrigerator. The shelves also have handles that are easy to grip, making it simple for users to adjust and slide the shelves in and out.","This side-by-side refrigerator has two humidity controlled crispers, while most other refrigerators only have one. Out of the four door bins, three of the bins are adjustable and gallon size. In the freezer, there are three wire shelves, four door bins and one slide out basket. These storage options help users make their refrigerator more organized, therefore decreasing the time a user spends looking for foods stored in the refrigerator. LG believes that users should not have to spend minutes looking for food, so they’ve included features, such as the slide-out shelves, that allow users to access their food quickly.","The freezer uses frost free technology to defrost built-up ice. This defrost system works automatically, so users do not need to spend time setting timers or worrying about when the freezer needs to be defrosted.","The ice maker uses Ice Plus, which recycles the water that drains from the ice machine. This water is used to cool other areas of the ice machine that produce heat. Because the Ice Plus technology reduces the need for cooling in the freezer, it saves energy, makes the ice maker more efficient and lowers a user’s utility bill.","The sophisticated digital controls on the dispenser display allow users to choose between water and crushed or cubed ice. The control panel will inform users when to order and replace the water filter. They can also change the temperature of the refrigerator and freezer and lock the settings from the control panel. Also, a door alarm will sound if the refrigerator freezer is open for too long.","One of the features that impressed us about this side-by-side refrigerator is the LoDecibel Operation, which reduces the sounds made by the refrigerator. We value this feature in this refrigerator because we&#39;ve heard the noise made by models of other brands. With the LoDecibel Operation, users will not have to complain about the LG LSC27914SW.","LG provides a one-year warranty for the parts and labor of this side-by-side refrigerator. It is important to realize that LG makes all their own parts, so it will take longer to obtain parts when ordering replacements. On the other hand, the parts users receive will be more reliable in the long run because they are made specifically for LG refrigerators, instead of being generic parts for any refrigerator."]},"id":"645e1e66-5474-4e2b-8332-b81b99b1c700","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3830d94e-52df-47b6-987c-d32c1d54dca0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>LG LSC27914SW</strong> is a smart choice in a side-by-side refrigerator.
