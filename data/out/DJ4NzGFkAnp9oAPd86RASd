You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","RAVPower is best known for manufacturing replacement laptop and cellphone batteries, along with external battery power banks. However, the company also makes AC adapters and <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1290-best-qi-wireless-chargers.html\">wireless chargers</a>. The RAVPower RP-WCN7 charging pad is the RAVPower&#39;s first, and it definitely delivers.","This charging mat has a power output of 5 volts. This isn&#39;t awful, but it&#39;s not awesome either. The best wireless chargers have outputs of around 12 volts. With less power, it will take a little longer to charge your devices with this model than it would with more powerful options. In our testing, it took to 3 hours and 35 minutes charge a Nexus 5 smartphone with the RP-WCN7. The device will charge your phone even if it has a case on it.","A microUSB cable and an AC adapter are included in the box, so you can start charging your device immediately. It&#39;s advantageous that the charger utilizes microUSB because you can easily swap cables if you need a replacement, or you can use the pad with your car charger.","The inductive charger uses the Qi-standard making it compatible with most smartphones. It is possible to use the charger with some tablets, too. For example, Google and Asus&#39; Nexus 7 tablet would work well with it. Since tablets have larger batteries, it will take longer to charge them.","Since RAVPower specializes in batteries, it is one of the few companies that also manufactures and sells wireless charging receiver tags for various smartphones. However, the company only has them for Samsung&#39;s Galaxy S series and Galaxy Note line of smartphones. All you have to do is pop off your device&#39;s back battery cover and stick the receiver card to the battery.","This wireless phone charger is one of the few out there that is portable. The device is super thin, even smaller than a deck of cards. It is about the size of a Samsung Galaxy smartphone and measures 5.7 x 3.11 x 0.31 inches. You can easily wrap up the cord and toss it in a bag or purse.","As for design features, the charger has a large rubber ring that will keep your phone from sliding around. It also has a LED light, which flashes back and forth between red and white when your device is charging. When it isn&#39;t charging, the light shines a solid red. Since the light flashes, it can be incredibly distracting in a dark room and has the potential to keep you awake at night if you charge your phone overnight on a nightstand.","RAVPower offers a one-year warranty with its wireless charger. You&#39;ll also find email, telephone support and a FAQs section on the company website."]},"id":"142264aa-c916-46d9-87fa-7fa6511d692c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce58e37e-335e-4ec0-8440-f0f6517ba754","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, what makes the RAVPower RP-WCN7 stand out most is its compact size, its thinness in particular.

Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t as powerful as other chargers out there, but it still works well to charge your mobile devices wirelessly."]},"id":"ed13c55c-f52f-4eb6-9e6f-00a6d8f71236","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60154","url":"/ravpower-wireless-charger-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brandon-carte","url":"/author/brandon-carte","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Brandon Carte","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"Y2ioFDbnwaDrRNArHcGhXX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-05T22:10:04Z","datePublished":"2014-08-05T22:10:04Z","name":"RAVPower Wireless Charger RP-WCN7","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":79,"verdict":"RAVPower&#039;s RP-WCN7 takes a bit longer to charge your phone than other wireless chargers, but it is slim, sleek and portable.","pros":["This charging pad is very thin and portable."],"cons":["The indicator light on the front flashes when your device is charging, which has the potential to hinder sleep if you keep it on a nightstand."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-05T22:10:04Z","id":"DJ4NzGFkAnp9oAPd86RASd","meta":{"title":"RAVPower Wireless Charger RP-WCN7 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The RAV in RAVPower stands for reliable, affordable and value, but does the RP-WCN7 wireless charging pad deliver those three qualities?
