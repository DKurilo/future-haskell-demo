The slim black player looks sleek and modern, matching other modern electronics, but it does have a slightly cheap feel to the chassis and buttons. Although the player is packed with all the features most people want from a DVD player, and works well overall, it does have the slowest disc playback start time we logged in our tests.","With the DVP-SR510H, you can enjoy any movie in full 1080p high definition. The automatic resume feature on this device works better than any other that we tested. It can mark and remember where you left off for the six most recent DVDs you watched. All of the others in our comparison can remember one at best. It also lets you choose how fast or slow you want playback to be. You can push it up to 1.5x, if you simply want to scan through a movie or audio, or you can opt for slower playback, and you’ll still be able to hear audio. It also supports high-quality Dolby audio and multiple language audio and subtitles.","It has a handy 1080p upscaling feature, which can improve the quality of old, low-resolution movies. You’ll need to connect the player to your TV via an HDMI cable, then you can enjoy improved image quality with smooth playback. The Sony unit can play standard as well as rewriteable CDs and DVDs. It supports CD-R/RW, DVD-RW/+R/+R-DL and DVD-RW/-R/-R DL discs. And if you want to play digital media, it supports MP3, JPEG, AAC, WMA and linear PCM file formats. The player also has a JPEG slideshow option to let you browse your digital photo files, and you can even add background music with an MP3 file.","In our tests, this DVD player was easy to set up, and both the device and the included remote control were easy to use. They both have a slick and clean design, and their buttons are clearly labeled and easy to press. The player is short but still fairly wide, so if you prefer a more compact DVD player, check out the <a href=\"/craig-cvd401a-review\">Craig CVD401A</a>. On the rear of the Sony player, you have a USB port as well as RCA and HDMI connections. It only supports region 1 DVDs.","The player ships with a one-year warranty for parts and a 90-day warranty for labor. If you have a question or concern regarding your Sony player, you can contact their technical customer support team directly via chat, phone or email. Or you can peruse all of the informational resources hosted on their website at your leisure, if you want to troubleshoot an issue on your own or simply learn more about your player."]},"id":"dfa1f131-3d26-41d5-9763-ed378f97f67c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70206","url":"/sony-dvp-sr510h-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-07T15:50:50Z","datePublished":"2018-09-07T15:50:50Z","name":"Sony DVP-SR510H","synopsis":"The Sony DVP-SR510H DVD player lets you enjoy your favorite DVDs and CDs.
