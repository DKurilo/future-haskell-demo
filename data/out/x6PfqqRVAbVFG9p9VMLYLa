Brushless motors provide increased speed and durability, and they require less maintenance than an average motor. They can therefore increase the motor’s longevity and make for a smoother, quieter ride.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"85a7c356-27b2-47fd-a7d9-ce40bf79cba1","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" The boat is ready to run out of the box, aside from applying the decals and installing the eight AA batteries into the transmitter. No assembly is required to race it on the water. This fiberglass boat is durable, but it&#39;s also a little lighter than some of the other top RC boats, so the tendency to capsize is somewhat greater than the heavier boats in our lineup. When you get the hang of it and ease into the higher speeds (and this boat is quite fast at its top speeds) the results are better.","The overall maneuverability is quite good. Capsizing shouldn’t be a problem as long as you pay attention and ease up on the throttle every once in while, especially when you&#39;re buzzing over choppy waters. This RC electric boat is a blast to play with on virtually any body of water.","The Aquacraft Supervee comes with a 90-day warranty, which for an RC boat isn’t bad and should give you plenty of time to put it to the test during its warranty period.
