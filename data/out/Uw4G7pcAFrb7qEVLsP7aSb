You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Garmin Nuvi 66LMT is a <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> with a dual-orientation display and a touchscreen. It has a large, 6-inch display that&#39;s quite easy to read. The touchscreen interface uses resistive technology, instead of the capacitive technology that makes smartphones so responsive, so the touch interface won&#39;t be as smooth as your smartphone.","One of the strengths of this device is that it comes preloaded with a map of the United States (minus Alaska), so you can navigate as soon as you turn the device on. It also comes with map updates for the life of the device, so you&#39;ll know that your route is always current.","This car GPS also comes with lifetime traffic updates. This means that you&#39;ll receive updates about the traffic ahead, and the unit will recalculate the best route based on that information. Unlike some competing GPS systems, the Nuvi 66LMT has a built-in traffic receiver, so you won&#39;t have to pair it with your smartphone to receive traffic updates. This preserves your smartphone&#39;s battery and data allocation.","Unlike some of the best navigation GPS units, the Nuvi 66LMT lacks voice-activated navigation. You can&#39;t verbally command the unit, which is one of the best features of smartphone navigation apps.","It does have lane assistance, which helps you get into the correct lane prior to a turn. This can help you avoid a last-second lane change. It also has a speed limit indicator, so you can see your current speed as well as the speed limit of the road you&#39;re traveling on. One feature that the Nuvi 66LMT doesn&#39;t have is 3D maps. These make navigating more intuitive by simulating the height of the objects around your route.","This unit comes with a mount that connects to your vehicle&#39;s cigarette lighter outlet. It also has a rechargeable battery that lasts about one hour.","Garmin has exceptional customer service. Its phone representatives have excellent knowledge of the products, and it also offers email and social media support. The Nuvi 66LMT ships with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"e2dfc148-d58c-4880-88a0-eaa65e661b53","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bfdb3135-57a9-4d25-82b6-2fa3692ebf72","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nuvi 66LMT has the advantages of a 6-inch screen, lifetime maps and lifetime traffic.
