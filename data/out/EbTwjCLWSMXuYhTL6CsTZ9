The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">Wireless Keyboards and Mice</a> here.</em>","The Logitech M535 has steady build quality and scrolls decently well on a variety of users. In our benchmarking, we tested the wireless Bluetooth mouse on surface types you find in a typical home or office environment. The M535’s performance on standard wood and laminate desks was smooth, but it struggled on less-traditional surfaces.","Responsiveness on denim and carpet was slightly dull, and the mouse was unusable on marble and glass surfaces. The M535’s performance on glass wasn’t surprising, as sensor responsiveness tends to be poor on glass surfaces for all but the best Bluetooth mice. However, the Logitech’s jumpy performance on our marble surface – which simulates a home countertop – was remarkably lackluster.","In our hands-on testing, we found that the M535 falls in line with comparable budget Bluetooth mice. It’s constructed from plain plastic and features a lightly rubberized rim along its edge. Basic gesture support is also available when you install Logitech’s support software. With its curved profile, the mouse can easily be used with a variety of grip styles and either right- or left-handed, thanks to its ambidextrous design. Its build quality isn’t exceptionally sharp, but the mouse is durable enough to use for extended work sessions and to travel with.","At only 2.9 ounces, the Logitech is extremely light and comfortable to use. Much of the mouse’s weight comes from the single AA battery it uses for power, as the M535 – like most budget mice – lacks a rechargeable battery. With its budget billing, the mouse is also missing premium features like Bluetooth channel switching, but the Logitech still includes support for four-way scrolling, which is often only found on more upscale mice. To browse horizontally in large documents like photos or PDFs, you simply have to push the scroll wheel to the left or right. We found the M535’s four-way scrolling to be responsive and a strong addition to the Bluetooth mouse.","Logitech includes a one-year warranty for the M535 and provides support through channels including phone and email. Manuals and a FAQs section are additional troubleshooting sources for technical issues.","The Logitech M535 is a relatively straightforward mouse, but it benefits from this narrow focus. While its performance isn’t without some blind spots, consistent build quality and four-way scrolling make it a versatile option for home users."]},"id":"99fb3668-220a-4cee-acb0-649b7c7f3c65","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69390","url":"/logitech-m535-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-30T13:39:18Z","datePublished":"2017-05-30T13:39:18Z","name":"Logitech M535","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","id":"EbTwjCLWSMXuYhTL6CsTZ9","meta":{"title":"Logitech M535 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Though its sensor&#8217;s performance can be inconsistent, the Logitech M535 is still a strong option for the home users."},"products":[{"slug":"logitech-m535","url":"/product/logitech-m535","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","name":"Logitech M535","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","id":"W32wW6fBcqPGGy3XAqwCb9","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/oMAi4ZentsCprWhz5e2Jo.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","mimeType":"","name":"15ba97831638d1b6b582f61f7477914b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/15ba97831638d1b6b582f61f7477914b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","id":"oMAi4ZentsCprWhz5e2Jo","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oMAi4ZentsCprWhz5e2Jo.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Logitech M535 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Though its sensor&#8217;s performance can be inconsistent, the Logitech M535 is still a strong option for the home users."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/oMAi4ZentsCprWhz5e2Jo.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","mimeType":"","name":"15ba97831638d1b6b582f61f7477914b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/15ba97831638d1b6b582f61f7477914b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","id":"oMAi4ZentsCprWhz5e2Jo","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oMAi4ZentsCprWhz5e2Jo.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Logitech M535 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Though its sensor&#8217;s performance can be inconsistent, the Logitech M535 is still a strong option for the home users."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/logitech-m535-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"computer-peripherals","url":"/electronics/computer-peripherals","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","name":"Computer Peripherals","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:29Z","id":"f5QRUZiDRiDGdoHsnjAiKg","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
