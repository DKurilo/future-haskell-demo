The 12-hour to 40-hour battery life is also longer than most of the Bluetooth headphones we reviewed.","Harman Kardon headphones are renowned for superior sound quality and the BTs are no different. With 40 mm drivers and a wide frequency response of 16Hz to 20kHz you&#39;ll hear full bass and pure trebles. This set also functions in passive mode so you can keep listening with a cable after your battery dies. However, they are missing the active noise-cancellation feature that many comparable Bluetooth headphones possess.","The design of the Harman Kardon BT headphones is a bit different than most. Square ear cups, instead of round ones, surround your ears in soft leather. This 9.9-ounce design takes some getting used to before the headphones become more comfortable. Similar to most of the top Bluetooth headphones, the battery on this set can last 12 to 40 hours on one charge, which is above average for battery life. A few remote buttons are also located on the ear cup so you can answer calls and switch songs.","For wireless listening, you can be up to 25 feet away from your Bluetooth-connected device without losing connection. This is a bit less than the average Bluetooth headphones, but 25 feet is still more than sufficient for walking around with your headphones on. A detachable cable is also included so you can listen with a wire should your battery run out.","Harman Kardon provides email and phone support contact information on the website should you have any questions about this pair. A one-year warranty also covers the Harman Kardon BTs from defects. The user manual and FAQs are also available on the website."]},"id":"54f4b966-c55f-47da-8454-b18296b99908","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"81a24577-7623-44ca-a3bd-28029abdf8b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Harman Kardon BTs are some of the best Bluetooth headphones for their stylish design and long battery life.
