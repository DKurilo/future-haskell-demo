Its oversized wheels are located in the center of the head of the machine to give it more balance and power. Although Oreck <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaners</a> do not have automatic height adjustment features, the large wheels allow them to clean a wide variety of surfaces, including high-pile carpets.","This efficient machine has a direct suction motor, meaning the dirt lifts directly into the bag instead of winding through tubes. The brush rotates at over 7,000 revolutions per minute on high speed to agitate dirt so its powerful suction can lift it. It uses a HEPA inner bag that filters 99.97 percent of particles and releases clean air into your home. This means it retains pollen, mold and animal dander in its filter instead of blowing it back into your house like lower-quality cleaners.","This upright vacuum cleaner has a power switch located on the handle that allows you to adjust between two different speeds as you move from carpets to hard surfaces. The lower speed works better on hard surface flooring while the high setting tends to scatter debris. The grooves in the front of the machine allow for continual airflow so that it can clean tall carpets without air blockage. That also helps when you transition from a flat surface to a dense carpet.","Of all the vacuum cleaners we reviewed, the Oreck Magnesium is the lightest. Weighing 7.7 pounds, this bagged machine is easy to carry up and down stairs. We were impressed with its lightweight, sturdy frame.","This vacuum has a flat-to-floor profile. That means the handle will recline back flat to the floor, allowing you to reach under furniture. The top of the machine is soft so you don&#39;t have to worry about bumping into your furniture and causing damage. It is also equipped with a 30-foot power cord.","Oreck has service centers in almost every major city, and the company is easy to contact by email and telephone. The information on the Oreck website is impressive and covers a wide range of topics. If you need help with technical issues, you may want to contact a local dealer."]},"id":"12fb185a-2437-4039-81c7-5574b1a0b20c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1650864c-1993-4786-889b-98d5882500d6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Oreck Magnesium series of vacuum cleaners are ultra-light yet have powerful suction combined with high-quality filtration systems.
