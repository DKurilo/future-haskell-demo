You can make simple graphics, paintings and drawings. The software is relatively simple to use, with a clean interface and dozens of backgrounds and layouts.","This vector-based application offers shapes that include stars, polygons, rounded rectangles, arcs and wedges. It has a series of palettes – including for styles, clip art, fonts and colors – to help you easily create digital designs.","This Mac drawing software has a freehand line tool, which automatically smooths the rough edges that come from drawing with a mouse. This improves the quality of your artwork, making it look more professional.","You can create lines with adjustable stroke widths and colors. The strokes themselves can be decorated with arrows, zigzags and other icons. It offers Bezier curves for vector precision and basic clip art images to use in your artwork. However, you cannot convert images from vector to raster, meaning your files will be much larger. Vector is good when working for print, but raster images are much better for web design.","With this Mac drawing app, you can place text along a line or path, and convert text to editable shapes. This gives you complete control over how your words look in your drawings. You also can create and save paragraph styles to use in future projects.","Artboard lets you work in layers, so you can work on different components of your drawings separately. You can lock layers and turn visibility on and off to make editing your drawings easier. This Mac drawing software offers brush tools for painting and filters to apply effects to objects. It lacks distort tools that let you manipulate shapes and text.","Artboard offers 55 templates, which are divided into backgrounds and several different types of blank, standard papers. The background templates are attractive vector designs. Popular layouts are available, including business and greeting cards, invitations, graph paper, signs, and fliers. You can also create and save your own templates. Artboard offers 18 drawing tools, including a Cut Path tool, which lets you snip out certain sections of an image, and a Style Dropper tool, which is similar to a Color Dropper tool, but it picks up textures of an image rather than just color.","One of the most notable Artboard features is the ability to drag and drop or import images to incorporate into your artwork. This simplifies the workflow and lets you edit and use images to embellish your designs. You can also pull out ruler guides and turn on the snap-to function to ensure perfect alignment of objects. This Mac drawing software is compatible with pen tablets to let you draw designs as if you were using a real brush, pencil or pen.","Customer support for Artboard is available via email and telephone. The company&#39;s website provides access to user message boards and video tutorials. In addition, there is a FAQs page where you can find answers to common questions, and an in-depth PDF user manual to teach you how to take full advantage of this application&#39;s functions and tools.","Artboard offers backgrounds for your designs, as well as hundreds of clip art images and drawing tools. This vector-based program does not let you convert images between vector and raster, and it lacks distort tools. Nevertheless, its set of features and tools make it a good option for creating digital artwork."]},"id":"e2cb27c5-c79f-4810-9373-54c5430ecc85","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52668","url":"/artboard-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-04-28T23:43:50Z","datePublished":"2011-04-28T23:43:50Z","name":"Artboard","synopsis":"Artboard by Mapdiva is Mac drawing software that offers ample features, tools and usability components to help you create any artwork you want for personal and professional purposes.
