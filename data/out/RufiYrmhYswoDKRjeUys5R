To check if your Kidde smoke detector is part of the recall, we encourage you to visit </em><em>Kidde&#39;s recall website</em><em>.</em>","We gathered the most advanced smoke detectors on the market and spent more than 40 hours installing, evaluating and testing them in our laboratory. In the end, we found that <a href=\"/nest-protect-review\">Nest Protect</a> is the overall best smoke detector you can buy because of its great performance on our detection tests; plus, it’s easy to install and integrates into several smart home automation systems. Its mobile app can manage not only your smoke detectors, but any Nest smart home product you happen to own. You can get instant alerts, test your devices and even hush alarms right from your phone. This product stands head and shoulders above the competition and is the flagship of next-generation smoke detectors.","However, if you’re looking for something simpler, the <a href=\"/kidde-review\">Kidde Smoke and CO Alarm</a> is our pick for the best value. It is the least expensive of all the smoke detectors we reviewed. It’s easy to install because it requires no hardwiring, and if you buy more than one, you can interconnect them through your Wi-Fi network. This allows them to talk to each other and sound alarms simultaneously throughout the house, telling you what kind of danger has been detected and how to proceed.","Another smoke detector worthy of note is the <a href=\"/first-alert-review\">First Alert Onelink</a>. While it’s not as easy to use, and didn’t perform as well on our tests as Nest Protect, it’s still a fine smoke detector that will keep you and your family safe. Expect First Alert Onelink to last a full decade, with a warranty period that covers it the entire time. Its handy mobile app ensures that you’ll know within seconds if there’s a problem in your home – no matter where you are."]},"id":"61bd5430-2498-445c-b5d2-a27868880d01","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"How We Picked the Best Smoke Detectors"},"id":"c4c30046-df46-4b47-86f2-6183b14b9ee2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What kinds of detectors did we consider?</strong>","There are thousands of smoke alarms brands and models to choose from. You can pick up a conventional smoke detector for just a few bucks and it should work with no problems. But the best smoke detectors do more than blare an alarm when it detects danger. For our review, we picked the most advanced devices available – they’re more expensive than traditional smoke detectors, but they’re worth the extra cash.","The best smoke detectors come with a mobile app for your phone or tablet that lets you monitor your home – and notify you if there’s a problem – no matter where you are. Mobile apps also allow you to contact emergency services remotely if there is a fire in your home when you’re not there.","Modern smoke detectors also connect to your home’s Wi-Fi network. This not only connects the devices to their respective apps, but it’s also important if you’re installing a smoke detector as a part of a larger smart home system. A Wi-Fi connection is essential to keep everything working together.","<strong>How did we test them?</strong>","Once we gathered the most advanced smoke detectors we could find, we spent more than a week installing them in our laboratory, using their apps and testing their detection capabilities. We noted how easy each device was to install, learn and use, and we tested how effective they were at detecting danger.","In our detection tests, we hardwired each smoke detector to a power supply in our laboratory. We then sprayed each device with an aerosol smoke-detector-tester spray from 5, 10 and 15 feet away, and we timed how long it took each alarm to go off. Only Nest Protect passed all the tests we put to it. All the others failed at the 10 or 15-foot mark.","<strong>The Best of The Rest: Other Detectors Worth Considering</strong>","While Nest Protect, First Alert Onelink and <a href=\"/halo-review\">Halo+</a> nabbed the top spots in our review, there are other devices worthy of note.","If you already have conventional smoke detectors in your home and can’t afford to upgrade to the more advanced devices, the Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight is perfect. It’s a simple listening device, connected to an app, that plugs into a wall outlet and listens for smoke and carbon monoxide alarms in your home. When it detects an alarm, it notifies your mobile device that there’s a problem. It provides a recording of the alarm and even lets you notify emergency services right from the app. It’s a great, inexpensive alternative to the more expensive smoke detectors we reviewed.","If you’re looking for a more comprehensive smart home solution, you may want to check out the <a href=\"/asante-review\">Asante Smoke Detector Kit</a>.  It’s part of Asante’s wider home automation system that also includes garage door openers and irrigation controllers. Just know that the Asante package isn’t as easy to install as the rest of the products we tested, since it requires its own Wi-Fi network to function properly.","A top-notch smoke detector is a critical element for a safe home. And today’s modern technology has taken these devices to the next level. We spent more than a week using, installing, testing and evaluating the best smoke detectors on the market today. When we finished, we determined that the best products are Nest Protect, First Alert Onelink and Halo+. These products performed well in our tests and provide that extra layer of security for your home.","<strong><em>Contributing Reviewer: </em></strong><em>Danny Chadwick</em>"]},"id":"c5c1bffa-5676-4437-b926-f737da1d0f79","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1260","url":"/best-smoke-detectors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-23T19:35:42Z","datePublished":"2017-09-14T21:49:05Z","name":"Best Smoke Detectors","synopsis":"Smoke detectors can save lives, but some have more features than others and may perform better in detecting fire or carbon monoxide.
