You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Danby DAC060EUB2GDB is a powerful <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioning unit</a>. This device can cool up to 250 square feet and has a temperature range of 62.6 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, it is an energy efficient product and has a high energy efficiency rating (EER) of 11.2. This product also features three cool and fan speeds that give you several options to create the right temperature and humidity level for your room. It is a large window AC unit and includes an expandable window installation kit to help it fit in large windows.","This Danby window air conditioning unit is a powerful device, featuring 6,000 British thermal units (BTU). This amount of energy allows you to cool up to 250 square feet. Additionally, although not the widest on our lineup, the unit has a wide temperature range. You can set the thermostat on this product anywhere between 62.6 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Furthermore, you can choose between three different cooling speeds and three different fan speeds.","Even though this product is powerful, it is an Energy Star qualified device. It has an EER of 11.2. This is an excellent score, as the best room air conditioning units have a rating of 10 or greater. In addition, an estimated annual energy cost for using this AC unit for eight hours a day over a three month period is $45.71. This is less than many similar products on our lineup.","The large number of settings and features on this product makes it easy to use. In addition to the three fan and cooling speeds, there is also a dry setting that helps remove excess moisture from the air. This is a benefit if you need to control the humidity in your home.","Additionally, the unit comes with both energy-saving and sleep modes. Both of these modes can keep you cool and help you save money on your electric bill, and they are not found on many similar products.","This product works best in rooms with large windows, as the unit is bulky. It is 13.3 inches tall, but it requires a window at least 14 inches tall to fit correctly. Additionally, this Danby window AC unit is 18.56 inches wide and 15.75 inches long. It weighs approximately 52.8 pounds. If you have a window larger than these specifications, this Danby product includes an expandable window installation kit that allows it to fit in windows between 23 and 26 inches wide. A window mounting kit is included with this air conditioner.","A one-year manufacturer appliance warranty is included with this window air conditioner. However, it also includes a five year compressor warranty, which is excellent and one of the best warranties we saw on this type of device."]},"id":"ba6da99d-de0f-4744-bd52-d48ef895bf54","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a0be7d28-599f-47ef-bef3-0ee821ddaa07","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Danby DAC060EUB2GDB is an air conditioning unit with plenty of power to cool up to 250 square feet.
