As the first handheld video game console to make use of dual-screens, touch-pad and internet connectivity, the Nintendo DS stood head and shoulders above all other handheld consoles. Despite the emergence of its chief competitor, the <a href=\"/psp-3000-review\">PSP</a>, the Nintendo DS has fared very well, managing to sell more than 77 million units before its redesign, the <a href=\"/best-video-game-consoles\">Nintendo DS Lite</a> was released.","The Nintendo DS Lite arrived in mid 2006 to instant acclaim. Having shaved off some weight, trimmed down its dimensions, extended its battery life and improved the brightness and durability of both the top and bottom LCD screens, the new and improved Nintendo DS Lite met with quick success that has continued well into its second year on the market."]},"id":"8a264d7d-d300-4e9f-904c-3d7545d13c36","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though the computer specs remain the same from the original Nintendo DS, the improved size translates to better performance and longer battery life, greatly benefiting game play and other media functions.
