You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This unique <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">ride on toy</a> is sure to make children feel like they&#39;re driving in style. The Silver MP3 Kids Ride on Remote Control Power Wheels Car is equipped with the interesting feature of an MP3 adapter so young drivers can listen to their favorite tunes while cruising the neighborhood. Just make sure they&#39;re not texting while driving.","It comes with all the basics your child needs to drive, such as a steering wheel, gas pedal and seat belt. When you first open the box, you&#39;ll find an electric car, rechargeable battery, battery charger, remote control and instruction manual. After that, it&#39;s as simple as charging the car and hitting the road. The remote control requires batteries, which aren&#39;t included, so you&#39;ll need to find some if you want to drive the car with the remote to ensure your child&#39;s protection before they get behind the wheel.","Like most remote control Power Wheels vehicle sets, this one includes a remote control for adult supervision. This acts as a manual override if your child is going somewhere they shouldn&#39;t or if you spot oncoming traffic in the neighborhood and want to make sure your child doesn&#39;t go out into the street. The remote control will always supersede the car&#39;s built-in controls, so you won&#39;t have to worry about your child fighting you for control of the wheel.","This car comes partially assembled, with the front steering gear already installed and the rear motor in place. The car&#39;s battery should already contain a partial charge straight out of the box because the manufacturer tests most units prior to shipping. The instructions for piecing together the rest of the car are quite straightforward and easy to understand, which means that within 45 minutes, you&#39;ll have the car ready to go. This RC vehicle is built for durability, and you&#39;ll quickly notice there are countless metal braces and brackets underneath the plastic  molding.","The MP3 player attribute of this car is a simple jack for plugging in existing separate MP3 players. The car does not actually have an MP3 player installed in it. The steering wheel has a number of buttons that children can push for things like the horn, turn-signal sounds and music.","While the vehicle&#39;s size may make it a good purchase for children between the ages of two and three years only, it is still an excellent value for the price. This remote control Power Wheels car was built with an exceptional level of quality, apart from some minor molding and sticker bubbling."]},"id":"668518b9-bde8-4b40-802c-96cfe9c4b82c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55386","url":"/mp3-kids-ride-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-15T17:13:54Z","datePublished":"2012-11-15T17:13:54Z","name":"MP3 Kids Ride","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-11-15T17:13:54Z","id":"htfVDgaWyC28n9mtr7owge","meta":{"title":"MP3 Kids Ride Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Start training your kid to drive a real car with this exceptional MP3 kids ride-on toy vehicle.
