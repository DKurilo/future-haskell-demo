Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer is a <a href=\"/best-juicers\">robust juicer</a> that extracted an impressive amount of fluid in our testing, so you get the maximum amount of juice from any of the fruits and veggies you run through its grater. It’s equipped with a nozzle that extends out from the machine quite a bit, which is helpful in avoiding messy drips.","Unfortunately, this machine does not come with its own pitcher, unlike many of the best juicers. However, the length and configuration of the nozzle help when it comes to capturing juice since you can easily use a simple coffee cup or drinking glass to get the vitamin-rich liquid. However, without a pitcher that includes a froth/pulp filter, you need to use a mesh kitchen strainer or other device to remove any of the unwanted froth or pulp for a smooth drink.","This juicer did a good job in all our tests, above average in terms of juicing yield. When pulverizing soft produce, it produced plenty of juice with scarcely any froth. The process seems unnecessarily complicated in some ways, though. With hard produce, we needed to cut an apple in fourths to fit it into the feeding tube and cut beets so they wouldn’t jam on the plastic fin on the bottom of the tube. Some of the best juicers can handle whole beets without cutting. However, with the Kuvings, we didn’t need to exert very much pressure on the pusher device to juice hard produce and we got plenty of liquid from our produce.","Grinding up leafy greens proved to be an easy task that, once again, created very little froth for us to strain. Despite the usefulness of the machine’s nozzle, some liquid did drip, so when you take this juicer apart, tilt the nozzle end up slightly so it doesn’t spill any liquid.","It took only 45 seconds to assemble this juicer, making it one of the easiest, and 5:10 minutes to clean it, which is in the middle of the pack. This machine comes with a cleaning brush. The grater, which is a pesky part, was quick and easy to clean. The removable parts of this juicer machine are dishwasher safe, which is another bonus.","The centrifugal juicer is equipped with eight parts and three buttons: Off, Turbo and Slow. We liked two of the safety features found on this juicer, namely the rubber feet that help keep it in place on the counter and two safety clips on either side of the machine to hold the lid in place.","This juicer rumbles a bit when you first turn it on and is a bit loud at the beginning as well as when it is slowing down after it has been turned off. Its noise level measured 89 dB, which is above average.","The Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer was noisy and it sounded like it was in pain but it worked well overall. It was in the top half of the lineup in terms of juicing yields, offering plentiful amounts of froth-free, pulp-free juice."]},"id":"dc02fded-ac3a-4724-952f-124fd3d6790c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62844","url":"/kuvings-centrifugal-juicer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-19T16:39:46Z","datePublished":"2015-02-19T16:39:46Z","name":"Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer NJ-9500UB","synopsis":"The Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer is a robust juicer that extracted an impressive amount of fluid in our testing, so you get the maximum amount of juice from any of the fruits and veggies you run through its grater.","review":{"rating":89,"verdict":"The Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer gave us a decent amount of juice, especially on the greens and other soft produce.","pros":["You can drink the juice directly from the machine without straining it since it produces very little pulp."],"cons":["The plastic fin at the bottom of the chute makes for more prep work."]},"strapline":"The Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer is a robust juicer that extracted an impressive amount of fluid in our testing, so you get the maximum amount of juice from any of the fruits and veggies you run through its grater.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-19T16:39:46Z","id":"R2SeUe5Zqt4JCFmf56SQu5","meta":{"title":"Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer NJ-9500UB Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kuvings Centrifugal Juicer emits plenty of juice, leaves little pulp and is easy to clean.
