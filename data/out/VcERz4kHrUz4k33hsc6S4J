We’ve tested each one on a variety of fabrics, including cotton, polyester, denim and silk. Our expertise with these laundry appliances has grown with each test, and we’ve learned what to expect from the best irons.","We&#39;ve also asked people who know irons to help us understand what matters for this type of product. Quilters use irons during their creative process and they need one that works well on lots of different fabrics in order to get the ideal finished product.","&#34;A regular iron just won&#39;t cut it. I have to have a top-quality iron,&#34; said Brooke Johnsen, a Utah-based quilter and member of the Modern Quilt Guild.","Johnsen said if the fabric is not creased by the iron correctly she has to redo her sewing, so she looks for a heavy iron with even heating across the whole surface. Bonnie Browning, executive show director with American Quilter&#39;s Society, agreed that heft and even heating are what counts for the precise ironing that quilters do.","&#34;When we quilt we really just press – lifting the iron up and setting it down, letting the iron do the work,&#34; Browning said.  ","Even heating combined with steam capabilities is important for everyday ironing, according to Matt Kosloske, senior product marketing manager with Spectrum Brands, which includes Black &amp; Decker and Russell Hobbs.  ","&#34;All irons heat up, steam is what makes the difference,&#34; Kosloske emphasized.","Kosloske indicated that the right sole plate and water tank size matter, too. If you are ironing a lot it might be worth it to invest in easy-glide ceramic, but stainless steel will work fine if you iron less often. Those who iron every day need larger water tanks. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We meticulously inspected and compared the most important features of each iron, such as steam output, weight, heating time and cord length. We found that the best steam irons have safety features that turn off the iron if it’s left unattended for a short amount of time, or tip over, and have easy-to-read controls you can adjust easily. The comfort of the handle was also a serious consideration in our testing.","In our evaluation process, we tested each iron&#39;s steaming, ironing and safety capacities. We used the clothing irons on a variety of everyday fabrics and some nicer fabrics, such as silk, and looked for good performance. For steaming, we noted how well the steam controls worked and whether they could remove wrinkles as well as a vertical iron. We also checked to see if each iron engaged its timed safety shut-off feature when tipped or upright, as claimed by the manufacturer.","<strong>How Much Does an Iron Cost?</strong>","We tested irons that cost an average of $43 and come with large water reservoirs, responsive steam settings and quite a bit of power. There are irons available for closer to $10, but they usually have fewer features and don’t work as well on delicate fabrics.","<strong>Performance: High Wattage &amp; Steam to the Rescue </strong>","If you find a steam iron with high wattage, you may suddenly find yourself doing less work when it comes to ironing clothes. More power means more efficient ironing, a higher steam capacity and less work for you per garment. An iron with a large number of steam holes can also produce fuller steam bursts. Additionally, adjustable steam gauges let you have control over how much steam you use at a time, if any. If you plan on using a lot of steam, you will want to look for units that have short steam regeneration times between bursts.","There are multiple kinds of soleplate shapes as well, the most common of which are the standard U shape or a tapered shape, which makes it easy to iron around buttons, collars and other tricky areas. It is also important to have irons with nonstick soleplates that stay clean or are at least easy to clean. Look for a self-cleaning function, as well as anti-calcification and anti-scale systems, all of which work to reduce and remove impurities from the inner soleplate area of your iron.<br/><strong><br/>Ease of Use: Let Convenient &amp; Easy Work for You </strong>","The best irons feature a long cord, providing you more freedom of movement as you iron, which is especially important if you are doing a sewing or quilting project. It should also have additional helpful features, such as a temperature alert to let you know when the iron is ready to use, and, for digital irons, an intuitive interface that is easy to figure out and adjust.","It is important to find the right balance of weight, size and usability. While it is true that a slightly heavier iron lends itself well to smooth passes over fabric, an iron that is too heavy or bulky is difficult to use, especially if you have a lot to iron. Whether you just need to touch up a dress with a steamer or do your whole family&#39;s ironing, your iron should be comfortable to hold. Look for an iron with an ergonomic grip so your hand and arm won&#39;t get as tired as you work. A great iron has all of its buttons and dials within easy reach of the handle so you don&#39;t have to strain yourself.","An iron with a water reservoir of at least 8.5 ounces, like the <a href=\"/black-decker-d2030-review\">Black &amp; Decker D2030</a>, lets you keep ironing for longer between refills. And when you do go to refill your iron, it shouldn&#39;t be yet another chore. A quality steam iron is easy to fill, with wide water ports, a transparent reservoir and accurately marked fill lines.<br/> <br/><strong>Safety: Don&#39;t Get Burned </strong>","It can be easy to forget you have an iron plugged in if you get an unexpected phone call or are watching a gripping TV show while ironing your favorite T-shirt, but most modern irons have you covered. Make sure you consider irons with safety features, such as automatic shut-off. Most irons are programmed to shut off in about eight to 15 minutes if left unused in the upright position, or in 30 seconds if left tipped over or face down. This feature can prevent you from having a burnt garment or worse damage.","<strong>Warranty: Irons Should Work as Hard as You Do </strong>","You need a clothing iron that can stand up to everyday use. Even if you don&#39;t use it that often, you should still look for one that comes with a manufacturer&#39;s warranty in case of damage. Some irons come backed by a comprehensive five-year warranty, while others only offer a short one.","<strong><br/>More Laundry Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"2aebcfbe-f1e3-43a1-8ba2-4455344bc9fd","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-washers-review\">The Best Washing Machines Overall</a>","<a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">The Best Washer-Dryer Combo Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">The Best Top-Load Washers</a>","<a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">The Best Front-Load Washers</a>","<a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">The Best Portable Washers</a>","<a href=\"/best-dryers\">The Best Clothes Dryers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4e1a9f77-f85e-4452-8087-1873cbaa108c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_111","url":"/best-irons","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angela-parkinson","url":"/author/angela-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Angela Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4mNVTVXMirWtTXf6QMhCjd","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-23T00:09:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-23T00:09:00Z","name":"Best Irons of 2019","synopsis":"We tested each iron's steaming, ironing and safety capacities on linen, cotton, denim, wool, polyester and silk.
