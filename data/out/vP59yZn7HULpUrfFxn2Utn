You’ll need a smartphone, tablet or similar device to use this train, which has both ups and downs. While it’s pretty cool to be able to run the train from the small computer you carry around in your pocket every day, it’s not ideal for young kids who would have to ask to use Mom or Dad’s phone every time they want to play with the train.","That being said, the free E-Z App is pretty cool. Setup takes two seconds as all you have to do is download the app and turn the train on. You can speed up or slow down the train using the large slider on the screen and press buttons to make bell and whistle noises. What most of our testers didn&#39;t like is that these noises come out of the phone itself, not the train, so they sound really muted. Our testers were split on the app with some enjoying its responsiveness and others noting it wasn’t very responsive at all. One tester also couldn’t get the app’s audio components to turn off after exiting the app and ended up having to close it entirely. One reviewer said, “It’s kind of cool, but it needs alternate controls,” so it ultimately earned a B+ for design and detail.","The set comes with 14 pieces of E-Z Track, so it’s incredibly easy to put together. The largest oval you can build is 56 x 38 inches, so it’s pretty midrange in size compared to the other trains we tested. If you want something huge and showy for the holidays, we’d recommend the <a href=\"/lionel-polar-express-train-set-review\">Lionel Polar Express</a>. If you don’t have much space, there’s the incredibly small <a href=\"/bachmann-freightmaster-review\">Bachmann Freightmaster</a>. The track for the Santa Fe Blue Lightning needs to be plugged in for the train to run. If the train’s wheels aren’t aligned correctly the tracks will spark, so we recommend adult supervision. It’s intended for users who are at least 14 years old, which we would say is appropriate. The smaller, detailed parts of this train aren’t going to be appreciated by a toddler.","A few testers pointed out an issue while using the train, and upon further testing they were proven right. This train is slow. Like, really really slow. It went around the track at 0.86 feet per second, the second-slowest train we tested. Only the <a href=\"/haktoys-train-king-choo-choo-series-review\">Hasktoys Train King Choo Choo Series</a> was slower, and that was partially due to how hard it was to keep on the track. In our durability tests where we dropped the engine from a height of about 3 feet this train did fairly well. After two drops the headlamp flickered and by the third it turned off completely and a piece of plastic broke off. It also struggled around the track and moved at an even slower speed after the drops, but it did still technically work, so we gave it a B-. Frankly, nothing about this train stands out aside from its Bluetooth capability. If that’s important to you then you should by all means give it a try, but its lack of speed and fun features like a working smoke stack put it lower in our rankings."]},"id":"75cc7f81-8aec-433e-a289-462eb801418d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70292","url":"/santa-fe-blue-lightning-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-16T21:13:01Z","datePublished":"2018-10-16T21:13:01Z","name":"Santa Fe Blue Lightning","synopsis":"This HO scale train comes with three train cars and a general style locomotive with a working headlamp, though there aren’t any parts that move freely as the train navigates the track.","review":{"rating":62,"verdict":"The Santa Fe Blue Lightning is a rather run of the mill train that left most of our reviewers wanting more.","pros":["It has Bluetooth connectivity."],"cons":["A smartphone or tablet is required to operate the train."]},"strapline":"This HO scale train comes with three train cars and a general style locomotive with a working headlamp, though there aren’t any parts that move freely as the train navigates the track.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-10-16T21:13:01Z","id":"vP59yZn7HULpUrfFxn2Utn","meta":{"title":"Santa Fe Blue Lightning Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Santa Fe Blue Lightning is a rather run of the mill train that left most of our reviewers wanting more."},"products":[{"slug":"santa-fe-blue-lightning","url":"/product/santa-fe-blue-lightning","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","name":"Santa Fe Blue Lightning","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","id":"rzyVMaosQp5a8gbWyBd8xj","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/QmgUEKCD3jPXh4uNdYkSNe.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"96b4505aef3d7791db25f1bfae6846a0.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/96b4505aef3d7791db25f1bfae6846a0.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","id":"QmgUEKCD3jPXh4uNdYkSNe","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QmgUEKCD3jPXh4uNdYkSNe.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Santa Fe Blue Lightning Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Santa Fe Blue Lightning is a rather run of the mill train that left most of our reviewers wanting more."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/QmgUEKCD3jPXh4uNdYkSNe.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"96b4505aef3d7791db25f1bfae6846a0.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/96b4505aef3d7791db25f1bfae6846a0.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","id":"QmgUEKCD3jPXh4uNdYkSNe","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QmgUEKCD3jPXh4uNdYkSNe.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Santa Fe Blue Lightning Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Santa Fe Blue Lightning is a rather run of the mill train that left most of our reviewers wanting more."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/santa-fe-blue-lightning-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"toys","url":"/hobbies/toys","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","name":"Toys","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:27Z","id":"nmskLXysMcqxbkZ6iB2YBG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
