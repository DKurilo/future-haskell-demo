Although most of its dropdown video entertainment systems are equipped with several inputs, high-quality monitors and infrared wireless transmitters for audio, only one model includes a DVD player.","The overhead DVD player from Zicom has a hefty console that fits a built-in DVD player, center controls, a dome light and speakers. It also includes HDMI and USB inputs, a dual-channel infrared headphone transmitter, and an SD card reader. The HDMI inputs turn your flip down DVD player into a full-blown mobile media center because they allow you to connect other devices, such as gaming consoles, to the in-car entertainment system. Additionally, the USB port lets you plug in your smartphone or tablet, so you can screen videos you already have or stream video with an internet connection to everyone in the back seat of your van or SUV. The infrared transmitter lets you use wireless headphones so you can watch movies or play video games privately – and it lets those sitting up front listen to the radio or their own music without being disturbed by the back seat&#39;s entertainment.","Although the screen on Zicom&#39;s flip down DVD player is on the smaller side, the 10.1-inch monitor is widescreen with the standard 16:9 ratio, so your DVDs with letterbox-style playback won&#39;t have black bars taking up space on your screen. The console itself comes in different colors, such as silver, black and tan, all of which blend in with many car interiors.","The Zicom includes a remote control, which lets you quickly pause, play, rewind or fast-forward your DVDs. You also get easy access to menus so you can change the setup, volume or mode of your overhead DVD player.","Zicom&#39;s overhead DVD player includes almost everything you could want in a mobile entertainment system for your minivan, SUV or RV. You get HDMI connections so you can easily add a gaming console, a USB input so you can plug in your smartphone and stream video from movie services, and an infrared transmitter so your passengers can listen to audio through the system using wireless headphones.<br/> "]},"id":"4795734c-7798-4a10-82e4-2dabafe4963d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50598","url":"/zicom-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-31T14:26:19Z","datePublished":"2010-08-31T14:26:19Z","name":"Zicom","synopsis":"Zicom, a sub-company of Accele Electronics, produces a variety of mobile entertainment systems, including flip down DVD players.","review":{"rating":77,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Zicom, a sub-company of Accele Electronics, produces a variety of mobile entertainment systems, including flip down DVD players.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-08-31T14:26:19Z","id":"oo48TccGUkFB7b5wytM5W4","meta":{"title":"Zicom Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Zicom&#039;s flip down DVD player includes a media player, several inputs and infrared transmitters for wireless audio.
