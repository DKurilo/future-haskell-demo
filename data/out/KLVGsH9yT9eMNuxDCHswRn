Despite its smaller 7-amp motor, it handles a variety of cleaning jobs on different surfaces.","This is one of the best budget vacuums for overall suction and power. We tested the suction of each vacuum in our comparison using fine flour and granular pieces of kitty litter to determine how well each vacuum picked up these materials. The Dirt Devil Dynamite Plus was able to handle these different substances with ease.","This upright vac is a great choice for pet owners. In one of our tests, we embedded pet hair in thick carpet. The Dynamite Plus was able to remove every hair after only a few passes. The vacuum has a brush roll button, which allows you to disable the brush roll so you can clean flat surfaces such as hardwood or linoleum without the risk of damaging your floors.","Of all the vacuums we tested, this is by far the most portable and storable. It weighs a light 10.8 pounds and has a compact stick for a handle. The handle retracts, allowing you to fit it into small closets or tight storage spaces.","This vacuum, though compact and portable, does lack maneuverability. The handle and head don&#39;t pivot, which means you have to pull the vacuum back toward you whenever you want to change directions. This is usually the case with low-priced uprights. For something a little easier to move around, check out the <a href=\"/shark-navigator-review\">Shark Navigator</a>.","The Dynamite Plus comes with a variety of tools, including an extension wand, crevice tool and dusting brush, that are all stored on the vacuum. That&#39;s impressive, considering how light and compact this vacuum is.","To use the extension wand and any of the included accessories, you simply pull the hose out, which detaches easily from the back of the vacuum, insert the extension wand, which is attached alongside the body of the vacuum, and fasten the tool to the end of the wand. The extension wand gives you a 5-foot reach.","The vacuum base stores a dusting brush, and the crevice tool fits nicely inside the extension wand. There is no upholstery tool, so this may not be the best vacuum for cleaning dusty curtains or cleaning your car.","On a positive note, the Dirt Devil’s long 25-foot power cord gives you lots of room to vacuum large areas. Despite its lower-power motor, this vacuum does get loud. In our tests, the Dynamite measured 92 decibels. It was the second loudest vacuum we tested."]},"id":"c2826f42-7069-4312-b686-bc14c953bca5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"55817da6-2fbf-45b4-b40c-d766a71e9190","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dirt Devil Dynamite Plus is a smartly designed vacuum that works perfectly for small households, apartment dwellers or college students.
