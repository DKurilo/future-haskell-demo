It can support up to 175 pounds, which is far more than any TV you’re likely to own. With a slim mounting profile that’s just an inch, your TV will look like it’s hung like a painting. It also features anti-theft security features that make it very difficult for anyone to remove your TV from the mount. There isn’t much more you could want in the best fixed TV wall mount.","Fixed <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">TV wall mounts</a> have one purpose – to securely hold your TV on the wall. As long as the mount is capable of holding your TV securely, there’s no reason to pay more than you need to, and you really shouldn’t pay more than $50. At less than $30, the MI-305B provides security, stability and versatility.","On the back of your flat-screen TV, you&#39;ll find a pattern of holes compliant with VESA. This is where you mount the TV to the bracket on the MI-305B, which has a universal VESA complaint design up to 750 x 450, which means that it fits nearly every TV between 32 and 60 inches. Still, you should double-check your TV&#39;s VESA pattern before purchasing a TV wall mount.","The Mount-It MI-305B comes with a lot of mounting hardware, but you won’t use all of it. Rather, the excessive hardware is to ensure that you have everything you need, whether you’re installing it on a double stud, solid wall, metal, concrete or brick. Like the <a href=\"/mount-it-mi-318b-review\">Mount-It MI-318B</a>, this the mount also comes with a built-in level to ensure that you don’t hang your TV crookedly. Still, we recommend using a larger level, as these are more accurate than the small built-in levels.","While this is a fixed TV wall mount, that doesn’t mean you can’t adjust it. The mounting bracket that attaches to your TV can adjust horizontally. It also has three height settings, allowing you to find the right position for your TV even after you’ve drilled the holes and attached the bracket to the wall.","Unlike the <a href=\"/sanus-systems-vmpl50a-b1-review\">Sanus Systems VMPL50A-B1</a>, this TV wall mount has an anti-theft locking bar that makes it extremely difficult for your TV to be stolen from the mount. Thieves would have to tear the TV from the wall, which would be very difficult considering that the mount can support up to 175 pounds. While this is ideal for use in public places like restaurants and public lobbies, it’s also a welcome feature for the home as it keeps the TV in place if curious children try to fiddle with it.","The Mount-It MI-305B may be simple, but it does the job at a fraction of the price of other fixed TV wall mounts. With a heavy-duty design that can support TVs ranging from 32 to 60 inches, it’s our choice for the best fixed TV wall mount."]},"id":"072773f5-8350-4543-841a-f6cf008b57b5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69088","url":"/mount-it-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-02-24T15:47:21Z","datePublished":"2017-02-24T15:47:21Z","name":"Mount-It MI-305B Fixed","synopsis":"The Mount-It MI-305B is a simple but effective fixed TV wall mount that is very affordable and capable of holding almost any TV that measures between 32 and 60 inches.
