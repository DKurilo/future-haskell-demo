It is a simple dual fan cooler designed to keep your laptop fans from kicking into overdrive. The fans pull out hot air and dispel it through the cooler&#39;s vents The fans are quiet, so you can keep this notebook cooler plugged in for an entire eight-hour workday and never notice the sound at all.","This notebook cooler does not have adjustable height. It is made of solid plastic, but  it is not uncomfortable when you use it on your lap. In part, this is because there are no feet protruding from the bottom. It feels just the same as if you had your laptop on your lap. However, in this position the laptop doesnâ€™t stay securely on the cooling pad, even though there are grips designed to keep your laptop secure If you use it on a desk or solid surface, the laptop will stay in place a little easier, but not much.","This cooler is best suited for a very small laptop or notebook. A 14-inch laptop&#39;s edges has at least an inch of hangover on all sides. This laptop cooling pad is compatible with any laptop. An available USB port is all you need for this cooling pad to work, but there are not additional USB ports offered with this cooler. However, there is a place to store the USB cord when it&#39;s not plugged in.","StarTech.com has great customer service. You can find downloadable user manuals on the website, and you can contact the company over the phone, through email, or via social media. There is also a live chat option, and the representatives we spoke with answered all of our questions or put us in touch with the people who could. This cooling pad has a two-year warranty, which is one of the better warranties out there."]},"id":"dd86d687-ed4e-4ad5-9b80-babb3ed4e229","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"109444ab-cb70-4719-95b6-c4d47552bfc8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The StarTech.com NBCOOLERLE is a very basic dual-fan cooler.
