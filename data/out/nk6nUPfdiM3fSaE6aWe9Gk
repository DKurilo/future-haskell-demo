Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Though it has a huge selection of <a href=\"/best-gift-baskets\">gift baskets</a>, Mary Gift Baskets lacks flavor, packaging and unique treats. We recommend that you spend your money on our top-rated gift basket, the Founders’ Favorites Gift Box from <a href=\"/harry-and-david-review\">Harry &amp; David.</a>","After having 20 people try at least five food items in 11 different gift baskets, we’re confident that our taste test is the most comprehensive gift basket testing on the internet. Of all the baskets, the Bountiful Favorites Gourmet Gift Basket from Mary Gift Baskets received the lowest score. Our testers gave this basket an average of 2.17/4, the equivalent of an F rating.","Though this basket tried to include gourmet items, food choices such as a tin of lobster spread and spreadable Monterey Jack cheese received the lowest possible ratings from our testers because they lacked quality and flavor. Our testers consistently ranked foods from this basket the lowest in our comparison.","This company offers kosher baskets but in order to get vegan baskets you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere, like <a href=\"/gourmet-gift-baskets-review\">GourmetGiftBaskets.com.</a> The entire collection of baskets is impressive, however, and you can choose from over 400 different baskets.","This basket shipped in good condition, and there were no problems with the box or the packaging. We appreciated that the basket was secured with bubble wrap instead of the butcher paper that some baskets shipped with. Bubble wrap secured the baskets better than other packing materials – that’s one thing that this company has going for it.","You can purchase baskets from Mary Gift Baskets using your credit card or PayPal account. However, there is no option for overnight delivery. Ground shipping is your only choice. This company can ship to APO/FPO addresses, which is a great benefit if you want to ship to a member of the military who is overseas.","There aren’t any extras you can include with your order, so what you see is what you get. We prefer companies that let you add chocolates, balloons or a greeting card to your order to personalize it."]},"id":"400e13d3-e80b-4d53-a898-2c8adca7c065","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"392f9b32-44e8-4186-aa40-3f1a9ff13219","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bountiful Favorites Gourmet Gift Basket from Mary Gift Baskets has poor-tasting food and a selection that includes spreadable cheese and canned lobster spread – two food items that our panel of taste testers hated.
