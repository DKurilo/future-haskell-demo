They&#39;re especially a great option if you live in a small apartment or have a tight office space. The HP Spectre One 23-e010se has a sleek, elegant design that looks impressive and fits well in every room in your home. However, this beauty comes at a price, and for its class, the tag is on the high-end.","This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one desktop PC</a> has a dual-core i5 processor and a 2.9GHz processing speed that moves fast, so you never have to wait when working on a project for work or watching a movie with friends. It has 6GB of RAM, not the most in its class, but acceptable, and you can run multiple programs comfortably.","One downside of this home PC is that it lacks the touchscreen capability found in almost every other all-in-one desktop. However, the lack of touchscreen functionality isn&#39;t its only shortcoming. The most notable limitation of this PC is that it doesn&#39;t have an optical drive. This means you can&#39;t use the PC to watch DVDS or Blu-ray Discs – it’s only good for streaming media. Your only other option is to purchase a USB-based optical drive and connect it to one of the to USB ports on the system.","Fortunately, the computer does come with HP&#39;s TrueVision HD Webcam. This high-quality webcam will allow for fantastic images while video communicating with others.","HP offers a two-year warranty on the Spectre One, guaranteeing that the PC will stay useful for a while. The actual support site is somewhat clumsy, and whenever we tried to access the live chat feature, we were redirected back to the support homepage. Customer support representatives are available through telephone or email, and once you find the FAQs and downloads, you&#39;ll get the answers you need quickly."]},"id":"6f412980-2134-423d-be11-993a9c845a48","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a468d02f-cf75-4823-b11f-2a41fa625a34","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you buy an HP Spectre One 23-e010se, you&#39;re paying for beautiful design, moderate computing power and an HD webcam.
