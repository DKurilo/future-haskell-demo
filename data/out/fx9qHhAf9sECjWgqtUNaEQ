However, RipIt totally lacks any burning capacity. This is the chief reason it ranks so low in our review of the best Mac DVD copy software.","When you boil it down, this application doesn’t do a lot, but what it does, it does well. Simply put a DVD into your computer and open RipIt. A small screen will pop up with a picture of a DVD and details about the information stored on the DVD you inserted. Then, you hit the rip button.","Once this application is finished with its rip, you are left with a DVD media file. It plays your DVD, menus and all, via the DVD player application, and behaves just like a DVD would. The data is on your hard drive rather than on a plastic disc spinning in the DVD drive.","There are no bells, whistles or distractions from what this Mac DVD copy application is meant to do. One fun detail of the application is the real-time progress of your disc rip on the icon in your application dock. This doesn’t make your disc rip any faster or easier, but it is a nice touch that shows the developers at The Little App Factory are on their game.","There really isn’t a need to do anything more than that if you simply want to digitally back up your DVDs. It’s important to remember that all DVD rippers and copiers do the same thing and most of them are at least double the cost of this application. They try to divert attention away from this by dressing their applications up. This application doesn’t have to do that.","Remember that this DVD copier focuses on the ripping process. Don&#39;t turn to RipIt for creating physical backups of your movies. It won&#39;t and can&#39;t compress double-layer DVDs down to single-layer discs. Not really meant for compressing movie files, it is great for creating digital versions of DVDs on your Mac.","RipIt&#39;s blindingly simple operation is refreshing when technical jargon can overwhelm someone who doesn’t necessarily know about DVD file types. There aren’t strange conversions, raw file formats, code or lengthy waits. Simply put the disc into your computer and hit the rip button."]},"id":"2854c0de-7261-473f-9d3e-facfd15a8315","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2c0e69ef-c515-48b3-9a23-50c4bd715eca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["RipIt is a solid application that performs as advertised.
