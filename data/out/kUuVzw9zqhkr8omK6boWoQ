The original review is below, but check out our current top </em><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\"><em>3D Printers</em></a><em> here.</em>","For ABS printing, the Solidoodle 4 3D printer is a good choice. A few support options are lacking, but if you know your way around a 3D printer, the Solidoodle 4 has everything you need to print sizable, high-quality designs and 3D models.","3D designs up to 8 x 8 x 8 inches are able to print with the Solidoodle 4, which is slightly larger than average for many of the 3D printers we compared. Other Solidoodle models include the Solidoodle 2 and Solidoodle 3, each of which have print layer heights between 0.1 mm and 0.4 mm depending on which print mode and quality you select.","Although this 3D printing system does support PLA, only ABS is fully recommended by the manufacturer. You can, however, purchase universal 3D printing materials in 1.75 mm sizes for the Solidoodle 4. There is only one print head, so you can&#39;t print multi-colored objects with any of these printers.","The plain metal chassis of the Solidoodle 3 and the sharp, black chassis of the Solidoodle 4 are designed mainly for ABS (but can print in PLA), and a heated platform is included. A 3D printer kit option is not available for do-it-yourself types; you can only purchase the Solidoodle 2, 3 and 4 as pre-assembled printers.","Solidoodle really doesn&#39;t provide many support options on the website. There is an email address under the Contact Us section on the website, but phone numbers, a blog, a forum and FAQs are all missing. You can however, email the company and ask for a phone number for phone support. There is one short walk-through tutorial for how to install the software, and a manual for the printer does come with the box. Even a warranty is missing, so be sure you have the knowhow to work with 3D printing technology before you select a Solidoodle printer. There is also a two- to three-week lead time with the Solidoodle 4, but the Solidoodle 2 and 3 both ship more quickly.","To print, plug in the included USB cable to any Windows, Mac or Linux operating system. Unfortunately, there is no other way to print with the Solidoodle 4; you have to be connected to your computer throughout the printing process.","Along with each printer, you&#39;ll also get a power supply, USB cable, maintenance tools and a very small sample filament cartridge. Software isn&#39;t included; you&#39;ll have to download it yourself from the Solidoodle website. It is free, however, and instructions walk you through the process."]},"id":"999105a4-0e36-4388-8d79-5dcac5dd497f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fa4de0d8-9d15-4af1-8cf4-1a43664ad547","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["During our 3D printing comparison we found that although a number of 3D printing companies donâ€™t offer warranties, most of them at least have phone support.
