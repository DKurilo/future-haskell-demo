You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The MyID Sleek <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">medical alert bracelet</a> by ENDEVR is a lightweight silicone band that holds relevant medical information. Similar to the <a href=\"/care-review\">CARE</a> and <a href=\"/healthid-review\">Health ID</a> bracelets, it&#39;s for people with extensive medical histories. Available in eight bright colors, this band is both fashionable and practical.","This medical ID bracelet can be customized to suit any medical condition and comes with an online profile that you can update at any time. The all-silicone, waterproof design makes this bracelet suitable for children and adults, especially those who lead an active lifestyle.","After you first purchase this ID bracelet, you will need to set up your MyID online profile. There are two different types of profiles to choose from. The regular one includes information such as your personal vitals, contact information, an emergency contact and one vital medical condition. If you feel that isn&#39;t enough information, you can choose to purchase the premium online medical ID profile. With that feature, you have the option to include everything in the regular profile as well as multiple emergency contacts and vital medical information, medications, allergies and insurance information. Your online profile is protected by a username and password so that no one else can change your information.","Once you have filled out your online profile and begin wearing your medical alert bracelet, first responders and medical personnel will be able to access your information in three different ways: by scanning the QR code on the back of the bracelet with a smartphone or tablet, by visiting MYIDband.com and entering the ID and PIN printed on the bracelet, or by calling the 24/7 call center. With three ways to access the information, medical personnel in almost any situation can quickly learn of any medical problems you may have and be able to treat you correctly, even if you are unconscious.","If you spend a lot of time traveling, this medical alert bracelet works anywhere in the world. Your online medical profile quickly detects the location where your bracelet is scanned and translates your profile into the appropriate language. This feature could save your life if you become ill in a foreign country and don&#39;t speak the language.","The MyID Sleek medical alert bracelet by ENDEVR is a good midrange choice if you want something with a trendy look and feel that you can wear all the time. It is especially useful if you lead an active lifestyle, compete in sporting events or frequently travel to foreign countries. Although the basic online profile doesn&#39;t hold a lot of information, an upgraded profile is available if you need it."]},"id":"c4cf9cf2-cd74-45c4-8b40-e91734f561a9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63676","url":"/myid-sleek-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:16:25Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:16:25Z","name":"MyID Sleek","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer.
