Once you sign up, then it is just a matter of linking to the accounts you need to pay. For other service providers, you will register on their sites and go through the steps. It&#39;s common practice to verify your account by making a test deposit followed by a withdrawal from your payment account, and you need to provide additional documentation during the setup period. This process can take a week, so you may wind up paying some bills yourself while you wait. The site should be well designed and easy to use. Setting up your accounts should be intuitive and require the least amount of effort possible.","<strong>Security</strong>","It goes without saying that your financial information must be secure. Most, if not all, bill paying services use the latest security methods. Many companies guarantee their security and will reimburse you for fraudulent transactions. You can find guidelines for this procedure in your service agreement. Each website usually has tips for your information&#39;s security, such as keeping your account information confidential and maintaining your antivirus software.","<strong>Pricing &amp; Fees</strong>","Often banks provide bill pay service with no monthly charge. However, there may be conditions such as maintaining a minimum balance. If you don&#39;t meet the requirements, then you pay a monthly fee. Of course, account fees, such as overdraft protection and monthly fees for your payment accounts, apply as they normally do. If same-day payments are available, there is usually an extra charge for it. Monthly fees often cover a set number of payments per month, and then the service charges a per-transaction fee. Often you have at least a 25-bill pay maximum, which should cover most people.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>","Look for a company that has customer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because your financial information can be time-critical. Support contact options may include phone, email, chat and social media. They also include FAQs and knowledgebases to let you browse for answers on your own. Banks, such as Wells Fargo, PNC, BBVA and HSBC, offer phone support. MyCheckFree has a user forum, which is an excellent way to learn from other customers&#39; experience. Bill pay services with your bank also provide help at their physical locations.","It&#39;s ideal for paying bills online to find a company that gives you several ways to contact its customer support. If it has a wait time for one method, it may be quicker to use a different option. For instance, if it has a high call volume with a long wait time, it may be able to give you a quicker response on Twitter. Flexible options can help you get the answers you need as fast as possible."]},"id":"242b563f-52e7-4a08-b1d3-99b8a5c801ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"e86744d9-e1f1-4524-8311-1806ffc5b926","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://paytrust.com/\">Paytrust</a>","<a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/online-banking/bill-pay/\">Wells Fargo</a>","<a href=\"https://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/Homepage.do?siteArea=/PNCCorp/PNC/Home/Personal\">PNC</a>","<a href=\"http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-tools/online-bill-pay-software.jsp\">Quicken Bill Pay</a>","<a href=\"https://mycheckfree.com/br/wps?rq=login&slpg=Y&esc=93096239&sp=10001\">MyCheckFree</a>","<a href=\"https://www.bbvacompass.com/digital-banking-services/online-banking/pay-bills.html\">BBVA Compass</a>","<a href=\"http://www.us.hsbc.com/1/2/3/personal/online-services/personal-internet-banking/bill-pay\">HSBC</a>","<a href=\"https://www.xpressbillpay.com/\">Xpress Bill Pay</a>","<a href=\"https://www.chase.com/online/digital/online-bill-pay.html\">Chase</a>","<a href=\"https://www.mint.com/how-mint-bills-works\">Mint</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"753c1d68-ce35-4bd7-89d5-25cbf3b2fde0","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_103","url":"/best-bill-paying-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"mike-mcpeek","url":"/author/mike-mcpeek","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Mike McPeek","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"zHMn9cGyHw9eJCvSFXXYrJ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2006-08-01T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2016-08-31T17:54:26Z","name":"Best Bill Paying Services","synopsis":"Stop paying bills the old-fashioned way.
