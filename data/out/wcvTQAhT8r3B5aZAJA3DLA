For our most recent evaluation, we spent over 30 hours comparing each kit&#39;s testing methods, included supplies, ease of use, prices and certifications. We wanted the number one option to detect black mold and other dangerous growth colonies while still being easy to use. Additionally, we wanted our best overall pick to offer fast results and fast lab turnaround times so you could respond quickly to any threats to you and your family&#39;s health. The most highly ranked test kits in our lineup are AIHA certified and offer professional staff to help you get support via phone and email. ","<strong>How Much Do Mold Test Kits Cost?</strong>","The cost of mold test kits ranges from about $10 up to $395, with costlier kits typically including more tests and supplies like swabs, test plates and adhesive strips. Other services, such as lab analysis, can add as much as $40 to the total cost.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","While we didn&#39;t test these kits ourselves, we did compare their supplies, testing methods and support features to determine which were the easiest to use. Since mold can greatly impact you and your loved ones&#39; health, we gave more points to kits that require shorter incubation times and have faster lab turnaround. We also checked to see what kinds of testing methods each kit offers. Typically, kits that offer more testing methods scored higher in our comparison since they give you more options to work with.","We gave more points to kits that could detect a larger number of growths, including yeast, mold, fungus and bacteria. Kits that let you take HVAC samples and outdoor tests and that allow you to submit physical samples scored higher since they were more inclusive. Scores were also higher for kits that provide professional supplies like petri dishes, swabs, sample bags and adhesive strips. Similarly, the amount of support offered by the company influenced our rankings. If there are multiple customer contact options and multiple ways to find answers to questions, including a FAQs page and video tutorials, companies scored higher.","While we didn&#39;t score testing kits based on their prices, we did determine whether or not a product&#39;s price was warranted.

In addition to contact information, you might want to select a company that has strong support options, including FAQs and video tutorials. Aside from our top two products, the Pro-Lab Mold Test Kit and the Home Mold Laboratory Viable Mold Test Kit, you can find full customer support with <a href=\"/iaq-pro-5-minute-home-mold-test-review\">Healthful Home&#39;s 5-Minute Mold Test</a> and the <a href=\"/moldcheck-review\">Mold Check Whole House Mold Test</a>.","It also is handy if either the kit itself or the website offers a guidebook to tell you how to test for mold and identify what you find.","If you suspect that your home is infested with some form of mold, it is important to identify and deal with the problem as quickly as possible. Home mold test kits give you an excellent tool in the battle against mold and other harmful invaders. "]},"id":"c44408db-33f3-4085-b175-e913e41676d3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_213","url":"/best-mold-test-kits","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-31T22:59:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-31T22:59:00Z","name":"Best Mold Test Kits of 2019","synopsis":"We looked for mold detection kits that also identify things such as yeast and fungus, and that provide quick and accurate test results.","review":{},"strapline":"We looked for mold detection kits that also identify things such as yeast and fungus, and that provide quick and accurate test results.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-21T18:08:38Z","id":"wcvTQAhT8r3B5aZAJA3DLA","meta":{"title":"Best Mold Test Kits of 2019 - Detect Mold, Yeast and Fungus at Home","description":"We looked for mold detection kits that also identify things such as yeast and fungus, and that provide quick and accurate test results."},"products":[{"slug":"pro-lab-mold-test-kit","url":"/product/pro-lab-mold-test-kit","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","name":"Pro-Lab Mold Test Kit","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"WbNEjNedfJGnAMqdcAVZ6","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"home-mold-laboratory-viable-mold-test-kit","url":"/product/home-mold-laboratory-viable-mold-test-kit","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","name":"Home Mold Laboratory Viable Mold Test Kit","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"PmuXmpyrw74HG5QkNBUSD7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"healthful-home-5-minute-home-mold-test","url":"/product/healthful-home-5-minute-home-mold-test","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","name":"Healthful Home 5-Minute Home Mold Test","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"tgT4JPcebSznxswk5pGgMa","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"immunolytics-value-test-kit","url":"/product/immunolytics-value-test-kit","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","name":"ImmunoLytics Value Test Kit","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"kF5mfV7HdxpWrYFrgbtrr5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"mold-armor","url":"/product/mold-armor","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","name":"Mold Armor","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"EnUR4225nY7F3cSGZsAyJQ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/AMt5CxByJgnw6e3rHPyohC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Mold-Test-Kits-001.JPG","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/U/H/746297/original/Hero-Mold-Test-Kits-001.JPG","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"AMt5CxByJgnw6e3rHPyohC","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMt5CxByJgnw6e3rHPyohC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Mold Test Kits of 2019","description":"We looked for mold detection kits that also identify things such as yeast and fungus, and that provide quick and accurate test results."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/AMt5CxByJgnw6e3rHPyohC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Mold-Test-Kits-001.JPG","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/U/H/746297/original/Hero-Mold-Test-Kits-001.JPG","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"AMt5CxByJgnw6e3rHPyohC","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMt5CxByJgnw6e3rHPyohC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Mold Test Kits of 2019","description":"We looked for mold detection kits that also identify things such as yeast and fungus, and that provide quick and accurate test results."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-quality","url":"/health-and-beauty/air-quality","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","name":"Air Quality","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:34Z","id":"9XQeSF4Awfph4vGpgLPmkB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
