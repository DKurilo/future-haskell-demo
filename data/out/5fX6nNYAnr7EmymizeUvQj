By removing this quiet dehumidifier’s reliance on batteries or electricity, this has the overall effect of keeping your energy costs and humidity low. When the silica gel is used up, you can quickly and easily install more gel into the device. It utilizes approximately 6 ounces of gel per week when left on continuously to dehumidify a medium-sized room like a guest bedroom.","While a small dehumidifier, it still has a full range of electronic controls to set timers and humidity levels. It contains a collection reservoir that can easily be removed, in addition to a level indicator that will automatically shut down the unit when it is full or new silica gel is needed.","The use of the silica gel is actually multipurpose in use. In addition to powering the dehumidifier, it also acts as a filter that removes harmful particles like bacteria and allergens, helping ensure that the air you breathe is safe and clean. The benefit of this dehumidifier is it can be renewed anywhere.","While not intended to replace a basement dehumidifier, this device receives countless positive reviews from happy users. It works in a wide range of functions and is durable enough to rival even the most heavy-duty of dehumidifiers. It will struggle to dehumidify anything larger than a single room, but for smaller spaces it will run like any other unit.","The Eva-Dry EDV-300 is an ideal mini dehumidifier, capable of removing excess moisture in a room and quiet enough to make you forget it’s even there. This might be the best dehumidifier you can purchase given the cost, and its capabilities will surely surprise you. Due to its reliance on an alternative method of power and how easily it can compete with larger units, this is one item worth looking at."]},"id":"e9dcbdb5-03f4-409d-b817-e5df50ec4588","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57076","url":"/eva-dry-edv-300-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-07-23T11:51:52Z","datePublished":"2013-07-23T11:51:52Z","name":"Eva-Dry EDV-300","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
