One of the most notable improvements is the introduction of internet protocol or IP cameras. This is a surveillance camera that records live video feed and transmits it over the internet. This allows you, the homeowner, to remotely view real-time video feed of your home or property as the camera records it.","One of the major benefits of IP home security cameras is their ability to transmit data wirelessly. You don t need long cables to connect the camera to your computer. Secondly, the video can be viewed anywhere   and on any device   you have an internet connection.","<strong>Buying the Right IP Camera for Your Needs</strong>","There are many types of IP cameras in the market today. Each comes with its own specifications and functional abilities. Therefore, the first and most important thing to consider before buying an IP camera for home security is what your needs are. Where do you plan to place it? How is the lighting? What kind of data do you want to capture?","Look for an IP camera with an excellent lens that can capture high-quality video. Other features to look for in an IP camera include power over Ethernet (PoE), where power and data use the same cable. Also, make sure your camera has a PTZ (pan, tilt and zoom) feature and two-way audio."]},"id":"89d823fd-fac4-4646-83b0-e9ee6061eefb","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>When Can an IP Camera Help?</strong>","An IP home security camera with the above features ensures you have control of the camera wherever you are. Security monitoring also becomes more efficient since you can take action quickly (e.g., calling 911).","When you spend most of your time away from home, an IP camera is extremely helpful. You can tell who is knocking on your door, check on your babysitter and monitor your home&#39;s safety.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"f7303463-f6f6-462c-a45d-e9cd1acc98b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>The Top Three IP Cameras</strong>","<strong>1.
