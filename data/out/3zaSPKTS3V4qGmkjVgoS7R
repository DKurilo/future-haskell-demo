She said they often don’t pay enough attention to data management systems and the way glucometers connect to those systems.","Since diabetes is a chronic disease without a cure, people need a good data management system that provides them and their doctor with the relevant information to best treat the disease and minimize long-term health effects. She explained that &#34;[t]oday&#39;s glucose monitor manufacturers are developing different features to solve the connectivity issue. So it is highly recommended to check how the monitor transfers the data and its usability for this particular patient.&#34;"]},"id":"f360cb02-9ee3-4b4e-833b-9cc4ccc524b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/UK2k9XzkRegzYWMF9vUn9B.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"With this in mind, I closely evaluated the data management apps and desktop software that come with these glucometers, paying particular attention to connectivity and ease of use.

You don’t need to worry about a cord or having to enter notes for readings directly into the glucometer, which isn’t easy to do and may discourage you from writing important things like &#34;ate an apple&#34; next to a reading. However, Bluetooth has connectivity challenges as well. Bluetooth-enabled glucose meters aren&#39;t always so easy to pair to your phone.","<strong>How Much Do Glucometers Cost?</strong>","Most glucometers cost between $20 and $50. Within this range, you can get an advanced and accurate meter with Bluetooth and a companion smartphone app with excellent data management features.","Insurance coverage varies a lot. The meters most likely to be covered by insurance providers also tend to be the most expensive, like the OneTouch Verio IQ that cost over $100. However, the performance and feature-value of these more expensive meters were not significantly different in my tests from the cheaper models.   ","<strong><strong>How Much Do Blood Glucose Test Strips Cost?</strong></strong>","Two very important aspects of buying a glucometer are the cost and availability of the test strips. Test strips are the most expensive part of using a glucometer. Just because you chose a $20 over a $50 glucometer doesn&#39;t mean you picked the most affordable option. If the test strips of the cheaper meter cost $1.50 and the strips on the expensive meter cost $0.50, the long-term costs make the cheaper meter far more expensive. In addition, you have to consider availability. If you&#39;re not on top of how many strips you have and you run out, you have to run into a pharmacy to find strips. But if you choose a meter with test strips lacking in distribution, you won&#39;t find it. Some test strips have to be ordered online, which aren&#39;t ideal for emergencies.","To evaluate price and availability, I compiled a list of the most common online stores and five local pharmacies. I then noted whether the stores carried the test strips and for how much, including the prices if you purchased strips in boxes of 50 or 100. Some test strips were available everywhere, while others were only available in one or two online stores.","Since you can’t get cheap off-brand test strips, you have to consider the long-term costs and price fluctuations. When I reviewed glucometers in 2017, the lowest average cost for the cheapest test strip on the market was $0.12 per strip, while the most expensive test strip was $2.06 per strip. But in early 2018, the cheapest test strip averaged around $0.23 per test strip while the most expensive averaged $1.22 per strip. The difference in cost is extraordinary when applied to a year of using the meter, especially if you frequently test your glucose levels.","One explanation for the change in test strip costs is the fluctuating value of gold. Most test strips are made with a circuitry of gold, due to its superior conductivity, so as the value of gold moves, so do the manufacturing costs.","Another explanation is shown by Daniel Jennings in <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/3982686-insurance-driving-healthcare-costs\">“Is Insurance Driving Up Healthcare Cost?”</a>  It&#39;s the ever-changing ways health insurers cover, or don&#39;t cover, glucose meters. One way to save yourself from fluctuating prices is to sign up for a test-strip subscription. These subscription-based programs are becoming more popular, allowing you to pay a flat fee for test strips each month.","<strong>Do Glucometers Expire?</strong>","Glucometers wear out over time and should be renewed every two years to ensure accurate and reliable results. If you are concerned that your glucometer isn&#39;t working well anymore then you can run tests with a control safety solution to see how accurate the results are.","Control Solutions are readily available and should be used when you think your glucose meter is not accurate. For improved accuracy make sure you use control solution if you think your glucometer may have been damaged, if results are unusually high or low or when opening a new pack of test strips. It also worth taking your glucometer with you when you visit your doctor for a blood sugar test. Take a reading with your monitor at the same time. If the results are within 15% of the lab results then you should consider your glucose meter accurate.","<strong>Can Glucometers Measure Ketones? </strong>","Most ketone monitors can monitor blood sugar, but not all glucometers can monitor ketosis. As such, if you want to measure ketone, we recommend you buy a ketone monitor. The model we would highly recommend is the FORA 6 that measures both ketones and glucose in an easy to read display. It is also our pick for the best glucose meter overall. ","<strong><strong>What Else You Should Consider</strong></strong>","Glucometers vary quite a lot with concern to features and cost, which means it can be easy to choose the wrong one. Kristen Scheney, a nutritionist for CCS Medical, recommends not using price as an indication of quality. She continues, &#34;just because one glucometer is more expensive than another does not mean that it will be more accurate. Moreover, just because a device includes more features than another does not mean that it is the device for you. Sometimes simple is the best way to go to ensure you’re getting exactly what you need out of your glucometer.&#34;","Again, you should consult with your physician about what type of glucometer is best for helping you manage your diabetes. That said, here are some additional considerations:","<u>Are glucose meters are covered by insurance and Medicare?</u>","You don’t need a prescription to purchase glucometers, test strips or lancets. These are all over-the-counter products. However, since the long-term costs can be high, many insurance plans cover the meters and the test strips. While co-pays and coverage may vary, you should contact your insurance provider and talk to your doctor about what brands are covered under your insurance plan.","The one downside to using insurance to offset some of the costs is your plan often dictates which brand you can use. This is one of the most common complaints among diabetics because too often the only glucometer brands approved by their insurance providers have very expensive test strips.","Medicare Part B covers some diabetic supplies, including test strips, with a 20-percent Medicare-approved co-pay. However, this only applies if your physician and pharmacy are enrolled with Medicare.","<u>Have a Backup Glucometer</u><br/>A backup glucometer allows you to double-check a strange reading you think may not be accurate. For example, if you have a very high reading but you feel fine, you can check your blood again with a second glucometer. If the reading is high on both, then you can act accordingly. But if the backup glucometer gives a normal reading, you know that your primary glucometer needs to be calibrated.","Backup glucometers also help in situations when you run out of test strips. For example, if your primary glucometer is made by FORA, you&#39;ll likely have to order test strips online. And if you don&#39;t order them with enough foresight, you could easily run out before the refills arrive. A backup glucometer can be used to fill the gap.","<u>Lancets</u><br/>Every glucometer we tested came with its own lancet – a device with a spring-loaded needle that you use to prick your finger, palm or forearm. Unlike test strips, you don&#39;t have to use the lancet that comes with your glucose meter; you just need something that draws enough blood to test with the glucometer, so use whatever is easy and affordable. I used all 11 lancets that came with the devices and found no difference in pain, but some are easier to load and unload. (It&#39;s important to use a new lancet needle for each test.)","<strong>Gestational Diabetes: Why Pregnant Women Should Use Glucometers</strong>","According to the <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/gestational-diabetes\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, gestational diabetes occurs in up to 10 percent of pregnancies. While its exact cause is unknown, doctors believe hormones play a role, particularly hormones that increase insulin resistance. As such, having gestational diabetes doesn&#39;t mean you had Type 2 diabetes before you got pregnant or that you’ll have it after you give birth. However, you’re at a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes after your pregnancy if you don’t manage your gestational diabetes well. But even more troubling is that it can have a big impact on your baby’s development.","In <a href=\"https://consumer.healthday.com/diabetes-information-10/type-ii-diabetes-news-183/when-blood-sugar-rises-in-pregnancy-mom-and-baby-pay-the-price-737596.html\">“When Blood Sugar Rises in Pregnancy, Mom and Baby Pay the Price,”</a> Steven Reinberg, a reporter for HealthDay, argues the importance of staying on top of your blood glucose levels while pregnant. He points out that in addition to putting the mother at a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes post-pregnancy, prolonged high glucose levels put infants at risk of developing complications, both before and after birth.","In fact, studies have shown elevated glucose levels in developing infants can affect organ development and cause the body to handle food differently. As a result, these infants are at a higher risk of obesity as well as 11 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes and 42 percent more likely to have pre-diabetes by their teenage years.     ","The good news is you can minimize the risk of complications and long-term health issues for both you and baby. First, buy a blood glucose meter and check your blood sugar levels before and after meals to gauge how your body responds to the food you eat. If your glucose levels are high, especially before you eat, you should consult with a doctor to get on a health management plan specifically for gestational diabetes.","<strong>Helping Your Child Cope With Type 2 Diabetes</strong>","In an article published by <a href=\"http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2019/01-jan-feb/6-ways-to-help-your-child.html\">Diabetesforecast.org</a>, Barbara Brody addresses the tricky issues parents often face when a child is diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.

Now multiple CGM’s are receiving FDA approval each year, making for a growing market where even type 2 diabetics tired of finger-pricking can have an affordable CGM. The Freestyle Libre, for example, costs between $40 and $75 per month, depending on the insurance.","CGMs work by implanting a sensor under the skin. The sensor continually monitors glucose levels and sends the data to an app on your phone. It’s usually used by type 1 diabetics, and often in conjunction with insulin pumps. But CGMs are growing in popularity among type 2 diabetics who want something to help them better manage their diabetes.","However, while CGMs have a lot of clear advantages for data and health management, they are not without cons. The experts at <a href=\"http://diabetesstrong.com/fit-with-diabetes-part-4-the-pros-and-cons-of-cgm/\">Diabetesstrong.com</a> suggest CGMs tend to be less accurate than a glucometer because it measures glucose based of the interstitial fluid rather than the blood, so you may have to still use a glucometer when you suspect the sensor is off. In fact, Christel Oreum recommends you always trust what your body tells you and don’t rely too much on the CGM readings. She even suggests taking breaks from them every once in a while so that you’re not too over-reliant.","Another con is it does require an outpatient procedure to put the sensors under the skin. And while the procedure is generally very safe, it doesn’t come without risk or potential side effects, like bruising or skin sensitivity. In addition, the sensors have to be switched out. Some last a week. Some two weeks. The most recent CGM sensor lasts 90 days.","<strong>Why Should You Consider Clinical Trials?</strong>","To better treat, prevent and potentially cure diabetes, scientists have to run clinical trials for new technology and medicines to ensure products are both effective and safe. However, recruiting participants to these clinical trials is one of the major obstacles researchers face to progressing new treatments.  ","According to Nicole Kofman from <a href=\"https://diatribe.org/why-should-you-consider-participating-diabetes-research\">diaTribe.org</a>, recruiting participants is difficult because of several reasons: access and inconvenience, fear of risks, lack of understanding, and awareness. The first two reasons are somewhat difficult to overcome, as it’s not easy for many people to get to a trial or to convince them to join in a process that could have undesirable consequences. However, perhaps the biggest obstacle is the last, as Kofman points out that 85 percent of people don’t even realize clinical trials are an option.","Kofman notes how a significant portion of participants benefit from trials due to the intrinsic value of knowing they&#39;re helping advance science and improving lives, but she also argues that participants often receive better care, since they are treated by “some of the top researchers” at leading centers. In addition, many trials provide compensation for time away from work and travel.  ","Without clinical trials from past generations, we wouldn’t have glucometers, continuous glucose monitoring systems, diabetes medications, insulin pumps and more.

A great advantage of this over traditional glucometers is the automatic alerts it sends when your glucose levels are too high or low, allowing faster treatment and greater potential for minimizing the progression of the disease over time.","Before approval, the FDA required a clinical study of 125 diabetics, comparing the device’s accuracy to lab-conducted glucose readings while evaluating the potential risks, which are listed as allergic reactions, bleeding, bruising, infection, pain and discomfort, scarring, sensor fracture during removal and skin inflammation. However, the FDA found these risks occurred less than 1 percent of the time.  ","Upon the study’s completion and the unanimous approval for the U.S. market from the FDA Advisory Committee, the commissioner, Scott Gottlieb M.D. described the device as a “vivid illustration of the potential for these mobile platforms.”","<strong>Study Shows Losing Weight After Type-2 Diagnosis May Lead to Remission</strong>","A <a href=\"http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2018/06-nov-dec/early-weight-loss-after.html?loc=ymal\">recent study</a> showed that focusing on weight loss after a Type-2 diagnosis might lead to a remission of symptoms.

Of the people in the study, 69 were able to regain healthy levels of insulin production and were able to go off medication. The results suggest remission might be possible, but only if you lose a significant amount of weight shortly after your diagnosis.
