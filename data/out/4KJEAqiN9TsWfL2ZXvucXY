It also doesn&#39;t include a spellchecker or worksheets.","This program uses an interview-style format to help you write your own will, but it doesn&#39;t ask questions about specific assets or property, rather it automatically assumes everything will be left to your surviving spouse or children. This is okay if you only need a simple, bare-bones last will and testament but may be too basic if you have a lot of property or valuable assets.","While Do Your Own Will is a simple program, it does allow you to create documents other than a last will and testament. These include a living will, or health care directive, and a Power of Attorney. Both of these, along with your simple will, make up the basics for planning your estate.","If you need a little guidance while writing your will, this online program includes some help options, including a legal reference guide to help you understand important terms. It also has a directory to look up lawyers in your area in case you need to speak with a professional.
