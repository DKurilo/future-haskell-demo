You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Eton Rover is the size of a flashlight, but it&#39;s much more than a light source. At first glance you&#39;ll notice there is an American Red Cross logo right on the radio dial, which means Eton had to obtain licensing from that trusted organization. The American Red Cross doesn&#39;t officially endorse any product specifically, but we suspect they don&#39;t lend out their logo liberally. This <a href=\"/best-crank-radios\">crank radio</a> boasts a large number of features and has a great design to boot. While there isn&#39;t a solar panel on this device, it has a few extra ports that will make your life easier.","When you want to charge this emergency radio, cranking it for one minute will allow you to have 15 minutes of radio use on it, on low volume. You can also charge your cell phone using the Rover since there are USB and mini USB jacks on the side. If your battery is drained on your mobile device, cranking the radio for seven minutes will charge the cell phone enough to talk for about five minutes or tweet about your camping weekend. This is one of the quicker charging times we have seen.","You cannot charge this device using a solar panel though, as there isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s too bad since the best crank radios we&#39;ve reviewed have this feature. But you shouldn&#39;t be deterred by that one setback as there are a few other features that set this crank radio apart. It has two separate USB jacks: one is a standard size USB and the other is a mini USB. There are plenty of mobile devices that use both, so charging anything from cell phones to portable speakers will be easy to do.","The Eton Rover does have a headphone jack that you can use for private listening, or you can plug your musical device into it and use it as an external speaker. This is especially useful for those dance parties you may want to throw at the campsite. You can also tune the crank radio to different AM/FM radio stations as well as NOAA weather stations.","The design of the Rover crank radio is both aesthetically pleasing and physically functional. It is easy to hold in either hand and crank it. There is a cell indicator that lights up when the battery is charged, or when your cell phone is charged. This is something we haven&#39;t seen on other radios. The flashlight is strategically placed on the radio so if you aren&#39;t using the light, you can stand up the device, flashlight face down, and pull up the antenna and listen to the radio.","You should know you are in good hands with Eton. They provide customer assistance through various telephone numbers, an email and an updated blog. There is also a two-year warranty on the Rover."]},"id":"ae6823d1-5e5f-48ae-b0a6-ed4e6d4bb9bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"800c2e05-8350-486a-a15e-9029ce321c11","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Finding the right emergency crank radio is important, and we can think of a few reasons to select the Eton Rover.
