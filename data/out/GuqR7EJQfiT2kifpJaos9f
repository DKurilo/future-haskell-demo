We print a model of the Empire State building and evaluate it for straight corners, warping, pointy spires, smooth surfaces and no flaws. The UP mini 2 produces surprisingly accurate and well-made 3D prints. The Empire test was nearly flawless, and we saw minor shifting and surface flaws on the other models. Prints were infinitesimally shakier than those made by more expensive printers, but we were impressed overall with the models’ print quality.","The machine’s only real downside is its small print capacity. The UP mini 2 can only handle models that are 4.7 x 4.7 x 4.7 inches or smaller. You must either scale down large models or print them in sections and glue them together in post-production. This is inconvenient if you need a 3D printer for a wide variety of projects. The UP mini 2 does calibrate and auto level but not automatically before each print. It’s easy to select this function from the touchscreen menu though, and it doesn’t take long to perform. Before each print, the printer lays a test strip, so you can see if the filament is feeding properly, to remove any excess gunk from the nozzle and to test the z-height."]},"id":"853f63bb-24b1-45cf-bd5a-8aa09b55ea15","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Printer Design"},"id":"1a7e5985-ead0-48ea-aa2f-da2decf77373","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/gJaw8FWDVFKscaymRB7gjK.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68169-up-mini-26.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJaw8FWDVFKscaymRB7gjK.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"gJaw8FWDVFKscaymRB7gjK","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJaw8FWDVFKscaymRB7gjK.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9772e64d-b137-4006-b378-b77eb645bac0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This tiny printer is one of the best home 3D printers because of its small footprint, plastic chassis and enclosed design.

The heated bed was also great – none of the test prints warped at all, so we know the temperature in the machine is well regulated.","One the of the UP mini 2’s weird design aspects is the detached filament holder. The spool itself goes inside a spaceship-like capsule that sits next to the printer. This plastic holder feeds the filament through a tiny hole, into the included tube, through the back of the printer and all the way to the print head.
