You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The SHOWWX from Microvision is a compact, plug-and-play <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">mini projector</a>. The overall design of this unit makes it sleek and slim, and it still produces a relatively good picture. This is one of the lightest pico projectors we looked at, and overall, we thought this to be a decent product –just not necessarily for the office.","The picture quality of this mini projector has some distinct advantages as well as some limitations. The biggest advantage is the contrast ratio of 5000:1. This is the best we&#39;ve seen on any of the micro projectors we reviewed. This gives great contrast between the lights and darks in the images you are viewing. The brightness is another variable in picture quality, and it isn&#39;t nearly as bright as we would like it to be. It is only 10 ANSI lumens, which means the room will have to be dark in order for you to see the picture clearly. The 848 x 480 resolution is good, and the image size is also respectable at 6 to 100 inches. This mini projector is unique in the fact that it uses a laser to project the image instead of the typical LCoS or DLP methods.","This mini projector includes a mini USB port. This is how the wall charger is connected to the device so you can charge the battery. There is also a port in the back that can be used with a composite video adapter. This is a great way to connect to any device with a TV-out such as a camera. The only difficulty is you can only use Microvision-specific cables with this product. This isn&#39;t always very convenient if you happen to forget to pack the cable and need to give a presentation. If there were a USB port or an SD card slot, this cable issue might not be a significant drawback. However, as it is, this product might not do as well in a business setting as some of the other products in the lineup. Its connectivity options lean more toward recreational devices.","Something we like to see on mini projectors like this one is a built-in speaker. While this device doesn&#39;t have one, it is simple to hook one up through the headphone jack. The battery life of this device is fairly respectable at 2 hours, and you can always play it using the included AC power adapter. Since this device uses a laser for projection, this is the only mini projector we found that doesn&#39;t have a lamp, which means you don&#39;t have to worry about buying a replacement. This micro projector is one of the smallest in the lineup at only 0.6 x 2.4 x 4.7 inches and weighing only 0.27 pounds.","This mini projector is a plug-and-play product. There are only four buttons: power, select, up and down. These buttons allow you to change the color mode, brightness and aspect ratio. Overall, the design of the mini projector is very orderly and uncluttered. While we appreciate simple and clean designs, we also want some control. One of our concerns with this mobile projector is the fact that there is no manual focus. For the majority of the time, automatic focus works just fine but we&#39;d like the option to fix the image if we need to."]},"id":"90d9a7b8-bb1d-448a-a720-b945b262e691","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a42844af-b4ce-4f22-80bc-4ee63fbb6495","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SHOWWX from Microvision is a good mini projector.
