The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/electronics/computers\"><em>Home Computers </em></a><em>here.</em>","For those who want a personalized computer, the CybertronPC Axis A4 is a desktop PC with multiple build options. Like all of the home computers on our lineup, it is also fully customizable after purchase. However, the most affordable version of this desktop is a low-powered machine that will not handle many tasks. We reviewed the base version of this computer, but your version may have better components that will improve the performance and capabilities. Also, if you want to improve the A4’s power, you can upgrade or add components to keep it running for years to come.","The Axis A4 comes with an AMD A4 processor with a speed of 2.7GHz. This is among the slowest processors we saw in our reviews. On top of that, the PC does not have a dedicated graphics card. This means that all graphical processing has to be handled by the CPU. Also, it only has a 4GB memory card. Games have to be played on low to average settings, and HD videos may take a while to load.","This is a computer you use for homework and browsing. With 1TB of hard drive space, you can store thousands of documents, images and music files. If you need more storage space, you can add a hard drive or plug in a USB storage device. With 14 USB 2.0 ports, you have plenty of options for extensions and peripherals. Unfortunately, none of the ports are USB 3.0, and you cannot customize with a motherboard that has 3.0 options.","While the Axis A4 has an HDMI port, we recommend that the base model be used as an office or workspace computer. Since you can’t play the best games at the highest settings, and since HD movies take longer to load, there’s no reason to use this desktop PC as a home media center. But in an office, you’ll have a great computer for homework or other projects."]},"id":"8735d2e4-39c1-4d32-8e24-21a8aa3bfd8c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bbc62a32-0e2d-4463-99e9-ee28ed8925e3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The CybertronPC Axis A4 is a customizable computer, but its base model is underpowered.
