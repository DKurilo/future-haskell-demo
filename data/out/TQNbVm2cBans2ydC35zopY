Virtual desktops allow you to set up all your programs, apps, and servers on an external server and then access everything wirelessly. Virtualization software, including <a href=\"#VMware_Horizon_Air\">VMWare</a>, <a href=\"#Cisco\">Cisco</a> and <a href=\"#Citrix\">Citrix</a>, allow you to set up everything you or your employees need for your business. DAAS programs offer a variety of different services, with some including virtual servers, collaboration tools and productivity management.","<strong>DAAS: What to Look For</strong>","While any DAAS offers basic services, including a virtual desktop and some security, many offer additional features, such as better security, mobile access, compliance, scalable user bases and features like data sharing. The following features can help you choose a DAAS that&#39;s right for your business.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>Security is an important function for any DAAS, especially if you handle any credit card or payment data on your virtual desktop. Even if you mostly use your desktop for handling email, you still need security. Good security features to look for include encryption with secure connections as well as secure cloud storage. SEC/FINRA compliance regulates financial security and is important if you plan to use the virtual desktop for financial services.","<strong>Storage &amp; Memory</strong><br/>A virtual desktop has limited storage and memory, just like a real PC. While some DAAS companies offer unlimited storage or large amounts of storage, others offer limitations based on a pay scale so that you pay for what you need per computer. Memory is important because some programs require specific amounts of memory in order to run. Storage is also important if you want the virtual desktop to store many files. Some DAAS programs provide communal cloud storage, which eliminates the need for per-desktop storage.","<strong>Available OS</strong><br/>If you need a specific program or app, then it&#39;s important that you verify that the virtual desktop has an OS (operating system) compatible with your software. Many have a list of available choices you can select from while setting up your software while others allow you to switch as necessary. If you want to use the virtual desktop as a server, then it is important that you make sure a server is available.","<strong>Mobile Access</strong><br/>Mobile access may not be important for everyone, but it offers a lot in terms of convenience. Mobile access means that you can log into your virtual desktop from any device, including a phone or a tablet, so that you can reply to an e-mail, work on a document or work on projects even when you&#39;re not in the office.","<strong>Scalable Offerings</strong><br/>While some DAAS companies only offer virtual desktop software to large businesses, many offer fully scalable services for small business. If you choose a small-business option, it is important to ensure that you can scale up as needed, in case your business expands. Most DAAS offerings are scalable with payment options per user plan, which allows you to pick an option that suits the current size of your business.","Choosing a virtual desktop service affects what tasks you can perform, your employees and security.

A single-sign-on option allows you to use the DAAS network as a password manager because it only requires your main password to log into the apps.","Various other features, including WAN optimization for reducing and managing traffic, real-time VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), audio and video streams and rich graphics, allow you to get the same or better solutions from the virtual desktop as you would from a hardware computer. You can also fully manage your desktops using adaptive orchestration. TuCloud offers a scalable DAAS platform for creating networks with unlimited virtual desktops and servers.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>VMware Horizon Air Review</strong>"]},"id":"07c1f118-d848-4f6c-ade0-7ab609526b53","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/J3guLbW5WoQLEW7ThgE6Xc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Horizon Air from VMware is a fully scalable virtual desktop solution that you can purchase per computer for a monthly fee that has multiple options for storage, security and memory.

You can choose between 30 and 120 GB of storage, and you can scale your storage up with separate data and cloud options. Normal virtual desktops come with one to three central processing units (CPUs), while the server option comes with 20 CPUs, allowing you to host several apps and programs without any problems. Additional hosted storage is available in terabyte increments, allowing you to greatly expand your available storage.","This virtualization software is fully cloud hosted, allowing you to access it from any device, so long as you have internet. Built-in security features, including individual users and encrypted storage, offer security compliance, making this DAAS a good fit for medium to large businesses. You get a virtual private network (VPN) with your virtual desktop software, allowing you to connect all of your desktops securely together. This makes this DAAS solution suitable for businesses with multiple branches and for setting up work-at-home employees. It also allows you to securely access files and data from a mobile device.","A public IP address allows you to add your virtual desktops to other networks and VPNs without problems. This lets you use the virtualization software just like you would a regular computer. Available servers include Windows OS and Windows Server, but not OSX or Linux.","Online app hosting allows you to run full software programs directly on your virtual server. This virtualization software supports and sells multiple apps for businesses, including many that you would normally run on a traditional server. Because the apps install instantly and are hosted in the cloud, you get added security and instant digital backups for your apps and programs.","VMware&#39;s Horizon Air and Horizon Apps offer flexible DAAS solutions for mid-size to large businesses, but with a per-month payment option and the option to add one computer at a time, it may not be suitable for small business or enterprise.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"13ba757a-becf-4083-aa2f-649716a95de2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10240","url":"/best-desktop-as-a-service-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-16T21:54:08Z","datePublished":"2016-11-16T21:54:08Z","name":"Best Desktop as a Service Review","synopsis":"DAAS or Desktop as a Service allows you to cut costs on purchasing and setting up hardware because DAAS works with virtual desktop interfaces, which are priced lower than standard PCs.","review":{},"strapline":"DAAS or Desktop as a Service allows you to cut costs on purchasing and setting up hardware because DAAS works with virtual desktop interfaces, which are priced lower than standard PCs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-18T17:37:24Z","id":"TQNbVm2cBans2ydC35zopY","meta":{"title":"Best Desktop as a Service Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
