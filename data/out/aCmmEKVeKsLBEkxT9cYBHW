Play is a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">budget 3D printer</a> designed for beginning users and small workspaces. With virtually no set up and software that is very easy to use, the Play is great for classrooms, first time users and those who want to simplify 3D printing. While the print quality and size are not the best we saw in our testing, the Play is still a great option for your home projects.","Auto calibration is what makes the Play one of the best 3D printers under $500 in our review. We found this printer needed very little calibration to print accurate models. The start-up process is also very short – this printer heats up and calibrates quickly.","Print quality is about average for printers in this price group. Although it can print with a 0.05 mm resolution, we found some warping and quality issues during testing. The issues we saw are common among 3D printers but still inconvenient if you need a professional-quality model. This printer can only build models up to 4 x 4 x 5 inches in size, so it’s better suited to making draft and experimental prints than professional prototypes.","It was incredibly easy to set up this affordable 3D printer. Everything is already in place when you pull it out of the box, and it takes about two minutes maximum to install the filament holder and insert the filament. This 17-pound printer has an all-metal frame and doesn’t rock during printing, so your final product is better than one made with an all-plastic printer.","Although it doesn’t have an onboard screen, you can easily control all of the printer’s features and settings with the software. The Play’s biggest design shortcoming is that it doesn’t have a heated platform. This means you can’t print with ABS filament, and your prints are subject to warping due to temperature fluctuations. We found the aluminum print plate to be very high quality, but we used a combination of printer’s tape and glue stick so the filament would stick.","Printrbot sells some of the most affordable replacement cartridges. This keeps costs low in the long run. This cheap 3D printer also accepts universal cartridges, so you have more freedom to choose from different colors and brands than you do with other budget 3D printers. The Printrbot Play comes with 150 grams of filament, which is enough for a very small print but not nearly as much as comes included with comparable printers.","The provided Cura software is free to download from the Printrbot website. Just be sure you get the most recent version, we found ours elsewhere, or you can’t print with Play-configured settings. Cura is one of the best open-source 3D printer software platforms, as it allows you to control almost every aspect of your 3D printer, while still having an interface that is easy for beginners to navigate.","The Printrbot Play prints while your computer is tethered to the printer with the included USB cable or via a microUSB card. Tethering, or leaving it plugged in, is inconvenient if you want to move your computer during the hours long print. The microUSB card is a slightly better option, but we found the port very fragile. Also, you must name your prints a particular name and plug the card in before you plug in the printer, or it won’t auto print.","The two-month warranty provided with the Printrbot Play is really short compared to the 12 months that most companies provide. However, Printrbot has a great support page and staff, so you can find lots of answers for your questions quickly. Email support is available on the website, but a phone number for tech support is not. You can find a helpful forum, tutorials and manuals though. We found these to be clear and easy to follow."]},"id":"3306b817-e80d-47c2-94b0-7b052dfb1646","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"96839ebb-113f-43bc-8918-e3e48a6cca66","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Since its so simple and small, the Printrbot Play is one of the best home 3D printers we reviewed.
