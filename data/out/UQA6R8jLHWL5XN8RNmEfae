You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Motorola Talkabout MS350R shares many similarities with our favorite <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">walkie talkies</a>. It is packed full of features and has a durable, lightweight body. In terms of price and functionality, it is virtually as good as our top picks. However, there are a few aspects where it doesn&#39;t measure up to our top two-way radios. For example, its actual coverage area is nowhere near the advertised 35-mile range. Also, it is not RoHS compliant, meaning that it contains some lead. Fortunately, it weighs just half a pound and offers many of the wilderness features you need.","The Talkabout MS350R is an excellent camping and hiking walkie talkie. It has a durable, waterproof body. In fact, if you drop it in water, it will float, so you can take it on your kayak without fear of losing it. While it features a full range of controls and options, it never feels burdensome. If there were any complaint to the design, it would be that some of the attachments are flimsy. The belt clip tends to break under moderate pressure.","This camping two-way radio offers a maximum range of 35 miles. It should be noted that this range is over calm waters, and as you add more solid obstacles, the effective range decreases. If you&#39;re using it in the mountains or the woods, expect a range of one to two miles.","The radio has 22 channels to choose from, including FRS and GMRS frequencies. If you&#39;re having trouble finding a frequency, you can run a channel scan. You also have access to private channels and hands-free operations. The Motorola Talkabout can access NOAA weather channels, and if there is a local emergency, your radio will signal you. Unfortunately, if you get stuck, the radio does not have an SOS function.","The screen is backlit and displays a lot of useful information. The battery meter will notify you when you need to recharge the radio. If you are away from a charger, you can use three AA batteries. Unfortunately, the Talkabout is not lead free.","Motorola supports the Talkabout with a one-year warranty, which is a little shorter than we&#39;d like to see with a device that will take a beating. If you need help with your radio, you can access FAQs and downloadable manuals from the website or contact support agents by phone and email."]},"id":"34ed7fa5-f4b3-4cc3-ae0e-884d2ea60d5e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"95fbe520-dd7b-46a9-943e-9112a93a25be","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola Talkabout MS350R is a good camping walkie talkie with many of the features and functions that we look for in a top two-way radio.
