This emergency radio is equally suited for the hard-core outdoorsman and the avid sports fan who is locked away in his in-laws bathroom trying to hear the outcome of the game. It&#39;s small and the extensive amount of time you can get off one charge is what really sets this radio apart from its competition.

This solar panel is a lot more powerful than other crank radios we reviewed, allowing you to enjoy the features of this device during hikes, camping trips or times of emergency. And when the battery is fully charged, you will get 12 hours of radio time at normal volume.

There is a USB port that you can use to charge any of your mobile devices, and it can be used to charge the radio as well. Should you find yourself wanting to listen to anything in private, such as the final game of the tournament or the weather report at 3 a.m., you can plug your headphones into the device.","We would love to see a thermometer and compass on this crank radio, as almost any emergency situation would call for these two features, but having access to several different NOAA weather stations is a useful addition.
