It accomplishes this through a dedication to creating an organic bed that naturally forms to your body’s contours and retains firmness for years beyond memory foam beds. Combined with a lengthy warranty period and emissions certification, this mattress has won its way into the bedrooms of many.","The Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen is made of five individual, botanical, “bliss” layers, as the manufacturer calls them. The top-most layer on the organic latex mattress is a non-woven, certified, organic-cotton cover designed to assist in relieving pressure from your body as you sleep. The second layer is a pure Joma New Zealand wool that contributes to air circulation and cooling.","The third layer is a natural Talalay latex layer, giving two inches of rubber for that initial feeling of cushioning. The fourth layer is a six-inch, natural Dunlop latex core, denser than the third layer to provide increased support on your body’s pressure points. The fifth layer is an orthopedic foundation crafted from spruce woods to absorb pressure and increase your level of comfort as you sleep. Combined, this all-natural latex mattress alleviates pressure points on your body by allowing your spine to form naturally as you sleep rather than bending and creating back pain.","The Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen comes with a 100-night money back guarantee or exchange, allowing you to shop without fear of being stuck with a bed that isn’t comfortable. Should you find this mattress suitable to your needs, it is also protected by a 25-year manufacturer’s warranty. However, you likely won’t find issues with the mattress as it has the GreenGuard Gold Seal, certifying it against chemical emissions and for comfort.","Each individual layer of the Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen contributes to a more positive experience at night. Whether you’re always tossing in bed or simply wake up with pains in your neck and back, latex beds like this are designed specifically to address these issues. Due to the natural spring of latex, and the use of organic wool and cotton layers, this mattress is a truly comfortable addition to a good night’s rest."]},"id":"58628e2e-3a2f-4ecb-8378-e21b67151262","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59298","url":"/plushbeds-mattressess-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-09T13:25:31Z","datePublished":"2014-04-09T13:25:31Z","name":"Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen","synopsis":"The Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen takes a serious approach to comfort, creating a multi-layered latex mattress that alleviates pressure points on your back and encourages deep sleep.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen takes a serious approach to comfort, creating a multi-layered latex mattress that alleviates pressure points on your back and encourages deep sleep.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-04-09T13:25:31Z","id":"6UZarv3uGiK99uJikKDcCm","meta":{"title":"Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Plushbeds Botanical Bliss Queen is a natural latex mattress that combines five plush layers into a powerful sleeping aid.
