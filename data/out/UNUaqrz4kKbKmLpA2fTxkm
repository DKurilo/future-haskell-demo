The company&#39;s aptly named Photo, Slide and Negative Converter does just that: converts your old 35 mm slides and negatives, as well as photos up to 5 x 7 inches, to digital format. More archaic film sizes like 126 film or Super 8 are not supported, but if you&#39;re among the masses who have boxes of 35 mm slides gathering dust in their attics and basements, Sharper Image&#39;s converter can easily handle your needs. "]},"id":"21efed74-b2bb-4a2a-94dd-eb5fccb1692d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Compatibility"},"id":"9faef5b4-f599-4c46-8ad3-64882f648069","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/grREGWReiJPVmHFXXasiYd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"There are many different types of film, categorized by their size. 35 mm film – and the slides made from those negatives – is the most common.
