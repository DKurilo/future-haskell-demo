The Samsung T220 22-inch Widescreen LCD <a href=\"/best-photo-only-printers\">printer </a>fuses a sleek and colorful look with cutting-edge technology for a result that is bound to impress multimedia fanatics and knock the socks off power gamers. After you try the Samsung T220 you’ll never settle for subpar image or video again.","<br/><strong>Standout Features</strong>","<br/>•\t20,000:1 contrast ratio<br/>•\t2ms response time<br/>•\t1680 x 1050 max resolution<br/>•\tMagicBright preconfigured settings control panel","<br/><strong>Features</strong>","<br/>Let’s set performance aside for a moment. The Samsung T220 22-inch LCD Monitor is one of the most hands-down aesthetically pleasing displays we’ve seen. A single sheet of crystalline glass runs across the display surface of the Samsung T220 where it terminates at the edges in a reddish brown. The monitor is supported by a simple black stand with an oval base that blends well with any workspace. <br/>The sheet of glass protecting the surface of the monitor manages to reduce direct glare and reflections fantastically. After all, what good are stunning features if glare ruins the experience? Happily, it doesn’t, and the Samsung T220 offers truly exceptional performance due to some smart engineering. <br/>The Samsung T220 22-inch Widescreen LCD Monitor displays blacks, whites and all the grays in between beautifully thanks to a 20,000:1 contrast ratio. On the Samsung T220, colors look truer and hues are dead on accurate. Double color fidelity with a 2ms response time and actions sequences in movies and games will be completely unaffected by blurring. Dark Knight on Blu-ray and Fallout 3 will be pushed to entirely new levels of realism and detail on the Samsung T220 LCD Monitor. <br/>The Samsung T220 is a highly versatile display. With a 1680 x 1050 HD video, TV, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 games will look spectacular. And at 22-inches, the Samsung T220 produces images that are highly visible from across the room. Go ahead and use it as a TV in a pinch. The integrated USB hub and HDMI uplink make interfacing with other hardware a breeze. <br/>One of our favorite features is the MagicBright 3 presets on the Samsung T220. There’s a row of buttons that control seven presets that affect brightness, contrast and sharpness according to what you’re doing on your computer. You can automatically adjust the monitor’s settings for gaming, browsing, movies or plain text at the touch of a button. It’s a small touch, but we appreciate the added convenience. A small, discreet bar of buttons is infinitely preferable to manually adjusting settings by trial and error.","<br/><strong>Summary of Reviews from Across the Internet</strong>","<br/>Reviewers appreciate the low power usage of the Samsung T220. Thanks to environmentally friendly design, owners waste less energy and save money on electricity bills.<br/>The Samsung T220’s stand is not height adjustable. Big and tall users may have to use a phonebook or stand to bring the Samsung T220 to eye level.","<br/><strong>Summary</strong>","<br/>Whether it’s the subdued look, incredible colors or feature set, multimedia users with an eye for color, high-performance gamers, and professional media authors will all find something to love about the Samsung T220 22-inch Widescreen LCD monitor."," ","Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gaming-monitors,4533.html\">other spectacular Computer Monitors on TopTenREVIEWS</a> and compare and contrast them.<br/> "]},"id":"070dabbc-989a-4cc4-8618-a5a32dfe0fa7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_7166","url":"/hewlett-packard-3901-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-11-12T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-11-12T07:00:00Z","name":"Hewlett Packard Designjet T1100 Photo Printer","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":4,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-11-12T23:16:33Z","id":"sUESQdtHp76gBe2ewiYsub","meta":{"title":"Hewlett Packard Designjet T1100 Photo Printer Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
