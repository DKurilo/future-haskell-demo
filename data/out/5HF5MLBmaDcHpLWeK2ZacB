This GE JB350 has a large 5.3-cubic-foot capacity oven, an important feature for cooks who feed a large family on a regular basis.","The oven comes with two racks, with five rack positions for the top rack and a fixed, telescoping rack on the bottom level. This specialty rack allows you to extend the rack out without accidentally pulling it all the way out. This is extremely handy when removing large pans with a roast turkey or leg of lamb with both hands.","There is plenty of room to cook multiple dishes at once, and the racks can hold two standard-size cookie sheets or cake pans each. Unfortunately, unlike the best electric stoves, the GE JB350 does not have a keep-warm preset. This feature would allow you to keep a dish warm while you continue to cook on the range or wait for everyone to get to the dinner table.","This electric range is equipped with two 6-inch burners and two 8-inch coils, each with one in front and one in the rear. The coils are GE Power Boil elements, and produce powerful heat rapidly. This means that your pot of water for pasta won&#39;t take very long to boil.","Cooking is a messy job and even the tidiest chef can end up with a dirty electric stove. Fortunately, the GE JB350 is easy to wipe down and clean. You can remove the heating coils and the chrome bowls. You can also lift up the top of the range to clean under the burners to get stray crumbs and spills. The oven is self-cleaning, using extremely high temperatures to burn the food residue to ash. After the cleaning cycle finishes, you just have to wipe out the remainders."]},"id":"ac1dcbc3-bc16-41db-8c2b-175695b351ef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3017ae87-dad8-4aae-a3c6-f483c5c1245e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE JB350 is an excellent cooking range and is a solid option as a replacement oven.
