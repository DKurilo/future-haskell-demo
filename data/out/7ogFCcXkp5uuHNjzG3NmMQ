SlySoft CloneDVD brings an ample amount of features to the table, but they fall short of the breadth offered by our top DVD burning software. However, this short list of features may be more appealing to users who are just looking for a simple, uncomplicated way to burn DVDs. Either way, you will find plenty in SlySoft’s CloneDVD to satisfy your DVD burning needs.","You will get exactly what you need with SlySoft’s CloneDVD: DVD burning software and copying abilities (while conserving the menus and bonus features) and simple burning in just a few steps.","While these basic burning and copying features get most jobs done, CloneDVD’s inability to copy DVDs to CDs disappointed us, as did its complex and unintuitive interface. It also lacks CSS decryption processes, making it even more difficult to create copies of protected DVDs by necessitating the download of separate encryption-removal software.","We were also disappointed by SlySoft’s lack of video file converting features. In a world dominated by the mobile market, we expected to be able to both burn DVDs and convert them into iPhone, Android and other mobile-friendly formats. They do offer another product, CloneDVD Mobile, which has these features, but we would like to see them in their DVD burning software as well.","The time it took to complete a full DVD burn with CloneDVD was a single hour, and the copy it produced was superb. We were quite pleased with the result, and we’re certain it will continue to produce near-perfect copies of your favorite DVDs.","Fortunately, CloneDVD includes most of the key features that you’ll need to burn DVDs. You can burn just the main feature or the entire disc, including bonus features, menus, subtitles, and more. You can also compress multiple DVDs to fit on one disc or separate it out into multiple discs. We particularly enjoyed the “visual quality bar” feature in CloneDVD; this feature shows how variations between Windows operating systems can affect the quality of the burned DVD.","If you are just starting to experiment with burning your own DVDs, CloneDVD is a good place to start. The interface isn’t the simplest, but it does come with several tutorials that make learning how to navigate the application much easier. A handful of tutorials on SlySoft’s site help greatly while you get accustomed to the application."," "]},"id":"d1d305a9-6d87-4ebc-ba98-bc31757cecd7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"25d6f88e-4694-453e-a152-6c874bbaa8fc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Slysoft CloneDVD delivers on its promises, but it may not offer all of the features you’re looking for and it isn’t the easiest application to use.
