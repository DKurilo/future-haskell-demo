Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Encore Protection is a <a href=\"/best-roadside-assistance-services\">roadside assistance service</a> that works with many commercial and fleet customers. Its plans for consumers are managed and sold through Amazon.com, which can make it easy to sign up and manage your subscription.","However, Encore Protection’s standard pricing is one of the highest in the roadside emergency services that we reviewed. It charges nearly $100 for the service, almost twice the price of our number one service. One definite plus to this service, though, is the low cost to add multiple family members. For just a few dollars more per month the service can extend to your immediate family.","With its single, standard plan, Encore Protection gives you five service calls per year and a towing limit of 25 miles per incident. This towing limit is higher than many of the services we reviewed. If you anticipate needing even more towing, though, <a href=\"/good-sam-roadside-assistance-review\">Good Sam&#39;s</a> standard and premium plans offer unlimited towing.","You can sign up for Encore Protection in any U.S. state, and there are no age restrictions. The service also extends into Canada, which is an added benefit if you’re planning a road trip north.","One downside to this emergency roadside service is its lack of a premium plan. While other services we reviewed offered extra benefits for higher costs, Encore only offers its single or family plans. With these plans you do get access to some concierge service and retail discounts, but there is no travel-interruption reimbursement if you get into an accident, and there is no option for car insurance. If you want the most premium services, <a href=\"/aaa-review\">AAA</a> is our top pick and it offers can insurance as well as concierge service to help you plan and book your trips.","Because this company doesn’t have customer service agents for its consumer-level protection plans, you’ll need to contact Amazon.com to get service or help with your account. While Amazon has a good reputation for customer service, the fact that you can’t go directly to the servicer for this plan drew negative marks from our reviewers. This service does offer a mobile app, however, which should help if you need the emergency services."]},"id":"97624bd8-731a-4e4e-b7b4-5999f80d7691","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b2be525c-842e-480b-a5b0-0dae1fc712df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Encore Protection offers some good perks in its roadside assistance service, especially if you pay the extra fee for full family coverage. Since you get 25 miles of towing included with each of the five yearly service calls, you’ll be able to get your car to your destination, even if you break down along the way. However, because the service is managed and serviced through Amazon, you won’t be able to talk to Encore Protection customer service agents about your account.
