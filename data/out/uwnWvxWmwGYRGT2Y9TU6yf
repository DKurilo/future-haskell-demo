You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The second of the two robot vacuums offered by DirtDevil is the DirtDevil RoomMate. Available in DirtDevil’s signature red, this <a href=\"/best-robot-vacuums\">robot vacuum cleaner</a> has eight sets of brushes and an undercarriage cleaning cloth that work together to clean your hard floor surfaces. A drop sensor is also included to ensure your robot vacuum doesn’t take a tumble down your stairs.","To operate the DirtDevil RoomMate, simply place the unit in a room you would like cleaned, turn it on and shut the door. The sweeping brushes will move dust and crumbs under the vacuum’s suction area. It is recommended to dump the dustbin out after each use and rinse the filter. However, if you aren’t strict on this, there is a full bin indicator to let you know when cleaning out the bin is necessary.","This robot vacuum doesn’t have an intelligent sensor to determine when it has cleaned the entire room, so you’ll need to remove it from one room and move it to another. The battery lasts for approximately 50 minutes until it needs to be recharged. Four hours of charging between uses is recommended and, quite honestly, inconvenient. This aspect of the RoomMate is our least favorite feature. You have to recharge the unit for longer than it actually runs. Cleaning your entire house would be an all day process. Might as well just break out the upright vacuum and get it done faster. You also can’t schedule the RoomMate to start cleaning automatically, and it doesn’t work well on carpeted floors.","DirtDevil offers users a one-year warranty, and online and over-the-phone technical support. They have a video tutorial for the RoomMate robot vacuum cleaner and a fairly helpful user manual. We contacted them via email and received a response back within a few days."]},"id":"c085ccb4-406f-493a-ae83-f3cef7f68d27","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cb15bd0e-928e-4744-8055-b59f2561660a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The DirtDevil RoomMate isn’t the most impressive robot vacuum cleaner, but it is efficient in cleaning your hard floor surfaces.
