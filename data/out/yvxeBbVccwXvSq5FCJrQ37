However, if basic is what fits your fancy, this integrated dishwasher will be ideal.","This isn’t the quietest dishwasher on our comparison, but it still has a fairly quiet sound rating at 48 decibels. You can fit up to 15 place settings into a single load with this Samsung dishwasher, which is spacious.","Although it has just four wash cycles and two wash options, it includes the staple features. The wash cycles you get on this unit are normal, heavy, delicate and smart auto. None of these are specialty wash cycles, but they cover the basic functions. The features most consumers will miss are an express cycle and a rinse only cycle. The wash options you get on this unit are a delay start option – which you can use to delay the start time to three, six or nine hours – and a sanitize option, which will sanitize your dishes using high temperature water.","This integrated dishwasher also includes an adjustable racking system that allows you to fit tall items on the top rack. The unit includes other rack conveniences such as an upper rack cup shelf, removable tines on the lower rack and a two-piece silverware basket on the lower shelf.","While the Samsung dishwasher bears the ENERGY STAR label, it lacks eco-friendly dry options. However, you do get the smart auto wash cycle, which can assist you in being energy conscious. The smart auto wash cycle will sense what wash cycle is necessary based on the dishes you load, making sure you only use the amount of water and energy necessary.","You get an excellent warranty with this Samsung built-in dishwasher. For the first year, the parts and labor are covered; the racks and electronics are backed by a five-year warranty. Additionally, the unit’s tub and door liner have a lifetime warranty.","Samsung provides help and support by phone, live chat and you can send them an email by filling out an online contact form on the Samsung website. Samsung also provides the unit’s user manual, FAQs and some tutorials on its website for quick reference."]},"id":"7d964812-506f-4d99-9d74-f0e9f6ae643b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"10ddcd30-3cc8-44dd-9993-6f1497f07000","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You don’t get any specialty wash cycles or options on the Samsung DW80F600UTS dishwasher, but it is energy efficient and offers standard functionality that will clean dishes well.
