You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you knead bread and love making big dough, the KitchenAid KGSS907SSS is a move in the rye direction. This KitchenAid model is a <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">slide-in gas range</a> comes with great features for bakers, cooks and regular families alike. Features like dehydration for baking fruit into bread, convection baking, broiling and bread proofing to encourage yeast fermentation in bread. The warming drawer below the 4.1 cubic foot oven keeps rolls, plates and other meals warm while you prepare other foods. The hidden bake element adds extra space in the oven chamber so you can squeeze in that extra batch of cookies.","The KitchenAid KGSS907SSS is available in black, white and stainless steel to match your kitchen and your other appliances. The stovetop features a powerful triple tier burner with low and high heat on the same burner. Between the four burners, output ranges from 6,000 to a powerful 15,000 –BTUs, or British Thermal Units, for an even wider range of cooking capabilities. Melt butter or chocolate on the gentle simmer or sear steak, boil water, or stir-fry veggies on the higher settings. The two large continuous grates make sliding cookware from burner to burner easy and reduces the risk of spilling your food. But because accidents do happen, the smooth stainless steel or porcelain-enamel top is easy to clean with basic stainless steel cleaner or all-purpose.","Convection baking spreads heat throughout the oven chamber and eliminates cold pockets. The easy convection conversion system takes the guesswork out of using this efficient cooking method and bakes your dishes faster and more evenly. The two powerful oven lights make it easier to check the progress of your cooking without letting out air from opening the oven door.","The limited parts and labor warranty lasts a year and you must hire a professional to install this slide-in gas range. Be sure you have enough counter space in your kitchen for this KitchenAid model. It measures 35.65 -inches high, 30 -inches wide and 27.25 -inches deep.","Whether you&#39;re a pro with dough or just need a durable range for regular family meals, the KitchenAid KGSS907SSS offers a wide range of features for baking enthusiasts and regular users alike."]},"id":"47cfa994-7bb4-4db3-b552-0b47108231d6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58010","url":"/kitchenaid-slide-in-range-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T12:58:22Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T12:58:22Z","name":"KitchenAid KGSS907SS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
