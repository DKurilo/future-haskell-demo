This, of course, allows you to monitor from home or check in on your baby anytime if, for instance, your baby is with a sitter and you and your spouse step out.","This is incredibly convenient. It cuts down on extra hardware and lets you do things you can&#39;t do on a traditional monitor, like toggle between an eBook and your napping baby using the same device.","While this monitor is not the most attractive on the market, it&#39;s not what you would call ugly either. And when you see how well it functions, you&#39;ll get used to the design and may even start liking it. It calls to mind a friendly little E.T.-like alien, looking out for your little one.

If they added a zoom feature to go with the pan and tilt, it would be close to perfection. At times you may get a little lag, but it will run great most of the time. This panning and scanning will all happen quietly enough it won&#39;t disturb a sleeping baby, and even an awake baby may not notice it.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56774-ibaby-monitor5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oawroHVJ6e9QBr99R5ZyD5.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"oawroHVJ6e9QBr99R5ZyD5","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oawroHVJ6e9QBr99R5ZyD5.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c4aa640e-8593-4ae3-a873-b4ef2e3eba2d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This unit also allows you to take photos from the application of resolutions up to 640 x 480.
