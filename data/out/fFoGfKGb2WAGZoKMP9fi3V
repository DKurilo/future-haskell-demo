While these systems effectively monitor your home for such threats, it lacks some of the services and supplementary support options that the best home security systems offer, such as alerts for flooding, power failure and natural gas leaks.","Your contract with Guardian runs five years, which is quite long in the home-security industry. The monthly cost for the basic service, Edge Essential, is somewhat higher than the basic services of other security systems we reviewed. If you end the contract early, you are responsible for paying 75 percent of the balance.","The Edge Essential package comes with a color, touchscreen control panel that sends weather alerts, has emergency signal buttons and offers two-way voice communication with Guardian operators. It also includes three door and window sensors, a motion sensor, two window decals and two yard signs. Guardian offers a total of four security packages, and each includes the GE Simon XT control unit. With all plans, you can fully control your system from your smartphone, computer or tablet.","With the more advanced security packages, you can opt for home automation. These plans increase incrementally – with additional costs – giving you the ability to control a variety of home features. The next plan, Edge Control, lets you remotely control your lights, thermostat, garage door and door locks. Edge Plus, another plan, gives you all of these features plus an image sensor that sends you a live view inside your home. The most advanced plan, Edge Premium, offers two indoor cameras and live video streaming.","You also have the option of selecting additional equipment, including heat or smoke alarms, medical pendants, a remote control key fob, an outdoor security camera with night vision and more.","Unfortunately, you cannot get alerts for flooding, power failure or natural gas leaks.","GE manufactures all of Guardian Protection&#39;s equipment. However, this system  must be professionally installed; you cannot do it yourself. All of Guardian&#39;s equipment has lifetime warranty coverage. If you choose, you can make use of existing equipment already installed at your home.","Guardian&#39;s wireless system offers advantages over traditional landline-based systems. Phone-based systems are vulnerable to experienced intruders who know how to disable a landline system with wire cutters. Wired systems are also more difficult to install.","The company offers useful help and support. You can contact representatives directly via email or phone but not live chat. The reps we spoke to were positive and courteous. The support site also features user guides as well as basic FAQs and a blog."]},"id":"67438bde-9e8e-40c3-9926-f5b88a5319e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9cb7d4a2-09c5-476d-936f-05be67a398a3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for reasonably good home security to guard against fires and intruders, Guardian Protection Services is a fine option.
