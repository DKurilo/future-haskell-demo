The body of the thermometer features just a few buttons – one for power, up and down arrows to scroll through menus, a button to switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius and another to set alarms.","The body has a docking station to hold the wireless receiver, and because you don’t have to fuss with pairing it to a smartphone or tablet, just insert the 5.75-inch probe connected to the base station into your meat and the thermometer will do the rest.","The wireless receiver can be used up to 250 feet away, and the receiver&#39;s display has large numbers that are easy to read. The display is also illuminated, making it possible to read it when grilling at night. We like the fact that this grill thermometer supports two probes, both of which are included in your purchase price. Weber&#39;s probe senses temperatures from 32 degrees up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit. While it doesn&#39;t register as wide of a range of temperatures as other thermometers we tested, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem for most cooks.","This digital grill thermometer is powered by two AA batteries that can be easily replaced by opening the back with a coin instead of a screwdriver—a nice time-saver since it’s usually easier to grab a coin than locate a screwdriver. The instructions are straightforward, clearly describing the simple set-up process.","Unfortunately, the thermometer doesn&#39;t have an automatic shut-off feature, so if you accidentally leave the BBQ thermometer powered on, it will die out. The thermometer comes with pre-programmed temperatures and standard cooking times set by the USDA, which is a great feature when it comes to food safety. You can select from lamb, chicken, beef, pork, seafood, turkey and veal.","Weber offers a two-year warranty for the Weber 6741 Style Wireless Thermometer, which is twice as long as most top-notch digital grill thermometers. Weber offers telephone and email support, or you can find FAQs online, if you need answers to any questions."]},"id":"722f88e8-5973-42ea-b14e-9a0d346de047","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60113","url":"/weber-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-31T21:27:05Z","datePublished":"2014-07-31T21:27:05Z","name":"Weber 6741","synopsis":"Weber’s Style Wireless Thermometer is a basic digital grilling thermometer that is a snap to set up and to use.","review":{"rating":75,"verdict":"The Weber Style Wireless Thermometer isn&#039;t a Bluetooth-smart thermometer.
