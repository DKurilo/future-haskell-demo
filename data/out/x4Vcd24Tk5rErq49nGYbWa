This is obviously an eco-friendly option that both reduces cost and lowers environmental impact.","Information can be obtained without leaving your desk! Need to do some last minute research on a particular topic? Simply find a great eBook store, search for your keywords or phrases, purchase the book and you’re set!","Unlike paper books and materials, digital books only require one device to carry around with you. This means you can carry a library of various book genres for every mood.","eBooks can lower the cost of enjoying your favorite titles. With no shipping and handling costs, eBooks typically have prices that are 50-60% lower than their print counterparts.","eBooks are more flexible than paper books. For those who have trouble reading the typical book-sized font, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook readers</a> can enlarge the font size to make reading more pleasurable and easier on the eyes.","eBooks can contain multi-media elements not available with traditional books. Audio and video can be embedded to make reading a fully immersive experience.","Ever wonder where that great passage in your favorite book went to?

While traditional books can be copied with machines, the time and cost of doing so typically keeps this type of piracy at bay. With eBooks however, “sharing” books that have not been purchased with others is as easy as posting a file online or, in some cases, copying and pasting the text from one document to another.","Many people still prefer being able to hold a traditional book in their hands. For those of us who enjoy reading a book in bed before signing off for the night, a cold hard digital device just  won’t be the same.","While one advantage of eBook devices is their ability to enlarge fonts for easier reading, the fact is one is still reading off an LCD screen. Unlike paper, these screens provide a glare that not only make reading inconvenient if the lighting isn’t just right, the glare may actually cause eye strain and make it more difficult to focus while reading.","With the wide variety of formats and eReader  devices on the market, choosing which device is the right one for all situations can be nearly impossible. Though compatible formats have been introduced that should allow most readers to view purchases, many of these still lack proper formatting. Without proper page layouts and spacing reading becomes more of a tedious chore than an enjoyable pastime. With traditional books one simply buys and reads!","When is the last time you had to plug your paper book into the wall outlet? How disappointing would it be to find yourself right in the middle of a steamy romance scene while traveling only to have the batteries in your reading device die, with no way to charge them?","Currently eBooks have an unreliable life span. Paper books last for decades provided they are well cared for.
