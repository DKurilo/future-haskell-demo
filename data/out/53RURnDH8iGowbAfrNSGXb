With this stove, you get a 6.3-cubic-foot oven with seven oven rack positions so you can position numerous pans, casserole dishes and ceramic cookware the way you want. The heating element on the back of the oven and its powerful fan ensure the heat will circulate evenly. With a rapid-boil burner among the five on the stovetop, you can bring foods to a boil fast, and the central oval heating area makes a great spot for a griddle.

That’s why we searched for a variety of gas ranges.","We examined features including the types and number of burners, the Btu levels for the burners, whether you get a griddle/grill area, whether the grill/griddle comes with the range, the oven size, the number of oven racks and rack slots, the type of heating used for baking and roasting, and more.","We also considered price since that is a key consideration for many consumers. While some cooks will spend plenty to get every feature they want on a gas range, more budget-minded people choose a range that fits their pocketbook and still has the capabilities they find most useful in cooking. For some, it might be a rapid-boil burner; others want lots of oven rack positions for baking. Still others need a Sabbath mode to keep food safely warm for hours for religious reasons.","We consulted with professionals and did extensive online research, reading blogs and dozens of customer and professional reviews, to get insights into the cooking performance of different models and select some of the best models out there.","Professional cooks often prefer gas ranges and cooktops because of the control it gives you when cooking. You have immediate control over the temperature and can visually adjust the heat by looking at the size of the flame. Blogs like <a href=\"http://www.olgasflavorfactory.com/olgastips/kitchen-tips/chose-gas-cooktop/\">Olga’s Flavor Factory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.builddirect.com/blog/playing-with-fire-how-to-choose-a-gas-range/\">BuildDirect</a> attest to this. Olga also feels that gas cooktops are easier to clean, though she acknowledges that many people feel electric cooktops are easier. Having the ability to wash the grates in the sink and clean out the nooks and crannies underneath, she feels, is an advantage.   ","Jill Canty, the author of the BuildDirect gas range blog, provides helpful advice about installing a gas range. She said that before buying a gas range it’s important to pay attention to details like if you have the right amount of space for it and determining if there is a gas connection where you want it installed. These blogs agree that gas ranges are cost effective in the long run. A gas range may cost as much or even more than an electric range to buy initially, but gas ranges cost less to run.","We talked to Nick Cash, a former restaurant owner from Utah. He and his brother owned and operated the Bistro 258, a beloved restaurant in Ogden, Utah, for eight and a half years. Cash said they used gas in his restaurant for everything upstairs and on the main floor. They used an electric oven in the basement for baking bread and roasting vegetables. This was a good arrangement because gas would have been disallowed downstairs due to a lack of ventilation. “Gas was clean and quick to ignite, especially for the type of demand in a restaurant,” Cash said.","As for cooking at home, he said his wife Jolene loves to cook on a gas cooktop. “She loves having instantaneous flame and heat,” he said. However, he said Jolene is not crazy about a gas oven because she feels it tends to distribute heat less evenly than an electric oven. Cash acknowledged that their gas oven does not have convection capabilities, which could dramatically improve the heat distribution problem his wife has experienced. For these reasons, Cash says their next range will consist of a gas cooktop and an electric convection oven.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","To find the best gas ranges, we combed the internet, looking for models that would suit a wide range of cooks, but at a reasonable range of prices to accommodate all our readers. We read manufacturers’ websites as well as the details in user manuals, checked the warranties, called manufacturers to ask questions, and carefully studied consumer reviews. A key element in our investigation was whether a particular gas range could adapt to different styles of cooking so you could, for example, make Mexican food one night, Chinese the next and down-home Southern comfort food another day. We also considered how these gas ranges would look in your kitchen since free-standing gas ranges are an integral part of the kitchen decor. Any gas range worth its salt should look attractive and be relatively easy to clean.","<strong>What to Look for in a Gas Range</strong>","Cooking Capabilities<br/>The best gas ranges give you burners to fit different pans and let you adjust the flame and heat levels. Most cooks appreciate a stovetop with dedicated burners for certain tasks, such as a burner with a quick boiling function or a warming burner so you can keep foods hot without scorching them. A continuous and level cast-iron grate across the top allows you to safely slide a full, heavy pot from one area to the next without having to lift it.","Pricing<br/> The gas ranges in our lineup are priced between about $600 and $2,000, though the majority are well under $1,000. A search on the Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s websites reveals that top selling gas ranges start out as low as $450 up to more than $4,000. The pricier ones have special features like double ovens. If you are interested in a double oven gas range, there are some nice midrange options like the <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/pd/GE-30-in-5-Burner-4-3-cu-ft-2-5-cu-ft-Self-Cleaning-Double-Oven-Convection-Gas-Range-Fingerprint-Resistant-Slate/999912479\">GE JCB860EEJES</a> that also has the advantage of convection baking. Slide-in gas ranges with front controls are also more expensive than the free standing ranges in our lineup that have controls in the back. The <a href=\"/electrolux-ei30gf45qs-review\">Electrolux EI30GF45QS</a> is the most expensive gas range in our lineup. It is a slide-in range with plenty of extras, including convention technology, and it has a wide Btu range. It’s capacity, however, is smaller than many more economically priced ranges in our lineup.","Extras<br/>Extras like an elongated burner and an integrated griddle allow the cook to whip up dishes ranging from pancakes to paninis. Many cooks also like a delay-start function, and it&#39;s useful to have a gas range with a warming pan so you can keep foods like dinner rolls warm while the rest of a meal is cooking on the stovetop itself.","Easy Cleanup <br/>Look for a gas range with sealed burners that can easily be wiped clean. It&#39;s also a good idea to look for a recessed pan on the stovetop because it catches any liquid spills or drips and keeps them right there. Many gas ranges come with self-cleaning functions that heat up and burn away oven messes, but it&#39;s also quite helpful to have an extra steam-cleaning function that uses water to help steam debris off the oven interior."]},"id":"7d47d190-15d1-45fc-9dba-c0ede1931910","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"4babe374-421f-45ad-8b7a-b16dd1a620c5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/lg-review\">LG LRG4115ST</a>","<a href=\"/samsung-review\">Samsung NX58F5700WS</a>","<a href=\"/ge-jb700sejss-review\">GE JB700SEJSS</a>","<a href=\"/maytag-mgr6600fb-review\">Maytag MGR6600FB</a>","<a href=\"/frigidaire-ffgf3054tb-review\">Frigidaire FFGF3054TB</a>","<a href=\"/whirlpool-wfg525s0hv-review\">Whirlpool WFG525S0HV</a>","<a href=\"/kenmore-elite-74233-review\">Kenmore Elite 74233</a>","<a href=\"/electrolux-ei30gf45qs-review\">Electrolux EI30GF45QS</a>","<a href=\"/amana-review\">Amana AGR6603SFS</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a9360364-b2fc-46fc-8fa4-010d230df295","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_365","url":"/best-gas-ranges","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-22T16:22:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-22T16:22:00Z","name":"Best Gas Ranges of 2019","synopsis":"We carefully evaluated gas ranges and based our ranked them best to worst based on power, precision, capacity and overall feature package.","review":{},"strapline":"We carefully evaluated gas ranges and based our ranked them best to worst based on power, precision, capacity and overall feature package.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-21T03:06:27Z","id":"53RURnDH8iGowbAfrNSGXb","meta":{"title":"Best Gas Ranges of 2019 - Reviews of Gas Ranges","description":"We carefully evaluated gas ranges and based our ranked them best to worst based on power, precision, capacity and overall feature package.
