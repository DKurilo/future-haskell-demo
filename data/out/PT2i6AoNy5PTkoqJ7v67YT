This can be a big decision for your loved ones to make.

These documents should contain anything pertinent that you want them to know that is not spelled out in your will. This document could be used to let your executor know exactly how you’d like your belongings handled before and even during the reading of the will.","Have you thought about giving the gift of life by donating your organs to someone in need after you pass away? If you would like to help increase another person&#39;s quality of life by donating, simply fill out the form in this will software, and your survivors will know that was your last wish.","Another great document included in this will software is a document for survivors.
