You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","Most <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook readers</a> send you to a single digital storefront, and you have to hope the books and magazines you want are available for a good price. The Onyx Boox M96 is an Android eReader, which means you can download a variety of reading apps, rather than using the built-in reader. If you like a particular store, you can download the reading app affiliated with that store and use it to purchase and read books. This freedom also allows you to download third-party eBooks that may not be on a major digital storefront. Unfortunately, the M96 is plagued with a poor design and a difficult user interface. While this eReader gives you access to the most variety, it&#39;s more cumbersome to use is priced much higher than most other eBook readers we reviewed.","The Onyx Boox M96 has a huge screen at 9.7 inches, but its resolution is not as great as other eReaders. Also, it lacks a front-lit screen, so you cannot read in the dark. The device itself is surprisingly hefty for its relatively small size. At less than half an inch thick and under 10 inches long, it looks small, but it weighs over a pound, more than most other eBook readers.","The best aspect of the M96 is its open platform. With its Android 4.0 operating system, you can download multiple reading apps, which then give you access to digital storefronts. For example, you can download the Kindle reading app and then buy eBooks from Amazon’s bookstore. The eReader comes with 4GB of storage space, allowing you to download about 3,500 books.","Unfortunately, if you download and store several books, you’ll quickly learn that navigating the menus and finding books is a pain. The interface is clunky, and most of the apps do not work properly with the M96’s unique design. Even though there are buttons to move forward and backward, if you are reading a book through the Kindle app, you can only turn pages with the included stylus. In addition to the disappointing interface, the battery lasts half as long as other eBook readers. You can read for roughly two weeks with the Wi-Fi turned off, compared to the standard 30-day battery life we’ve become used to."]},"id":"61b978ef-0b9d-4b99-8de3-dabfe60a8569","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b9e3eed4-a0de-48df-b273-20cf7a436276","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Onyx Boox M96 is an Android eReader, which means that you can download and read eBooks through a variety of reader apps, including Kindle.
