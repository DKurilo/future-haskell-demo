It can also remove clear-water iron and filter out sediment.","This single-tank water softener uses resin media to remove calcium and magnesium from your water supply. It can absorb 45,000 grains of hardness before requiring a regeneration cycle. This system removes up to 120 grains of hardness per gallon, which is extreme hardness, and up to 12 parts per million of clear-water iron from your water supply. The softener media also acts as a self-cleaning sediment filter that does not require you to change it. This water softening system works with municipal water or well water.","As a salt water softener, it uses resin media to strip calcium and magnesium from water. Once the media reaches its full capacity of hard water minerals, a brine solution removes the accumulated minerals. The regeneration cycle also flushes out the sediment the resin media has drawn out of your home&#39;s water. This process requires a wastewater drain for the used brine solution and an electrical connection to operate the control unit.","The regeneration cycle removes up to 5,089 grains of hardness per pound of salt from the softener media. The control panel lets you set the time of day, regeneration time and hardness of the source water, which you can find out by contacting your water provider or using a home test kit. Morton&#39;s Look Ahead technology monitors your water usage to schedule regeneration cycles as needed. You can also initiate an immediate regeneration cycle.","The system uses a space-saving single-canister design, with the resin tank enclosed in the salt reservoir. The reservoir holds up to 210 pounds of salt. It has a service flow rate of 18 gpm, which is sufficient for a household of any size. This water softener comes with the basic valves and fittings required to set up the system. If you prefer a high-functioning, two-tank system, the <a href=\"/us-water-systems-review\">US Water Aquatrol 56SSE</a> is a good choice.","Morton offers a one-year in-home service warranty on this unit. It also offers a three-year warranty on electronic components and a good 10-year warranty on the salt storage and resin media tanks.","The Morton 45,000 Grain Capacity Water Softener is a high-capacity unit that softens extremely hard water and removes high levels of clear-water iron. The water softener media acts as a self-cleaning sediment filter. This unit can handle both city and well water for any size of household."]},"id":"50b75238-195b-45e2-bc4d-69b3a75a32d8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63256","url":"/morton-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:22:08Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:22:08Z","name":"Morton 45,000 Grain Capacity","synopsis":"The Morton 45,000 Grain Capacity Water Softener is a salt-based water softener with the capacity to treat very hard water.
