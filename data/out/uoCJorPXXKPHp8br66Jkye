However, with no inline microphone or remote control and a design that is primarily for women, they are not for everyone.","The FitClips sport earbuds are for women and feature a small, light design to make them comfortable to wear. They come in a number of fun colors that you can choose to match your sportswear or music player. They are also sweat and water resistant, allowing you to participate in any type of sports, although they are not waterproof or suitable for water immersion sports such as snorkeling or swimming.","A flexible earhook bends around the upper ear, while the earbud goes directly into the ear canal. The result is a lightweight hook that is comfortable but still sturdy enough to keep the earbuds in for popular sports such as rock climbing and yoga. Because the earhook bends around the ear, it fits most sizes without causing discomfort. Once you slide the hooks over your ears, you can adjust them yourself or wait for them to adjust with gravity to the shape of your ears. If you have larger ears, the small design might not be a good fit.","Each pair comes with small, medium and large ear clips, allowing you to adjust the size based on your ear for proper sealing and comfort. The latex clips fit smoothly to cushion the ear while sealing in sound. The intra-aural headphones fit directly into the ear canal to provide high-quality sound, even when running.","With no noise canceling properties, the earbuds are suitable for outdoor use, including for activities that take place around vehicles. However, you may prefer a noise canceling pair if you plan on using them at the gym, where loud noises can be distracting. The sport earbuds also lack an inline microphone and remote control, which means that you have to stop and take out your phone to answer calls and change, pause or skip songs. This is definitely inconvenient if you are jogging, running or cycling.","A lightweight design, colorful exterior and small earclips make the Koss FitClips a comfortable option for their main demographic, women. Combined with multiple color options and quality audio, and they make a good basic pair of sports earbuds for active women."]},"id":"64b20b33-76ab-43cc-8694-6d08f7ce9812","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63401","url":"/koss-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T21:49:00Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T21:49:00Z","name":"Koss FitClips KSC32","synopsis":"The Koss FitClips KSC32 sport earbuds have flexible over-the-ear loops, a lightweight design and they are water resistant, making them suitable for most types of sports.
