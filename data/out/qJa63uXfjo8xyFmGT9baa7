A facial cleansing brush is absolutely necessary to remove these products that could be clogging your pores.”","During our most recent review of facial cleansing brushes, we researched a list of more than 30 products and narrowed it to our 10 favorites. Then, we acquired the brushes, evaluated them in our lab and tested them personally at home. This gave us valuable insight on both the benefits of using facial cleansing brushes and on which attachments are most useful. From face and body brush heads to sponges and pumice stones, we tried them all.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Before we ordered and acquired any of the 10 facial cleansing brushes we tested, we researched them in detail to record product specifications and study consumer reviews. We also reached out to manufacturers and skin care specialists to learn which features to consider most carefully and how to use the brushes properly.","Once we received, unpackaged and photographed the brushes, we examined them individually to get a feel for their handle grips, power sources and settings. We then took them home for hands-on testing.","To achieve the best results, manufacturers of facial cleansing brushes recommend using their products for several weeks. This lets your skin adjust to a new, more thorough cleaning system that may cause initial outbreaks and irritation as your pores release impurities. It also gives your skin time to experience the benefits of improved circulation and collagen production that using a facial cleansing brush can provide."]},"id":"4ec31fa5-9810-4389-827a-0fb094f46e82","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/WXRZLzMiYovm52vNfsnetU.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/facial-cleansing-brushes-testing-clarisonic-mia-2/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9UL00vNzk5NDAyL29yaWdpbmFsL0ZhY2lhbC1DbGVhbnNpbmctQnJ1c2hlcy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMi5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WXRZLzMiYovm52vNfsnetU.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"WXRZLzMiYovm52vNfsnetU","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WXRZLzMiYovm52vNfsnetU.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c2959896-970c-4f4d-b000-a911e4a523ce","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While our testing schedule didn’t accommodate using each brush for a full month, we did spend enough time with each one to get a feel for its handle comfort, durability and cleansing settings.

Even if you’ve removed your makeup prior to using the device, you’ll notice that the brush lifts and removes additional debris and impurities from your face.","Keep in mind that some facial cleansing brushes have rechargeable batteries, while others require two to four AA batteries. Also, you’ll notice diminished brush performance if you don’t replace brush heads as they wear. While most manufacturers recommend replacing brush heads every two to three months, the best indicators of a facial cleansing brush’s performance are its results.","“You can tell if you have a good brush by the results on your skin,” Dr. Lee said. “Do you see a healthy glow after using it? Or do you see more redness and irritation? Do you notice that your skin is clearing up? Or do you notice that it’s actually clogging your pores more and giving you acne? The results of the brushes speak for themselves.”","Features<br/>When you purchase a facial cleansing brush with multiple speed settings, you can customize its cleaning intensity to your skin type. On a related note, we recommend identifying in advance whether you’re primarily looking for an exfoliation tool or a product that’s safe for sensitive skin.","“Look for a brush that fits your needs,” Dr. Lee advises. “There are firmer brush heads that can provide a deeper clean to tougher skin and gentle heads that can be swapped out for sensitive skin. Facial brushes also come with different speeds, which relates to how fast the brush head turns. Finding one with multiple speeds allows you to be more gentle on sensitive areas and more aggressive on areas with rough skin. Also, look for a brush handle that is waterproof. Most brushes are battery-powered, and you want to make sure that the case is waterproof if you need wash the brush handle.”","While each of the facial cleansing brushes we tested is water-resistant, the best products are 100 percent waterproof. This means you can safely wash them under running water and use them in the shower or bathtub as well."]},"id":"e659196e-38e9-4e91-a5f2-7b19a22f2fef","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ozwRcCmhTaspkZcgcfb4M9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/facial-cleansing-brushes-testing-foreo/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9UL08vNzk5NDA0L29yaWdpbmFsL0ZhY2lhbC1DbGVhbnNpbmctQnJ1c2hlcy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwNC5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozwRcCmhTaspkZcgcfb4M9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ozwRcCmhTaspkZcgcfb4M9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozwRcCmhTaspkZcgcfb4M9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e49db558-6ba1-49a2-a3c0-8cb1e512c4c1","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Accessories<br/>Most facial cleansing brushes come with both a standard brush head and a softer, more gentle brush for sensitive skin.

A select few products also have a charging station or upright stand to help keep your bathroom counter organized.","Warranty &amp; Support<br/>If something goes wrong with your facial cleansing brush, it’s nice to have support options available.

Some companies also offer support by text and Facebook Messenger.","<strong>Acne &amp; Sensitive Skin</strong>","If you have acne-prone skin, an exfoliating cleansing brush could help. These brushes clear away dead skin cells, an excess of which, combined with oil, can lead to breakouts. That being said, you should always use a new cleanser pad every single time you use the brush. This will prevent the spread of bacteria or unwanted oil buildup. The downside to using a cleanser brush if you have acne is that it could cause you to break out more initially as the dead skin cells are cleaned away, leaving more fragile skin underneath.","Most cystic acne sufferers shouldn&#39;t use facial cleansing brushes, as it can cause the breakout to spread. Cystic acne is often itchy or painful and occurs when the infection is deep in the skin. Using a cleanser brush on these areas can cause a cyst to burst, which in turn usually causes the infection to spread. Therefore, you should spot test any facial cleanser and brush you buy before you use it on your full face. This is good advice for anyone, not just those with acne or sensitive skin.","Whether you’re prone to breakouts or not, it’s important to keep the brush head on your facial brush clean. Clean it after every use with warm water, and if you can still see any makeup, use a mild soap to get the brush back to its appropriate color. Once it&#39;s clean, simply pat it dry with a cloth."]},"id":"6fb567d9-f797-4bbe-80d6-059edb905e93","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"b4e94b5e-1435-4414-8fe7-a56fcb4af4ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/essential-skin-solutions-review\">Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin</a>","<a href=\"/etereauty-review\">Etereauty 5-in-1 Beauty Care Massager</a>","<a href=\"/vanity-planet-review\">Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa</a>","<a href=\"/mary-kay-review\">Mary Kay Skinvigorate</a>","<a href=\"/clarisonic-review\">Clarisonic Mia 2</a>","<a href=\"/conair-true-glow-review\">Conair True Glow</a>","<a href=\"/foreo-luna-review\">Foreo Luna Mini 2</a>","<a href=\"/neutrogena-review\">Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System</a>","<a href=\"/olay-review\">Olay ProX</a>","<a href=\"/clinique-review\">Clinique Sonic System</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3e25ea12-d95e-415f-9605-8a3638f9be06","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_169","url":"/best-facial-cleansing-brushes","authors":[{"email":"jchristensen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-09T16:49:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-09T16:49:00Z","name":"Best Facial Cleansing Brushes of 2019","synopsis":"Most scrubs, cleansers and astringents can't give you the deep cleansing and exfoliation that a motorized facial brush can.","review":{},"strapline":"Most scrubs, cleansers and astringents can't give you the deep cleansing and exfoliation that a motorized facial brush can.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-14T21:31:48Z","id":"qJa63uXfjo8xyFmGT9baa7","meta":{"title":"Best Facial Cleansing Brushes of 2019 -
