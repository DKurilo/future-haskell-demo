You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Researching and reviewing the top 10 <a href=\"/best-universal-remotes\">universal remote</a> products for our side-by-side comparison has been both enlightening and informational. Now, at our number 10 product, we are certain that you know exactly what to look for when searching for and purchasing a universal remote. The Universal Remote Control MASTERCONTROL RF20 is our number 10 product for good reasons. We are thrilled, however, to have finally found a remote with RF capabilities. With thousands of device codes preprogrammed into the RF20, you can control household components located away from your living room and entertainment center.","The MASTERCONTROL RF20 does have a few features we were not expecting to see, including the child lock feature. Unlike the Philips SRU8010, this is not a restriction function that limits what channels and functions your children can use, but rather a total lock function, blocking your child from all operations of the remote.","After reading consumer horror stories about programming this remote with only the user manual, we are happy to report that the RF20 does have the learning mode function that allows commands to be learned from one remote and transferred to the new universal remote.","Our favorite function and feature of this media center remote is the RF capabilities. No longer will you have a max operating distance, but you can go wherever you want within your house and still control your devices.","We were disappointed in the missing low-battery indicator, motion sensor to preserve battery power and automatic backlit function. However, the LCD screen and buttons can be backlit if you use the light button on the side of the remote.","The MASTERCONTROL RF20, when compared to the Harmony One or any of the top five remotes in our universal remote review, looks outdated, and the design is easily outdone. The URC RF20&#39;s specifications claim that the main screen is an LCD screen, but again, when comparing our top products, this screen is definitely not as spectacular as the 2-inch color touch monitor of the Harmony One or the 2.8-inch color display of the Philips SRT9320.","This particular programmable remote uses four AAA batteries, which seems like a lot compared to the two AA batteries used by most of the other all-in-one remotes.","With the purchase of the URC RF20, you receive a &#34;Quick Setup DVD Program Guide&#34; that has systematic instructions for setup. On the Universal Remote Control website, you can also access a user guide in PDF form. This manual is meant to be a companion to the DVD guide.","Macro programming for this remote is extremely difficult and requires frequent calls to the technical support line, which is actually extremely helpful.","When compared to the Logitech Harmony line of universal remotes, or even the Philips remotes, the URC RF20 is very difficult to program. Universal Remote Control has provided an online users guide and a DVD guide (to be used only on a PC). There&#39;s also a technical support phone number that customers can call.","This particular universal remote requires intense macro programming, and unless you have owned a URC remote previously, or are just a technical genius, you will have trouble getting everything just right. Because the macro programming is such an intricate part of making this remote work correctly, we thought the user manual would have extensive instructions. We were wrong, however. The user manual dedicates just one page and one example to macro setup. Quite disappointing.<br/> "]},"id":"53ebe77c-0989-4d3f-9de5-a76d59d21351","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7a7d7976-5f89-459a-9ab0-3a85df675164","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its dated design, difficult-to-use settings and lack of features, it is easy to see why the Universal Remote Control MASTERCONTROL RF20 slipped through our universal remote review ranks.
