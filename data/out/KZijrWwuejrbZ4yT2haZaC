After all, Sony is a leader in electronic innovation and the <strong>Sony Xplod CDX-GT540UI</strong> looked to be on the cutting edge.

If you use the &#34;USB 1-Wire for iPod&#34; connector (sold separately), you can control your iPod through the in-dash receiver. This connection will also charge your iPod and song information will show up on the display. The Quick-BrowZer feature lets you search your music library on your car audio head unit like you would on an iPod. And the Zappin feature scans through each song on your iPod in second-long increments until you find the one you&#39;re looking for.","While this in-dash receiver has impressive features when it comes to playing MP3s and CDs, it is not compatible with Bluetooth technology. This was surprising, considering most of the newer car stereos are at least Bluetooth ready. In addition to this, the front panel is not detachable. A detachable front plate is an excellent deterrent for would-be car audio thieves."]},"id":"783aade8-d953-4028-a641-891a0f13569b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"ddeee83b-fc2f-40ba-a018-00ef8fe4cae4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony Xplod CDX-GT540UI does have a built-in AM/FM tuner.
