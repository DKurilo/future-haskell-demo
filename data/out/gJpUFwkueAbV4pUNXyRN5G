But don’t let its simple aesthetic fool you – behind it lies a powerful arsenal of features, tools and controls. However, be aware that Audacity is geared more towards those who want to record simple vocal audio for things like podcasts and audio books over users who want a fuller studio experience where they can create multi-track beats with vocal audio paired with loops or MIDI instruments.
