It&#39;s late and dark and you can&#39;t find your charger. After your search ends, you begin to fumble to plug the adapter into your device. You put the cord in upside down, flip it over and try again. Wait a minute, you were right the first time after all and it wasn&#39;t upside down. It&#39;s an annoying process that we&#39;ve all been though.","Wireless chargers are an easy and affordable solution to this minor, but still incredibly frustrating, common experience. With a wireless charging pad, you can charge your smartphone conveniently. It is much easier to just plop your phone down on a wireless charger rather than fumbling with cords. Since charging pads are energy efficient, you can keep them plugged in and not have to worry about losing your cord. They come in all sorts of different colors, shapes and sizes allowing you to choose one that matches not only your phone but your personality as well.","Wireless chargers save you time and free up some space by eliminating &#34;rat&#39;s nests&#34; of cords on or around your desk. They are inconspicuous and powerful (pun unintended) devices. They will certainly make your life much easier if you chose to invest in one. We&#39;ve ranked the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1290-best-qi-wireless-chargers.html\">Nokia DT-900</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1290-best-qi-wireless-chargers.html\">Tylt Vu</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1290-best-qi-wireless-chargers.html\">Samsung EP-P100IJWUST2</a> as the best wireless chargers. For additional information, take a look at our <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">articles on wireless chargers</a>.","<strong>Wireless Chargers: What to Look For</strong>","Depending on what smartphone you own, a wireless charger may or may not work with your device  because it is up to device manufacturers to determine if their product lines are compatible wireless charging.","Most (but not all) wireless chargers use a charging standard called Qi. Although more than 55 smartphones embrace the Qi charging standard, there are still many popular cellphones that can&#39;t charge wirelessly without using a special case or receiver. This even includes the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphones. However, there is an array of battery doors, cases, skins and sleeves available to incorporate the technology into your phone if your device manufacturer opted not to.","After determining if your device is compatible with wireless charging, you&#39;ll want to look at specific models decide which wireless charger to purchase. We&#39;ve evaluated the top 10 models based on the following criteria.Â ","<strong>Specifications</strong><br/>Typically chargers have a low energy output around 5 volts,  but some are even more powerful, resulting in lower charge times. In addition to power output and charge times, we rated chargers based on what manufacturers include in the box. Most models include an AC adapter, while others don&#39;t. Though all the charging pads we reviewed include a USB cable. You&#39;ll also want to be aware of the light and sound indicators that let you know that your wireless charger is operating correctly.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>Since this charger will become part of your desk or decor of your home, you want it to look nice. Since the whole point of wireless chargers is to keep cords out of the way, so you really don&#39;t want the charging pad to be in your way either. Wireless chargers come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes, and some models come in an array of colors. Some are round, unobtrusive and take up very little tabletop space. Others are larger, which makes them better suited for tablets or to keep on a nightstand to charge your phone while you sleep. Some are manufactured to be incredibly thin, making them easy to transport. A few of the wireless chargers we reviewed can also double as stands, allowing you to operate your device while it is charging.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Wireless chargers are as easy to use as plugging them in and setting your phone on top of them, but if you need some extra help, a component breaks, or your charger begins to overheat, the manufacturer&#39;s support options will become an issue.  The best wireless charger companies offer multiple contact options and include limited warranties. Most manufacturers offer a standard one-year warranty, but the best warranties are closer to two years.","The best wireless charger to choose depends on a number of factors. Most importantly, you need to make sure your device is compatible with Qi wireless chargers. Wireless charging is still a relatively new field, but it has certainly grown over the years. Now, there are a variety of models to choose from that will allow you to clean cords off your countertop and keep your device powered."]},"id":"eee60fd7-a73c-407e-b245-aa33da6d5d41","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9c4a9d31-2a69-4180-9a07-abb6e2440f76","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A3NCBNI/?&tag=ttr_wireless_charger-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|738[art|NA[pid|60123[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Nokia Wireless Charging Plate</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DG8NVQI/?&tag=ttr_wireless_charger-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|738[art|NA[pid|60124[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tylt Vu</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F358AVI/?&tag=ttr_wireless_charger-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|738[art|NA[pid|60125[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Samsung Wireless Charging Pad</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0HFMIU/?&tag=ttr_wireless_charger-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|738[art|NA[pid|60127[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Adata Elite Wireless Charging Stand</a>","<a href=\"http://mugen.co/mugenizer-n11-portable-wireless-charger-power-bank-with-4800mah-battery.html\">Mugenizer</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C6VP03I/?&tag=ttr_wireless_charger-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|738[art|NA[pid|60132[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">LG Wireless Charging Pad</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C40OG22/?&tag=ttr_wireless_charger-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|738[art|NA[pid|60133[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Choe Wireless Charging Pad</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F6SQ1D6/?&tag=ttr_wireless_charger-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|738[art|NA[pid|60134[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">PowerBot Wireless Charger</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"00f64d9d-a59d-46ba-9eef-7f7d21f7a3f7","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_738","url":"/best-wireless-chargers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brandon-carte","url":"/author/brandon-carte","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Brandon Carte","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"Y2ioFDbnwaDrRNArHcGhXX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-12-14T21:28:35Z","datePublished":"2014-08-19T23:00:00Z","name":"Wireless Charger Review","synopsis":"Wireless chargers make keeping your device's batteries topped off a drop-and-go affair.
