You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kalorik WCL20629 is a compact, dual-zone wine cooler that offers an environmentally-friendly way to chill up to 18 bottles of wine to the ideal serving temperatures. The slim design lets you fit this cooler into a small space or countertop. The thermoelectric cooling system requires minimal energy and runs vibration-free. If you have a larger wine collection, consider the <a href=\"/edgestar-review\">EdgeStar CWF340DZ</a>.","This dual-zone <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">wine refrigerator</a> has a black interior and exterior, complemented by a matte silver door. The door is composed of double-paned, tempered see-though glass. This is one of the few that does not have tint or other technology to keep light away from your bottles. Its clear, see-through glass means it would be best to put this in a location that does not get a lot of sun. It includes an LED light to help you pick your desired wine choice in darkened areas. Unfortunately, the light switch is located inside the cooler, requiring you to open the door to turn it off and on. Keep in mind that every time you open the door the inside temperature changes affect your digital thermometer’s reading.","The temperature controls for each zone are located on the front for easy access. The top zone is optimal for white wines and has a temperature range of 44 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit. This section holds six standard-sized bottles. The lower zone holds 12 bottles of red wine and can maintain a temperature between 54 and 64 F. Since this is a thermoelectric-type wine cooler, it performs best in areas where the ambient temperature is not over 75-77 F. This unit is not designed for odd-sized bottles or sparkling wines.","This free-standing wine fridge is intended to fit easily onto a counter or table. Thermoelectric coolers need plenty of space around them to expel the warm air from inside the cooler, and the Kalorik coolers are no exception. If you notice your wine cooler isn’t cooling to the temperature you desire, make sure it has proper ventilation and that the fan screens are clean. This unit is not designed to be built into a confined space, and you cannot reverse the door. Keep those two details in mind as you plan the space you intend to put your new wine cooler."]},"id":"ee865cfe-56a8-485e-b190-35fdafe0e500","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f54f9a5f-ca9d-45c7-a654-c272e5de45fa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kalorik WCL20629 is a good starter cooler for those just dipping their toes into the wine fridge market.
