You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","It is unfortunate that CPI Security is only located in a few select states in the southeast, because it has some great features available with its <a href=\"/home/smart-home/best-wireless-home-surveillance-systems/\">wireless home surveillance systems</a>. CPI can alert you to threats such as intruders, fire and carbon monoxide – threats that are commonly monitored by wireless security systems. However, CPI also includes detections for flood and broken glass.","In addition to threats to your home, CPI can also monitor for medical emergencies. This means anyone in your family that has a serious medical condition, or senior citizens that have unique medical challenges, can live independently and know that if an emergency were to happen, help would be there quickly. In fact, regardless of the alert, CPI will dispatch help within seven seconds after your alarm sounds.","The door and window sensors that come with CPI&#39;s wireless home security systems can be used on interior doors and cabinets where dangerous chemicals and medications are stored. You will be alerted each time one of these doors opens, which can help you monitor young children&#39;s activity and ensure they are prevented from accidentally ingesting something dangerous.","Other equipment that is available as part of your wireless burglar alarm system includes panic buttons that you can use if you are at home and someone breaks in while the system is unarmed. With a quick press of the button, CPI will be notified that something is wrong and will send help immediately. CPI also has motion detectors, pet immune sensors and wireless surveillance cameras available.","CPI Security monitoring services will watch your home 24/7. If you choose to connect to your system with your cellphone or tablet, you can monitor your home, too. It&#39;s easy to watch live video feed or to receive alerts if your wireless home security system is triggered, or when your child gets home from school and disarms the system. You can also use your cellphone for many home automation tasks, such as locking your doors, turning up your thermostat or arming the alarm if you forgot to as you left in the morning.","While CPI has all these great devices and wireless burglar alarms available, it only provides a 90-day warranty on the equipment. The industry standard is two years, and some of the best wireless security systems include a lifetime guarantee. It is also difficult to relocate with your CPI system since its services are only available in certain states. This is important to note since CPI requires you to sign a five-year service agreement when you purchase one of its systems.","This company does have some good support options, including email and telephone. It includes a FAQs section on its website and will provide a history of when your alarm is triggered through your online account."]},"id":"c96a6e1f-5e7a-4626-9a45-385844a80adb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"996be022-90e8-4dd0-bb74-ada440eeb3d3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While it is disappointing that the warranty is so insignificant and its service area so restricted, CPI Security does have great options for wireless home security including one of the fastest response times among the systems we reviewed."]},"id":"e3d5fabe-9d81-4a14-b6fe-48b48b2b283b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58874","url":"/cpi-security-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-21T17:09:05Z","datePublished":"2014-02-21T17:09:05Z","name":"CPI Security","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"CPI Security will protect your home and send emergency crews quickly if a threat is ever detected.","pros":["The response time for CPI is approximately seven seconds."],"cons":["CPI only has a 90-day warranty on its security system."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-02-21T17:09:05Z","id":"MDXrMgmfdZDcMJFLmhjffC","meta":{"title":"Wireless Home Surveilance","description":"CPI Security wireless home surveillance systems have a response time of just seven seconds.
