You will find that the kit comes with 0.25mm, 0.35mm and 0.5mm nozzle replacements. Each replacement requires you use Slic3r code generator to configure the nozzle. Accurate configuration ensures that the nozzle cuts your model into the right horizontal layers. It also generates the right path the nozzle should take when creating a product and calculates the amount of material extruded.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/55726-lulzbot-ao-1013.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGmiL7QNxTaY2u4QojSEnC.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"cGmiL7QNxTaY2u4QojSEnC","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGmiL7QNxTaY2u4QojSEnC.jpg","alt":""},"id":"fbba4254-bd98-4625-b2e7-b5c5e8d12a2d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AO-101 also allows for multi-color printing.
