You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magic Chef MCSTCW21W2 <a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">compact washing machine</a> consumes around 330 kilowatts per year, resulting in around $36 in energy use, which is the highest of the portable washers we evaluated. Exact costs depend on your apartment or home&#39;s electricity hookups, but compared to similar portable washing machines, the Magic Chef uses more energy than other products in our line-up. Still, this is comparatively small if you consider what it costs to wash clothes at a commercial laundromat and since you are doing laundry at home, you avoid the aggravation of hauling clothing back and forth.","In terms of dimensions, the Magic Chef fits in with other small washing machines. It stands 37 inches high, 21.5 inches wide and 22.1 inches deep. Its stainless steel washtub is tough and uses a pulsating method to clean your clothes. At 79.3 pounds, this washing machine may not seem as portable as others. Thankfully, its cabinet handles and simple hookups make up for its weight. This washing machine can hold up to 2.1 cubic feet of laundry, which puts it among the most in our lineup.","The controls on this mini washing machine are easy to find and follow. The large power and pause button sits on the left of the control panel. With the large control buttons for temperature, program, function and water level, you can access the different settings for each feature.","With the six wash cycles available on the Magic Chef, you can select normal, jeans, cotton, quick, anti-wrinkle and air dry. This washer is among the fastest on the lineup. Its cycles can reach up to 800 rpm to wash and dry your clothes. This washing machine has most of the necessary functions to wash tough denim or soft wool, but it is missing a couple standard cycles. There isn&#39;t a designated delicate cycle, extra-rinse or soak-only function on this Magic Chef model.","Among the controls, you can find a time-remaining indicator and delay-start function. The time indicator displays the amount of time the washer needs to complete the cycle. This gives you an idea of how long you have to wait until your laundry is done. The delay-start feature allows you to load your laundry and set a designated time for the washer to start. This allows you to do laundry while you&#39;re away or set the washer to wait until you&#39;re home.","Once the washer completes a cycle, you hear a signal. This helps you avoid leaving wet clothes in the tub, causing mildew. The Magic Chef has all the essentials except fabric softener or bleach dispensers inside the tub. Instead, you have to use standard detergent with this washing machine.","One unique feature of the Magic Chef is the folding lid with a viewing window. If you place this compact washing machine in a tight space, the lid folds in half, making it easier to lift up and insert clothes. This is especially great if you keep the machine in a closet or tight space.","This washing machine is supported by excellent customer help. It is under parts and labor warranty for a full year, which is typical in the industry. If you happen to lose the product manual, you can find a downloadable PDF on Magic Chef&#39;s website. In addition, the website has a FAQs page, live chat service for speedy answers to questions, and support via email and telephone."]},"id":"9987df0b-035e-4938-8c0b-a7f36d3770bd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54863482-1440-4967-a231-c8fa9e52bd2b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magic Chef MCSTCW21W portable washer covers all its bases.
