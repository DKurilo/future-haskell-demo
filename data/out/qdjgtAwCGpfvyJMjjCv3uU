The square design with bright side lights is similar to the style used by moms and grandmothers for decades. The dual-sided mirror can be reversed for a normal or magnified reflection.","This mirror is designed to be placed on a vanity or in the bathroom where there is plenty of counter space. The mirror is large enough to give you a full-face view in both modes. You can use the regular view for normal makeup application and the five times magnified view for detailed tasks like tweezing eyebrows, trimming mustaches and putting in contacts. The magnified view could also help people who need corrective eyewear put on makeup without having to wear glasses.","The mirror comes equipped with two custom 13-watt bulbs. This custom lighting should help reduce heat output as well as energy usage. The manufacturer has also engineered its lighting to recreate the color spectrum of daylight. The mirror weighs just over 5 pounds, so it&#39;s easy enough to move around to different parts of the house. If you want a truly portable lighted mirror that is easy to pack for vacations, you may want something like the <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">Tweezermate</a>, which is battery powered and doesn&#39;t weigh as much.","The angle of the OttLite mirror can be adjusted vertically, and the stand offers full 360-degree adjustments. It&#39;s powered by a regular electrical cord and doesn&#39;t need batteries. Replacement 13-watt bulbs can be purchased directly from the manufacturer. While two bulbs are provided, replacement bulbs are not included with the initial order.","The base is 11 inches wide, and the mirror stands 13 inches tall. Unlike other countertop vanity mirrors of this variety, this model does not have side mirrors to give you a three-way view. This is a bit of a shortcoming for a mirror that takes up this amount of counter space.","The OttLite Natural Makeup Mirror lighted vanity mirror should do an adequate job of helping you put on makeup accurately. The five times magnified mirror can help those who have eyesight problems and can provide accurate detail for delicate tasks like tweezing eyebrows and putting in contacts. The manufacturer does not provide any warranty coverage for this mirror, which may be a disadvantage."]},"id":"82919dc1-ef0f-48b2-9734-70d8c0adbfc0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66162","url":"/ottlite-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-10T21:46:37Z","datePublished":"2015-07-10T21:46:37Z","name":"OttLite Natural Daylight","synopsis":"Fans of 1970s and 1980s-style lighted vanity mirrors may like the style of OttLite's Natural Makeup Mirror.
