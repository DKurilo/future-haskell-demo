This propane-fueled grill features a Sure-Lite electronic ignition system. This feature makes starting the grill easy. It also includes a 10,000 BTU side burner. This level of power is not quite up to par with some of the top-level gas grills available, but it should still meet the needs of most grillers. Unfortunately, propane fuel is the only option for this gas grill, as it does not offer a natural gas hookup.","There are 400 square inches of primary cooking space on the Broil King Crown gas grill or 100 square inches per burner. While this is a decent amount of space, it’s on the low end when compared to other gas grills on the market. It could be limiting if you plan to host a large event and need to cook several items simultaneously. Contrastingly, this gas BBQ grill offers more than enough warming space with 235 square inches, which is on the high end when compared with other grills. The Broil King also has side shelf space, which is ideal for keeping accessories at the ready.","The Broil King Crown is a standard size gas grill. It weighs 124 pounds and stands 50 inches tall. This grill has stainless steel cabinet doors and a stainless steel control panel. Stainless steel prevents rust and wear and is ideal for housing material in gas grills. The cooking grates and warming rack are made from porcelain-coated cast iron, which allows for those coveted sear marks and prevents residue from building on the grating. The construction of Broil King grills is impressive and built to last.","Broil King offers a lifetime warranty on the cast aluminum components, a five-year warranty on the burner and a two-year warranty on the parts and paint. The burner and parts warranties are disappointing when compared to the longer warranties offered by other manufacturers, but if you have any problems with your Crown gas grill, you can contact Broil King customer support by phone or by email. We contacted them by phone and found their support team to be very friendly and helpful."]},"id":"44e0e0f8-0ed6-44a9-9c63-5f4c3904dc9b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3ee7710b-1ab1-43fd-bef4-ce399528cfb7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Broil King Crown gas grill is a great addition to any backyard or patio.
