The HP Pavilion MS225 is a decent all-in-one PC that can handle your day-to-day tasks well. It has an 18.5-inch widescreen with a 1366 x768 display resolution. The monitor houses all of the computer&#39;s components and looks a bit bulky when compared to other models. However, the overall design is still much cleaner than a traditional PC.","One unfortunate sacrifice that this all-in-one desktop PC makes is that it doesn&#39;t include touchscreen capabilities, so you can&#39;t interact on the monitor with gestures. You&#39;ll have to use the wired keyboard and mouse that come standard, which adds to the clutter on your desk.","Perhaps in an effort to keep cost down, HP has designed this home PC with a slower processor at 1.6 GHz. This means you won&#39;t be able to load browsers, images and movies as fast.","In terms of external device support, HP falls short again. This PC only has six USB 2.0 ports. It lacks any USB 3.0 and HDMI ports, so you won&#39;t be able to connect high end external devices, game console, monitor or a Blu-ray drive, which limits your use of the PC dramatically. It does, however, have a DVD drive allowing you to watch movies and listen to your CDs.","On a positive note, this all-in-one desktop weighs in at about 14 pounds, so it&#39;s easy to move from room to room within your household. This is a big bonus if you live in a confined space.","You can reach HP&#39;s help and technical support by phone or email. If you have a pressing issue and need immediate assistance there is also a live chat option you can utilize that&#39;s found directly on the website. For added assurance, this home PC comes with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"5a3f6ad6-1b31-4fed-a9ad-dcd62235d30d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e7aa69b1-1e18-45eb-b4be-6f6c8ac3310d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Pavilion MS225 is a decent all-in-one PC that can handle day-to-day tasks easily.
