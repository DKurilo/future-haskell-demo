We regularly examine the category, looking for new and important brands, models and characteristics in the realm of steam mops. We acquire the most important mops on the market and test them. After our testing, we narrow the field by scoring them using a proprietary system that helps determine which products to include in our comparison. Along the way we talk to experts and research online to better understand what goes into making a good steam mop. The answer can be a complicated one. The usefulness of these mops is sometimes debated. You need temperatures over 200 degrees Fahrenheit to kill bacteria, and many of these mops do not even get close to that range. Some would argue that trying to sterilize floors is a losing battle anyway. Even if you do manage to sanitize them, that lasts a very short time, unless you plan to never set foot on your flooring again.","&#34;Disinfection should be called &#39;temporary disinfection&#39; because germs start to grow on disinfected and sanitized surfaces as soon as you touch them again,&#34; according to the EPA&#39;s electronic pamphlet <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/ece_curriculumfinal.pdf\">Green Cleaning, Sanitizing and Disinfecting: A curriculum for Early Care and Education</a>.","The level of cleaning also varies a lot, depending on the mop and the way you use it. The concept of a chemical-free clean is very appealing nonetheless, especially since so many cleaning chemicals are used incorrectly, making them ineffective or even dangerous. And that same pamphlet recommends steam cleaners for sanitizing.","&#34;They can be used on many surfaces, including bathroom fixtures, floors and countertops, carpeting and upholstery.&#34;","Caitlin Wagner, Product Manager for upright vacuums at Shark, works to develop vacuum cleaners all day long, but she swears by her steam mop when it is time to clean her kitchen. Filling it up with just water, not chemicals, is something she values. ","&#34;I don&#39;t know how I lived without my steam mop before,&#34; Wagner said.","<strong>How We Tested  </strong>","After conducting initial research to find models we wanted to try, we spent more than 30 hours testing steam mops so we could prepare and rank a list of the best products on the market. To conduct our tests, we poured individual patches of soda, orange juice, spaghetti sauce and mustard in different spots on the tile floor of our lab’s kitchen, and let the messes dry overnight. The next day, we noted how quickly each steam mop heated up, what the average temperature of each cleaning pad was, and then started cleaning. We noted how many passes each mop needed to clean the floor.","We also observed whether you could adjust the amount of steam emitted from each machine, and checked to see whether each model left a reasonable amount of moisture on the floor.","In addition, we used a somewhat subjective approach to calculate the maneuverability of each steam mop by operating it and determining how the machine felt and moved as we used it to clean. We also noted how easily each one moved into tight corners or other hard-to-reach spots to get the room&#39;s entire floor clean."]},"id":"b8278a79-2853-4c23-9128-b877d9741e3e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/F2EukyG3DPwW7qA6aLpPkY.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"<strong>How Much is a Steam Mop? </strong>","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/home-steam-mops/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8zLzUvODE5MTg1L29yaWdpbmFsL1N0ZWFtLU1vcHMtTGlnaHQtTi1FYXN5LVRlc3RpbmctMDAzLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F2EukyG3DPwW7qA6aLpPkY.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"F2EukyG3DPwW7qA6aLpPkY","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F2EukyG3DPwW7qA6aLpPkY.jpg","alt":""},"id":"48b9fd5b-21bd-48d2-980f-a5d0a07aea99","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We recommend a steam mop in the $70 to $90 range for the best combination of performance and versatility.

The last thing you want to do is ruin your gorgeous investment, and you’ll need to keep it clean if you want to protect it. So the big question is, can you use a steam mop on a wooden floor? The quick answer is no.","Exposure to heated water will cause wood cupping and long-term damage to your wood flooring. The steam may also remove any polish or finish you&#39;ve applied to your floors, making them look uneven and dull. And be careful what you use to clean the floors; vinegar will eat away at your finish, and soap will leave streaks.","The best way to clean your hardwood floors is by using plain, room-temperature water on a rag or mop. Just make sure the cleaning instrument isn&#39;t sopping wet, as too much water can damage the floor. Get rid of any standing water as soon as you can, and further protect your floors by placing mats in entryways and rugs in high-traffic areas."]},"id":"0af98618-5316-4855-a3e2-b3891b0e7222","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ZvzznENkwmuwkKiAWLgV2d.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"<strong>Things to Look for in a Steam Mop  </strong>","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/home-steam-mops/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8zLzYvODE5MTg2L29yaWdpbmFsL1N0ZWFtLU1vcHMtSDIwLVg1LVRlc3RpbmctMDAyLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvzznENkwmuwkKiAWLgV2d.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ZvzznENkwmuwkKiAWLgV2d","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvzznENkwmuwkKiAWLgV2d.jpg","alt":""},"id":"420825c8-7d0a-4646-9956-92ec36c0d848","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Performance<br/>The best mops make cleaning as easy as possible by offering hot, potent steam power with the ability to get around obstacles, under furniture and into corners. Top-quality steam mops are powerful enough to clear away stuck-on liquids and household debris with very few passes, rather than a lot of scrubbing.","You should find a mop that heats the water to a very hot temperature. In fact, the hotter the water, the better, because you want to kill as much bacteria as possible.","It&#39;s great to have a long electrical cord, especially if you clean large rooms, because you don&#39;t have to keep pausing to change outlets, or use an extension cord, which can be unsafe. Finally, a large water reservoir makes cleaning for long periods of time possible.","<br/> ","Design<br/>All of the steam mops on the market have the same basic design, but we like the ones with features that make cleaning quick and easy – but also thorough. Some units have conveniences like adjustable steam levels for cleaning especially tough messes, and for getting the right amount of steam for specific surfaces. It&#39;s good to look for a steam mop with a removable tank since that is the simplest way to fill the reservoir. Otherwise, you&#39;ll need to hold the entire device over a sink to fill the reservoir or pour water into it using a pitcher. Steam mops that stand on their own are quite convenient when you need to step away from your cleaning project temporarily, and they give you more options for storage.","Accessories<br/>We focused heavily on each steam mop’s ability to clean floors, but we also considered the extra tools and accessories that came with each model. These helpful extras can assist you with other household chores, making housework easier. Steam mops with accessories such as brushes, squeegees and carpet glides for freshening carpets let you use your appliance in many places in your house.
