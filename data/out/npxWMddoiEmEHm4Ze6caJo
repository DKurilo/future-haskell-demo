While it does a fine job cleaning, it was more difficult to handle than half of the units we tested. It has good accessories, though its warranty is shorter than we&#39;d like. While writing this article, the AR Blue Clean cost around $116, which is close to the $120 average for the electric pressure washers we reviewed.","The AR Blue Clean AR383’s water pressure is good – at 1,900 PSI, it’s the second highest in our comparison. This meant it did well removing dirt and oil in our cleaning tests, though it didn&#39;t match the two top-performing models we reviewed from <a href=\"/ryobi-review\">RYOBI</a> and <a href=\"/craftsman-review\">Craftsman</a>. We found the pressure gun easy to handle, especially the way it connects to the pressure hose with a quick release.","At 28 pounds, this machine is relatively lightweight, but we found its wheels don&#39;t work nearly as well as those on the heavier RYOBI, Craftsman and <a href=\"/sun-joe-review\">Sun Joe</a> models we tested. This means you might have trouble moving it around your project site, though it&#39;s still one of the more portable units we reviewed.","Putting this machine together is straightforward since most of the parts snap together. However, you need a screwdriver to attach the tool caddy to the back of the machine. The assembly process is more involved than those of most other pressure washers we tested but not by much.","The AR Blue Clean AR383 is one of two pressure washers we tested with a built-in hose reel – the other being the Craftsman CM1800. While this is a useful way to store your pressure hose, it was hard to use because the hose didn&#39;t coil smoothly as we reeled it in.","Its pressure hose connects to the back of the unit in a spot that&#39;s close to the tool caddy, so close that it can be difficult to join the two. To complicate things further, this hose connector is inaccessible while storing the power cord on the unit. We found it easier to hook up our garden hose to the front of the machine.","The AR383 comes with two wands and a detergent tank. However, adjusting the stream while you use the machine can be unsafe. We preferred the simpler approach most machines take, giving you distinct nozzles you can swap out. There&#39;s also a soap nozzle with an integrated detergent tank, which can be unwieldy to carry while cleaning your car. Our testers also found that the soap nozzle itself didn&#39;t work very well.","The AR Blue Clean AR383 is the third-quietest pressure washer we reviewed. It only produced 82 dB of noise, which is much lower than our test group’s 87.4 dB average. This unit comes with a one-year warranty, which is shorter than the 1.7-year average for the products we reviewed."]},"id":"bbce2a4e-1f22-4488-8a83-315373f45dfd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69874","url":"/ar-blue-clean-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-04-19T15:16:03Z","datePublished":"2018-04-19T15:16:03Z","name":"AR Blue Clean AR383","synopsis":"The AR Blue Clean is a clear example of what you get when you buy a good, albeit average, pressure washer.
