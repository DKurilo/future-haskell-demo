You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Finding the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">LED light bulb</a> that shines as bright as an incandescent bulb can be a challenge. Fortunately, the EcoSmart GP19 is among the brightest LED lights that produces a true 60-watt brightness. This LED light does an excellent job, filling your room with bright mid-range white light while using much less power than a traditional incandescent light bulb.","One of the best features of the EcoSmart GP19 LED light bulb is that it only uses 10 watts of power to give you the light you need. If you use this LED bulb an average of three hours a day, it will only cost you an average of $1.20 per year to run it. LED light bulbs can save you money on your power bill and help you be environmentally friendly.","While the best LED light bulbs last up to 22.8 years with recommended usage, the EcoSmart GP19 only lasts up to 18 years. This may seem like a disadvantage, but in reality, you are purchasing a light bulb that you won&#39;t have to replace for 18 years. If the EcoSmart GP19 ever fails within the five-year warranty, EcoSmart will replace the bulb.","The light produced by the EcoSmart GP19 radiates omnidirectional, or in other words, it can fill the room with light, rather than shining in a particular direction. This makes the LED light perfect for floor lamps and ceiling light fixtures in large rooms that need plenty of light. Unfortunately, the GP19 is not designed to be used in outdoor light fixtures or with dimmer switches.","This LED light turns on instantly though, giving you light right when you need it. It also produces much less heat than incandescent light bulbs, making it a good choice for use in sconce lights in a hallway or bathroom where the heat could affect the paint on the wall it is fixed to."]},"id":"7f29bd4f-f266-4689-808f-ad003dc7db6c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0219d53b-e268-43ea-964c-96ff494b3dd8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The EcoSmart GP19 LED light bulb produces more than enough brightness to be truly comparable to the output of a 60-watt incandescent light bulb.
