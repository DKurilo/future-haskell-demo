This product is extremely lightweight, can travel up to 15 miles on a single battery charge and easily folds, making transportation simple. Additionally, this product provides many basic features, such as a seat belt and wheel locks, as well as a few extra features, including a storage tray by the footrests.","The highlight of this product is its lightweight design. This electric wheelchair only weighs 50 pounds, which is significantly lighter than many similar products on our lineup. It is designed to carry a rider weighing up to 265 pounds, which is a lower weight limit than the average of about 300 pounds. This model can fold down to a compact size so it can easily be stored in your home or transported in the back of a vehicle.","This wheelchair reaches speeds up to 5 mph; however, the weight of the rider can affect the overall speed of the product. It has the capabilities to easily maneuver indoors and outdoors and can even climb hills at a 12-degree angle, one of the steepest angles we saw on this type of product. However, its turning radius is approximately 31.5 inches, which is a much wider radius that many wheelchairs on our lineup.","The battery life on this product is similar to what you will find on many motorized wheel chairs â€“ it travels up to 15 miles on a single charge. While this is average in the industry, the best wheelchairs last approximately 19 to 20 miles on a single battery charge.","Many basic design features, including a seat belt and wheel locks, are included. There is sufficient padding on the seat to make it comfortable to sit in for extended periods of time. However, there is no headrest, which may be an important design feature for some.","The manufacturer&#39;s warranty on this product is adequate. The frame on the KD Smart Chair is warrantied for five years. For comparison, the best warranties for the frame on electric wheelchairs is 10 years or more. KD covers all electronic components for one year. One other assurance we were pleased to see is that this wheelchair comes with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. If you are not pleased, you receive your money back within 60 days, a guarantee not available on many motorized wheelchairs."]},"id":"6bad5330-eb42-4794-9f30-1950e6f9aec3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"acb24b8e-2e1a-485f-8263-7a3e1ae3a566","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KD Smart Chair is the best option for a compact wheelchair.
