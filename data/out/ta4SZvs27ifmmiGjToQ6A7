This freedom allows you to buy a prepaid phone and use it as long as you need to without paying any extra fees. Liberty Wireless offers no-contract phones and nationwide coverage, but available plans and phones are limited.","The best prepaid phones we reviewed have one main advantage over the major wireless providers: variety. Unfortunately, Liberty Wireless only sells one phone and three plans. For $20, you can buy 500 anytime minutes. Once you buy one of the prepaid phone plans, you can purchase more minutes at different prices. Liberty also offers two unlimited plans â€“ 14 days for $35 and 28 days for $50. These two plans offer unlimited voice, text and web.","Liberty Wireless uses the Nationwide Sprint Network, so you&#39;ll get full coverage. However, this does not mean that you are a Sprint customer. Liberty is still responsible for its customers, and if you have any issues or questions, Sprint will not help you. Also, you must be within the Liberty Wireless service range to use your phone.","Liberty&#39;s phone selection and features are lacking. While basic features such as long distance and caller ID are available, the no-contract phones have basic web and multimedia capabilities. You won&#39;t have to pay an activation fee to start using your phone, and if all you need is a phone to make calls or send text messages, Liberty can cover your needs. Fortunately, Liberty&#39;s phone is free for new customers. Hopefully Liberty will start to offer greater variety and better options.","If you need help with your service, you can start by browsing the short FAQs section on the company&#39;s website. The answers range from pricing information to service limitations. If you have further questions, customer support agents are available by telephone and an email contact form. The support offerings on Liberty&#39;s website are far too basic, and you are more likely to get better and more detailed answers from an authorized dealer than directly from a Liberty support representative."]},"id":"9032f2ba-8e54-4db6-924c-77d785c8f8fd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4d36b24c-84b5-458c-ae8f-bf15a07bd764","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Liberty Wireless sells basic prepaid phones, but its offerings are too limited to compare to other services.
