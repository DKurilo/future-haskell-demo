In its natural state, it is a bulky sports car. When you hit the central button on the remote, it transforms and raises its hood while it sits on the two back tires. At full height, this car stands and shoots missiles. Street Troopers even drives around on its rear wheels. Everything sounds amazing so far. If only it were as much fun as it sounds.","This multi-purpose toy is meant for kids ages 5 and up. This RC car would be great if two children had them to have battles and races through the kitchen. There are three frequencies on which you can run the signal, which is a great option because most <a href=\"/best-remote-control-cars\">RC cars</a> for children only run on one frequency. It requires 6 AA batteries for the vehicle alone and an additional 9-volt battery for the remote. The lack of a battery charger or wall adapter is damaging when a toy with so much playback burns through so many batteries every 10 minutes.","This two-wheel-drive vehicle runs great on slick floors and pavement. It is quite heavy at 5 pounds and looks like it can take a beating. But with so many moving parts, you hardly dare crash it into a curb or take it off jumps. Because of its heft, it is also a slower radio controlled vehicle, but if you&#39;re buying this type of transforming car, it&#39;s probably not to race.","When the car transforms into its upright position, the Gatling gun shoots one spring-loaded suction dart. The distance each dart travels is pretty weak, at 6 to 12 inches at best, but it never fails to get a good laugh. The two buttons on the top right and left of the remote spin the chamber, but two buttons are redundant because both spin the chamber counterclockwise.","The remote is very easy to use. The left and right joysticks respectively control each wheel with skid steering. The center button transforms the car instantly and allows you to stop mid-transformation and still drive the remote control car. The car has a good range that maxes out at 30 feet, but because it&#39;s meant for indoor use, running out of range won&#39;t be a problem.","The manufacturer, Maisto, offers a 30-day warranty. FAQs and email support can be found on Maisto&#39;s website. An instruction manual and extra missiles come with the vehicle."]},"id":"d0f4cf0e-a5e0-45f0-8ec5-7b91963f2c10","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ecf43bb3-774f-4071-838b-332d1cb39837","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Maisto&#39;s Street Troopers is certainly an exciting idea that looks like a lot of fun, although in practice it doesn&#39;t quite deliver.

This vehicle focused on its transformation and fun factor, which rate highly, whereas the car&#39;s performance and speed seem to be an afterthought."]},"id":"fff12730-f6e4-478b-b398-720bbf642a16","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55435","url":"/street-troopers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-15T22:13:35Z","datePublished":"2012-11-15T22:13:35Z","name":"Street Troopers PT-808","synopsis":"The Street Troopers radio controlled vehicle is the car we all wanted when we were young.
