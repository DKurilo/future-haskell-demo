The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-dvd-authoring-software\"><em>DVD Authoring Software here</em></a><em>.</em>","DVD-Lab is advanced DVD authoring software that was not designed with beginners in mind. Although we found the software to be quite versatile, its overall ease of use, inconsistent DVD copies, price and incompatibility with Vista kept DVD-Lab out of one of the top spots on our lineup.","DVD-Lab comes with an advanced DVD authoring program called DVD-Lab Studio. DVD-Lab Studio includes even more features, such as the ability to add a subtitle stream and &#34;play all&#34; support.","With DVD-Lab, you can create slideshows, menu-based movies and single-chapter movies with no menus. You can also include your slideshows as chapters in your movies.","Building a main menu with this DVD menu maker software is interesting and different. Instead of the software automatically including all links in predesigned templates, you can create your own linking structure on the Connections screen. This feature gives you a considerable amount of control, but at the same time, it increases the chances of authoring a DVD with an erroneous menu structure.","Although we found that DVD-Lab&#39;s menu creator options are strong, the software doesn&#39;t offer many additional features. However, it is one of the few DVD authoring software programs we reviewed that includes true drag-and-drop functionality. Just about everything can be dragged from one section of the application to another.","In order for your DVD video to come out as recorded, you must first go through the demuxing process. This feature separates the imported video and audio streams for better syncing in the finished copy. It is highly recommended that you perform this operation before you make a DVD. Unfortunately, however, demuxing is very slow. It took more than a half hour for us to demux a ten-minute video clip.","DVD-Lab does not include any direct import features. All videos on your camcorder need to be loaded onto your hard drive before you can import them into DVD-Lab. Some people might see this as an irritating extra step, but the manufacturer sees the exclusion of a direct-import feature as a plus."]},"id":"dec79e5a-cca4-49e5-8bf0-14e00ccfd7b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cefa1236-3780-45a8-bc39-4530ccd9db31","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, DVD-Lab is sophisticated DVD creation software that gives you an immense amount of design control.
