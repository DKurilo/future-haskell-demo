These career paths involve completing an associate&#39;s degree and sometimes certification.","Many education programs for vocational careers qualify you more quickly for an entry-level job than a four-year degree. Advancement opportunities are often available once you gain work experience. You may also consider continuing your education and certifications while you work, which will provide you additional advancement opportunities.","The cost of education is more affordable in vocational careers that involve an associate&#39;s degree, not only because you have a regular paycheck coming in, but because many hiring businesses and institutions provide at least partial reimbursement (usually around one-third) for education expenses. Others may cover their employees&#39; costs for recertification related to the work they perform.","Individuals may begin a coursework towards vocational careers as early as high school. Some high schools provide the training within school curriculum, or students can enroll in college-level courses for part of the school day. Students who are put on this track may not be expected to pursue a four-year degree, or family circumstances require them to work as soon as they turn 18. Other students may have been home-schooled throughout their elementary and secondary education at an accelerated pace, leaving them enough time to pursue vocational coursework before they graduate. The certification they receive then can be a means to provide employment later on when they pursue a four-year degree.","Because of the economic recession, a growing number of individuals who pursue a vocational career path are those who seek to change careers. These individuals may have experienced lay-offs, and as they re-enter the job market, they find that they are no longer qualified to get a job that will pay them the salary they need. This happens for a number of reasons. Getting a job has become more competitive in many industries where companies are downsizing the number of jobs they have for a particular field. As a result, only the most qualified are getting the jobs. Advances in technology are another reason why workers need to update their skill sets.","<strong>Vocational Careers: What to Look For</strong>","In our vocational careers review, we include some of the highest paying jobs you can get with an associate&#39;s degree, such as <a href=\"/best-vocational-careers\">computer programmers</a>, <a href=\"/licensed-practical-nurses-review\">licensed practical nurses</a> and <a href=\"/respiratory-therapists-review\">respiratory therapists</a>. And although salary was included in our review criteria, we also considered other factors in our rating process. The following is a description of each of our review criteria.","<strong>Salary</strong><br/>Although we often choose a job based on a number of factors, such as an aptitude for working with numbers, a natural attention to detail or an interest in serving people, salary is a major factor in selecting any career path.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"5c922898-d086-4b89-8c25-f087fa6a459c","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Job Availability</strong><br/>Certain industries anticipate growth over the next five, 10 or 20 years, while others may decline. Job availability is influenced by a number of factors, such as advancements in technology which may automate tasks that presently need to be completed by a human being. For example, some entry-level jobs in computer programming are getting outsourced to countries such as India or China. On the other hand, other jobs are increasing in demand. This is true of any job in the medical field which will be meeting the needs of the aging baby boomers over the next few decades.","<strong>Advancement Potential</strong><br/>Certain industries have more opportunities for advancement than others with just an associate&#39;s degree. Job qualifications that have additional levels of certification or opportunities to specialize within a particular niche provide a better initial investment because of the ability you will have to build upon your initial education. Some job classifications, such as a computer programmer, require a bachelor&#39;s degree for advancement, often in addition to work experience. However, we considered the ability to build upon your existing skills as a factor in this criterium.","<strong>Informational Criteria</strong><br/>We provided other information about jobs in the side-by-side comparison on this page. This information, including schedules available, interaction with others, physical requirements and basic office skills required, was not included in the ranking process, since factors such as being on your feet most of the time or sitting at a desk all day could be viewed as either positive or negative according to your preference.","<strong>Schedules Available</strong><br/>Certain professions provide varied work shifts which offer a flexible schedule. For example, having the option to work part-time or on a swing shift some of the time frees up your schedule to pursue additional education or to meet the needs of your family. Jobs that cater to the needs of others around the clock such as medical assistants or vocational nurses often require entry-level employees to work weekends and holidays. More experienced staffers often work days or have the option to work another time slot.","<strong>Interaction with Others</strong><br/>In some jobs you will work in teams, and in others you will work solo. Others will provide a mix of the two. In some jobs you will have interaction with clients, patients or customers, where in others you will only interact with fellow staff.","<strong>Physical Requirements</strong><br/>Certain jobs are more physical than others. For example, vocational nurses and pharmacy technicians are on their feet most of the time, where computer programmers and paralegals must focus their eyes on computer screens all day. Some jobs require the frequent use of protective gear such as latex gloves or face masks because of contact with biohazards. Uniforms are required for some jobs and not others, although certain dress codes may still apply. For example, paralegals who work at law firms often must wear formal business attire such as a dress shirt and tie each day.","<strong>Basic Office Skills Required</strong><br/>Although not necessarily something you learn in your vocational training, certain basic office skills are needed in certain jobs you pursue. Some of those skills include spelling, grammar and punctuation skills; basic math skills, typing, data entry and 10-key skills; proficiency in the MS Office Suite, verbal communication and phone skills, English speaking proficiency; and the ability to manage multiple tasks, plan ahead and meet deadlines.","Within this website, we included a review of each job we evaluated. Each job review provides a description of the type of tasks involved, resources regarding the type of initial degree and/or certification, as well as additional education and certification available for advancement within the profession. We will include information about how technology affects this job, such as certain kinds of equipment you will use.","In addition to the reviews, this site includes a sample job description for each career. It also includes what we call a typical work day for each career, which features a fictional person employed in one type of job you may pursue within each field.
