The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use. Top Ten Reviews does not endorse piracy or any other illegal activity.</em>","At ninth place on our review of the best <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software\">Blu-ray copy software</a>, Nero Burning ROM 2016 makes physical copies of certain movies, including non-commercial Blu-ray discs. However, this Blu-ray copy application lacks nearly every feature and tool we look for in this type of software.","During our evaluation we found Nero Burning ROM to be the most straightforward program to make Blu-ray copies with. However, the program has no way to bypass the copy protections found on almost all commercial Blu-ray movies. So, even though you can start copying in as little as a single click, you can only copy home movies or unprotected discs. This severely restricts the usefulness of the program. If you need a program that can break copy protections, consider our top pick: <a href=\"/blue-cloner-review\">Blue-Cloner</a>.","This program also lacks the ability to save a Blu-ray&#39;s disc image onto your computer. A disc image (or ISO file) is the blueprint for a disc. This is the file Nero is scanning and burning when it copies your Blu-ray movies. If it had the ability to save this file to your hard drive, you could use it as a digital backup, watch it in your media player as if it were a physical disc, or even burn new copies if you lost the original. Of the 10 applications in our lineup, Nero Burning ROM is the only Blu-ray copier that doesn&#39;t come with this ability.","Even though it cannot extract a disc&#39;s ISO file, if you already have a Blu-ray disc image on your computer, you can use Nero Burning ROM to burn it onto a new disc. In our timing tests, it took this program 42 minutes to burn a disc image onto a blank Blu-ray, which is about average among the products on our lineup.","Despite what it lacks, this program produces good results. When our video experts examined a freshly copied Blu-ray movie, they could not detect any flaws in the picture, audio or other aspects of the new disc. It was totally indistinguishable from the source disc."]},"id":"87ec424c-7aed-421c-9f3e-fb97bb73cbf9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c55b680d-bf35-40ab-85de-3a56647b3192","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you buy Nero Burning ROM 2016, you should do so for all its non-Blu-ray copying abilities.
