The Xtender Power Assist acts as a secondary mode of propulsion beyond your arms and will give the added power needed to keep moving. For active users not wanting to restrict themselves to an electric wheelchair that can’t be moved manually, this device proves to be an invaluable aid.","The wheelchair attachment effectively allows you to turn a manual wheelchair into a power chair to reduce overall fatigue while in use. The powered wheelchair assists by adding small amounts of power, which is extremely helpful when you start to get fatigued on difficult terrain or on a longer journey. In addition, when traveling up inclines the motor prevents rollbacks.","Wheelchair users still push the wheels on their chair just like a regular manual wheelchair, but the power assistance motor gives added propulsion to the chair with each push. It creates the subtle effect of making each push more efficient and moves your chair further with less effort. The Power Assist may not be a fully automatic wheelchair, but it creates a form of powered assistance for enhancing your mobility and independence.","If you own a manual wheelchair and you’re comfortable with its feel, then the Quickie Xtender Power Assist is an incredible asset. It doesn’t remove all of the work out of propelling your own wheelchair, but it does help in extending the range of travel while requiring less effort on your part. The Power Assist is an ideal hybrid device, propelling you subtly but allowing you to build arm strength. This is one of the best wheelchair assistance devices on the market."]},"id":"da4bd911-47d7-4466-8e83-e1bdbe9856e7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58039","url":"/quickie-xtender-power-assist-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T15:25:50Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T15:25:50Z","name":"Quickie Xtender Power Assist","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
