It received high marks on independent tests for detection, protecting against over 98 percent of known malware threats. It also extends its protection to mobile devices if you find you need virus protection for your iPad or iPhone. Unlike other programs in our review of the best Mac antivirus software, Dr. Web includes this option at no additional cost.","This is one of the programs that protect against ransomware. However, malware protection is basically its only function. It doesn&#39;t come with a rescue CD to restore your computer in the event of an attack. It doesn&#39;t scan USB drives or other removable drives for threats either. Dr. Web for Mac does scan incoming email to ensure no threats are attached to the messages, though.","This antivirus for Mac includes a gamer mode that detects when you are watching a movie or playing a game online. It suspends some functions to allow you to use your computer resources for your activities rather than for virus scanning. This is an important feature, since running the program tends to slow down your computer by 1,387 seconds, based on independent evaluations AV-Test conducted during the summer of 2016. This is the most loss of performance you&#39;ll see with any program in our review.","Dr. Web provides 24/7 telephone tech support. While it doesn&#39;t have live chat support, its website has an impressive knowledgebase that includes FAQs, user forums, video presentations and important articles on the types of threats your Mac computer may be vulnerable to. You can access more articles and update information within the antivirus program itself, so you don&#39;t need to log on to the website to search for this information."]},"id":"fd925000-efbb-43dd-ab71-5bff12db9233","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"834b94e0-1800-42b4-9f70-919b22ae23d8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Dr. Web offers great virus protection for Mac devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
