You can download recipes directly from websites into this <a href=\"/best-cookbook-and-recipe-software\">cookbook software</a>, and it even lets you download entire cookbooks. Just like <a href=\"/living-cookbook-review\">Living Cookbook 2015,</a> it comes with 1,000 preloaded recipes. ","TheRecipeManager lists recipes in alphabetical order instead of grouping them by meal category. This makes it easy to scroll through your collection to get ideas when you just cannot figure out what to make for dinner. You can also search for recipes by name and mark your favorites so they are easy to find later.","Another benefit is that it&#39;s easy to scale recipes using this software. You can select the number of servings you need to make from the dropdown menu, and TheRecipeManager automatically updates the ingredient list for the new serving size.","This cookbook software comes with a menu planner, which allows you to create meal plans by simply dragging and dropping. Once you choose a recipe for a specific day, it shows up in the calendar. If you want to move the dish to a different day, you can drag it from its original position on the calendar to the new date. It doesn&#39;t give you verbal cooking instructions though, which can be cumbercome if you&#39;re covered in flour or some other messy ingredient and need to know what to do next. If this is a component you&#39;re looking for in recipe software, we suggest you check out <a href=\"/mastercook-review\">MasterCook 15</a>.","Every recipe you download can include images. It&#39;s always helpful to see what the finished product will look like before you try to cook something new, and the images may also give you serving ideas to enhance the dish’s presentation. The images display in the recipe viewer so you can get a good idea of what you are cooking – you can click on them to make them larger, or, if you prefer, you can browse recipes by images only.","One of the program’s biggest drawbacks is that once you find your favorite recipes, you can only share them with friends who have TheRecipeManager software, which is quite limiting compared to the best recipe programs. Given most modern computer capabilities, you could take a screenshot and share it that way. "]},"id":"4a6715aa-a561-4e7f-bdc2-4d750b6c2791","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"add7c501-83e0-43ce-ace3-787594c6d7fd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TheRecipeManager includes over 1,000 recipes to get your digital database started.
