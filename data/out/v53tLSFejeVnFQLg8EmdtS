But whether you thrive on Thanksgiving-size dishes or a simple grilled cheese sandwich, if you cook often, you&#39;ll need a cooktop with a steady heat range and a firm foundation. With rock solid cast iron grates and a tough stainless steel surface, the Whirlpool Gold 36-inch (GLS3665RS) is a formidable gas cooktop that will work well with the rest of your kitchen. Each of the five burners delivers at least 9,000 BTUs of power, with three power burners producing 12,000 to 15,000 BTUs for fast boiling and searing. The continuous grates help you make a smooth transition between simmering and flaming burners without spilling your heavy pots onto the surface. The recessed grates fit your countertops to blend with the rest of your kitchen. The low grates make it easier and to move heavy pots on and off the cooktop."]},"id":"e196b68a-db0d-4b19-814e-5d8302b1e954","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/KMRL4EsHzebZSUxjyBghQU.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Even the most experienced cook knows that boil overs and messes should be expected. If a spill extinguishes the gas cooktop’s flame, the auto re-ignition brings it back to life. Plus, the deep stainless steel well contains water and food spills for easy cleaning. The sealed burners prevent food and water in the well from reaching the burner box and damaging the cooktop. You can remove the solid, weighted knobs for easy cleaning, and their wide motion range gives you high, low and any temperature in between.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57775-whirlpool-gold-36-inch1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMRL4EsHzebZSUxjyBghQU.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"KMRL4EsHzebZSUxjyBghQU","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMRL4EsHzebZSUxjyBghQU.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e3023537-b406-40ea-a630-074822acb41b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Most gas cooktops require professional installation, and though that&#39;s the recommended and safest option, you can install the Whirlpool Gold yourself.
