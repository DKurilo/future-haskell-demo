As one of the most economical running headlights on the market, it delivers reliable performance for daily runs and other activities, but this particular model doesn&#39;t offer a lot of extra features.","The bright white light has a dimmer, so you can adjust it to suit your specific needs. There is a red light option as well for when you need to stop and read a map, star chart or guidebook. The beam spreads forward up to 30 meters when in spot-beam mode and up to 20 meters when in wide-beam mode, ensuring that the area immediately in front of you is visible so you can avoid potholes, branches and other potential hazards. A strobe light option makes you visible to oncoming traffic. The single-button control on the Northbound Train LED Headlamp is easy to operate once you get the hang of it, but it could take a few tries to master using it at first.","One major benefit of this running headlamp is its exceptional battery life. When used on the highest power, the light can run for up to 43 hours, and when dimmed, you can get up to 150 hours of battery life. The Northbound Train LED Headlamp uses three AAA batteries, which are easy to find when you need to replace them, but they aren&#39;t rechargeable, so you need to keep extra batteries on hand. This particular running head torch has a water resistance rating of IPX-4, which means it can withstand splashes and raindrops but can&#39;t be submerged.","The elastic strap on this running headlight stretches without pinching, and it is durable enough that it won&#39;t snap under pressure. The strap easily adjusts to make the fit even better. The size range is such that you can use this headlamp on a child or stretch it to use on a helmeted adult, and once you have it on, this unit stays put on your head. The entire headlamp weighs just 3.2 ounces and the light doesn&#39;t bounce, even while you&#39;re moving.","The long battery life of the Northbound Train LED Headlamp is its defining feature, so this model is great for runners who embark on extended trips. However, the light on this running headlamp isn&#39;t as powerful as others."]},"id":"b04f5c84-c9cd-4596-9e82-6c41cab9e237","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62535","url":"/northbound-train-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:42:21Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:42:21Z","name":"Northbound Train LED","synopsis":"The Northbound Train LED Headlamp is a comfortable and reliable running headlight that combines a long-lasting battery and durable construction.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Northbound Train LED Headlamp is a comfortable and reliable running headlight that combines a long-lasting battery and durable construction.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-03T20:42:21Z","id":"R2vGD7DsUsmKkUNBxyN5oe","meta":{"title":"Northbound Train LED Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Northbound Train LED Headlamp delivers reliable illumination and extra-long battery life in a convenient lightweight running headlight.
