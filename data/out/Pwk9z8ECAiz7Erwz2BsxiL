You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE AED08LV has competitive energy efficiency numbers that make it one of the <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">best window AC units</a> on the market. It has all of the important certifications, including the Energy Star label, and all of the numbers to back them up, starting with the highest energy efficiency ratio in our lineup: 12.2. That will translate into savings on your power bill.","This window AC unit uses up to 8,200 British thermal units (Btu) – the amount of energy needed to heat or cool a pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. The Btu use defines the amount of space a window air conditioning unit can handle comfortably. This GE unit&#39;s 8,200 Btu can cool a room of approximately 250 square feet.","The airflow number also is quite high with this unit. It can move 230 cubic feet per minute. That is the second highest in our comparison, only the <a href=\"/lg-lw8015er-review\">LG LW8015ER</a> does better with 250 CFM. Getting the air moving quickly can make a dramatic difference in how cool a room feels.","The GE AED08LV also is great at reducing humidity, which can make a dramatic and speedy difference in how a room feels. It removes 1.9 pints per hour, which is the second most of all of the units in our comparison. There is not a specific dehumidify operating mode, so you cannot dry the air without also cooling it.","This unit is missing a sleep mode, which would save energy overnight by gradually increasing temperatures. There is a generic energy saving mode, though, and there is a timer so you could set the unit to turn itself off at some point during the night while temperatures naturally drop outside.","The warranty coverage is one year on everything, which is normal but not great. The GE site is a little less helpful than others we looked at, but if you have questions about the warranty or the product itself you can reach customer service representatives by email, telephone or live chat."]},"id":"abcd67e8-13ee-48fb-8fc7-3170ed2db384","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3c13dc9b-9cee-40fa-9f7f-369593cb1ba5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This window air conditioner is missing a few operating modes, but it is competitive in the most important ways.
