This is the only <a href=\"/best-baby-sound-machines\">baby sound machine</a> we tested that has a rechargeable battery. It charges with a normal micro-USB cable included in the retail packaging. It’s also the only sound machine we tested with Bluetooth connectivity. It only has three sound profiles, but you can find white noise or nature profiles on your smart phone and play them through the speaker with a Bluetooth connection.","The SoundBub fits in the palm of your hand and is made of chew-safe materials. There are three cuddly animal designs to choose from: Bella the Bunny, Ollie the Owl and Benji the Bear. All the styles have a soft, padded fabric cover on the front panel and a soft rubber clip to attach it to a stroller, crib or car seat. To turn the speaker on, simply press the belly button on the front panel. Each time you press it, the sound profile changes until it turns off after the last setting.","The white noise and nature profiles didn’t do a great job of masking external noise in our tests, but they sound natural. The <a href=\"/munchkin-review\">Munchkin</a> sound machine has the best sound profiles we tested in terms of noise masking and sound quality. We didn’t notice any startling noises and the SoundBub’s speaker didn’t make any unusual pops or clicks like some of the baby sound machines we tested. There are a plethora of white noise and fan sounds online that you can wirelessly transmit to the speaker to mask noise. The SoundBub has 30, 60 and 90-minute timer settings and a continuous play mode. We played a sound profile for more than five hours on a single charge.","WavHello has a mobile app called Voiceshare that allows you to record voice messages and lullabies to play through the Bluetooth connection. You can also use it to record yourself reading a bedtime story and share it with a babysitter if you are travelling away from home so your infant hears the soothing sound of your voice.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The SoundBub is by far the most portable and durable baby sound machine we tested. The included white noise and nature profiles aren’t the best, but the Bluetooth connectivity and Voiceshare app give you infinite possibilities for soothing your baby to sleep with calming sounds."]},"id":"e0af208c-554f-4148-b023-0f82bd7bb5aa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70223","url":"/wavhello-soundbub-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-11T12:06:07Z","datePublished":"2018-09-11T12:06:07Z","name":"WavHello SoundBub","synopsis":"The WavHello SoundBub has some unique features that make it a useful addition to your diaper bag.
