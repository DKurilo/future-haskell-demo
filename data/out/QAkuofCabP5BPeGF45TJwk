Unfortunately, those size constraints carry over to the drivers and reduce overall performance.

Even so, just about all speakers in this range require the addition of a subwoofer to reproduce the lowest bass tones. The Aperion Intimus 4T produces the narrowest range of frequencies of any speaker on this review site.","As we’ve discussed in other reviews on this site, the range of human hearing is typically 20Hz to 20kHz. The frequency range of the Aperions is 55Hz to 20kHz. That isn’t bad but doesn’t compare well with other speakers in our review. On the bass end, reaching down to only 55Hz drops off the entire lowest octave on a piano keyboard. Admittedly, there isn’t a lot going on down there most of the time anyway, but we prefer having the option. At minimum we like to be able to produce the low E of a bass guitar or upright bass, but that, too, is left off with a 55Hz cut-off. Pairing these speakers is a must if deep bass is expected.","On the treble end, 20kHz does cover the entire sonic range. It omits, however, the ultrasonic overtones that, though not actually heard, can be perceived. These overtones add to the spatial, airy quality of music. Losing them is difficult to define but can reduce the musical emotion in some music."]},"id":"e74b1158-0d96-4828-aedb-cec2cdc9de36","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Peformance"},"id":"ee1a31e7-c907-4847-bc1c-71393161c111","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The sensitivity rating of speakers tells how quiet they are when not being driven and also how much sound they produce with a given amount of input. Sensitivity is typically measured by playing a test tone, usually of 1kHz frequency, with 1W of input. The 1W input figure is often quoted as 2.83V but they represent the same input power. A microphone is placed 1 meter in front of the speaker and the sound pressure level is measured in decibels, or dB. The Aperion 4T floor standing speaker registers 86dB which makes them a pretty average speaker overall but the least efficient speaker in our survey.","In its most important sense, lower sensitivity means that an amplifier or receiver has to work harder to produce the same level of output as a more efficient speaker. One could say that the problem would be solved by simply turning up the volume but that ignores the nature of audio components, which perform much better when not being pushed too hard. Turning up the volume may well solve the sound level issue but it tends to notably degrade the quality of the sound as the amp is cranked up.","Recommended amplifier power is 25W to 150W. The Aperions are one of three speakers in our review that have 6 ohms nominal impedance. While most amplifiers will drive 6 ohms without problems, it’s more important to make sure that your amp can handle it than with the more common 8 ohm speakers."]},"id":"4d52b05e-ab78-45b2-afa6-4e56b1fb603d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Speaker Design"},"id":"f2395c89-48bf-403b-9307-f2d9760c2518","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Aperion 4T floor standing speaker includes two 4-inch woven fiberglass composite woofers.
