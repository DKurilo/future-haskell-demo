Its compact size and durable construction make it a terrific option for flying indoors and outdoors. The four small rotors make maneuvering this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">RC helicopter</a> simple and open all kinds of options for tricks and acrobatics. Because it is missing some of the balancing features that other similar helicopters offer, it is slightly more difficult to fly, though it has many more options for maneuvering. It is also missing some of the other products&#39; advanced features, such as a camera and ultrasound sensors.","The AeroSky RC Quadcopter is built for innovative flying. Rather than being limited to traditional flight patterns, this radio-controlled helicopter opens up all kinds of flying options. From figure eights to barrel rolls and single-point hovering, you&#39;ll love this RC helicopter&#39;s capabilities.","There are four rotors on this remote control helicopter. There is no gyro stabilizer, however, and the helicopter is a little more difficult to fly than some similar models. But this RC helicopter isn&#39;t built for basic flying, and the challenge of learning to fly it in circles and loops adds an element of fun to operating this mini RC helicopter.","The AeroSky RC helicopter is slightly more difficult to fly than many similar models, but its construction is solid and it can take a crash and live to fly another day. It&#39;s inevitable that you&#39;ll crash your helicopter into the ground, a wall, a tree or fence at some point. This is why solid construction is so important.","The remote control helicopter&#39;s engine is completely covered by a hard plastic polymer. While the plastic is not overly thick, it&#39;s not overly heavy either, and its lightweight construction lends added speed to this remote control helicopter.","After you charge the remote control helicopter for about 30 minutes, you&#39;ll have a full battery, which gives you about five to ten minutes of flight time. This is standard for similar units, and the copter&#39;s 3.7-volt lithium polymer battery is the standard for other units as well.","The remote control may take some time to get used to, but even children can master the controls. The challenge of learning to fly without crashing is part of the appeal of purchasing an RC helicopter."]},"id":"10bf0d70-c405-45f5-aa15-0108cebe8a47","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"05c1fd5a-9df0-4251-ac73-2dce8d3c685c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AeroSky RC Quadcopter is a compact RC helicopter.
