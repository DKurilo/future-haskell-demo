Like all walk-in tubs, this Universal Tubs model is ADA-compliant, so it makes your safety the priority. The <a href=\"/best-walk-in-tubs\">walk-in bathtub</a> includes features such as a grab bar and textured floors to ensure your safe entry and exit. This isn&#39;t exactly a safe step tub, because the step is higher than those of traditional walk-in tubs at 15 inches, but you can smoothly transition from standing to sitting and then simply swing your feet over the lip of the tub.","Universal Tubs&#39; basic version of this model is a soaker that&#39;s 60 x 30 inches, so you can fit this specialized bathtub in your regular tub&#39;s place. It stands about 42.5 inches high, which means you can get a deep soak. The gelcoat finish on the tub shell makes it durable, and it comes with an attractive chrome-finished faucet. You also get a handheld shower so you can rinse off before or after your bath.","You have your choice of the type of tub you want with this model. If you&#39;re concerned about the cost of a safe step tub, you can choose the basic soaking model, which is the least expensive. To make your bathing experience more comfortable and soothing, you have the option of turning this handicap bathtub into more of a spa at home. You can choose a whirlpool system, which gives you 12 adjustable water jets, or an aerotherapy system that comes with 26 air injectors. The dual-massage option gives you both. Aromatherapy and chromotherapy add-ons are also available, so you can add calming fragrances or changing colors of light to your water.","The controls on this tub are pneumatic buttons, making it easy to press each one, and they&#39;re easy to reach on one side of the bathtub. If you are interested in a more affordable soaker tub with basic features and functionality, the <a href=\"/kohler-review\">Kohler Elevance Rising Wall</a> is a good choice.","The swinging door seal is backed by a lifetime warranty, so any leak you spot can be taken care of by the manufacturer. The tub shell is protected by a 10-year warranty, and all other parts have a one-year warranty. Labor is only covered by a 90-day warranty, but Universal Tubs offers an extended warranty on parts and labor for an added cost."]},"id":"1682967c-54c3-40dc-ba7d-919dcb52a4ef","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60616","url":"/universal-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
