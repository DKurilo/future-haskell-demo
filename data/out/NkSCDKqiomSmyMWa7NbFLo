Nonetheless, they make a number of pretty impressive devices that will deliver well for many consumers. The BIC America DV62si is a competent two-way <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1274-best-bookshelf-speakers.html\">bookshelf speaker</a> that can be used in a stereo music system but is likely more at home as part of a home theater setup.","The BIC America DV62si bookshelf speakers boast some pretty impressive specifications. With sensitivity of 90dB, they’re competitive with all but the best bookshelf speaker we reviewed. Their dynamic frequency range is even more noteworthy. With bass response that goes clear down to a deep 43Hz, they have one of the best frequency response range of any of the bookshelf loudspeakers we’ve found.","The treble response of the BIC America DV62si bookshelf speakers is nearly as remarkable peaking out at 21kHz. Exceeding the normal highest frequencies that humans can hear, 20kHz, they can produce some of the ultrasonic overtones that we can discern. The super-high tones add to the spectral qualities of music that we experience that are more than just a sum of their parts.","With all that said, it would be easy to conclude that these are pretty extraordinary bookshelf speakers. Good though they are, we find them hard to get excited about. The bass notes are all there but they leave a rather thin feel. Likewise, the mid-range and high-frequency information is presented but rather mechanically and in a way that doesn’t produce much emotional response.","The manufacturer recommends minimum input power of 10W and maximum input of 175W. That’s a good spread that is likely to meet most people’s needs. The bookshelf speakers are magnetically shielded to prevent video interference. That isn’t an issue for home theaters with flat-screen TVs but could be if you’re setup includes a CRT television or monitor. Speaker inputs are of the five-way variety for convenience and ensuring a good cable connection whether using single or dual banana plugs, pin or spade connectors or even bare wire. The posts are gold plated to prevent corrosion.","Bass and mid-range frequencies are produced by a single 6 1/2-inch driver whose cone is made of a rather rigid poly/graphite material that responds rather cleanly across the board. There’s also a 3/4-inch soft dome tweeter for high-frequency reproduction. The crossover is set at a rather high 3,500Hz, the highest of any of the bookshelf speakers we’ve evaluated.","BIC America offers a seven-year parts and labor guarantee, one of the longest of any bookshelf speakers we’ve found. That seems to say a lot for their confidence in the product. Otherwise, customer support is pretty lackluster. They can be contacted by email or toll-free telephone but the usual online manuals and FAQs are absent."]},"id":"733558d7-c3f5-4b58-a83a-44147e43b54d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a79fa6ac-529a-46a2-a3f6-67fc0aeb0b08","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BIC America DV62si are very good bookshelf speakers for enjoying music or as part of a home theater system.
