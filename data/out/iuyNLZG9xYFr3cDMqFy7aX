You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Genie ChainLift 800 is a reliable, affordable garage opener that shares many of the features found in the best <a href=\"/best-garage-door-openers\">garage door openers</a> but lacks the extras, such as a keyless entry pad, included with the premium models. Security extras, such as having the ability to disable the remote if it gets lost, are also lacking.","With the 1/2-horsepower motor, this opener can lift a standard metal or wood sectional door that weighs up to 350 pounds. This is slightly more than the average 1/2-horsepower garage door opener. Most are capable of lifting up to 300 pounds. If you have a door that is heavier than 350 pounds, then you need a 3/4-horsepower garage door opener - which is available in our top pick, <a href=\"/chamberlain-premium-whisper-drive-review\">Chamberlain Premium Whisper Drive</a>. The ChainLift 800 uses a dual-pinion gear chain that is durable and long lasting. While chain-driven garage openers are fairly quiet, they tend to be noisier than most belt-drive openers.","The Genie ChainLift 800 comes with two 3-button remote controls, which is perfect for dual-car homes or as a backup remote in case you lose one. The control panel allows you to turn on the lights and lock the door from use. Instead of an oversized door button, the control panel has three slim buttons. Not having an oversized button for the door may prove troublesome if you have your hands full of kids or groceries, but it is not too much of an inconvenience if you have your hands free.","This garage opener includes the standard safety features all the best garage door openers have. Two laser beam sensors are placed at the base of the garage door, stopping the door from moving if anything or anyone crosses it. The opener also has a sensor that stops and lifts the door if it comes into contact with anything while it closes. It is a great relief knowing you don’t have to worry about the safety of a child or a pet that might cross its path at the wrong time.","This opener comes with a 10-year motor warranty and a one-year warranty on all other parts, including the chain and railing. If you need to contact Genie for any reason, you can get in contact with support staff by email and telephone. A downloadable manual can also be found on the product webpage."]},"id":"c1ce2fae-eb9e-48ae-8d7d-c561a243a58e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7e0ec4b9-4abb-46a9-a96e-7c999b985063","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are in the market for a standard, chain-driven garage door opener, then the Genie ChainLift 800 is worth considering.

But it lacks a keyless entry pad and security extras. However, with its powerful 1/2-horsepower motor, bright lights, two remote controls and generous motor warranty, the ChainLift 800 is a good option if you need a no-frills, affordable garage opener."]},"id":"fa528103-910a-49f2-a9d8-aaeb9c7652e6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60104","url":"/genie-chainlift-800-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-31T18:54:06Z","datePublished":"2014-07-31T18:54:06Z","name":"Genie ChainLift 800","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":74,"verdict":"The Genie ChainLift 800 is a solid garage door opener that is strong enough to lift a standard sectional door, but it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of extras.","pros":["This garage opener is compatible with HomeLink and Car2U home automation systems."],"cons":["A keyless entry pad is not included."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-07-31T18:54:06Z","id":"iuyNLZG9xYFr3cDMqFy7aX","meta":{"title":"Genie ChainLift 800 Garage Opener Review - Pros and Cons","description":"The Genie ChainLift 800 is a solid garage door opener that is strong enough to lift a standard sectional door, but it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of extras."},"products":[{"slug":"genie-chainlift-800","url":"/product/genie-chainlift-800","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","name":"Genie ChainLift 800","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","id":"rWqw6b8zMg27ZfjYk6S92f","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HQ2F2mQAjByriZnpb9b6KB.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","mimeType":"","name":"60076-genie-chainlift-800-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/60076-genie-chainlift-800-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","id":"HQ2F2mQAjByriZnpb9b6KB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HQ2F2mQAjByriZnpb9b6KB.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Genie ChainLift 800 Garage Opener Review - Pros and Cons","description":"The Genie ChainLift 800 is a solid garage door opener that is strong enough to lift a standard sectional door, but it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of extras."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HQ2F2mQAjByriZnpb9b6KB.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","mimeType":"","name":"60076-genie-chainlift-800-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/60076-genie-chainlift-800-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","id":"HQ2F2mQAjByriZnpb9b6KB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HQ2F2mQAjByriZnpb9b6KB.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Genie ChainLift 800 Garage Opener Review - Pros and Cons","description":"The Genie ChainLift 800 is a solid garage door opener that is strong enough to lift a standard sectional door, but it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of extras."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/genie-chainlift-800-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"patio-and-driveway","url":"/home-and-garden/patio-and-driveway","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","name":"Patio & Driveway","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:00Z","id":"gjj9LfCzhFK29WJH6eTnEk","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
