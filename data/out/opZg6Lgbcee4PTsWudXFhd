If one person alerts authorities, the offending person faces serious legal consequences. Ripping and redistributing copyrighted works can result in multiple charges for each distribution incident."]},"id":"c90c5b16-c448-4fa3-b747-d4d2074d28b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>When Is DVD Ripping Legal?</strong><br/>When a person creates his or her own DVDs that are not copies of copyrighted work, ripping is completely legal.
