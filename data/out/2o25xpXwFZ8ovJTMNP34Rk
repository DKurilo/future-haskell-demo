You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Door to Door has been providing portable moving and storage containers since the beginning of the industry. The pioneering company has grown based on its reputation for service and dependability. The company operates in 70 locations nationwide. The <a href=\"/best-moving-containers\">moving containers</a> fit approximately one to one and a half rooms, so you order based on the number of rooms you are moving, and you pay only for what you use. You have a week on each end to load/unload your containers. Loading is easier at ground level; there are no ramps to go up and down.","Getting started with Door to Door is easy. You can get a quote online or through a call. The company’s sales and customer service are available seven days a week. It also allows you to create an account online so you can view your account and pay your bill. If you need containers in a hurry, you can have your services expedited to ensure your containers arrive in 48 hours.","Each pod holds about one to one and a half rooms. They measure 5 feet x 8 feet x 7 feet and accommodate 40 to 50 medium boxes. Packing your containers by room is a good way to keep track of your items.  This is especially important if you plan to store them, but there is a possibility that you may need to retrieve some things while in storage. Having your rooms organized into separate boxes can make things easier, and it is also helpful when unpacking.","Door to Door makes containers with construction grade plywood so they breathe to prevent mold, and Door to Door provides a heavy-duty weatherproof cover for further protection. In cross-country moves, your container is transported by tractor-trailer so it is not subjected to the weather.","Door to Door can store your container in its storage facilities if your new location is not ready right away. It is convenient to store a container; you do not have to unload your items and then load back up when you are ready to go to your final destination. This is one of the greatest benefits of container moving. You hold the keys to your containers, so you can rest easing knowing that only you have access to your possessions. The storage facilities are monitored 24/7.","Door to Door is a solid company that has been helping people move for 18 years. The one-room containers are scalable; order extra containers and only pay for the ones you use. The containers help you organize your belongings by room, and that makes unpacking and retrieval more manageable. For a professional, client-focused moving company, Door to Door is simple and affordable option."]},"id":"db54b1cb-1b2d-4dbd-9e55-4226a8270f52","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66112","url":"/door-to-door-storage-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-09T15:00:36Z","datePublished":"2015-07-09T15:00:36Z","name":"Door To Door Storage","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-09T15:00:36Z","id":"2o25xpXwFZ8ovJTMNP34Rk","meta":{"title":"Door To Door Storage Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Door to Door has grown into a national company based on its service and reputation in the moving and storage industry since 1996.
