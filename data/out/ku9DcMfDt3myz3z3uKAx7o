While the objects it makes don&#39;t have the highest print quality, it is great for simple projects and learning how to 3D print. Filament is very inexpensive, and this small, lightweight printer is easy to transport. Printrbot makes this printer in many different configurations. We tested the assembled Printrbot Simple, but a DIY 3D printer version and a heated bed version are also available from the manufacturer.","With a maximum build size of 6 x 6 x 6 inches, the Printrbot Simple is on the small side of affordable 3D printers. While the build size only lends itself to small printed items, you can always print larger models in two separate prints then combine them with glue. The print layer height of 0.05 millimeters is right on par with both budget and more expensive 3D printers.","It isn’t necessary to auto level the Printrbot Simple, but calibrations are key to making sure your items have the best print quality. Manual calibrations are made on a trial and error basis, as this 3D printer has limited controls in the software. Wooden wrenches are provided to help you adjust the Z-height; we found this method to be less convenient that complete auto calibration but still fairly simple.","The models we made with the Printrbot Simple were not end-user quality and instead closer to draft quality. It is perfect for testing out prototypes or printing simple models but not for precise parts or complicated designs.","This cheap 3D printer is made of metal and steel and is much sturdier than many plastic chassis printers. Very little shaking and quaking occurred during out testing. At 16 pounds, this was one of the easiest printers to move around in our test lab. However, it has some design missteps that make it slightly difficult to use. The printer doesn’t have an on-off switch (plugged in is on, unplugged is off), and the bed is easy to scratch if the print head is too low. You need to use tape or purchase an upgraded bed, as the installed one might have wear and tear after many uses.","The Printrbot Simple is compatible with PLA but not ABS, unless you upgrade to the version with the printed heat bed. Filament cartridges are available from the manufacturer in 15 colors for an extremely reasonable price. The printer also supports universal cartridges, so you can purchase filament from any of your favorite retailers. Your purchase includes 250 grams of filament to get you started right away, but it is much less than the 580 grams included with most other 3D printers.","It’s recommended that you use open source software with the Printrbot Simple, and we found that it works better with Cura than Repetier Host, but almost any open source software will do. Tethered printing via the included USB cable is very easy but not entirely convenient if you want to use your computer during a five-hour-long print. If you want to print with your computer unplugged, you can save 3D files to the provided microSD card and plug it straight into the printer. You still need to start the print via your computer, but once the print starts, you&#39;re good to unplug.","This affordable Printrbot 3D printer comes with a two-month warranty. While it’s fairly common for budget 3D printers to have short warranties than premium models, two months is much shorter than many of the other budget models we reviewed. A user forum, email support and tutorials are all available on the company’s website, making the Printrbot Simple very easy to use for any skill level."]},"id":"5982fac4-1046-4ad3-9310-34f4496c6b6d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"27cf1309-ae82-4647-b488-d600d3acff62","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This inexpensive 3D printer excels in its simplicity but lacks some finesse.
