Priced at $39.99 (MSRP), it’s one of the more affordable products we tested, and it has more features and accessories than some of the pricier brushes in our review. With two facial cleansing brush heads, a body brush and a pumice stone, the Essential Skin Solutions brush provides full-body skin care that is gentle enough for sensitive skin. It’s also waterproof for use in the shower.","It is very similar in design to the <a href=\"/etereauty-review\">Etereauty 5 in 1 Beauty Care Massager</a>, our choice for best value, but the Essential Skin Solutions device got higher marks for user experience in our testing. The only model that scored higher was the <a href=\"/clarisonic-review\">Clarisonic Mia 2</a>, but at $169, it was also the most expensive brush we reviewed.","Upon trying the Essential Skin Solutions system, the first response of one of our testers was, “Oooh! I like it! This one feels like a really good skin care tool, and it has a really good grip.”<br/>The Essential Skin Solutions System is a rotating facial cleansing brush. Our testers described its motion as “driving itself around your face” and said it felt comfortable. However, the way it propels itself prevents you from being able to pause during use or slow down and focus on a specific area of your face. Also, the rotation of the brush heads sprays water if the attachments get too wet, and you’ll want to avoid getting your hair tangled as the brush spins. Our testers with longer hair avoided this problem by pulling back their hair before using the brush.","Its housing has an ergonomic design and a rubberized, nonslip handhold that can be washed under running water. The facial brushes and body brush are designed to cleanse and exfoliate your face, arms, chest, back and legs. The pumice stone helps smooth rough spots and callouses on your heels and feet. Just soak your feet first in warm water to soften the skin, and then apply the stone.","Designed for all skin types, this product has a soft-bristled brush for sensitive skin and a firmer brush for deep cleansing and microdermabrasion. For best results, Essential Skin Solutions recommends replacing the brush heads every two to three months. Replacements are available for between $9 and $12 apiece.","While using a gentle cleanser with this device is just fine, thick scrubs or lotions are not recommended, especially formulas containing exfoliating particles such as nut shells and crystals that could be harsh on your skin. The manufacturer also advises trying the system for less than a minute the first time to see how your skin reacts. While our testers experienced no problems or irritation with this device, it may take a few weeks for your skin to adjust to using a new skin care product.","This device has only one speed/intensity setting. By contrast, the <a href=\"/foreo-luna-review\">Foreo Luna Mini 2</a> has eight. Also, while we prefer rechargeable batteries like the Foreo’s and the Clarisonic Mia 2’s, the Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Brushing System is powered by two AA batteries instead. These are included with your purchase. Though there’s no storage or carrying case, the packaging box can be reused for storage if needed, but it’s not as durable or secure as a case would be.","The Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Brushing System has a one-year manufacturer’s warranty and comes with a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee. Customer service is available by phone, email and Facebook messenger."]},"id":"d9e27a27-1a3c-4762-8710-94ea30fd7849","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65093","url":"/essential-skin-solutions-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","datePublished":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","name":"Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin","synopsis":"The Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Brushing System earns a repeat ranking as our best pick in facial cleansing brushes because of its impressive performance, versatility and value.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"The Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Brushing System is a repeat choice for our best pick.
