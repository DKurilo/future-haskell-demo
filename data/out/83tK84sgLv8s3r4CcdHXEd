You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kamp Kitchen TF2005101-KK outdoor propane unit is on the basic end of <a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\">turkey fryers</a>. It will definitely get the job done, but it lacks a handful of features the best turkey cookers include – especially safety features.","The burner on the unit heats at a rate of 38,000 Btu (British thermal units). This is less power than some turkey fryers put out, but it should still cook your dinner quickly. You can fry up to a 20-pound turkey in the 30-quart pot, which is very large.","This outdoor turkey fryer is missing a few of the most important safety features. For instance, it doesn’t have an auto shut-off feature, which is really disappointing, and you don’t get a vented lid or a cooking basket with this pot. It does have a poultry stand, though, which helps keep the turkey in place while it&#39;s cooking.","It also has a lifter, which is convenient as well as safe. The lifter works with the poultry stand to help you lower the turkey into the pot and remove it safely after cooking. The unit also comes with a stand that elevates the burner up off the ground.","This propane turkey fryer also lacks a bit on the convenience side of things. For instance, it doesn&#39;t have a drain valve. A drain valve, which is usually located toward the bottom of the pot, helps to safely and easily drain the used oil after your done frying the turkey.","You do get a thermostat with this unit, though, which is helpful. You can use the thermostat to determine the temperature of the oil and the internal temperature of the turkey. It&#39;s important to ensure the turkey reaches a safe temperature before you take it out of the fryer.","This Kamp Kitchen propane turkey fryer, which is sold by Lowe’s, is backed by a one-year warranty. That is standard coverage for this type of unit. The manufacturer doesn’t offer the user manual or instructional videos online on how to fry a turkey, which is unfortunate, but you can get help and support for the unit by phone and email."]},"id":"1e5d78e0-e034-403f-9ad5-8fc67c7d1cfb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ffeb9923-c019-42e6-9c28-d653a272065e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kamp Kitchen TF2005101-KK is a basic turkey fryer.
