To start, we researched numerous trash compactor models made by well-known manufacturers, examining the features that contribute to the machines’ power, performance, safety and convenience. Also, even with something as seemingly utilitarian as a trash compactor, we evaluated aesthetics.","During this process, we read manufacturer websites and user manuals, checked online reviews, and perhaps most important of all, interviewed experts who work with and repair these machines daily. After that, we determined which factors are most important and logged our research into a weighted chart. Then, we used a proprietary ranking system to help us decide which trash compactors we should highlight.","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","We spent more than 45 hours researching and evaluating trash compactors. Among other things, we looked each model’s interior size, compression ratio, price and warranty. We gathered information from manufacturer websites, looked closely at consumer reviews, checked user manuals and read the warranties. In addition, we watched demo videos of how different trash compactors work.","We also considered how easy each trash compactor is to use. For example, many have convenient features such as foot-operated controls that allow you to open the compactor when you’re holding trash. Some models also have bins that open to the side, which makes taking trash out much easier and can prevent back strain. In addition, models with removable drawers let you fully clean inside the machine.","<strong>Expert Advice</strong>","Trash compaction is good for the environment and your household, according to Melinda Aguilar, a sales representative with Renwes Appliances, who was interviewed by Amy Preiser for a “House Beautiful” article. When asked what she’d say to a skeptic about trash compactors, Aguilar said, “I’d say that all the negative things you think of are taken care of – they’re not smelly, noisy, bulky. They’re convenient. You take out the trash less, you contribute less to the landfill. But this is the coolest thing: If every single household in the U.S. had a trash compactor, our landfills could be reduced by 80 percent.”","However, things can go wrong with trash compactors that might require a service call from a repair person. John Ritchie, the technician manager at Cody’s Appliance Repair in Eagle, Idaho, has worked on trash compactors and has seen some glitches. He has found that people sometimes overfill a compactor and then neglect to make sure the drawer is properly back in position before starting it, which causes the machine to jam or lock itself down. “There is room for user error,” Ritchie said.","<strong>What to Look for in a Trash Compactor </strong>","Type<br/>Before looking at any trash compactors, measure the area you plan to store yours. Most models are of the under-counter variety, although there are freestanding compactors. You can also buy a portable trash compactor you can wheel to messes in your yard, vehicle, garage or elsewhere, then return to the place you typically keep it.","Performance<br/>One important consideration is the compaction ratio. A ratio of 4-to-1 means the machine can crush the average volume of four bags into the size of one. That means more trash taking up less space. However, it also means the bags are heavier, so you need to consider what you can lift.","Features<br/>Many good-quality models have a toe bar – a switch on the bottom that opens the compactor when you push it with your foot. When you&#39;re holding trash to toss, this small feature can make a big difference. It&#39;s also great to get a trash compactor that includes an air freshener system or charcoal filter to cut down on odors.","<strong>How Much Does a Trash Compactor Cost?</strong>","The Trash Compactors we researched cost an average of $891, so buying one of is no small decision. More expensive models generally crush more trash. Owning one does greatly reduce the number of trips you take to the curbside dump, so despite costing a lot they’re very convenient.","<strong>How Do You Clean a Trash Compactor?</strong>","Cleaning your trash compactor is a good way to keep it odor free. And cleaning it isn’t difficult – just make sure you unplug it before you begin.","First, remove the trash bag and the drawer from the cabinet. Using a vacuum, suck up any loose crumbs or debris in the trash collector. You can then use a mild cleaner and warm water to wipe down the inside, outside and the drawer. You don’t need to use harsh chemicals. An antibacterial soap or a cleaner like Pine-Sol works well enough. We do recommend wearing protective gloves while cleaning.","Before replacing the drawer and putting in a new trash bag, make sure every part is dried. This will cut down on mold and additional unpleasant smells popping up. If your trash compactor cabinet is wood, you can use a wood cleaner or polish on the outside. If it has a metal or stainless steel finish, you can find appliance cleaner at your local grocery store that will help remove fingerprints and other smudges."]},"id":"9cb552d5-2749-4389-9c03-9f9a2fb81bd7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"90429f49-2326-447c-abd8-d274197e6ff6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/kenmore-elite-review\">Kenmore Elite 14733</a>","<a href=\"/maytag-review\">Maytag MTUC7500AFM</a>","<a href=\"/kitchenaid-review\">KitchenAid KTTS505EPA</a>","<a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore 14729</a>","<a href=\"/whirlpool-review\">Whirlpool TU950QPXS</a>","<a href=\"/ge-review\">GE Universal UCG1680LSS</a>","<a href=\"/gladiator-garage-review\">Gladiator GACP15XXMG</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c436f8d3-6a45-4942-93f5-8bca71ec892e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_198","url":"/best-trash-compactors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T22:58:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T22:58:00Z","name":"Best Trash Compactors of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the top trash compactor brands, based on compaction strength, as well as performance, safety features, design options and versatility.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the top trash compactor brands, based on compaction strength, as well as performance, safety features, design options and versatility.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-11T21:57:47Z","id":"VbAbs6VjyoDmoNX4rwMUHV","meta":{"title":"Best Trash Compactors 2019 -
