The package also includes a carrying pouch and a hard-shell case to help protect it while it&#39;s not in use. This line laser is powered by three AAA batteries and can run for up to 30 hours before you&#39;ll need to change the batteries. This is longer than most other units and is a useful feature.","Whether you&#39;re a carpenter, plumber, contractor or just a home-improvement specialist, the important layout tasks and quality control are essential, but time consuming. The PLS180 helps you cut down time while increasing accuracy. It generates two crisp, visible laser lines for level applications and has a range of approximately 30 feet. The laser also wraps 180 degrees, which means it can fill the room you&#39;re working in for the most accurate application. From ceilings to doors and installations to wallpaper, no job is too big or small for this line laser."]},"id":"1cf2eeb0-a777-4d13-8991-3238f4c30570","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/kGBkm9QF826gSzVzr7dGnj.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56553-pacific-laser-systems3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kGBkm9QF826gSzVzr7dGnj.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"kGBkm9QF826gSzVzr7dGnj","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kGBkm9QF826gSzVzr7dGnj.jpg","alt":""},"id":"27e680e4-06d7-4216-b468-13fd00b338fd","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Simply put, the PLS180 line laser level is powerful.
