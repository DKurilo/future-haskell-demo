You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information</em>","The Berkel 823E <a href=\"/best-meat-slicers\">meat slicer</a> is a good option for restaurants that slice meat numerous times every day. This unit has a nice amount of safety features, too, which makes it a great addition to a restaurant where several employees are around throughout the day.","This unit won’t take up a lot of counter space in a restaurant. It is just 15-1/4 inches wide, 18-3/4 inches deep and 13-1/2 inches high.","The Berkel meat slicer is on the professional end of meat slicers, and it can slice more than just meat; you can easily slice vegetables and cheese with this electric meat slicer too.","The blade is 9 inches long and can slice food items up to 9/16 inches thick and 7-1/8 inches wide. Additionally, this unit has a dual-action knife sharpener built into the top.","This unit has a flexible 6-foot cord, which makes it easy to place it farther away from a plug if necessary. The Berkel 823E meat slicer has one speed, and has 1.4 horsepower for slicing meat, vegetables and cheese.","This slicing machine has a handful of safety features, which makes it a good option for either a restaurant or a home meat slicer. One of the most convenient safety features is its moisture-protected on and off switch. This unit also has a permanent tapered ring guard, which covers the non-slicing portion of the knife even when you remove the sharpener and center plate. Additionally, you can disassemble this meat slicer without tools, which makes it easy to clean thoroughly.","You get a one-year warranty that covers the slicer in case of accelerated wear and tear from both labor and travel.","The Berkel 823E meat slicer is a great option for a restaurant that needs to slice meat throughout the day, and it can also be used to slice vegetables and cheese with extreme precision every time. Its handful of safety features will give you peace of mind with employees around it often."]},"id":"5d9999f5-9964-4698-b4ec-4ed27457c72c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59408","url":"/berkel-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-23T04:03:42Z","datePublished":"2014-04-23T04:03:42Z","name":"Berkel 823E","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-04-23T04:03:42Z","id":"ZR8Ldd4JETQGbEHCVyjVf5","meta":{"title":"Berkel 823E Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Berkel 823E electric meat slicer can be used in a restaurant or home setting, and it includes a handful of safety features.
