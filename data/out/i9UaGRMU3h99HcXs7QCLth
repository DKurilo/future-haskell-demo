You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","DNA My Dog is the least expensive pet <a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA testing kit</a> we researched, and it doesn’t provide the level of detail and depth that the other pet DNA testing kits offer. However, if you are looking for a cheap way to tell which breeds are in your dog, this is a good option.","To get your DNA results you will need to swab your dog’s cheek and send in saliva samples.  This company only takes two weeks to return results – the fastest of any pet DNA kit we evaluated. However, the results don’t go into as much detail as the other services we researched.","You can also pay the company more money to find out the genetic makeup of your deceased dog by using a chew toy or some other object with your former pet’s saliva. To get your DNA results for your deceased dog you have to send that object to the company.","One nice thing about this company is the picture certificate that you can order that shows a picture of your dog that you submit, alongside the breed results of your dog’s DNA test. If you are curious to know which breeds are present in your mixed-breed dog, having a print certificate is a nice way to have that information close at hand to tell your friends.","DNA My Dog tests your dog’s DNA against the DNA of 95 dog breeds. This is less than half of the breeds tested with the <a href=\"/wisdom-panel-review\">Wisdom Panel 4.0</a> test, but it should still be enough to determine the major breeds present in your dog. For an additional fee you can also choose to have your dog’s DNA tested for wolf and coyote DNA. This additional test will show you the percentage of wolf or coyote DNA in your dog and can also determine if there are hybrid breeds present in your dog’s parentage.","DNA My Dog will also tell you if your dog breed is at risk for any genetically influenced diseases or health problems. However, unlike <a href=\"/embarkvet-review\">EmbarkVet</a>, the best dog health DNA test we researched, this test doesn’t focus on specific health genes. This test’s health results use the different breeds present in your dog to give you information about common diseases present in those breeds.","Though it is a no-frills DNA test, if you’re just looking to know the breeds that make up your mixed-breed dog and don’t have a huge interest in knowing the health issues of your dog, DNA My Dog is an excellent choice."]},"id":"95b352cd-db4f-4197-aedb-f2bad0b4936d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69629","url":"/dna-my-dog-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-09-26T20:17:15Z","datePublished":"2017-09-26T20:17:15Z","name":"DNA My Dog Breed ID Test","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":26,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","id":"i9UaGRMU3h99HcXs7QCLth","meta":{"title":"DNA My Dog Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"DNA My Dog is the cheapest dog DNA test we researched, and the results come within two weeks.
