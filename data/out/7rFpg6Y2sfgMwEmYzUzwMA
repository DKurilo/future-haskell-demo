You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sony&#39;s Xperia line of smartphones has gained popularity for its simple, yet striking, aluminum-and-glass construction. Just slightly thicker than the industry-leading iPhone 6, the new Xperia Z3 is a phablet with one chief selling point: water resistance. You can submerge the phone under 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes and have it come out nary the worse for wear. It&#39;s a fun feature, and combined with the generally solid performance the device turns in everywhere else, it makes the Z3 a top smartphone worthy of consideration. ","The Xperia Z3&#39;s design is understated, yet easily identifiable: Both the front and back of the phone are solid glass, while the sides are made of gently curved aluminum. The result is comfy in your hand, if rather large – at 5.75 inches tall, with a 5.2-inch screen, this is definitely a phone for people who don&#39;t mind bigger devices.","The screen itself is somewhat disappointing. You don&#39;t have to have a QHD display to be competitive these days, but you do need a bright, vivid screen with brilliant colors that&#39;s viewable from any angle. The Z3 screen is 1080p and uses IPS LCD technology, yet we were left underwhelmed by its performance. Viewing angles aren&#39;t as wide as you&#39;ll find on other devices, and sun glare makes outdoor use difficult. It&#39;s a fine screen, but it won&#39;t turn any heads.","The camera on the back of the phone is like its screen: perfectly acceptable, but by no means exceptional. An ƒ/2.3 aperture opens onto the phone&#39;s six-element, 20.7-megapixel sensor. It&#39;s large and impressive, but thanks to substandard image processing, it turns out photos that are noticeably overexposed and tend more toward warmer hues than other smartphones we&#39;ve reviewed.","If you&#39;re a gamer who owns a PlayStation 4, the Z3 offers a unique feature among smartphones: the ability to play PS4 games right on your phone. There are a few limitations – you have to be on the same Wi-Fi network as your home console, and you&#39;ll need to buy an attachment that will let you use your PS4 controller with the device – but if you want to play top-tier console games while away from the couch, it&#39;s a possibility."]},"id":"64cd7d76-e55b-4d06-95cd-727ab314d02e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce25009b-b2b3-4912-9519-a2619d7ecd0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The best smartphones have powerful processors, solid cameras, decent battery life and fun extras.
