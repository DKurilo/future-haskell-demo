Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">Wireless Keyboards</a> here.</em>","The Logitech Wireless Keyboard K250 puts just the right mix of simplicity and style right at your fingertips. It meets your basic typing needs, starting with no-hassle plug-and-play setup and continuing with reliable wireless connectivity and quiet, comfortable typing at every sitting. Although it lacks some of the added features that are included on other higher-ranked wireless keyboards, it appeals to our minimalist sensibilities and earns a spot on our lineup of best wireless computer keyboards.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>The Logitech Wireless Keyboard K250 incorporates the same reliable 2.4 GHz connectivity and 30-foot range as other Logitech wireless keyboards in our lineup. It also connects to your computer using the manufacturer&#39;s device-networking receiver. The tiny Unifying receiver allows you to sync your keyboard and up to five additional compatible peripherals to your computer at once, freeing up your USB ports. The receiver recognizes the keyboard almost instantly and no software installation is necessary.","This keyboard is equipped with preprogrammed F keys that, with the help of the Function key, control media and other common functions such as checking your email or launching your calculator. Sadly, this keyboard doesn&#39;t have any designated hotkeys for media and internet controls like some of its competitors.","The K250 is powered by two AAA batteries that are estimated to last up to 15 months. Unfortunately this keyboard doesn&#39;t have a battery level indicator, so you&#39;ll have to keep a few batteries on hand to avoid getting caught with a dead keyboard. It doesn&#39;t have a power switch to help save energy either.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>The K250 is a full-size keyboard with a standard layout. It has low-profile, concave-shaped keys that provide a quiet, comfortable typing experience. It also has adjustable feet so you can alter the angle of the keyboard as you like. As part of the Logitech Fantasy collection, this matte black keyboard features a gently curving frame that is embellished on opposite corners with sweeping floral elements done in white. This dramatic ornamentation gives the keyboard status as a decorative accessory rather than a mere peripheral kept only for data input. (You can check out Logitech&#39;s Dark Fleur Wireless Mouse if you&#39;d like to have a matching pair.) At first glance, the bottom edge of the keyboard looks as though it might be able to act as a palm rest. But it proves to be too thin and fails to provide anything other than a wide, somewhat cumbersome border around the keyboard.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Logitech has made it easy to access online support options specifically for this keyboard. The product page contains links to an informative FAQs list and troubleshooting guide, a user manual in PDF format, a user community forum, and email and phone access to technical representatives. There is also a link to available software downloads and updates. This keyboard comes with a three-year warranty."]},"id":"e1b11516-1aab-4437-a1fb-52701d419cac","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e428619b-bd56-4063-9c11-c81845dc27e3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Logitech delivers reliable performance right out of the box with the Logitech Wireless Keyboard K250.
