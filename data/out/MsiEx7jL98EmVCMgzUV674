You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","DrawPlus by Serif is drawing, illustrating and <a href=\"/best-2d-animation-software\">2D animation software</a> that allows you to create animation masterpieces using a single program. This animation software is full of tools you can use to create high-quality backgrounds, scenery and characters. It includes drawing tools, complete with pencils, erasers, shapes and vector path pens. You can also scan your paper drawings and trace over them to convert them into vector graphics for coloring and animating.","A joint tool places movement points on your character&#39;s body so it moves naturally and smoothly. You can animate using individual frames or create animation paths with keyframes. In addition, the program supports onion skinning, which allows you to see the previous frame, your current frame and the following frame on top of each other to help you create smooth movement.","DrawPlus is compatible with drawing tablets, and the integrated Pressure Studio application helps you calibrate your tablet for optimal results when using the program. Drawing tablets are a comfortable way to create digital art, as they allow you to sketch naturally.","You cannot use this 2D animation software to record or edit dialogue and sounds. While you can import sounds into your animation, you have to use a different program for audio recording and editing. It also doesn’t have a special effects library or a lip-syncing feature. If you want a program that offers more recording and editing options, you might be interested in <a href=\"/anime-studio-review\">Anime Studio</a>.","DrawPlus supports a wide variety of file types, including JPEG, GIF, PNG and BMP image files. You can also import video files that are in AVI or QuickTime formats. If you want to add audio to your show, you can import MP3 or WAV files. When you finish your project, you can export your animation as a Flash or AVI file or a QuickTime movie.","If you ever have any questions about this software, you can find answers in the FAQs, user forum or knowledgebase support pages on the Serif website. Also, there are a few text and video tutorials that give step-by-step instructions on animating with keyframes and stopframes. If you still can&#39;t find the answer you need, you can contact Serif by phone or email to speak directly to a technical support agent."]},"id":"dcb9c2ab-3f54-4974-957e-c60a1dda665b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58689","url":"/drawplus-x6-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-23T20:34:38Z","datePublished":"2014-01-23T20:34:38Z","name":"DrawPlus","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":86,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-01-23T20:34:38Z","id":"MsiEx7jL98EmVCMgzUV674","meta":{"title":"DrawPlus Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Create animations with stunning characters and backgrounds using DrawPlus.
