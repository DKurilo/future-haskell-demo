The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-car-battery-chargers\">Car Battery Chargers</a> here.</em>","The Peak PKC0AZ is a portable car battery booster that delivers 450 cold cranking amps to jump-start your battery, which is in the perfect range for most passenger vehicles. Unlike some other jump-starters, the Peak PKC0AZ is equipped with a power switch, so you don&#39;t have to worry about it becoming a safety hazard or draining away as it sits in your trunk.","Equipped with a sturdy handle and only weighing 12 pounds, the Peak PKC0AZ is easy to cart around. You can store it in a compartment in an RV or boat, and it doesn&#39;t take up much room in a trunk.","The insulated, spark-resistant clamps and cables wrap around on each side of the battery booster, making it easy to keep the PKC0AZ neat and tidy. This car battery booster does not feature overcharge protection, though, so you need to keep an eye on it while it recharges or it may overheat.","Another good safety feature of the Peak PKC0AZ is the reverse polarity warning light. If you place a clamp on the wrong battery post and try to jump-start it, it could cause the battery to explode. This charger has a warning light that indicates if you have incorrectly connected to your battery.","A USB port and a 12-volt power plug are built into the Peak PKC0AZ, making this battery booster a great way to power a 12-volt light or radio. You can also use it to recharge your mobile devices, like your phone or MP3 player, which is especially useful when you&#39;re stranded on the road and your phone battery is running low. An LED flashlight is also built into the charger, making it easier to see where to connect it in the dark or low light.","One thing the charger lacks, though, is a solid warranty. Peak only covers it against defects for 90 days, which is restrictively short compared to the five-year warranties of some chargers. This is the only battery booster in our lineup that isn&#39;t under warranty for at least a year."]},"id":"f8d35b1b-b8b4-40ac-931b-27aa2214cbdc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4674e814-a19a-4ec0-a84d-a1c17b311384","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Peak PKC0AZ jump-starter can provide you with the power you need to get your vehicle battery going again in an emergency.
