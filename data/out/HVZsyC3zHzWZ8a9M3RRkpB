Despite the small size of this cheap dehumidifier, it is powerful enough to effectively keep small rooms dry.","This Eva-Dry collects water in a built-in, 16-ounce reservoir that is spillproof. When the reservoir is reaching its capacity, a light will turn on to indicate emptying is needed. In the event of a full reservoir, this small dehumidifier will automatically turn off to prevent overflow. Such a feature proves invaluable for owners who occasionally forget to empty the reservoir between uses.","What makes the EDV-1100 possibly the best dehumidifier for small rooms is its quiet operation. It utilizes Peltier Technology, meaning it doesn’t contain a compressor. As the compressor typically accounts for much of the noise in a dehumidifier, its absence means no mechanical hums and thus a quieter home. Considering how many users will likely have this device in a bathroom or closet adjacent to the bedroom, keeping the dehumidifier unnoticeable is important in maintaining regular daily routines.","The Eva-Dry EDV-1100 excels as a crawl space dehumidifier due to its compact size, weighing only 3 pounds. You just need to make sure there is a plug near your crawl space to give the device power. It only has an on/off setting, so you won’t have to worry about adjusting any other options for increased or reduced moisture removal.","While the reservoir could certainly stand to be larger, it still proves ideal for day-to-day use in small increments. This isn’t something you’ll want to leave running all day every day as the reservoir will need very frequent emptying, but it proves sufficient to dry a bathroom after a shower or keep moist laundry in the closet from dampening the rest of your wardrobe."]},"id":"10d56006-48a9-4345-b6a9-be6ed007fdcd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57067","url":"/eva-dry-dehumidifier-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-07-23T11:51:11Z","datePublished":"2013-07-23T11:51:11Z","name":"Eva-Dry EDV-1100","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
