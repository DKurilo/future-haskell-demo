The rewards and APR help make this a good credit card for college students.","<strong>Before Applying for a Student Credit Card</strong>","Keep in mind, if you do not have the financial skill or knowledge to responsibly manage a line of credit, do not apply for a student credit card. Before taking on any credit, make sure you can afford it. Use your credit card mainly for your cost of living, i.e. things you would spend money on anyway like food and rent. Never use it to pay for something that is more than you can afford, and do not use your credit card for large, unplanned purchases. If you need more information, seek out financial planning assistance, which can often be found on college campuses.","Owning a credit card is a major financial decision that should never be made lightly. While building credit can help you in the long run, you must ensure you are building a positive credit score or you will do more harm than good to your financial record.","<strong>Why Build Credit?</strong>","Establishing credit as a young adult is an important step in the transition to adulthood. College is a good time to apply for a first-time credit card because college is a transitional stage of your life – while you make many decisions for the first time as an adult, you still have the familiarity and structure of school.","Your credit score is a numerical representation of your credit history, and your credit history helps banks and lenders see how well you handle credit and manage your finances. If you have no credit history or a poor credit history, lenders will often deny your requests for loans. This can cause trouble down the road when it is time to buy a new car or a house or even just apply to live in an apartment complex.","Some people are surprised to find that credit history is not just examined when making purchases or applying for loans but at other important times like when you apply for a new job. For example, some jobs require you to have a corporate credit card, and if you have no credit history, they may not trust you with company funds. However, if you have a solid credit history, with few missed payments or defaults, lenders are more likely to grant you loans and trust you to responsibly manage the money they give you.","The best way to build credit is to responsibly use a credit card and never extend its limit beyond your means. College is the perfect time to start building credit because as you get older, your options are limited if you do not have a strong credit background.","<strong>How Do You Build Credit?</strong>","Beginning to build credit can seem like a daunting task, especially if you have no experience with credit cards and applying for credit. Many people wonder how to even begin the process and worry that since they do not currently have credit, no one will approve them.","Student credit cards are a great way to bridge this gap. Since credit cards for college students are designed for first-time credit applicants, the process is geared toward those with no credit history.","Some college student credit cards require a co-signer for approval. This means that someone with an established credit history, usually a parent or guardian, is also on your account. However, this means that his or her credit history is on the hook if you default and cannot make payments.","<strong>Can International Students Apply for College Student Credit Cards?</strong>","International students attending school in America may face additional challenges when applying for student credit cards. Even if they have a solid credit history in their home countries, it doesn’t carry over when they apply for credit at American banks.","The best credit card for international students is most likely a secured credit card. Like a college student credit card, secured credit cards are easier to qualify for and help you build your credit score. These credit cards require a deposit that covers the bank’s losses if you can’t pay your bills. While putting down a deposit is not ideal, it is a great way to build credit until you qualify for a different type of credit card. Discover it offers student credit cards and secured credit cards that might be good options for international students."]},"id":"66ee8c90-a116-4c8e-b6e2-01250b8394e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a996edad-04e1-48c4-b82a-c1ae15a6a7b2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/discover-it-review\">Discover it®</a>","<a href=\"/citi-thankyou-preferred-card-for-college-students-review\">Citi ThankYou®</a>","<a href=\"/journey-student-rewards-card-from-capital-one-review\">Journey℠</a>","<a href=\"/wells-fargo-cash-back-review\">Wells Fargo</a>","<a href=\"/bankamericard-credit-card-for-students-review\">BankAmericard®</a>","<a href=\"/u-s-bank-college-visa-card-review\">U.S. Bank</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"22094f30-a0c6-499c-9ab7-916f4ff23dc3","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_356","url":"/best-student-credit-cards","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-06-23T21:07:02Z","datePublished":"2016-08-29T17:10:25Z","name":"Best Student Credit Cards","synopsis":"Student credit cards are good for those looking to build credit.
