As a merchant, it&#39;s your job to make your customer feel safe so that you can enjoy their patronage, but is online <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> really safe? If it is, how can you convince potential customers that their information is protected? Here are some answers to these important questions.","<strong>Safety First</strong>","The safety of your customers&#39; information really comes down to what type of merchant service you use. Merchant services have a way of encrypting customers&#39; information so that hackers won&#39;t be able to read the information if it is intercepted. Normally, merchant services use a 128-bit encryption method called Secure Socket Layer (SSL).Encryption is the act of turning information into a code that can only be deciphered when it reaches its destination. To a hacker, encrypted information is just a jumble of nonsense.","Also, credit card information and other sensitive information can be stored with the merchant service in a secure database instead of on your computers. This means that your employees won&#39;t have access to your customers&#39; sensitive information.","Some merchant services provide added security for you and your customers. They provide fraud protection extras such as:"]},"id":"ae767815-c32c-446d-a1b0-38f31857aefe","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Address verification that compares the address on the customer&#39;s online order to the address of the card owner.","Real-time processing means the card is processed right away so the information the customer provides can be checked right away.","The customer must enter the card verification value, or CVV2 number, that is found on the back of their card to make a purchase. This verifies that the person making the purchase actually has the card and not just stolen information."],"type":"ul"},"id":"ec0178cd-0374-49d3-8f80-bec54286f519","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Why Shopping Online Is Safer</strong>","In some ways, shopping online can be safer than shopping in a brick-and-mortar establishment. When you shop in a physical location thieves can look over your shoulder to memorize your PIN and then steal your wallet, employees can write down your credit card information and sell it, or a hacker can steal your credit card information using a handheld electronic device. Online, thieves don&#39;t have these opportunities.","<strong>Convincing Customers</strong>","The best way to convince customers of the safety of your online credit card processing is to post stats on the checkout page. For example, many merchant services use Authorize.net for their gateway.
