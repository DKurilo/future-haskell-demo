You can use a free PC optimizer to reduce program crashes and long wait times between program launches, and although they fail to offer some of the robust system tools available with paid programs, they provide an attractive alternative for budget-conscious consumers.","<strong><strong>CCleaner<br/></strong></strong>","Industry experts praise CCleaner for its simple, streamlined user interface and its powerful junk-eliminating features, but they caution that the registry cleaner could prove dangerous in inexperienced hands. You should always back up your computer before conducting a free PC clean-up so you can restore your system if something goes wrong.","CCleaner offers both a free and a paid version, but both contain the same features; the fee simply adds superior technical support to the package. A quick word of advice: If you don&#39;t want to download Google Chrome and make it your default browser, be sure to uncheck that box when installing the program.","<strong><strong>Glary Utilities</strong></strong>","Some experts name Glary Utilities the best of the bunch if you&#39;re looking for a free PC optimizer. If you look past the technical jargon to the numerous utilities the program offers, you&#39;ll find several ways to boost your PC&#39;s performance and reduce system crashes.","<strong><strong>SlimCleaner</strong></strong>","If you&#39;re in the market for a more lightweight method of free computer clean-up, SlimCleaner rises to the head of the class. Weighing in at just 718 kilobytes, SlimCleaner features a straightforward user interface with no bloatware involved. Additionally, since the company only produces a free product, you don&#39;t have to worry about frequent sales pitches to upgrade.","<strong><strong>PC Booster</strong></strong>","Remote technical support, available even with the free version, makes PC Booster a reliable <a href=\"/best-pc-system-utilities-software\">PC optimizer</a> for users who might need assistance running the program. It offers a relatively clean user interface and several utilities for maximizing your computer&#39;s efficiency.<br/>With this program, you should take the time to make sure you only run the necessary features. Some of the modules prove extraneous for the average computer user, so be sure to read the documentation before you start clicking buttons. You might want to choose this program if your computer frequently crashes, as it focuses on resolving start-up issues.","<strong><strong>Ashampoo WinOptimizer</strong></strong>","Unlike its paid version, Ashampoo WinOptimizer Free does not offer live tuning, but it still offers a disk defragmenter, registry cleaner, one-click optimizer, internet cleaner and other useful modules. The simple installation process and fast processing speed make it a useful tool in computer users&#39; virtual tool chests."]},"id":"c60f4c30-2801-4b89-93cd-d969fa040dda","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"<strong>Free Versus Paid Optimizers</strong>"},"id":"11b75a7d-8860-4875-ba13-9c41657bc5cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While free PC optimizers might offer some of the same tools and utilities as their paid counterparts, they don&#39;t cover nearly as much ground. The best PC optimizers, such as System Mechanic and the paid version of WinOptimizer, introduce advanced features like hard drive partition management, secure deletion functionality and system restore assistance. If you&#39;re in a financial bind, we recommend relying on free computer cleanup programs only until you&#39;re able to invest in better software.","Choosing a PC optimizer should involve the analysis of several components Â  especially security.
