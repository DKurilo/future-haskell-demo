However, if you are into ultralight backpacking and need a camp axe you can depend on, the Gransfors Bruks Outdoor Axe is worth considering.","This camping hatchet weighs only a pound but can handle the toughest pines and hardwoods. Our testers said it handled tough jobs with chainsaw-like penetration while also tackling the more delicate missions, like shaping or shaving wood, with finesse. It also tackles brush with easy swings.","The butt of the axe head does a fine job driving in stakes or wedge-splitting firewood. It lacks other multitool features found in several of the camp axes we examined.","The 2.5-inch axe head is made of steel manufactured by Ovako, one of the leading European manufacturers of engineering quality steel for industry and construction. The collar guard, a feature not found on the other camping axes on our lineup, protects the handle against overstrikes when splitting logs. A small whetstone can sharpen this blade should it dull with use.","The handle length is 14.5 inches, a good size for a one-handed axe, although it can function two handed as well. It&#39;s well balanced and precise. It&#39;s made of hickory with a beeswax seal to protect it from the elements. The sheath is made of vegetable-tanned leather. Gransfors Bruks has a strong environmental stance.","Gransfors Bruks has been producing forestry tools in rural Sweden for over a century. It developed this particular axe with the help of survival expert Lars FÃ¤lt, who teaches the Swedish military and is the author of several books on survival.","The company offers a 20-year warranty on the axe head as long as it&#39;s been properly cared for, but some axe enthusiasts say this axe can be handed down from generation to generation. All Gransfors Bruks axes come with an axe book.","While purchasing this camp axe is an investment, the Gransfors Bruks Outdoor Axe is a great addition to your kit when backpacking, camping, rafting or climbing. Agile, lightweight and made with high-quality materials, it can handle most any cutting chore."]},"id":"4d352857-fa21-4853-812b-740983a72445","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68363","url":"/gransfors-bruks-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T19:00:22Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T19:00:22Z","name":"Gransfors Bruks Outdoor Axe","synopsis":"If you go on camping axe forums, you may see comments like, \"I wish I could afford a Gransfors.\" It is indeed one of the most expensive camp axes in our lineup.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you go on camping axe forums, you may see comments like, \"I wish I could afford a Gransfors.\" It is indeed one of the most expensive camp axes in our lineup.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-12T19:00:22Z","id":"FWtHQjcqorRvTYmaskQxPc","meta":{"title":"Gransfors Bruks Outdoor Axe Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Gransfors is high-quality camping axe that&#039;s extremely light yet sharp and precise.
