The AARP prescription drug plans are designed to make your out-of-pocket prescription drug expenses more predictable.  If you are a Medicare recipient, an AARP Part D Plan is available to you even if you are not an AARP member.  With AARP, you can choose between Medicare Rx Preferred Part D Plans with no deductible and a higher premium, or Medicare Rx Saver Plus Plans that have a deductible but a lower premium. The AARP Part D Preferred Plan with no deductible has comprehensive drug coverage, which includes nearly all generic drugs and most common brand-name drugs. This Part D Plan is ideal if you need several prescription drugs. The more affordable AARP Part D Saver Plus Plans have a deductible and may cover a lower number of generic and brand-name drugs, but still offer adequate drug coverage for the price.","When visiting the AARP Medicare Insurance website, you may be redirected to another page to view details about AARP Part D Plans. Here you can view a side-to-side comparison of the plans available to you based on your criteria and search options. Keep in mind that the total annual cost shown is only an estimate and may be subject to change based on your prescriptions, pharmacy and quantities. You may receive a more accurate annual cost quote by entering a detailed list of your current prescriptions. Once you have looked over the available Medicare Part D Plans, you may choose to enroll in the plan of your choice.  If you need additional help deciding which plan is right for you, you may contact United Healthcare via phone or live chat.  This customer service feature is useful because understanding the exclusions and limitations on Medicare Part D Plans can sometimes be confusing.","AARP Part D Plans are available to anyone that is eligible for Medicare. Medicare Part D Plans are not health insurance and only provide coverage for prescription drugs.  The AARP website is easy to use and makes comparing and enrolling in a Medicare Part D Plan easy and efficient.
