Their products are now made in China and imported to America. One of such products is the <strong>Celestron Outland LX 8x42</strong> binoculars. This is a powerful but inexpensive piece of equipment. If we were rating on what would be &#34;the most bang for your buck&#34;, this would be the winner. It is far less expensive and still ranks pretty decent. Typically the inexpensive products aren&#39;t built as well or something along those lines, that isn&#39;t the case here though. Although it doesn&#39;t have the best specs, it also doesn&#39;t have the worst and it is quite comparable to the more expensive 8x42 <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-binoculars\">binoculars</a>.","The first thing to usually go down in quality when you see a low price on a pair of binoculars, are the optics. However, you will be surprised to find that it is not that way here. These binoculars have an 18 millimeter eye relief space which isn&#39;t high but it is plenty for most people. Most binoculars nowadays will have 19 millimeters or more; so that is something on these binoculars that could use some improvement. They say that anything over 17 millimeters should be sufficient but it really depends on the person. The eye relief is the distance you can have your eyes away from the eyepieces and still get the full field of view. This applies mostly to people who wear glasses and thicker glasses may prevent you from getting the entire field of view.","The field of view itself on these Outland LX binoculars is not amazing but at 118 meters it is sitting about in the middle of its competition. The Diopter compensation is also par. It has BAK-4 prisms like all the rest and the lenses are even fully multi-coated. They are usually just multi-coated but Celestron went all the way for us. Unfortunately, the one important coating that they didn&#39;t put on is phase correction coating.","The one thing that Celestron excelled in above all the other binoculars that we reviewed was the close focusing distance. Most of the others could focus between 2 and 3 meters away but the Outland LX can focus as close as 1.5 meters away. This isn&#39;t a huge deal since most people use binoculars to see things far away but it shows the level of available focal adjustment.","Celestron provides excellent help, support and warranty coverage. As we started researching binoculars we quickly found out that no manufacture provides all the specifications information on their site. In order to get that information we had to call in and email them all. One of the two quickest to get the requested information back to us was Celestron. They were fast, polite and helpful. The support team didn&#39;t have every answer to our questions but neither did anyone else.","The other big win for these binoculars is the &#34;No Fault Lifetime Warranty&#34;. As of 2005 this impressive warranty was extended to nearly all the Celestron binoculars. It used to be that this warranty was only for the priciest ones but now it can be found on this super inexpensive set too. What the warranty offers is similar to the warranty that Eagle Optics has on some of their binoculars. It basically entails that no matter the reason for the binoculars breaking, Celestron will fix or replace your binoculars, no questions asked. This warranty was extended to so many of Celestron&#39;s products to demonstrate the confidence they have in them. This is a great move by them for it shows us exactly that."]},"id":"3df8d21d-e18f-4173-bac6-4caa7b1783b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d222e9f9-82af-4352-bf61-e6cbd0826706","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Celestron Outland LX 8x42</strong> binoculars may not be the top of the line but for the price they&#39;re phenomenal.
