Most crank radios have ports for mobile devices but don&#39;t include the cords required to connect them. It seems like the Adventurer has a port and cord for every device you have, including your cell phone, tablet and MP4 player. The manual even includes tips for charging your devices, which is important to pay attention to, because some mobile devices aren&#39;t designed to handle charging from a hand crank.","The Adventurer includes a three-LED flashlight that is very energy efficient. The charge indicator warns you when a charge is dwindling and it&#39;s time to crank it up again. Also, an alert indicator flashes when bad weather is approaching. Unfortunately, this only gains your attention if you&#39;re able to see the flashing warning light. Most emergency radios have a siren in addition to a flashing warning light to signal bad weather.
