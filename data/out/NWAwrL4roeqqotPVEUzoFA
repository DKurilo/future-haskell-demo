You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Jamo SUB 300 is a beautiful <a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">home subwoofer</a> with interesting design features, but when we tested it, this sub had trouble performing any of the tasks you&#39;d expect from a low-frequency speaker.","The Jamo SUB 300 has a frequency range of 28Hz to 150Hz with a crossover setting of 40Hz to 200Hz. Obviously, the high crossover frequency is nothing more than hype, since the higher the frequency, the lower the sound quality. The sub&#39;s amp can push as much as 300 watts peak power with 150 watts of RMS (root-mean-square) continuous power. This weaker power level leads to a max volume of 100dB in smaller rooms.","As a down-firing low-frequency speaker, the Jamo SUB 300 attempts to make up for its weak power by delivering a physical effect while listening. Unlike other home subwoofers, instead of a traditional port for pushing air, this sub uses a slotted rear port to push internal air out. Typically, this is more of a disadvantage because it creates a chuffing effect, although some audiophiles love the look of and sound from slotted ports.","This home subwoofer’s cabinet is much deeper than it is tall or wide and rests on short legs that provide a zone for the woofer’s output to reverberate off the floor to fill the room with deep, rich bass. It is available in three attractive finishes: black ash, dark apple and golden maple.","The Jamo SUB 300 can hit lower frequencies for film soundtracks, and the design allows it to ride through musical notes. Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t great at doing either. The Jamo SUB 300 home subwoofers have slightly fewer features than other powered subwoofers, but the variable phase control dial offers greater control over the phase setting than other subwoofers&#39; controls. The other dial controls the crossover frequency, which you can set anywhere between 40Hz and 200Hz to achieve the most fluid integration with your stereo system. The front-mounted volume control gives you easy access for quick adjustments.","The Jamo SUB 300 has a signal-sensing automatic on-off setting that puts the sub into standby mode when it is not in use. There are three ways to connect the subwoofer to your audio/video receiver: a single LFE line input, a stereo RCA line input and two stereo speaker-level inputs. It also has a left and right channel RCA output to connect it to other powered subwoofer speakers for greater bass impact.","Jamo covers the home subwoofer with a one-year warranty for the electronic components and a three-year warranty on the speaker. The company also provides a FAQs page and owner manuals on its website, and you can contact the technical support team by phone and email. Contacting customer support is a chore, though, and getting answers to your questions tests your patience."]},"id":"633574fc-a29f-4035-bfbe-2a53b845bd6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0f503fd1-af0e-44cf-b578-a3dce008be84","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jamo SUB 300 has a unique design and is available in three finishes.
