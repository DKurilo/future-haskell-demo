As such, there isn&#39;t much innovation left to do with this type of service. Almost all the <a href=\"/best-free-email-services\">free email services</a> on our side-by-side comparison chart share the same basic features, such as an inbox for incoming mail, composition editors and calendars. Mail.com is such a service, which is basic by nature but has a few unique features worth mentioning.","When you log into Mail.com, you are greeted by a homepage filled with news from around the world. The topics cover world, national and local events as well as fashion, celebrity and finance news stories.","Mail.com includes all the features an email service requires, and a few extras. The service filters known spammers and phishers. This free email service makes a valiant effort to prevent unwanted mail from reaching your inbox and although its filters are not quite as effective as services that ranked higher in our review, they are good enough. Mail.com gives you the ability to customize your filters to help sort and organize your incoming mail. Additionally, you can a list to block or allow specific addresses.","Normally, when you sign up for a new email address through a free email service, you only have one choice for domain. Mail.com has more than 200 domains that allow you to build a unique email address. If you do not want to be name@mail.com, you can choose, @dublin.com, @techie.com, @europe.com, @doglover.com and many more.","Another feature worth mentioning is Mail.com&#39;s ability to draw messages from other services into your Mail.com inbox. Mail.com calls this its &#34;mail collector.&#34; This is a great tool for people who have multiple email addresses but don&#39;t want to check each account individually. Moreover, Mail.com gives you the ability to send mail via proxy for other email accounts, so there wouldn&#39;t be a reason to log in to other services at all."]},"id":"54bd7a9b-a7b5-487b-89a3-7de15a77e81c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"47e3b604-9791-41cb-8d7d-41b693292446","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Mail.com is a basic service with a couple of great features that make it attractive to most people.
