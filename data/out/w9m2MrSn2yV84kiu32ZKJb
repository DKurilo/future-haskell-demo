The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-robot-vacuums\">Robot Vacuums</a> here.</em>","The Moneual RYDIS H68 Pro is a robot vacuum that can keep a new carpet looking clean after having food and dirt left on it by a busy family. It can also work without becoming a noise nuisance, and even if it does not have the directional conveniences of other robotic vacuums, it still has features consistent with the best robot vacuums.","This robot vacuum cleaner sweeps up debris with consistencies as different as human hair and garlic skins. It works better on carpeted surfaces than on hard surfaces, and it moves slowly but leaves little debris behind. There is also a mop feature that can clean up liquid messes on hard surfaces, something which even more advanced robot vacuum cleaners only sparingly have built into their features.","The vacuum is light and easy to store, and it takes little time to empty the dustbin and clean the rollers after it has completed cleaning. A status light lets you know when the robot vacuum is nearing the end of its charging power, and it typically lasts for two hours after it has been fully charged, which is longer than many other robot vacuum cleaners.","The Moneual RYDIS H68 Pro has the ability to navigate around rooms, even though it tends to bump into walls before veering around them. There are also not many extra accessories to assist with the maintenance of this robot vacuum. While it does come with a remote control that can direct the vacuum, there is no virtual wall. The vacuum lacks a magnetic or electronic barrier to keep it within the boundaries of a room, which can be an inconvenience if you do not want it to mistakenly end up in a room full of thin electrical cords or delicate objects.","A one-year warranty is attached to the Moneual RYDIS H68 Pro, which is typical for a robot vacuum. You can also call the manufacturers if you have problems with starting or operating it, and you can reach a representative during business hours. You can also look at an online user manual, which goes through the different parts of the vacuum and explains the patterns of the vacuum’s cleaning. There are no online tutorials, and that takes away the opportunity to witness an in-person approach to using the vacuum."]},"id":"22e79e07-d90e-4ccc-b8db-7785e2fc1996","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b01b66c8-a8fc-4ba0-bebd-8251cce5a001","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Moneual RYDIS H68 Pro is a strong enough vacuum to clean up your messiest foods and any litter your pet leaves around the house.
