With a push of a button, the Honeywell Air Genius pivots from left to right, pulling dirty air in from one side and shooting clean air out the other.","This air purifier allows you to choose between an odor-reducing filter and a permanent filter. While the odor-reducing filter handles offensive gases better, it has a short filtration life of three months. The permanent filter delivers middling performance, but you can wash it every three months rather than replace it. The Air Genius oscillates to achieve maximum filtration.","This air filter comes with an operation timer. You can run it for two, four, six, eight, 10 or 12 hours at a time before it goes into standby mode. The filter monitor will keep track of how long you&#39;ve used your filter and tell you when it is time to make a change. The Air Genius does not have an air-quality sensor, and the filter monitor is based on the amount of time you&#39;ve used the air filter rather than the pollution it has captured.","Honeywell lists the Air Genius on many of its websites, but we could not find a downloadable user manual on any of them. Some of the sites offer basic FAQs, but none of the answers would help you if you have a problem with your air filter. Fortunately, customer service representatives are available by email and phone."]},"id":"7fd84caf-1894-4f9a-a830-c563aeb9a0d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7817bdc9-774a-474b-9ebb-0d57d104eb98","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Honeywell Air Genius is an oscillating air purifier with an auto-off timer and a filter monitor.
