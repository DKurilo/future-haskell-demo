It also jumped into the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/988-best-gaming-services.html\">online video game rental</a> business. Thousands of kiosks are available in populated areas of the U.S., so most people are never more than a few miles away from the newest games and movies.","However, Redbox does not offer game rental by mail like its competitors, and it does not offer membership plans that allow you to avoid late fees or due dates. However, it lets you rent a video game right now, if you want to play a game tonight.","Redbox distinguishes itself by giving you access to games as soon as you want them. With a credit or debit card, you can drive to a kiosk and rent a game instantly. You do not have to apply for a membership, deal with credit checks or wait for games to arrive in the mail. However, Redbox has a limited selection. On average, any given kiosk holds a selection of about 50 of the newest games. Each rental costs a few dollars per day, and if you keep a game for 30 days, it becomes yours permanently. If you want to make sure the game is available when you get to a Redbox kiosk, you can reserve it online and pick it up at your leisure.","This isn’t the most cost-effective way to game. If you rent games every day of the month, you&#39;re paying nearly four times as much as you would with one of the competitors. Also, Redbox limits gamers by console – it only offers games for PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.","If you&#39;re looking for a specific game, there are several ways to find it. At the kiosks, you can browse for games by platform, genre and ESRB rating.","The Redbox kiosks are fully automated, but there are plenty of humans available to help you online. The FAQs section is detailed and offers clear and concise answers to many questions. However, sometimes you need personal help, and Redbox customer service representatives are available by telephone, email and live chat.","Redbox is a convenient online video game rental service, but when compared to other game rental services, it is not the most cost-effective solution. However, you never have to wait for a game to arrive as one of its thousands of kiosks is probably just a few miles away."]},"id":"c19bf837-b222-4899-a736-cacfc6ad3848","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58516","url":"/redbox-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-27T21:39:42Z","datePublished":"2013-12-27T21:39:42Z","name":"Redbox","synopsis":"Redbox revolutionized movie rentals with its highly accessible kiosks and freedom to rent movies without a membership.
