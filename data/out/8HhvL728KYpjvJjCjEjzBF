This range extender is sleekly designed to realize the full potential of your home or office&#39;s wireless range. It isn&#39;t the best Wi-Fi range extender on our lineup, but it&#39;s pretty close.","The Wi-Fi booster doesn&#39;t have any external antennas, but it can still capture and rebroadcast your home network&#39;s wireless signal. We actually like the sleek look of the unit without the antennas. It can extend your current wireless range by up to 300 feet. This means if you set the unit on the edge of your current connection, it repeats and rebounds the signal across any dead spots you have. It is compatible with most 802.11b, g and n Wi-Fi devices and works in conjunction with your router to help your wireless devices work at their peak when it comes to internet connectivity.","The range extender&#39;s real strength comes from its ability to receive and transmit on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Most Wi-Fi boosters only have access to the 2.4GHz band, which only allows them to send or receive information at one time. With access to both bands, the Belkin Dual-Band can transmit and receive at the same time, giving you a faster connection.","This unit is lacking a few features. We really like that other Wi-Fi boosters allow you to manage settings remotely through an IP address or other configuration. Belkin&#39;s version doesn&#39;t have this option. You can configure settings, set up passwords and change security measures online through Belkin&#39;s user interface, but it can&#39;t be managed remotely."]},"id":"13ae1289-d2d3-4f30-8f0a-66cb8a791caa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"469a7b4b-dfa0-4344-99a9-02b61746e455","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Belkin Dual-Band F9K1106 Wi-Fi extender is one of the best Wi-Fi boosters in our lineup.
