And the Vaio Tap SVT212190X all-in-one PC marries the two computing types well. One unique thing about the Tap is that it has a supplemental battery to make it mobile. This means you can easily move it from room to room inside your home.","This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one desktop</a> has an aesthetically pleasing design with a 20-inch widescreen with a pivot back to keep it upright. However, although it’s adequate for watching movies and videos, the 1600 x 900 display resolution on this PC is lower than others in its class.","Another drawback for this home PC is that its i5 processor only has 1.7GHz of processing speed. This means it can go about as fast as a tablet, which is pretty slow for an all-in-one PC.","The Sony Vaio Tap SVT212190X ships with a matching wireless keyboard and mouse. Also, the computer has a built-in webcam and two USB 3.0 ports. You don&#39;t get an optical drive, though, and there are no upgrades available to give the Tap a media player. If you enjoy streaming movies or playing downloaded games, you’ll be slightly disappointed that the screen&#39;s resolution is not quite HD. The resolution is good, especially for a 20-inch screen, but you won&#39;t go trading in your high definition TV for this computer.","If you need a desktop that you can move around the house so you can check your email or do minor work, this computer does the job. The Tap won&#39;t stream movies or play games well, and it will barely surf the web, but if you have a recipe loaded and need to get started, you can take the Tap with you without worrying about losing power.","Sony&#39;s customer support is among the finest we&#39;ve seen. Representatives are available through email, live chat or telephone. If you would rather try to fix your own problems, the site has comprehensive guides available for download. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t a comprehensive support program built into the computer, and Sony&#39;s free Kaspersky anti-virus software is only a 30-day trial. Besides that, Sony sticks to its customers and keeps them happy."]},"id":"c8f3c6aa-e13c-40a4-84ee-c56837b07e36","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5fd76f13-29da-497e-b334-294b7e5da7b7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony Vaio Tap SVT212190X does not offer major computing power or lightning fast speeds, but it does offer portability.
