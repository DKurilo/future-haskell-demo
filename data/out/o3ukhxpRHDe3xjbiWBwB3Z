You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","The ViewSonic TD2220 is an optical HD <a href=\"/best-touchscreen-monitors\">touchscreen</a> with a standard contrast ratio but a dimmer screen than other monitors we reviewed. It doesn&#39;t come with a stylus, but you can use one if you want. The ViewSonic monitor is a multi-touch device, so you can perform tasks that require the use of more than one touch at a time, such as rotating images. The viewing angles on this monitor are wide, but some monitors we reviewed have even wider viewing angles. One of the best things is that it works as a touchscreen PC or Mac monitor.","The display on this touchscreen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution, which is high resolution. It also has a typical contrast ratio of 1000:1 and a standard aspect ratio of 16:9. The brightness on this touchscreen desktop monitor is only 200 candela per meter squared, which is a little weak compared to other monitors we reviewed. However, the response time is a quick 5ms, and the monitor has a standard 60Hz refresh rate. The company doesn&#39;t publish the pixel pitch.","The vertical viewing angle of this monitor is 160 degrees, and the horizontal viewing angle is 170 degrees. While these viewing angles are great, some of the other monitors we reviewed have a wider vertical and horizontal viewing angle.","The optical touchscreen provides excellent capabilities. It also is multi-touch, which means you can use more than one finger or stylus to perform tasks on the screen. This is useful because you can perform tasks such as zoom and rotate.","It only uses 26 watts to operate, which is great. You can also change the screen to Eco-mode to save energy. When it&#39;s on Eco-mode, the monitor isn&#39;t as bright, but ViewSonic points out that in low ambient lighting conditions, if you have the screen brightness turned down, you&#39;ll not only lengthen the monitor&#39;s lamp life, but you&#39;ll also cut down on eye fatigue.","This touchscreen doesn&#39;t come with a stylus. You can still use one if you want. Optical screens work with styluses, fingers and even gloved hands.","The ViewSonic TD2220 monitor has a 21.5-inch screen and fits snuggly in the monitor. Of all the touchscreens we reviewed, this one has the most screen area for its monitor size. It weighs 14.22 pounds. With the stand, the monitor is 9.45 inches thick, but by itself, it&#39;s only 2.61 inches thick. You can adjust the monitor five degrees forward and 20 degrees back when it&#39;s on its stand. Or you can remove the stand and mount the screen on the wall. The ViewSonic TD2220 comes with a 100x100 mm Versa Mount."]},"id":"6a87c058-41f4-44cc-a1ae-468082a10c09","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e753cc9c-41af-4162-9173-ad7cf43257f8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although this touchscreen has a lot of really great features and specs, some of the other monitors we reviewed are even better. Still, the ViewSonic TD2220 is a great HD optical touchscreen. With the optical capabilities, you can use your finger, gloved hand or a stylus on the screen. It has a quick response time and it doesn&#39;t use as much power as some of the other monitors. Additionally, you can save even more energy if you turn on the Eco-mode. This touchscreen monitor will work well with a PC or a Mac."]},"id":"4d0670db-9271-4b4d-aa0f-0efcb3470cb4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55617","url":"/viewsonic-td2220-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-12-21T14:28:27Z","datePublished":"2012-12-21T14:28:27Z","name":"ViewSonic TD2220","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":68,"verdict":"This optical desktop monitor has high-definition resolution and conserves energy as well.","pros":["This touchscreen monitor works with a PC or a Mac.
