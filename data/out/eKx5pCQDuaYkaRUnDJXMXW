Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Maytag MFX2676FRZ is the only four-door French door refrigerator in our review. This means you get an external storage drawer in addition to the standard refrigeration and freezer compartments. This and other features make it a great fridge, but it falls short of the energy efficiency and comprehensive warranties of the best French door refrigerators. For a more traditional French door layout, consider the <a href=\"http://www.toptenreviews.com/kitchenaid-review\">KitchenAid KRFF707ESS</a>.","This Maytag <a href=\"/best-french-door-refrigerators\">French door fridge</a> has over 26 cubic feet of storage to accommodate lots of groceries. Its PowerCold function lets you set the temperatures lower for a short time to chill or freeze groceries quickly, then returns the fridge to the standard set temperature to maintain the cool.","The water and ice dispenser uses a filtration system to purify the water for drinking. The ice bin holds 3 pounds when full, which is much more than you get with most French door refrigerators&#39; ice bins, which typically hold only 1 pound. The dispenser is designed to accommodate large containers such as pitches and water bottles, making it easier to fill them with ice or water.","There are five shelves in the refrigerated section that are adjustable and spill-proof. Some of the shelves can be folded up out of the way to free up more space for tall items, then flipped back down when you need more shelf space. There are three crisper drawers that have adjustable temperature controls, and five additional bins are located in the French doors, including three gallon-sized bins. There isn’t a designated dairy bin, but there is a full-length external drawer that is big enough to hold items such as meats and party platters. It’s unusual but useful to have it as an external drawer rather than an internal bin.","Like most French door fridges, the Maytag has a two-tier freezer. There is a total of six bins to hold a lot of frozen foods. These bins are made from durable plastic and vary in depth. A special bin right behind the freezer door called a pizza pocket can easily hold pizza boxes on end or other bulky items.","This Maytag model is less energy-efficient than most fridges in our review. It costs about $85, or $3.17 per cubic foot, to run for a year. While this isn&#39;t too expensive, other French door fridges cost as low as $50 to $60 per year.","In addition to the standard one-year warranty, the Maytag comes with a 10-year warranty on the compressor. This is helpful, since this is the main part in charge of cooling the refrigerator. However, several more parts that make up the sealed system are not covered by an extended warranty. It’s common for these smaller parts to go out faster and sooner than the compressor, so it’s helpful when a manufacturer extends a warranty to this system.","The Maytag MFX2676FRZ is a four-door refrigerator that places its full-length drawer outside of the refrigerator unit as its own separate bin rather than including it inside the refrigerated compartment. The ice bin holds 3 pounds of ice, and the water dispenser is large enough to accommodate tall containers. There is an extended warranty for the dispenser, but the rest of the sealed system and parts are not covered beyond the initial first-year warranty, and the fridge&#39;s energy efficiency is below average."]},"id":"0d1e2f11-379d-4c6c-af2e-456d48f24fe9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51077","url":"/maytag-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-12T15:28:06Z","datePublished":"2010-10-12T15:28:06Z","name":"Maytag MFX2676FRZ","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-10-12T15:28:06Z","id":"eKx5pCQDuaYkaRUnDJXMXW","meta":{"title":"Maytag MFX2676FRZ Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of the Maytag MFX2676FRZ to see where it ranks among the best french door refrigerators."},"products":[{"slug":"maytag-mfx2676frz","url":"/product/maytag-mfx2676frz","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","name":"Maytag MFX2676FRZ","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","id":"mDewmuYyLBggzajzEGcJEY","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8fkW2F8FNxiotLYqEDq7EZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","mimeType":"","name":"51049-maytag-mf12269vem-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/51049-maytag-mf12269vem-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","id":"8fkW2F8FNxiotLYqEDq7EZ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8fkW2F8FNxiotLYqEDq7EZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Maytag MFX2676FRZ Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of the Maytag MFX2676FRZ to see where it ranks among the best french door refrigerators."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8fkW2F8FNxiotLYqEDq7EZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","mimeType":"","name":"51049-maytag-mf12269vem-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/51049-maytag-mf12269vem-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","id":"8fkW2F8FNxiotLYqEDq7EZ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8fkW2F8FNxiotLYqEDq7EZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Maytag MFX2676FRZ Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of the Maytag MFX2676FRZ to see where it ranks among the best french door refrigerators."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/maytag-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"refrigerators","url":"/kitchen/refrigerators","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","name":"Refrigerators","dateModified":"2019-04-05T11:40:23Z","id":"hGnCzHoUh2aAKgnXsQGcFg","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
