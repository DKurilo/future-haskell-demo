You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The EdgeStar CWD1550W is an affordable <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">washer dryer combo</a> with a compact design and features like varied spin speeds and a favorites setting that make it worth a look for the right buyer. However, it has just one dryer cycle and lacks other features such as automatic load sensing.","This washer dryer combo has 2 cubic feet of space, which will hold up to about 8 pounds of laundry. This is the standard size for one of these machines. This is a ventless machine, which is a common feature among combination washer dryers. These machines are obviously convenient in the way of saving space, but a ventless washer dryer is also convenient if you live in a place without an external venting system. You can hook it up to your sink instead of venting externally. The down side to a ventless washer dryer is clothes don’t get as dry as they do with conventional dryers, so they may come out of the dryer slightly damp and you’ll have to air dry the rest.","Another limitation of the EdgeStar is it only has one dryer cycle. Some washer dryer units in our reviews have settings like normal dry, damp dry, more dry and low temperature settings. But this dryer only has a normal dry setting. This washer dryer also lacks an automatic load sense, which is a feature that can help conserve water because it will fill the tub with the right amount of water for the load you’re washing. Nonetheless it is a relatively energy-conserving machine that costs only an estimated $11 a year to operate.","While limited in its dryer options, this machine has plenty of washing cycles. It has cycles for cotton, wool, delicates and permanent press. You can customize a “My Cycle” button to default to your favorite, and most used, settings. There is also a self-cleaning and sanitizing cycle that uses super-heated water to remove buildup in the drum, so it won’t transfer to your clothes. This is a cycle you should use at least monthly.","Another feature this all-in-one washer dryer includes is a built-in water heater that heats water to higher-than-average temperatures to clean clothes quickly and efficiently. This machine also has spin speeds of between 600 and 1,120 rpm, which is wider than the average machine. This gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to the speed with which you wash and dry clothes. Delicate items require lower speeds, while bulky items like towels respond better to faster speeds.","This washer dryer has a one-year warranty for parts and labor, which is standard. If you need help setting up the washer dryer or have any problems, you can direct your question to customer service via email, phone or live chat."]},"id":"5d0f1907-b638-4025-bdff-bee4f6ece541","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2e3309a4-e9fb-4dd9-a93f-593d38ad82bb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The EdgeStar CWD1550W is a nice washer dryer combo with all the washing cycles you will need to clean your clothes the way you like.
