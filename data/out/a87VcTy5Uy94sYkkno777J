You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","iSkysoft developers are proving their keen eyes for making great applications wrapped up in pretty packages. If you like to watch your movies on the go, iSkysoft DVD Ripper for Mac<strong> </strong>will make sure your DVDs earn their keep and are a great addition to your <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copy software</a> application library. DVD Ripper for Mac comes complete with video editing capabilities, output options and a ripping preview screen.","DVD rippers (such as this iSkysoft DVD Ripper for Mac) won’t create physical DVDs you can put in any DVD player and enjoy. These applications create digital versions of your favorite discs and allow you to export them to many more portable devices than your Mac. With a digital copy you don’t need to worry about scratches or dust, or even fingerprints. All you need to worry about is clicking the convert button. With this application you can even edit the videos you’re ripping using the trim, crop and effect tools provided. Trim out those pesky previews, remove the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen and even adjust the brightness and contrast of the whole film.","For the physical version or duplicate, don&#39;t rely on this Mac DVD copy software application. It won&#39;t compress larger DVD-9 discs to DVD-5 discs, leaving you with a movie split onto two discs. This application isn&#39;t meant for burning the discs. If you even want the movie on two discs, you will need to use another application. Stick with this application if you want to squeeze your movies onto your mobile devices, not physical DVDs.","The output profiles available cover all the usual bases. This Mac DVD copy software application doesn’t have the extreme profile range available with the other rippers, but the lack of those niche outputs will only deter the hardcore DVD ripper. By including a HD profile category, it makes it easy to overlook the holes elsewhere. The end product in the testing process was nice and clean for computer viewing, therefore you won’t be disappointed with the end product even if you can’t put it anywhere you might wish.","This application&#39;s design makes it easy and fun to use. Everything has that high-design gloss you’ve come to expect from Mac products. It’s a pleasant reminder that the application you purchased is a full package not just being held together with chewing gum and spit. The progress screen also is a great way to monitor the rip and an easy way to keep an eye on the output.","iSkysoft wants to make sure you’re completely happy with your Mac DVD copy software application. If you are going to put the money down to purchase the software, you’ll rest easy knowing the developers are close at hand. The website provides ample how-to information through step-by-step illustrated tutorials and user guides. The online form allows you to ask your specific questions to the support team for more personal support."]},"id":"bc455191-465f-4c89-a334-7dc57ca4b8c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dcfed927-6f9d-4428-b1e4-d573738c31ad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you feel restricted by the limitations of physical DVDs, then a DVD ripping application is a great option.<strong> </strong>iSkysoft DVD Ripper for Mac is a great option for your consideration.
