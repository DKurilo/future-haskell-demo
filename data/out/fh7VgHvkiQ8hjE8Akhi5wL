The steaming basket is made of heavy-duty stainless steel, and the aluminum core at the base evenly distributes heat and resists corrosion and discoloring.

It can also be put in the oven for baking. The mid-sized capacity of this saucepot and steamer serves a couple or small family well.","This compact steamer is versatile and made to last. You can use this pot to cook rice or pasta below and steam fish and vegetables with the steam cooker insert, saving you both time and energy.

The steamer basket can also double as a strainer to drain pasta, which is handy and means one less dish to clean.","This Farberware Stack &#39;N Steam model is oven-safe to 360 degrees Fahrenheit. It comes with a lifetime warranty, so you will have peace of mind knowing that Farberware stands behind its product.","The greatest things about this Stack &#39;N Steam pot are its versatility, durability, affordability and the  lifetime warranty. You can braise beef, use it as a vegetable steamer, steam seafood and poultry, or even put it in the oven. Since it is not dedicated to one use, you have the flexibility to cook what you want all in one single pot. The handles are designed to be oven-safe and stay cool on the stovetop, and it has a well-fitting lid.
