READYdebit offers ScoreTracker for those who have a prepaid card account with direct deposit. ScoreTracker is an application that enables you to track your credit score over time with online tools, including an interactive simulator that will &#34;help you learn how to anticipate changes in your credit score and make the best choices to protect your credit over time,&#34; according to the READYdebit website.","You can pay your bills, check your card balance and view your account statement wherever and whenever you need to with the READYdebit mobile banking app. This app is available for the iPhone iOS version3.0 and later and the Android OS version 1.5 and up. Note: You must sign up for online bill pay before you can pay bills using the mobile app.","Text alerts are another mobile feature that keeps you informed about your account, even if you don&#39;t have an iPhone or Android device. You can choose which alerts to sign up for online, including a low balance notification that will alert you when money you have deposited is available.","With the prepaid debit card, you are able to make purchases online and in the store just like you would with a credit card. You are able to use your card at the gas station, but we recommend that you pay for the gas inside instead of at the pump. If you do pay at the pump with your prepaid card, READYdebit will place a $125 hold on your funds until the transaction has been approved, which can take days.","Like a regular credit card, a prepaid card has limits and restrictions. READYdebit is no exception. There is a minimum and maximum dollar amount that you can load, save and spend with your card. For example, for every reload that you perform, you must add a minimum of $20 to the card balance. Additionally, there is a maximum cash load value of $2,500.","You can choose from several methods to load money onto your prepaid card, including an in-house bank transfer or a Green Dot MoneyPak card (which will cost you up to $4.95 to obtain). You can also load cash at any Visa ReadyLink location, send money to your prepaid card directly from your checking or savings account and transfer funds from one READYdebit card to another.","Although you can only load up to $2,500 on your card, if you opt to load money electronically via direct deposit, you can max out the reload value at $10,000. This is one of the highest max values for any prepaid debit card. This nearly sky-high limit makes READYdebit a popular choice for travelers because the card is safer to carry than cash.","Do keep in mind that even though you can load money onto the card as many as five times per day, you can only spend $2,500 every 24 hours.","The Platinum READYdebit offers free customer support that includes automated phone support and live customer service. You can also contact the company by email. A representative will try to respond to your email within one business day, according to the website."]},"id":"53cc1ac5-0fad-4f1d-a3f8-26ec4dad2db0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d4f25180-9d18-4d36-a0ae-d86b4fc08a98","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The READYdebit Platinum card offers features are similar to other prepaid debit cards.
