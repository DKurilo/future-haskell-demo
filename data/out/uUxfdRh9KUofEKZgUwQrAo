We specialize in a wide variety of categories, ranging from consumer focused tech products to services for small and medium businesses. And each category receives between 40 and 140 hours of research, comparative testing and careful analysis. In addition, we consult with industry experts to get insights on what separates the best from the rest.","<strong>What We Evaluated</strong>","Your business cannot succeed if you don’t manage your cash flow effectively. Most businesses fail, not because the product or service was not good, but because the books weren’t managed effectively to maximize the return on investments in time and capital. As such, we looked closely at how each online accounting service achieve this purpose for a small business owner still in charge of managing their ledger.","Every business has different challenges with different approaches to survival and growth, but the big picture principle is always the same - you want more money to come in than going out. And it’s this principle that should drive your decision on what kind of accounting software you should use.","Money Coming In<br/>The most important feature of online accounting software is the automated invoicing. With it, you don’t have to manually send invoices to clients. The software takes care of the invoicing process, from sending the bill, processing the payment and calculating the results in your accounts receivable ledgers. It should account for taxes and even send late-payment reminders with late fees, should you choose to have such policies. You should be able to access your invoices from a mobile device and even physically take payments on location if needed.","We also looked at how well the accounting software created estimates to send to clients. The best software allows you to create the estimate and send it to the client for feedback or approval. And once approved, it should automatically convert the estimate to a working invoice.","If your business does work in multiple countries, look for an accounting service with multi-currency capabilities. Most offer this, but often only within the most comprehensive package.","Money Going Out<br/>We looked at whether the accounting software tracked your bills and debt, and whether it paid these bills automatically or if it just tracked the money required to keep the business afloat. We also made sure the software scanned and tracked receipts for deductions and auditing purposes.","The money going out also includes features to help with payroll, inventory control, product development, market research and any other investments required to improve your business. Some of these features, such as payroll, require different fees. And some cloud accounting services don’t provide payroll services at all.","Performance Tracking<br/>Finally, you need the accounting software to provide reliable performance data about your businesses performance, in both macro (year to year) and micro (day to day) reports. You can’t understand your return on investments if you don’t have good data. And if you can’t grasp your businesses ROI, you’re not going to make the best decisions for growth, much less survival.  As such, don’t underestimate the financial health reports. Look for reports capable of delivering reports on a wide range of criteria, like debt-to-revenue ratio, inventory trends and more.","<strong>How Much Does Online Accounting Software Cost?</strong>","For self-employed with just a handful of clients, you can expect to pay around $10 per month, though some services have free plans, though these generally limit the number of invoices you can send to just a few with very little customization. If you’re a small business owner with 50 to 100 clients, you can expect a lot more features and pay between $20 and $30 per month. For 500 or more invoices, it costs around $50 per month. Adding payroll services is an additional fee based on a monthly fee around $20 and an addition $4 to $12 fee for each employee.<br/><strong><br/>Should I Apply For a Small Business Loan?</strong>","You started a business to make money, not go into debt. And in a perfect world, your business would take off from the day you open the door, but we all know perfect worlds only exist in fairytales. In reality, applying for a small business loan is necessary just to get your company up and running. Many of the most successful businesses operated at a loss for decades before they turned a profit.","According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/01/be-like-bezos-musk-5-reasons-losing-money-can-lead-to-success.html\">Tim Mullaney of CNBC</a>, taking on debt, via loans, lines of credit and business credit cards, early in a business venture is necessary to not only develop the product or service, but to gain market share. Companies like Amazon operate at massive losses for many years, taking on debt or sacrificing profits to capture a larger part of the market. This is not an accident, but done with a long-term plan in mind. And that’s what it really comes down to - when you take on debt, it needs to have purpose and a plan aimed at a return much greater than the debt plus the interest rate applied over time. However, even if you’re just a humble retailer running a hipster bookstore and cafe, you may need to take on debts from time to time to keep your business afloat, especially in the early days of the business. You may not know for a few years that spring and fall months are when you receive most of your annual income, and may need small business loans or lines of credit to make it through the lean months.","Whatever your situation, it’s important to do your research and have a plan in place for how you’re planning on repaying the loan. Depending on the loan type or line of credit, you may have to present a detailed plan of how you expect to use the debt to benefit your business.","<strong>What Is a Business Credit Score?</strong>","Every consumer with debt has a credit score and credit reports. These scores and reports, which are strictly regulated by laws, are used by banks, businesses, landlords and sometimes potential employers to evaluate your risk as a consumer. The reports show how much debt you have compared to your estimated income, whether you make late payments, if debts have been sent to collections and if you’ve ever declared bankruptcy.","The information in the three reports is then used to create a FICO credit score to represent your risk in a simple and quick format. This number is used to either approve loans, credit cards and other financing or determine the interest rate. A good score means you pay less interest. A loan approved on a low credit score means you’ll likely have to pay an interest rate many times greater.","However, while consumer credit scores are well-known, many small business owners don’t realize their business also has a credit score. There are several kinds of business credit scores used for different purposes. According to <a href=\"https://www.nav.com/business-credit-scores/\">NAV</a>, the most common credit scores and reporting agencies are Dun &amp; Bradstreet PAYDEX, Intelliscore PLusSM from Experian and FICO LiquidCredit Small Business Score.","Dun &amp; Bradstreet PAYDEX: 0-100<br/>Score shows how promptly your business pays bills. Used by vendors and suppliers to evaluate terms of contracts related to your business.","Intelliscore PlusSM from Experian: 0-100<br/>Score predicts the likelihood of delinquency on outstanding debts. Used by lenders to determine terms of business loans and lines of credit.","FICO LiquidCredit Small Business Score: 0-300<br/>Specifically made for small businesses, this ranks businesses based on their payment history, but it often includes personal credit reports and scores along with the business score, especially when the business is small and relatively young. Lenders use this score to determine SMB loans and lines of credit.","With business credit scores, most of the criteria used to calculate your score are similar to your personal credit score - debt ratio, credit utilization, outstanding debts, length of credit history, bankruptcies, liens and judgements. However, there are other considerations, such as the company size and industry risk that also factor into the score.","Similar to your personal credit score, it’s important to stay on top of your business credit score. This means regularly evaluating your business credit reports, looking for errors and immediately correcting any errors you find. In addition, it means having a strategy in place for building your credit score or repairing your credit score if you find it’s fallen below satisfactory levels."]},"id":"17ad26ed-9b86-4470-84f1-490f940512cd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_384","url":"/best-billing-and-invoice-software","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-21T23:42:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-21T23:42:00Z","name":"Best Online Accounting Software of 2019","synopsis":"Looking for billing and invoice software that includes features like automated reminders and payment tracking?
