It ships with preloaded maps of the United States, so you can begin navigating as soon as you turn on the device.","This GPS also has lifetime traffic updates. This means it searches ahead for congestion and then alters your route to get you to your destination in the shortest possible time. Magellan&#39;s traffic service works via a traffic signal built into the GPS. This is a better system than those of several competitors, which use Bluetooth pairing with a smartphone to acquire traffic information, a process that costs battery life and data.","This navigation GPS does have Bluetooth, but instead of using it for traffic information, it uses it to transform itself into a speakerphone. You can make calls on your cell and use this GPS as a speaker and microphone. Unfortunately, the GPS lacks voice-activated navigation, which is one of the most useful features offered by the best navigation GPS units.","One of the best features this GPS offers is lane assistance. When approaching a turn, the GPS tells you in advance what lane to enter. This can help you avoid dangerous lane changes. It also has a speed limit feature, which displays both the speed limit of the road and the speed at which you are traveling. Both these features can help you avoid a speeding ticket.","This unit doesn&#39;t have the 3D maps that some of its similarly priced competitors offer. These maps make navigation more intuitive, especially in a place with a lot of buildings.","The display is 5 inches and uses smartphone-style capacitive touch technology. Cheaper GPS units use resistive-style touch technology, which is significantly more frustrating to use.","Magellan has below-average customer service. We experienced multiple long wait times on the phone, and the chat representatives we interacted with were only somewhat knowledgeable about Magellan products."]},"id":"0899e38f-618d-48cc-972f-6fdc59d69bc7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b9783575-9dca-4006-a489-4f43198f4f1f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magellan RoadMate 5465T-LMB has lots of premium features, but it is missing voice-activated navigation, which you can find in competing GPS units at a similar price point.
