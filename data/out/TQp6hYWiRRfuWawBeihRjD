Depending on your fax service provider, you can even opt for advanced security options for extra protection. Here are some of the facts about sending online faxes safely.","<strong>Compared with Email</strong>","Email hacking is a much more common occurrence than the hacking of telephone lines, which are used to transmit faxes. Emails are also more easily forged. Anyone can type out an email and make it look as though someone else sent it, but only faxes can be handwritten and signed to ensure authenticity. Many industries that deal in sensitive information, such as the medical, legal and economic sectors, are choosing to use online fax instead of email when they can.","<strong>Compared with Printed Fax</strong>","There are many security benefits that come from using online fax over printed fax. Printed faxes from a fax machine take time to print out, but if left unattended, they can be read or stolen by anyone in the immediate area. In that case, the thief has a legally binding, printed document to use at his or her discretion. Instead of employees wasting their time watching a long fax print out, they can receive a fax online, where it is safely stored on their computers."]},"id":"a0de5f43-e482-4e25-8ab0-a736f1d23257","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Security Features</strong>","Online fax services have security features that allow you to safely send and receive faxes online.","<strong>SSL Encryption</strong>","One way your online faxes are kept safe is with SSL encryption. This type of encryption protects your personal information when you are using an internet browser. You can see an indicator of SSL encryption when the web address in your URL bar begins with &#34;https&#34; instead of just &#34;http.&#34;","When you receive faxes online, you will get an email alert with a link to your fax, which you can then open in a secure internet browser. From there, you can print, copy, and save the fax.","<strong>Confirmation Emails</strong>","In case you&#39;re worried about someone fraudulently using your online fax account to send faxes at your expense, many online fax services offer protection against that by using confirmation emails. Each time a fax is sent from your account, you will receive a confirmation email. If you ever get a confirmation email for a fax you didn&#39;t send, you ll know your account has been compromised. You can then change your password or contact support to suspend your account.","<strong>Customer Support</strong>","The best way to learn how to receive a fax online safely is by using the customer support features of the online fax service you choose. Many of them have how-to guides and blogs posted online for you to look through. You can also call or live chat with support staff if you have any questions about how to receive a fax online.","<strong>Which Internet Fax Service is the Most Secure?</strong>","Efax is probably the most secure online fax software. It offers SSL/PGP security, lets you sign and fax documents online, and offers a larger amount of secure online storage space than other online fax services. Other online fax providers have comparable security and are less expensive. Make sure to thoroughly research online fax services before you decide on which is best for you.","Now that you have some information on the security of online faxes, you can more easily find an online fax service provider that fits your needs. Once you make the switch, you can rest easy, knowing your faxes are safe and secure."]},"id":"dde8471b-5813-4b89-898b-2102df76216d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9420","url":"/is-internet-faxing-safe-how-to-send-and-receive-faxes-online-safely","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-22T22:05:07Z","datePublished":"2015-04-22T22:05:07Z","name":"Is Internet Faxing Safe?
