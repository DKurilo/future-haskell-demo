In that time, we’ve considered dozens of programs, copied hundreds of discs, and watched hours and hours of footage.","Our testing methodology was painstaking. We devoted a significant amount of time to inspecting the small details in copied footage to ascertain the quality of every copy. We also paid very close attention to each application’s interface, workflow and usability","As we used each program, we inspected its tools and tested how useful and reliable they are. We timed how long it takes each application to create an exact copy, compress content and save a disc’s image to a computer.","These data points, plus the individual experiences of our reviewers, informed our reviews and top choices. Reviewers held each program to the standard of “would I recommend this to a close friend?” If the answer was “no” for any product, it didn’t rank well.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","When we evaluated the best Blu-ray copiers, we subjected each program to a battery of tests.","Quality Tests<br/>We used each program to make an exact copy of a commercial Blu-ray disc. As part of our tests, we asked video experts to examine the quality of each copy we created to search for imperfections, such as pixelation, compression artifact, motion-blur and other defects. All the products we reviewed make perfect copies with no quality loss whatsoever.","Only one of the programs can compress commercial Blu-rays to fit onto smaller-capacity discs or DVDs. Again, our video experts watched these compressed copies and concluded that the degradation in picture quality was minimal. However, there were other issues that created inconsistent results – if you use Blu-ray copy software for compression, expect to burn a disc or two before you get the results you want.","Timing Tests<br/>Because Blu-ray files are so massive, making copies is time-consuming – especially when you make a disc-to-disc copy. We found it takes up to five hours to complete a full disc-to-disc copy. Similarly, compressing a Blu-ray movie to fit onto a smaller blank disc can take up to 10 hours. This is true no matter which Blu-ray copy software you choose.","Once an ISO file is on your computer, it takes significantly less time to burn it on another disc. We found that burning a new copy of a Blu-ray disc from a disc image takes an average of 45 minutes. So, if you plan to make multiple discs, it’s best to burn from an extracted ISO file rather than make individual disc-to-disc copies.","Ease of Use Tests<br/>Blu-ray disc copying is a technical, and often confusing, undertaking. The best Blu-ray copy software distills the process down to its simplest form. As such, we evaluated each product’s interface and workflow. We tracked how easy it is to start the copying process, extract disc images, compress content and burn new discs from an ISO file. Our results show that the programs we reviewed generally have simple processes, but some are geared more toward tech-savvy individuals, and casual user may experience a bit of a learning curve using them.","<strong>Key Features of Blu-ray Copy Software</strong>","We also used the following criteria find the best Blu-ray copy software:<br/><br/>How Much Does Blu-ray Copy Software Cost?<br/>You can pick up decent Blu-ray copy software free from several sources, but you won’t get the extra features that make the best programs stand out. The paid programs we reviewed cost $20 to $120. However, in our experience, you generally get the most out of your purchase at around $60. Anything above that hard to justify since there are cheaper and better options.","Copy<br/>Before any Blu-ray copy software can start duplicating, it must first bypass the anti-piracy encryptions found on nearly every commercial Blu-ray disc. Most products we reviewed can do this, and those that don&#39;t are limited to making copies of unencrypted discs. This drastically limits the application&#39;s usefulness.","The best Blu-ray copy software not only makes disc-to-disc copies, but it also extracts and saves disc images to your computer. You should also be able to burn an extracted ISO file onto a blank disc without needing the original.<br/><br/>Output<br/>All the products we reviewed created an exact copy of our test Blu-ray disc. So, no matter which product you choose, you can make exact 1:1 copies of your movies.","Blank Blu-ray discs come in three sizes: 25GB, 50GB and 100GB. Each is more expensive than the last. A spindle of 25GB blank discs costs about $50, while 50GB and 100GB versions cost $100 or more. Since most commercial Blu-ray discs are 50GB or 100GB, making exact copies of your movie library can be expensive.","The best applications can compress larger commercial discs onto smaller-capacity, less-expensive discs. It’s also useful when you can shrink your Blu-rays to fit on DVDs, especially if you want to watch movies where a Blu-ray player isn’t available. However, since compression often causes quality loss, know that you&#39;re not getting all the Blu-ray goodness from the original disc when using this option.","Customization<br/>The best Blu-ray copiers don&#39;t limit you to making rote copies of your discs. For example, our top pick, Blue-Cloner, lets you pick and choose which content you want to copy and burn onto a new disc. This is useful if you only want to copy a single special feature onto its own disc.","One of the most useful tools is a &#34;Movie Only&#34; option, which strips away everything on a disc except for the feature presentation. It is a great way to fit a Blu-ray movie onto a smaller blank disc; however, you may lose important features such as menus, chapter selection, subtitles and extra audio tracks.","Another feature worth mentioning lets you split the content found on a commercial disc onto two separate blank discs. This is a useful if you want to burn everything on your Blu-rays without paying more for high-capacity blank discs.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Each program we reviewed is relatively simple and easy enough for anyone to use, regardless of computer skill level. In the rare case you need assistance, you can consult the FAQs section on the software&#39;s official website – all the programs we tested offer this resource.","If the FAQs don&#39;t have the answer you&#39;re looking for, you can email the company and will usually receive a response within 24 to 72 hours. Some companies offer live chat on their websites, which you can use to talk to a customer service representative immediately.","Several companies that make Blu-ray copy software have official social media accounts. Facebook and Twitter are the most popular platforms, and you can contact reps on them for solutions to simple problems.","<strong>Best Free Blu-ray Copy Software</strong>","If you don&#39;t want to pay to back up and copy Blu-ray discs, you should check out <a href=\"/aurora-review\">Aurora Blu-ray Copy</a>. It’s the most basic program we reviewed and the simplest to use. It produces exact 1:1 copies of Blu-ray discs as well as every other program we reviewed.

For example, it can&#39;t compress a Blu-ray movie to fit on a smaller-capacity blank disc or compress it down to burn onto a DVD.
