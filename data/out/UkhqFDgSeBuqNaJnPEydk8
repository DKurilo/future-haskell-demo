For a heavy-duty shop vac, the average horsepower is between 5 to 6, so 6.5 is pretty amazing.

The wet/dry vac allows you to go from picking up dust and dirt from installing sheetrock in your upstairs to sucking up flooding in your basement.","This garage vacuum can transform into a 180 MPH blower as well, so you can easily move from the inside to the outside and take care of business. There’s no need to buy a leaf blower to keep debris off your sidewalk, driveway or around your pool and deck area, as the WD1680 has got it covered.","With 6.5 horsepower and 180 MPH blowing capabilities, the shop vac could possibly set all of the car alarms off in your neighborhood when you turn it on – that is, if it wasn’t for Ridgid’s added Scroll Noise Reduction feature. Now, this won’t block out the sound of the vacuum totally, so we definitely don’t recommend using it while your neighbors are trying to sleep."]},"id":"58b8b6b2-8038-471a-95b9-fed5b9d8d8a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/4jCA4m4i4tY7qeYE5YZzWb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56545-ridgid-wd16801.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4jCA4m4i4tY7qeYE5YZzWb.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4jCA4m4i4tY7qeYE5YZzWb","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4jCA4m4i4tY7qeYE5YZzWb.jpg","alt":""},"id":"566e6671-e3e9-4c60-a715-9bb28d01fb6d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ridgid WD1680 comes with a 7-foot hose, two extension wands and one utility nozzle.
