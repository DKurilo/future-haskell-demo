We were able to unpack, setup and begin using this tool within 10 minutes of opening the box. The instructions are clear, and all you do is fill it with oil, plug it in and pull the trigger. You don’t have to worry about fuel mixtures or recoil cords. And when you’re done cutting, it’s a breeze to clean and store.
