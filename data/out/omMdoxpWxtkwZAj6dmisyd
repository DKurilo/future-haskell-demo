Not only will you have plenty of customizable features to clean, sanitize and dry your dishes, but you will also benefit from a very energy-efficient dishwasher.","The sound level on this dishwasher is 50 decibels, which is relatively quiet, but it&#39;s higher than many competing dishwashers. You get an impressive nine wash cycles on this dishwasher, which is the most out of all the units in our comparison. You also get four additional wash options. The three spray arms can clean up to 14 place settings.","Of its nine wash cycles, the stemware wash cycle and eco-friendly wash cycle are both impressive. The stemware cycle is designed for china, crystal and other extremely delicate dishes and it will leave them spotless. The eco wash cycle will use less time and water to wash pre-rinsed and lightly soiled dishes.","This built-in dishwasher unit also features an eco-friendly drying function. Along with the heated dry option, this Electrolux dishwasher also includes an air dry option, which is more energy efficient than the standard heated dry option because the heating element, which consumes a lot of energy, isn’t used. According to its EnergyGuide, this dishwasher is estimated to cost you $29 annually and is estimated to consume 272 kilowatt-hours every year. These are low numbers, and they make this unit very energy efficient.","Electrolux provides excellent warranty coverage for its dishwashers. For the first year, this unit&#39;s labor and parts are covered. The racks and electronics are under warranty for the first five years you own the dishwasher, and a lifetime warranty covers the dishwasher&#39;s tub and door liner.
