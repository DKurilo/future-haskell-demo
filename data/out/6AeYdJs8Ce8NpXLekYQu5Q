Their sound quality is above average and the Bluetooth will let you go up to 33 feet away from the paired device, but once you reach about 20 feet away, you will start to notice some static coming from the earbuds.","There are five sets of rubber cushions to choose from to help with comfort. However, even though they are designed to be lightweight, the distribution of that weight grows to be a little uncomfortable after a while.","The SF600 small wireless earbuds are designed with hydrophobic mesh and silicon seals, which keep moisture out. This works with heavy sweat or light rain. These earbuds make it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks and pause or play music. There is a multifunction button that houses most of the controls.","We love that you can get almost seven hours of continuous use from these wireless earbuds before you have to charge them. Most of this use is talk time because that uses up the battery more quickly than listening to music does. You can just plug them in using a USB cable, and it takes two hours to fully charge them.","Since the SF600 earbuds are made from Kevlar, they are lightweight and very durable. However, it can be hard to put these in your ears because they are not as flexible as other earbuds. Over longer periods of use, the top of your ears can feel heavy and pinched, and the only cure is taking them off. The neckband is comfortable and doesn’t really sit on your neck, allowing free movement.","Motorola offers a one-year warranty for the SF600, and there are PDF user guides to help you use the Bluetooth earbuds. You can talk to an agent on the telephone or through the live chat feature on the site for any technical support."]},"id":"2f80b5ec-b7c7-4968-97ba-96182060c1da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9c30c0af-f33c-4bbd-a884-98a666b9194d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sound quality and the simple layout of the controls make the Motorola SF600 earbuds a great pick for anyone looking to improve their music listening experience with wireless devices.
