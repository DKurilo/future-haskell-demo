You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","KidGPS is a small, basic <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS tracker</a> that lets you track your child’s whereabouts in real time, whenever you want. While it lacks many common features and functions found in the best GPS trackers, it does the bare minimum without much fuss. It has great battery life, and its monthly subscription fee won’t put a large dent in your wallet.","You can view all details about the tracker from the free companion smartphone app. Once you log in to this fairly intuitive app, you can view the tracker’s current location and recent history. You can even see your child’s location superimposed over a map from Google Maps.","The app can send push notifications to your phone to let you know when your child gets home safely and provides you with a variety of additional alerts, including a low-battery alert. You can also set up digital perimeters, called a geofence, around certain areas like your house, their friend’s house or their school. Any time your child enters or exits that zone, you’ll receive an alert.","Battery life expectancy for the KidGPS is good, although it doesn’t surpass some other units in our review. On a single charge, and with the recommended minimum use, it can last for up to five days. This is convenient, as you don’t have to worry about charging it every single night. However, it should be noted that the more frequently you check the device’s location, the faster the battery will drain.","If your child feels threatened or needs your help, they can press the large panic button that’s located on the front of the device. Physically, it does not feel as high quality as many of the other trackers we reviewed, so it may not be the best option for your active or rough-and-tumble child. Additionally, it is not water-resistant, so it can’t be used in the rain or sprinklers.","Technical support for the device is available via email; the company doesn’t provide live chat or telephone contact options. KidGPS ships with a one-year manufacturer warranty. The service subscription goes through T-Mobile, and considering the device’s low initial purchase price and its low monthly subscription cost, it’s one of the most affordable GPS trackers available."]},"id":"4ff85745-dd19-4dd3-af10-10305a4d06f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"31f7a4cc-e7ce-4637-9a88-8b6b7c025152","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KidGPS is a basic GPS tracking device, without any real standout features.
