Its <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-dental-insurance\">dental insurance</a> plans are varied, including plans that are cheaper and have copays, and plans that cover preventive care 100 percent. However, it has long waiting periods for certain procedures, and it doesn&#39;t cover certain pre-existing conditions. In addition, despite having lots of options in each region, the premiums are more expensive than most insurance providers.","Since every region is different, I got quotes for individuals, couples and families in each region of the U.S. and evaluated the available plans. On average, UnitedHealthcare’s plans are a bit on the expensive side. That said, the plans aren’t as expensive as some. For example, an individual pays about $52 for comprehensive coverage with a $1,200 annual limit with UnitedHealthcare. However, you’d pay nearly $84 for similar coverage from <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/spirit-dental-and-vision-review\">Spirit Dental</a>.","The best feature of UnitedHealthcare is the coverage options. In each region, this provider had 6 to 10 plans, except for the East, which had no plans. These plans varied a lot in the maximum annual limits and deductibles. The advantage of so many options is it provides you with a way to fit your budget to your needed coverage. This also allows the range of premiums to be among the most affordable at any level, though never the best.","While you can get preventive services right away, basic procedures, such as fillings, restorations and extractions, require a four- to six-month wait. Major services, like root canals, are also not covered in the first year. Dentures and bridges are only covered for teeth lost while you have been on UnitedHealthcare&#39;s insurance. So, if you were born without certain teeth, this insurance company does not reimburse you to replace them. This could be an issue for some people. Additionally, many restorative works, like crowns, can only be replaced once every five years.","This service does offer an advantage for large families. The family deductible caps out at $150 a year, regardless of whether you have one child or 10. However, it does not cover orthodontia, so you need supplemental insurance should any of your children need braces.  ","The website is not as conveniently organized as others we reviewed. There are many pages that all have a little information. And when you enter the information for a dental insurance quote, it provides health insurance quotes first, which is confusing. You have to click on the dental tab to find the quotes you’re looking for. Under the plans, you can view the details of each plan."]},"id":"dcf56f9f-9758-4921-9d27-d6580b6ba5ba","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64114","url":"/united-healthcare-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-09T19:11:49Z","datePublished":"2015-04-09T19:11:49Z","name":"UnitedHealthcare","synopsis":"UnitedHealthcare offers healthcare services with large networks and multiple plan options.
