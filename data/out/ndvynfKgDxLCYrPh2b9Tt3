You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The SuctionSeal Pet is a bagless <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum cleaner</a> that is ideal for those who loves pets but not the hair. This machine comes with a12-amp motor and a HEPA filter designed specifically to eliminate pet odor.","We like that this vacuum cleaner has direct air suction. Many cleaners move dirt in a horizontal path that travels along the sides of the machine then follows a curved path to the container. Dirt and hair can stick in the bends of machines, but this vacuum cleaner lifts the air straight up so that does not happen.","This vacuum cleaner has a suction plate that creates a seal between the cleaner and the floor. The company calls it SuctionSeal Technology, and it consists of a polycarbonate plate built into the front of the machine. As you move across carpeting or hard floors, the plate raises and lowers, creating a seal. This maximizes suction when you are transitioning from surface to surface. It is especially helpful when you move from a higher to lower level. The plate adjusts down, allowing the machine to maintain suction as the level changes, so the cleaner does not scatter dirt across your kitchen floor. You can also switch the roller brush off so that it does not scratch your hardwood floors.","The Eureka Suction Seal has an automatic height adjustment and transitions easily from tall carpets to flat surfaces. Because this upright vacuum is equipped with an auto shut of feature, if you run over an object, the machine will shut off automatically, preventing motor damage.","This upright vacuum has an awkward shape, making it difficult to maneuver. The handle does not lie flat, which prevents the machine from reaching under furniture. You will have to move objects like coffee tables to vacuum under them. The power cord length is a little short at 27 feet. We prefer longer cords so that you can cover larger spaces without stopping to switch outlets.","This machine is equipped with a pet upholstery brush that is designed to extract pet hair from carpet. It uses adhesive microfibers instead of bristles to attract and capture hair. In addition, an air-driven PET Power Paw tool removes pet hairs. The tools connect to the back of the machine so they are easy to find, and the 12-foot hose give it an extra-long reach for above-floor cleaning.","Everything you need for help and support is at your fingertips on the Eureka website. You will find FAQs, videos, guides, manuals and a service locator. There is a live chat feature, as well as a contact phone number and email address. We found it easy to get answers from live agents. Eureka backs this cleaner with a three-year warranty and has service centers to support its products."]},"id":"c9404474-7cd8-4e2e-8446-526432fd7c86","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"843da1c6-5930-4568-a9f6-3dd9205bd4fc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With a powerful suction motor for vacuuming and cleaning tools designed specifically for separating pet hair from your couch, the Eureka SuctionSeal Pet is an efficient vacuum cleaner that will make fast work out of an otherwise tedious chore."]},"id":"23ff25ab-defb-47c8-a64b-8e7ccef912c6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56883","url":"/eureka-suction-seal-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-28T14:18:05Z","datePublished":"2013-06-28T14:18:05Z","name":"Eureka SuctionSeal PET AS1104A","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
