You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Best Jewelry Supply&#39;s <a href=\"/best-watch-repair-kits\">Watch Repair Tool Kit</a> offers you the tools to make simple repairs, such as changing a battery and repairing or replacing a watchband or sizing a metal watchband. You can also use these watch tools to perform tasks on other items that contain small screws or require batteries. Small electronic devices, toys and other items with small screws are difficult to open without the proper size of screwdriver to accomplish the job, and watch tools make it easier.","Watchmakers&#39; tools let you take care of small watch repair jobs quickly, and the design of the case holders prevents damage to your watches while you are working. The screwdrivers fit the small screws well and prevent the screw slots from stripping, which can occur when using larger screwdrivers. Taking a watch or bracelet to a jewelry store takes time to drop it off and pick it up, not to mention the expense. These tools are also useful to tighten or replace screws in your eyeglasses.","This watch repair kit consists of 38 pieces. It includes two screwdrivers in sizes of 0.8 and 1.0 millimeters, respectively. You also receive a case back opener and watch case holder, a link remover, three sizes of pin punches to remove watch pins and a spring bar tool. There is a 7.5-inch nylon hammer with replacement face, tweezers, a dust blower, loupe, and cleaning cloth, among other items. The tools are made of metal and plastic for longevity and durability. The watch tools come in a plastic bag, and no case is included with this kit.","Not only is it annoying to have a poorly fitting watch or bracelet, but you run the risk of it dropping and losing it. A properly fitting watch or bracelet not only looks better, it helps you avoid that risk. You can use these watch tools to make repairs or adjustments on link bracelets, change a watch battery or clean your watch, and remove links from metal watchbands or change watchbands. You can also use the tools for changing the batteries on other devices that use small screws.","The Best Jewelry Supply Watch Repair Tool Kit is a 38-piece, reasonably priced watch tool kit that comes with tools you can use for many purposes other than making watch repairs. If you are searching for an all-inclusive kit to give you many options, this one may be worth checking out to see if it meets your needs."]},"id":"a7441130-a32c-48d1-9d14-998116cfb16d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64069","url":"/jewelry-supply-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-09T15:34:09Z","datePublished":"2015-04-09T15:34:09Z","name":"Best Jewelry Supply Watch Repair Tool Kit","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison becuase it has been replace by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison becuase it has been replace by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-09T15:34:09Z","id":"3PMDExMM6RDYkeWHkKBREB","meta":{"title":"Best Jewelry Supply Watch Repair Tool Kit Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Best Jewelry Supply.
