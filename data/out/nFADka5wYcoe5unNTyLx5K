You need to be able to accept credit and debit cards, but navigating the landscape of processors can be confusing since there are many pricing models and complex contracts. The first step is to take stock of your business and what you need. Figure out how many card sales you make and decide if you need mobile processing. ","Next, call several processing companies to get quotes. Some, but not all, processing companies list their prices online. And even then, most companies base pricing on your sales volume and average ticket size. By comparing different offers, you can better gauge what you’ll end up paying and may even be able to bargain down the costs.","<strong>What Are the Costs?</strong>","Cost is one of the biggest influencers as you choose a credit card processor. The costs are broken into two categories: processing rate and fees. The processing rate is usually a percentage of each sale along with a small transaction fee. Most rates range from 2 to 4 percent of each transaction, though this is may vary based on your monthly volume, average ticket size and what industry you’re in. There are multiple pricing options, including tiered, interchange plus and flat rate. ","Tiered pricing is the most common structure, though experts criticize it for its lack of transparency. In this structure, transactions are divided into several tiers based on the type of card used and whether the card is present or keyed in. When you call for quotes, processors tend to disclose the rate for qualified debit transactions, which are the lowest. Be sure to get information about all the tiers and find out which transactions qualify for those tiers. If you have a lot of debit card transactions, this pricing model may good for you.","Most experts prefer the interchange-plus pricing model, which adds a markup to the interchange rates charged by the credit card companies. This makes it more transparent and simpler than a tiered pricing model. You may need to prod the processor to give you a quote for this model, and some require you to process through them for a while before you can use interchange-plus rates.","Flat-rate pricing is the simplest – you just pay a fixed percentage of each transaction or a percentage of each transaction plus a small transaction fee. This pricing structure is probably best for small businesses with less than $2,500 a month in sales as well as for businesses with fewer credit card transactions. This is the pricing structure often offered by mobile processors like Square, and it&#39;s quicker to set up and tends to not have as many fees as others. However, it isn’t ideal for businesses with high sales volumes because the transaction fee is higher than in other pricing models.","In addition to processing costs, there are fees. The most common are monthly fees, fees for PCI compliance, monthly minimums and various network fees the processor may pass on to you. Some processors may also try to charge fees for memberships, cancellation and other vague services. Read through your contract before you sign and ask your sales rep if any of those fees can be waived.","<strong>What About Equipment?</strong>","Most processing companies offer free equipment, such as a terminal, when you sign a contract, or they allow you to borrow the equipment you need. When possible, buy the equipment outright. It may increase your upfront costs, but free offers tend to require you to sign long-term contracts and leasing equipment can be quite costly. ","If you opt for a free offer, look for a one-year contract the becomes a month-to-month contract after the first year. Also, check if you have to pay the full cost plus any cancellation fees if you change processors before the end of the contract. ","A free placement program is a little different – you get the equipment for free, but when the contract expires or you switch processors, you must return it. Free placement programs have additional costs and monthly minimums you’re expected to meet.","Processors also often push leasing. They may say it&#39;s like paying for a cell phone plan, but in the long run, you will end up paying more than if you’d bought the equipment outright. Most equipment comes with warranties or insurance, so you can replace it if it breaks, which is an advantage touted by sales reps trying to get you to lease."]},"id":"dcbaba83-f087-44cc-9ef7-f58b97ca6da3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_380","url":"/best-credit-card-processing","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"mark-pickavance","url":"/author/mark-pickavance","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Mark Pickavance","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"n9S2XBd3xtppkvZfYxDe6U","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-06T13:48:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-06T13:48:00Z","name":"Best Credit Card Processing Services of 2019","synopsis":"Whether you're looking for low fees or flexibility, our suggestions will help you find the credit card processing service that works for your small business.","review":{},"strapline":"Whether you're looking for low fees or flexibility, our suggestions will help you find the credit card processing service that works for your small business.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-15T15:29:05Z","id":"nFADka5wYcoe5unNTyLx5K","meta":{"title":"Best Credit Card Processing Services 2019 | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Whether you're looking for low fees or flexibility, our suggestions will help you find the credit card processing service that works for your small business."},"products":[{"slug":"helcim","url":"/product/helcim","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","name":"Helcim","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"C2URFqN45f3WsNmZxRnJWf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"stripe","url":"/product/stripe","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","name":"Stripe","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"pSzYMy7p6ZvJtubCPhoQES","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"square","url":"/product/square","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","name":"Square","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"rDKxCYJncvoST4NKTq8udj","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"paypal","url":"/product/paypal","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","name":"PayPal","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"BZxhG4YjA9wGY6Sw3sLegV","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"payment-depot","url":"/product/payment-depot","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","name":"Payment Depot","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"o2NCGLurWVfurjvzKvrTuU","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"flagship-merchant-services","url":"/product/flagship-merchant-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","name":"Flagship Merchant Services","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"6E5fr5dXSetCTFQZhViZAQ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/XzEi4q2pEMu6zSz6uZGXdE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Credit-Card-Processing-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/2/P/824353/original/Hero-Credit-Card-Processing-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"XzEi4q2pEMu6zSz6uZGXdE","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XzEi4q2pEMu6zSz6uZGXdE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Credit Card Processing Services of 2019","description":"Whether you're looking for low fees or flexibility, our suggestions will help you find the credit card processing service that works for your small business."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/XzEi4q2pEMu6zSz6uZGXdE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Credit-Card-Processing-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/2/P/824353/original/Hero-Credit-Card-Processing-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:54Z","id":"XzEi4q2pEMu6zSz6uZGXdE","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XzEi4q2pEMu6zSz6uZGXdE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Credit Card Processing Services of 2019","description":"Whether you're looking for low fees or flexibility, our suggestions will help you find the credit card processing service that works for your small business."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[]}
