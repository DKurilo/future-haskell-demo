Although there are oil-less turkey fryers available, they are less likely to produce the crispy, crunchy exterior and tender interior of oil-fried turkey. As a result, we chose oil fryers for our recommendations, since these seem to be the most popular and preferred models on the market.","We also watched user videos to see how real people work with these devices, which requires a measure of care to avoid accidental burns or fires.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We spent 40 hours researching turkey fryers, investigating each model to find the best on the market. We wanted to find excellent machines that offer superb frying capabilities, as well as models with the best safety measures built into the design. We also looked for convenience features that are nice to have but not essential, especially when compared to the importance of safety measures.","We looked at both indoor and outdoor fryers since both types are popular with consumers, although one may be a better choice than the other, depending on your specific circumstances. For example, if you live in a condo complex and have a tiny patio, an outdoor fryer might not work especially well in such a small space. But a countertop turkey fryer takes up little space and can still yield a succulent and well-cooked bird.","We found general information about turkey fryers on manufacturers’ websites and read through product reviews wherever we could find them. We also looked for specific information about different models that set them apart from others, whether that’s an automatic shutoff feature, a lifter to safely remove an already-cooked turkey or lid vents that help release steam.","Since safety is so important when it comes to turkey fryers, we checked to see what some cooking experts had to say. Daniel Gritzer, in the online publication <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/\">Serious Eats,</a> says deep frying a turkey “can deliver an incredibly juicy bird with the crispiest skin imaginable.” However, he cautions that you must keep children and pets completely away from the undertaking, read the manufacturer’s instructions first, and even if the weather’s cold, plan to stick by the fryer and enlist the help of others if you need to go indoors. “Responsible turkey fryers do not leave things unattended.”","A <a href=\"https://blog.plymouthrock.com/avoid-devastating-turkey-fryer-mistakes/\">blog produced by Plymouth Rock Assurance</a> has the following helpful tips:","Be sure you know how to properly use your fryer and review the safety instructions that came with it. Here’s a helpful list of what you should do:"]},"id":"2d27891c-6068-4bcb-9231-3f12034e7f70","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Completely defrost your turkey and remove excess liquids before frying it.","Cook your bird outside, on a flat surface and in an open area away from structures or combustible items.","Be sure the weather is ideal – no rain or snow.","Be wary of overfilling your fryer with oil.","Use extra caution when lowering or raising your turkey from the pot.","Have a fire extinguisher ready at all times."],"type":"ul"},"id":"1b5bad9b-2bde-4312-a1d8-abe11f3ea5f5","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How Much Does a Turkey Fryer Cost?</strong>","A good turkey fryer will cost you between $100 and $200 depending on its capacity, as well as the number of extra features and accessories that come with it. There isn’t much price difference between propane and electric heated fryers, though if you choose a propane model you’ll need to continually refill the propane. The price of a propane tank varies depending on where you live, but it’s usually between $5 and $10 and holds enough gas to fry four turkeys.","<strong>Can I Mix Different Oils in a Turkey Fryer?</strong>","It is possible to mix different oils together – like peanut oil and vegetable oil – for deep frying any foods, including turkeys. However, you will need to set your turkey fryer to a lower cooking temperature to avoid burning the oil, which will also affect the overall cook time.","It all has to do with the smoke point of each oil, or how hot the oil has to get before it starts to smoke, or burn, and become dangerous. Vegetable oil has a smoke point of 428 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius); peanut oil, however, has a smoke point of 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).  Because of the higher smoke point, you cook your turkey at a higher temperature in vegetable oil, which also cuts down on the overall cook time.","If you do combine vegetable and peanut oils, you’ll need to set the fryer at a lower temperature to avoid reaching the peanut oil’s smoke point. You will also want to adjust the cook time a little since it will take longer to fry – about 5 minutes more per pound – at the lower temperature. Most recipes recommend frying your turkey for 3.5 minutes per pound and assume you are using vegetable oil.","<strong>What Features to Look for in a Turkey Fryer?</strong>","Frying Capabilities<br/>In our research, we checked the overall capacity of each fryer, which is measured in quarts, along with the maximum turkey size, in pounds, that each fryer could handle. We also looked at the amount of oil needed each time you use the fryer and the heating ability, measured in British thermal units.","Safety Features<br/>Turkey frying can be quite dangerous because you’re working with a lot of hot oil, but many turkey fryers are equipped with safety features. We looked to see whether each unit had an auto shutoff, a vented lid, a lifter to help remove the turkey after cooking it, a cooking basket and a stand. Most turkey fryers will have some of these features, while the best will have all of them. The most significant safety feature you should seek in a turkey fryer is an auto shutoff function, which keeps it from overheating and potentially causing a fire and injuries.","Convenience<br/>Many turkey fryers come with some useful features that make cooking a lot easier. Some fryers have built-in extras such as a timer, a thermostat, indicator lights or a drain valve, all of which help either during the cooking process or, in the case of the drain valve, with cleanup.","<br/>"]},"id":"65248c79-578f-4098-9f5c-36023c32fd36","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"e7fd27ee-4350-4af1-8419-df08b3994026","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/masterbuilt-butterball-xl-review\">Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618</a>","<a href=\"/masterbuilt-butterball-review\">Masterbuilt Butterball Electric Fryer MB23010118</a>","<a href=\"/bayou-review\">Bayou Classic 32 Qt.</a>","<a href=\"/cabelas-review\">Cabela’s Ultimate</a>","<a href=\"/king-kooker-review\">King Kooker 1265BF3</a>","<a href=\"/king-kooker-ss1267sbsp-review\">King Kooker SS1267SBSP</a>","<a href=\"/bass-pro-shops-review\">Bass Pro Shops 1631023</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f1e7f99b-86d8-490b-b40a-f50e6d8fbf53","type":"list"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/masterbuilt-butterball-xl-review\">Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618</a>","<a href=\"/masterbuilt-butterball-review\">Masterbuilt Butterball Electric Fryer MB23010118</a>","<a href=\"/bayou-review\">Bayou Classic 32 Qt.</a>","<a href=\"/cabelas-review\">Cabela’s Ultimate</a>","<a href=\"/king-kooker-review\">King Kooker 1265BF3</a>","<a href=\"/king-kooker-ss1267sbsp-review\">King Kooker SS1267SBSP</a>","<a href=\"/bass-pro-shops-review\">Bass Pro Shops 1631023</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f1e7f99b-86d8-490b-b40a-f50e6d8fbf53","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_185","url":"/best-turkey-fryers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T21:48:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T21:48:00Z","name":"Best Turkey Fryers of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best turkey fryers (electric and propane) to cook a bird quickly and make this Thanksgiving or Christmas one for the scrapbooks.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best turkey fryers (electric and propane) to cook a bird quickly and make this Thanksgiving or Christmas one for the scrapbooks.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-17T20:48:19Z","id":"57kMpf4suRnkZgt5Y3vgdm","meta":{"title":"The 10 Best Turkey Fryers of 2019 (Including Indoor & Outdoor Fryers)","description":"Here are the best turkey fryers (electric and propane) to cook a bird quickly and make this Thanksgiving or Christmas one for the scrapbooks."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/VLvLNJEBQfUGshJH89GdJ5.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Turkey-Fryers-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/O/4/744772/original/Hero-Turkey-Fryers-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","id":"VLvLNJEBQfUGshJH89GdJ5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VLvLNJEBQfUGshJH89GdJ5.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Turkey Fryers of 2019","description":"Here are the best turkey fryers (electric and propane) to cook a bird quickly and make this Thanksgiving or Christmas one for the scrapbooks."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/VLvLNJEBQfUGshJH89GdJ5.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Turkey-Fryers-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/O/4/744772/original/Hero-Turkey-Fryers-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","id":"VLvLNJEBQfUGshJH89GdJ5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VLvLNJEBQfUGshJH89GdJ5.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Turkey Fryers of 2019","description":"Here are the best turkey fryers (electric and propane) to cook a bird quickly and make this Thanksgiving or Christmas one for the scrapbooks."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"fryers","url":"/kitchen/fryers","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","name":"Fryers","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:56Z","id":"siiTxQJ6GH7gGxZEDS2JJd","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
