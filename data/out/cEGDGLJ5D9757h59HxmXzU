The adjustable band makes it easy to customize the light to your head, ensuring long-term comfort when you&#39;re running for hours at a time. This <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-running-headlamps\">running headlamp</a> is lightweight and doesn&#39;t shift or jostle on your head once you put it on.","The light itself is adaptive and reactive, so the beam size and intensity adjust based on the ambient light. The light has a range of 7 to 170 lumens, and the beam extends from 2 to 65 meters, depending on local conditions. In practical terms, this means that it dims when you&#39;re faced with oncoming cars as you jog along the side of a road, creates a wide beam while you&#39;re running in a dark area to give you optimal visuals of the path ahead and turns into a point beam when you stop to read a map. This all prevents your eyes from constantly having to adjust to different light conditions and conserves battery life.","You can also use the optional operating system to program the light before your run or just leave it in constant mode if you don&#39;t need the reactive light. A red light option helps prevent eye strain when you&#39;re reading handwritten trail notes or a guidebook in the dark.","This running headlight has two control buttons on the front. However, they can be difficult to operate, especially if you&#39;re wearing gloves. The whole unit is water resistant, so splashes and rain won&#39;t damage it, but it shouldn&#39;t be submersed in water. The light portion can be removed to let you clean the fabric headband. A lock function prevents you from accidentally turning the light on during storage and draining the battery.","This running headlamp comes with an 1800 mAh Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery that charges in about 4.5 hours via USB, so you can set it charging overnight or while you are at work. At maximum power, the battery lasts 3.5 hours, which stretches out to a 12-hour battery life if you aren&#39;t using it consistently at full power.","The Petzl Tikka R+ headlamp works well for long-distance running, triathlons and trail running because of its adaptive lighting technology and comfortable design. However, its variety of features means it&#39;s more expensive than more basic running headlamps."]},"id":"4c4d8a5c-822b-4380-833e-53315ef896c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62533","url":"/petzl-tikka-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:41:56Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:41:56Z","name":"Petzl Tikka R+","synopsis":"The Petzl Tikka R+ headlamp is designed for serious runners.
