He shared with me the most important features of a crank radio to consider before adding one to your preparedness kit. Those features include battery operation, an efficient hand crank, solar panel and a USB port for charging mobile devices. He also emphasized the need for an emergency radio to receive weather alerts from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is included with every radio we tested.","Steve told me the Red Cross recently sent a carton of crank radios to Puerto Rico nearly a year after Hurricane Irma ravaged the island because the infrastructure is still in need of remote weather reports and alternative sources of energy.

Radios with flashlights, sirens and Bluetooth connectivity are more expensive, but eliminate the need for multiple devices in your backcountry or emergency preparedness kit. The best crank radios we tested cost around $85. If you add the cost of a $10 flashlight, $20 battery pack and a $15 solar charger, a more feature-packed crank radio saves money and space in your kit.","<strong>Crank Radio: What Else to Look For </strong>","In its most basic form, a crank radio is a simple handheld device that receives AM and FM signals and can be powered by a hand crank. However, the best models are more than that – they are survival tools. You should look for a crank radio that has as many survival features as possible, is built to be durable and comes from a manufacturer with great support.","SAME Alerts<br/>Every crank radio can pick up all seven NOAA weather alert stations. However, each station is geographically dependent, so you can only pick up one at a time, depending on where you are. The stations provide warnings for severe weather like tornados, hurricanes and flash floods, but they cover large enough areas that you can receive an alert for conditions several states away.","As such, you should consider an emergency radio with SAME technology. With SAME, you enter your zip code and the radio alerts you to weather and environmental conditions in your county.","Emergency Preparedness<br/>You should look for a radio with survival features like a flashlight, siren, compass, dog whistle and a mobile device charger. Every tool you have available in a survival situation is important, and these features can help you find your way and get your bearings if you&#39;re lost. They also attract attention if you need help and keep you connected to your phone.","Since these radios are designed to help you survive an emergency, they need to be able to withstand rough conditions. The best models are water-resistant and can survive bumps, drops and jostles. Your radio needs to be able to handle the weather, especially while you&#39;re camping.","Help &amp; Support<br/>When we evaluate any electronic device, we like to look in to the kinds of help and support the manufacturer offers. After you purchase your radio, it’s important to have access to help if something goes amiss. The manufacturers we tested have a combination of email and phone support, FAQs pages, and user forums.","<strong>Portable Battery Banks </strong>","The best crank radios we tested have solar cells and hand cranks to charge the internal battery and allow you to hear weather alerts. However, the fastest way to charge a battery in a crank radio is to plug it into a wall socket or power bank with a USB port. Here are some of our favorite mobile power banks to add to your emergency-preparedness kit.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-20100-Capacity-Technology/dp/B00X5RV14Y/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Anker PowerCore</a><br/>This portable power bank is about the size of a smartphone and has a 20,100-mAh battery that can fully charge a crank radio or other mobile devices more than six times. It has two USB outputs that let you quickly charge a pair of devices simultaneously, as well as a micro-USB port for recharging. The Anker PowerCore weighs just over 12 ounces, which is a bit heavy for a backpacking trip but light enough for most emergency-preparedness situations. It takes about 10 hours to fully charge the Anker PowerCore using a wall socket, and there are four indicator lights on the front panel that tell you how much charge is left.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Charger-RAVPower-6700mAh-External/dp/B00Y2PX4YI/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">RAVPower Portable Power Bank</a><br/>If you want a more portable device, this battery bank is a good choice. The RAVPower Portable Power Bank is about the size of a credit card and can fully charge a phone almost three times on a single charge. The 6,700-mAh battery has a voltage control chip that automatically adjusts for the connected device, as well as iSmart technology that detects the optimal current for the devices and maximizes the charging speed. This battery bank has only one USB outlet, but the device reaches a full charge in less than 4 hours when plugged into a wall socket.","<br/><strong>More Emergency Preparedness Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"3f9100e4-fcde-4d76-9ff5-247fd99acecd","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-portable-generators\">The Best Portable Generators</a>","<a href=\"/best-food-storage-services\">The Best Food Storage Services</a>","<a href=\"/best-solar-phone-chargers\">The Best Solar Phone Chargers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b58a4944-be34-4cd4-b5ea-750e905f6c62","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f27164fd-b300-4f2c-a7e3-b490cba8eca3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/eton-frx-review\">Eton FRX5BT</a>","<a href=\"/runningsnail-review\">RunningSnail MD-090</a>","<a href=\"/eton-scorpion-review\">Eton Scorpion II</a>","<a href=\"/weatherx-wr-review\">WeatherX WR-383R</a>","<a href=\"/sangean-radio-review\">Sangean MMR-88</a>","<a href=\"/midland-er-review\">Midland ER 310</a>","<a href=\"/midland-er200-review\">Midland ER 210</a>","<a href=\"/esky-review\">Esky ES-CR01</a>","<a href=\"/kaito-voyager-radio-review\">Kaito Voyager Pro KA600</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"eaa3d292-2a20-41ba-9db9-390f52b21c24","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_26","url":"/best-crank-radios","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-28T18:37:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-28T18:37:00Z","name":"Best Crank Radios of 2019","synopsis":"To find the best crank radio, we tested three major features: the rechargeable battery, reception (in town and on a trail) and the speaker.","review":{},"strapline":"To find the best crank radio, we tested three major features: the rechargeable battery, reception (in town and on a trail) and the speaker.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-06T18:17:22Z","id":"zDju9RH76LQjF8iiwfmYcj","meta":{"title":"Best Emergency Radios of 2019 -
