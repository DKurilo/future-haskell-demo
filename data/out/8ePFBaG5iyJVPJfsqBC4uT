With this portable vinyl converter turntable you can convert your favorite records into a digital format. Once converted, you can transfer those golden oldies onto your iPod, MP3 player or other modern day music device.","On the turntable portion of the Sony USB Stereo Turntable there are several different gadgets just waiting to let you groove to the music of your favorite vinyl records. The speed selector and the 45 RPM adapter located on the bottom left of the machine allow you to flip back and forth between converting 45s and 33s as needed. There are buttons to start and stop play, buttons to lift the tone arm up and down and two slots in the back, one for the audio line and one for the USB jack. All in all, this turntable appears to be “tricked out” with all the right accessories. However, it is missing several key elements we think are necessary in any vinyl converter. It doesn’t include an area to control and adjust the pitch of the record. Of course you can edit the sound later, but when using the turntable as a plain ol&#39; record player, you are unable to play with the record’s pitch.","The best thing going for the Sony USB Stereo Turntable is the included software, Sound Forge Audio Studio LE. This software makes it easy to adjust sound settings while the record is converting. You can also effortlessly  edit tracks after conversion and transfer those songs to a CD or a portable MP3 player. The software can also be used for your other audio recording needs – voiceover tracks, instrument performances, custom audio effects and more. The turntable itself is overshadowed by the Sound Forge software. While the Sony USB Stereo Turntable can convert 33s and 45s with ease, it doesn’t have the settings available to convert a 78RPM record or cassette tapes like its competitors do. Additionally, you can’t record from the USB turntable to a Mac computer.","Sony includes several pages of informative, step-by-step instructions on everything you need to know about your new vinyl converter turntable. There is a manual instructing you how to install the Sound Forge Audio Studio LE software and how to care for and clean your vinyl converter turntable. The manual even includes a diagram of how each piece should be placed and connected. An additional document explains how to record your record’s audio tracks to your computer.","The Sony USB Stereo Turntable includes the following items:"]},"id":"beeeba63-639e-480b-bf51-eb611e85714b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Dustcover","Slipmat","45 RPM adapter","USB cable"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6e95c170-734b-42d2-a2b6-45b6ff379ebb","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sony also includes a one-year warranty, guaranteeing the device against defects in material or workmanship for up to one year."]},"id":"b706b2d4-b6c8-467c-a883-71956f8c630b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"87e43f9c-e00a-46ab-8642-4feb7b88a7fb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sony’s USB Stereo Turntable is a quality piece of machinery that will effectively transfer your vinyl records into a digital format.
