wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I first downloaded ComiPo!, especially since the official website and interface look like they were made in the ‘90s. However, once I started testing, this software truly blew me away with how many options it offered and how easy it is. If you&#39;re looking for <a href=\"/best-comic-book-software\">comic book software</a> but don&#39;t have time to draw or don&#39;t have a lot of confidence in your artistic abilities, this software is the perfect option for you to dabble in the comic book world; especially if you are a manga fan. The interface is super simple and the 3D characters let you get just about any pose and any angle you want.","Since this program focuses on customizing premade characters, there are no paint brushes, pencils or other drawing tools. This also means it isn&#39;t a good program to use with a graphics tablet. Fortunately, the various elements you place on your comic panels are listed in layers. During my testing, I was able to select and adjust specific parts of my scene without ruining everything else.","There are only five premade characters, including the titular character ComiPo herself, but I made these characters my own by changing everything from hairstyle and accessories to poses and specific expressions. I was even able to save my character creations to the preset list so they were ready to use whenever I needed them. You simply drag and drop the character you want to use into a panel and then go from there.","To position your characters, simply choose a pose from the library and then use your mouse or the toolbar arrows to adjust the angle and distance relative to the panel. Unless you zoom in too closely to the characters, the figures remain crisp and clear. You can also add over 1,000 sound effects to make your stories more engaging. The program lets you import photos and apply filters to them so they look like cartoon backgrounds, a great feature for artists who want to use local or exotic locales.","The biggest downside is that ComiPo! is only compatible with PCs, so Apple users will need to find another program. If you&#39;re an Apple user with drawing skills and an iPad, you might want to consider <a href=\"/comic-draw-review\">Comic Draw</a>. You can find downloadable versions of ComiPo! on multiple websites, including crunchyroll.com, comipo.com and Steam. Just note that the software is sometimes called Manga Maker ComiPo!. You can purchase additional characters, props, backgrounds and clothing.","I couldn&#39;t find a trial version of this software on the company&#39;s website, but I did find one on another website, rpgmakerweb.com. You can find plenty of video and written tutorials on ComiPo!&#39;s website, but unfortunately there is no official forum. The company&#39;s Facebook page is very active so you can interact with other users there. I also found hundreds of user-created YouTube tutorials so you can learn tricks and get ideas from experienced ComiPo! comic creators. Should you need to contact the company, the only way to do so is through email. You can also find the program&#39;s user manual and FAQs page on the official website if you run into difficulties.","Manga Maker ComiPo! is super easy to use and gives you endless possibilities for customizing your characters and arranging your scenes. This program is great for kids or manga enthusiasts who want to make comics without having to use any drawing skills. Of all the preset drag and drop comic creators, ComiPo! is the easiest software to navigate and use.","Despite looking like it was made in a previous decade, the program ran without any glitches and gave me some of the most creative freedom of any software I tested. There are hundreds of background images, faces and poses, props and special effects to give your books interesting touches. Don&#39;t allow the website or the program&#39;s old-looking format deter you – this really is one of the most intuitive comic making programs on the market, especially if you happen to be a manga fan."]},"id":"94a66fee-f856-4ee7-904c-2f0a2787eb12","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69885","url":"/comipo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-04-23T21:44:08Z","datePublished":"2018-04-23T21:44:08Z","name":"Manga Maker ComiPo! 3.0","synopsis":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first downloaded ComiPo!, especially since the official website and interface look like they were made in the ‘90s.","review":{"rating":71,"verdict":"This software is ideal for children and manga enthusiasts alike due to its wide range of customizable features and its simple interface.","pros":["This program gives you hundreds of premade characters, props, poses and special effects to use."],"cons":["It isn&#039;t Mac compatible and has no drawing tools."]},"strapline":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first downloaded ComiPo!, especially since the official website and interface look like they were made in the ‘90s.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","id":"pGLmY86gZ6AEkfKjoZoJz3","meta":{"title":"Manga Maker ComiPo!
