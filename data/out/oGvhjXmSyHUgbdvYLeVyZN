The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">Wireless Keyboards and Mice</a> here.</em>","Thanks to its unconventional design, the Lenovo N700 is one of the more distinctive Bluetooth mice we reviewed. With its features and design, the N700 is a versatile Bluetooth mouse for presentations and lectures. The N700 was among the best Bluetooth mice we tested on laminate and wood surfaces, but it scored an average 85 percent on denim and carpet. In addition, it scored a low 70 percent on marble and completely failed on glass. Overall, it works well enough on most surfaces that aren&#39;t glossy.","The mouse can be used in two modes – Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless. Especially for the N700’s intended audience of business users, the versatility is useful if you’re frequently using the mouse in a variety of work environments. For instance, if you’re working from an older desktop or computer that lacks Bluetooth support, you can simply plug in the included 2.4GHz USB dongle to use the wireless mouse. Notably, the N700’s dongle holsters next to its AAA battery slot. Considering how small dongles are and how easy they are to lose, it’s a convenient and user-friendly design addition.","In our hands-on testing, we found the N700’s has good general build quality. The rear portion rotates into an arced mouse mode and a remote-like pointer mode. When the mouse is in the flat position, it solely functions as a laser pointer. The rigidness of the shape in mouse mode doesn&#39;t lend itself to a comfortable palm grip, but it works well with the claw and fingertip grips. When it&#39;s flat, the shape makes it one of the most portable mice in our review.","While the pointer mode is slightly superfluous unless you regularly give presentations or lectures, it’s a strong addition for professional users. However, the mouse lacks higher-end features like four-way scrolling and multi-channel Bluetooth connections – both would provide useful functionality for business users.","The Lenovo N700 works great on a typical laminate or wooden desktop, but it&#39;s average or below average on other surfaces. While the N700’s distinctive features make it a notable departure from standard Bluetooth mice, the Lenovo’s construction and versatility give it strong value."]},"id":"a35d222d-b2ac-49c6-9c87-99e20e17469c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69389","url":"/lenovo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-30T13:33:29Z","datePublished":"2017-05-30T13:33:29Z","name":"Lenovo N700","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":29,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","id":"oGvhjXmSyHUgbdvYLeVyZN","meta":{"title":"Lenovo N700 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Lenovo N700 features solid build quality and versatility for office and professional users."},"products":[{"slug":"lenovo-n700","url":"/product/lenovo-n700","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","name":"Lenovo N700","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","id":"9BwAZ4vQMFMiuZTAxRdLM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/KA24ZR8PwNTqrWZo3GrCWD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"04a466cc51d5df1ad127043a1efb6941.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/04a466cc51d5df1ad127043a1efb6941.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","id":"KA24ZR8PwNTqrWZo3GrCWD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KA24ZR8PwNTqrWZo3GrCWD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Lenovo N700 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Lenovo N700 features solid build quality and versatility for office and professional users."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/KA24ZR8PwNTqrWZo3GrCWD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"04a466cc51d5df1ad127043a1efb6941.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/04a466cc51d5df1ad127043a1efb6941.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","id":"KA24ZR8PwNTqrWZo3GrCWD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KA24ZR8PwNTqrWZo3GrCWD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Lenovo N700 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Lenovo N700 features solid build quality and versatility for office and professional users."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/lenovo-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"computer-peripherals","url":"/electronics/computer-peripherals","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","name":"Computer Peripherals","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:59:27Z","id":"f5QRUZiDRiDGdoHsnjAiKg","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
