This beginner <a href=\"/best-guitar-lesson-software\">guitar lesson software</a> covers the most basic principles, and it includes simple practice tools with an increasing level of difficulty. Since the lessons only cover the most basic skills, this guitar software will not help you become an intermediate or advanced musician. Also, the software lacks the simple navigation tools that you&#39;ll find in other learning programs. There are some interesting aspects of this guitar lesson software, although the lessons are useful only for beginners.","This guitar teaching software offers several basic lessons, covering fundamental music theory and chords. It will teach you how to tune and hold your guitar, and how to count time and strum basic chords. With only 28 lessons, Gitarrero Beginner cannot compare to other programs.","Fortunately, this guitar lesson software offers multiple difficulty levels for each of its lessons. As you begin to master a skill, you can turn up the difficulty to continue to challenge yourself. You can loop the practice tracks and play for as long as you need to. While these practice tools are good ways to help you learn beginning principles, they don&#39;t make up for the fact that there are only a few lessons to learn.","Lessons include videos and pictures to help you understand the concepts. Practice exercises include accompaniment to help you keep up and play on time. The software has a computerized tuner, but it lacks a metronome and interactive feedback.","If you have any problems, you can refer to the manual, tutorials and FAQs section. The information available should help you, but if you need personal help, Gitarrero&#39;s website includes email contact."]},"id":"c620d656-c023-435a-9521-9be14873363c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2caf0702-fb98-4b7f-b8cd-ee68622b2fc7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Gitarrero Beginner covers the skills that any beginner guitarist needs to learn.
