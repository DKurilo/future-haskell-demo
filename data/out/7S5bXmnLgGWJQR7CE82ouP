There is a fee for using an out-of-network ATM, but even that fee is smaller than other prepaid debit cards. Be aware that these out-of-network ATMs may also charge their own fees.

You can monitor your balance and transactions with this app. You can also use the app to add checks to your account and pass money between two different Kaiku accounts.Â There is no savings account or rewards program. These are two features that other cards have that provide another benefit to using the card besides the functionality of being able to make purchases with it. The lack of these features doesn&#39;t make Kaiku a bad choice, and we still rated it well for the features it does have."]},"id":"0abd9665-257e-4146-a29c-d34e8ff9fcf6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Funding Options"},"id":"90aaa430-28e3-495b-a12a-32de12b0eb48","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This prepaid debit card is reloadable in a variety of ways.
