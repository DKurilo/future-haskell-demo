The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-rewards-credit-cards\">Rewards Credit Cards</a> here.</em>","The Blue Sky from American Express® Card is a rewards credit card that works off a points system. With each eligible purchase you make, you will earn one point for every dollar spent. The points you earn can then be redeemed for travel, gift cards, and other items within the Blue Sky® Rewards Catalog. This card also comes with a welcome offer – if you spend $1,000 in the first three months of having the card, you will earn 7,500 bonus points.","This rewards card has fairly standard annual percentage rates and includes a lengthy introductory offer. For the first 15 months of having the card, you will enjoy a 0% introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers. After that period, you can expect your APR to be 17.24%-22.24% Variable for any purchases and balance transfers you make.","This card’s cash advance and penalty APRs go a bit higher. If you plan to use this American Express card for cash advances you can expect to see those transactions held to a 25.24% Variable APR. Furthermore, this card’s penalty APR is 27.24% Variable. However, if you pay your bill within the allotted 25-day grace period, you shouldn’t see that high penalty APR applied.","You can expect to see industry standard fees attached to this rewards credit card, with no surprises or hidden fees. Additionally, you will enjoy a $0 annual fee, which is a definite bonus in a credit card and one of our favorite things about this rewards credit card.","If you happen to make a late payment, you’ll be hit with an up to $35 late fee, and the same goes for a returned payment. When traveling abroad, if you use your card for purchases, each transaction will be charged a 2.7% fee. Additionally, any balance transfers and cash advances that you make will be charged a 3% fee with a minimum of $5.","Aside from great credit card rewards, you will receive the standard travel accident insurance, rental car insurance and extended product warranty benefits that you generally see included with most credit cards. Additionally, American Express offers even more benefits along with its Blue Sky from American Express® card. For instance, this rewards card also provides you with roadside assistance as long as you use your card to pay for the tow or locksmith service. Additionally, your card will include its return protection feature, which will back you up in the event a store doesn’t take an item you’ve purchased back.","American Express has excellent member support and is available to help you at any time. Its 24/7 customer service can be reached by phone, and you can also get online assistance via live chat or by sharing your screen with American Express. You’re also able to access many frequently asked questions and its cardmember community on its website, which may just answer any questions you have before having to contact them. "]},"id":"fed3b7e5-2db6-4967-9ec9-94cb51de972e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3e9e21d7-b3e2-468c-97f8-f63f2703972d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Blue Sky from American Express® card is a good option for a rewards credit card if you are looking to earn travel rewards and have the option to redeem points for more than travel.
