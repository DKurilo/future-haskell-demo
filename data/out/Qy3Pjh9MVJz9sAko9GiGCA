Adobe understands that every editor and project has unique needs, and it created an application that is infinitely customizable to meet those needs.        <br />\n        <br />\nMedia organization is essential to creating video efficiently. Adobe Premiere Pro comes loaded with adaptable media bins and panels, so you can store your media as well as preset attributes before you drag them onto the timeline. Adobe has some great instructional videos on media strategy that can help you optimize your workflow with top-notch bin structure. Once you have a structure that works for you, you can even save a bin template to your hard drive or the cloud. This saves you loads of time at the beginning of each project by eliminating the need to manually create a bin structure each time.         <br />\n        <br />\nPremiere covers all the bases for transforming your final sequence into a finished work. You can export it as a digital file of any size, from standard definition to ultrahigh definitions like 4K. This application can also burn videos to optical media such as DVD and Blu-ray discs.

In that time, we’ve spent hundreds of hours researching, rating and ranking each program. We’ve conducted hands-on editing tests as well as reached out to professional video editors to find out what they look for in the programs they choose.","Richard Dutcher, an independent film director from Salt Lake City, has produced eight feature films including “God’s Army,” “Brigham City,” “Evil Angel” and the upcoming “The Boys at the Bar.”","As we discussed his editing experience, he said, “I learned on Avid, used that until Final Cut Pro X came out,” then added that he’s been using it ever since. He also noted that editors should find what works best for them. “Because of the learning curve and limited amount of time, once I learn something I pretty much stick with it.”","When asked how people new to using professional video editing software can learn to work with the application proficiently, he said, “Classes are great if they’re available and affordable. If not, buy the manuals that are not published by the software companies, such as <em>Final Cut Pro X for Dummies</em> - written by actual users in the language that’s more accessible.”","We also reached out to Drew Tyler, a digital media instructor at Weber State University. He teaches both Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro X to beginning classes. When the class was over, he estimates his students chose Premier over Final Cut at about 65 percent to 45 percent.","He said there are “Two major considerations – does it fit your ecosystem, how much do you want to grow into the software.” Tyler added that you should choose a program that will fit your needs as your skills grow. “Look for something that has the ability to stretch. It might be overkill for what you’re doing now but you don’t want to run into a wall.”","<strong>How We Picked the Best</strong>","The top editing applications make your job easy and provide the tools you need to make a flawless final cut. We evaluated video editing software based on the following criteria:","Design<br/>We evaluated each program’s interface and workflow to determine the skill level required to use it: basic, intermediate or advanced. We also considered how well each step of the editing process flowed into the next and whether it is customizable enough for editors to adapt it to their personal preferences.","Editing Tools<br/>We evaluated each program’s timeline tool, looking for features that make it easy to arrange and enhance your footage and other elements.","In addition, we checked for features like color correction tools, which adjust the tone, hue, and saturation in your shots so they match and look as vibrant and beautiful as possible. Another feature we looked for was stereoscopic editing, which allows you to create the illusion of depth in your video.","Media Management<br/>The best professional video editing software is compatible with whatever camera, media type and file format you happen to be working with. In our evaluation, we found that every program can import and export all popular video file types, including proprietary files found on cameras and in software.","We also looked for smart media bins that can automatically analyze and sort your production elements. Additionally, we checked for content analyzers that examine your video footage and organize it by shot type, generate metadata, detect faces and recognize speech. Further, we made note of which programs can analyze a video file’s raw sound and match it to a corresponding audio file. This feature alone saves a great deal of effort and frustration by automating the syncing process.","Export &amp; Production<br/>Every product we reviewed can export a video as a stand-alone file on your computer. Any video editing program should be able to export your movies as popular file formats such as MOV and MP4, and the best can export videos in a dozen or more formats.","We also looked for programs let you upload your projects directly to sharing sites like YouTube and Vimeo. This is a great feature because the software also optimizes your video for those specific platforms. Additionally, we checked whether each program can author DVDs and Blu-ray discs to take your project from start to finish without needing additional software.","<strong>Other Considerations in Choosing Professional Video Editing Software</strong>","Will It Run on Your Computer?<br/>Before you spend hundreds of dollars on professional video editing software, you should make sure your computer is equipped to handle it. Start by checking your computer’s specifications. You can usually find them in the control panel’s home screen if you operate a Windows machine. If you’re on a Mac, you simply select “About This Mac” from the Apple Menu in the top left corner of your screen. Then, look up the system requirements of the application you’re considering. These can usually be found somewhere on the software’s official webpage. If you have trouble finding them on your own, simply Google the program’s name and “system requirements.” You can then compare what you find against what your computer has.&#34;","Programs like Avid Media Composer use a lot of resources. And even though your system may have the minimum requirements to run the software, you might still have trouble. Such programs are designed to work with specialized hardware with far more processing and rendering power than your average Windows or Mac machine. If you want to experience the full power of a professional video editing program, you may need to invest in a computer that is specifically designed for editing video and other highly intensive tasks.","Available Training<br/>Many professional video editing programs are becoming more and more accessible to the average user. But editing video is still complicated and time-consuming, and it takes months or years to become proficient at it. Before you select your video editing software, you should take some time to research the training resources available on the internet. Luckily, there are tons of free training videos on sites like YouTube that are made by professional video editors and targeted at users like you. Some software publishers, such as Adobe, partner with learning services like Lynda to provide in-depth training courses that show you how to use all the tools and features in their software. You have to pay for courses like these, but it’s worth the investment if you’re serious about becoming a professional video editor.","Do You Need Professional-Grade Video Editing Software?<br/>In many cases, you can save a lot of time and money by opting for a consumer or prosumer editing program instead of a full-fledged professional application. Think about your project and consider your editing skill level and how much time it will take to learn to use the software you choose. Chances are that if you’re new to editing or have limited experience, programs like <a href=\"/powerdirector-review\">PowerDirector</a>, <a href=\"/videostudio-review\">VideoStudio</a> and <a href=\"/pinnacle-studio-review\">Pinnacle Studio</a> have enough tools and features to meet your needs. They cost much less, have many of the same tools found in their professional editing counterparts and can produce more or less the same results in many cases.","How Much Does Professional Video Editing Software Cost?<br/>The professional video editing programs we reviewed can cost anywhere from $200 a year with a subscription to $600 to buy outright. The average among the programs we evaluated is about $400. A major consideration should be if you want to pay yearly or monthly or buy a program outright. Subscription programs are advantageous because you get the latest updates immediately. On the other hand, when you buy a program outright, you eliminate the risk of losing access to your work if you fall into hard financial times and can’t pay the subscription.","Professional Video Editors for Free<br/>If you’re making a small- or medium-size project, you may not have to shell out big bucks to buy editing software. Many of the programs we reviewed offer free trials or have free watered-down versions. For example, Adobe Premiere Pro has a 30-day, unrestricted trial period. This is plenty of time to finish post production on a moderately sized project or to at least get a rough cut done before you must pay for a subscription.","The same applies to Final Cut Pro X – it has a 30-day free trial before you have to purchase the software outright. One of the great things about FCP X is you can import iMovie projects. This means you can take your time making a rough cut in iMovie, then activate the FCP X trial, import your project from iMovie and use FCP X’s powerful tools to fine-tune for a month. This is a great strategy if you’re a Mac user who’s working on a budget.","Other programs we reviewed have watered-down versions you can download and use absolutely free – <a href=\"https://fxhome.com/express\">HitFilm Express</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lwks.com/\">Lightworks Free</a> are two examples. You may find these programs have everything you need to complete your videos. In fact, these programs will likely suit your needs in most cases. Even if you’re editing a feature film that will be seen by large audiences, it’s advisable to see if a free program is good enough before you spend money on a paid version. Additionally, these free programs are an excellent place to learn the ins and outs of professional video editors that cost hundreds of dollars.","How to Become a Professional Video Editor<br/>To become a professional video editor, all you have to do is become proficient in the craft. Having a college degree may help you land a job easier, but it’s not a necessity.","You can learn everything you need to know about editing videos for free online. On sites like YouTube, there’s endless content that teaches you both the theory of video editing and the practical use of individual applications. If you’re willing to put in the time to learn, there’s nothing to stop you from mastering all aspects of video editing.","Since your body of work will be the primary way potential employers and clients judge you, it’s critical that your work shines as brightly as possible. A strong reel and completed projects will far outweigh a degree in most people’s eyes. Getting that takes a lot of time and practice, so if you’re forgoing formal training, you’ll need to work at the craft every day until you’re proficient with video editing software.","You should also consider becoming certified in as many editing programs as possible. Adobe offers a <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/training/certification.html\">certification exam</a> for Premiere Pro, and Apple has an <a href=\"https://training.apple.com/us/en/recognition\">official certification</a> for Final Cut Pro.
