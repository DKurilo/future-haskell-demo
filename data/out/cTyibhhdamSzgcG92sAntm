This kind of versatility is important to ensure that you get a grill that fits your situation. Natural gas is quickly becoming a popular way to fuel gas grills because it saves you the embarrassment of needing to run to the local gas station for a propane refill when you run out in the middle of frying up the burgers. Natural gas runs off of your home’s gas hookups, so you will never run out. It is also less expensive over the long haul to run off of natural gas. However, if you do fuel your Weber grill with liquid propane, the Summit features an LED tank scale to let you know when it&#39;s time for a refill. Simply touch the button and a light will indicate how much fuel is in the tank.","One of the standout features of this gas grill is its handy Grill Out handle light.
