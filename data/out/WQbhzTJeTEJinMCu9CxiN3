However, the included manual walks you through each step with extensive pictorial guides, and it took us only a few minutes from start to finish.","Once the TAZ 6 is fully assembled and you’ve called up a model to print, the printer performs some auto calibrations. It first heats up just enough for the filament to clear the head, then it wipes the nozzle on a cleaning strip. When the cleaning strip wears out, you can turn it over and use the other side or purchase a new strip from Aleph Objects. Once the head is clean, the printer performs a four-point auto level, so each model prints on a perfectly flat surface. If the bed doesn’t pass this level test, the printer won’t let you print until it’s fixed – which is a lot more convenient than getting halfway through a defective print only to realize the bed isn’t level. You need to manually adjust the threaded rod to level the bed.
