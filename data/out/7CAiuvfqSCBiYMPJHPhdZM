In effect, an enterprise VPN service, such as <a href=\"#Hotspot_Elite\">Hotspot Elite</a>, <a href=\"#ExpressVPN\">ExpressVPN</a> or <a href=\"#IPVanish\">IPVanish</a>, creates its own internet, which is accessible only by authorized users.","Many businesses set up an internet VPN to manage the flow of information between employees, remote offices and members of the public who visit the company&#39;s website. By setting up a private network, it&#39;s possible to link offices together on a shared network. You can then provide secure access to that network for employees working from remote locations and permit external users to interact with the company website – by placing online orders, for example, or updating contact information – without giving away unrestricted access to the company database.","VPNs enhance the security of online interactions. Logging into a sensitive network from a public Wi-Fi, such as at a coffee shop, creates a weak spot that can be attacked by outside parties. Logging into a secure enterprise VPN service before accessing the <a href=\"/electronics/web-security\">private network</a> ensures that eavesdroppers get nothing but encrypted data, regardless of the public Wi-Fi&#39;s security shortcomings.","<strong>Enterprise VPN Service: What to Look For</strong>","Enterprise VPN services are enormously flexible. Some VPNs are designed to link a handful of users to a shared network while others are optimized for connecting multiple networks across the globe. No single configuration is suitable for every VPN, which is why each one must be evaluated in relation to the intended use of the network. In general, enterprise VPN services are judged by three criteria: who will be connected, how they will connect and the level of intervention required to manage their connection.","<strong>Remote Access vs. Site-to-Site</strong><br/>The most basic distinction among VPNs lies in the level at which users are connected. Remote access VPNs connect users to the shared network, which effectively extends the office wide area network (WAN) across the entire internet and allows authenticated users to interact with the private network as if they were physically present in the office. Site-to-site connections use many of the same protocols to connect one network to another. The most common application for site-to-site networking is linking field offices together in a single integrated web.","<strong>Authentication Level<br/></strong> The protocols a VPN uses determine the network&#39;s security level and ease of use. Remote access VPNs usually authenticate users through usernames and passwords, which makes it simple for anyone with login information to access the network from any location, while site-to-site VPNs use certificates and pass phrases that have been preloaded onto the hardware.","<strong>Management Level<br/></strong> Another factor to consider is the level of control an internet VPN offers administrators. Access levels on small networks are often configured for each person, though this becomes unwieldy as the network grows. Large networks use global management, by which a single administrator assigns permission levels to groups of people without having to separately reconfigure each machine.","VPNs combine the benefits of a private network with the ease of using the public internet. They provide secure connections between networks, and they allow remote access by authorized users. Enterprise VPN services can be configured many different ways, and determining which one is right for you depends on how your business will be using the system.","<strong>CyberGhost Review</strong>"]},"id":"50fa9039-7415-4084-b3cb-f6d8583d1c8a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/oixUbLkLrS9KTZRbSWG7h3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"CyberGhost maintains over 500 servers and provides an enterprise VPN service as well as an anonymous downloadable browser for millions of customers in 29 countries.

CyberGhost&#39;s setup automatically converts your IP address to an anonymous user, so once you&#39;ve signed up for this service, there&#39;s not need to re-enter your username and password. The free version of this download works with the latest versions of Windows, Mac and Android systems, though not with custom platforms or most mobile devices. The free version also imposes advertisements during your browsing session. The two-tier paid version of the enterprise VPN service doesn&#39;t have advertisements and comes with apps for your smartphone and tablet, though using the service on more than one device is a premium feature that is only available with the highest subscription level.","Information sent over CyberGhost&#39;s enterprise VPN is protected with a 256-bit AES encryption protocol. Browsing is mostly anonymous, as the VPN masks your IP and no logs are kept of the sites you visit during your browsing sessions. CyberGhost is also able to assign you a proxy server to mask your location and get around regional restrictions on delivered content. The company also offers anonymous, offline payment options, including bitcoin, which lets you pay through authorized retailers, rather than using potentially traceable online transfers.","By letting you choose which server you connect to, CyberGhost gives you some control over your connection speed and wait times. The server list updates in real time with information about each location&#39;s current load and available connection speed, which lets you switch from a lagging server to one with less wait time; however, the company only guarantees no wait time for its enterprise VPN service premium customers.","CyberGhost is simple to set up and log into, but the free version&#39;s lack of support for mobile platforms and streaming advertisements limit the service&#39;s utility. Strong encryption, a single login, and anonymous internet access are among CyberGhost&#39;s strengths, though the security of an AES encryption system largely depends on the details of the enterprise VPN service&#39;s specific coding.

By using StrongVPN&#39;s proxy, your account is rendered essentially invisible to your ISP, which gets you around service caps and bandwidth limitations, potentially speeding up service.","Using StrongVPN to establish a secure enterprise VPN service may be inconvenient, as only one device may be logged in at a time, but it can also save you a lot of troubles by diverting external attacks to the company&#39;s firewall and by helping you navigate around your provider&#39;s bandwidth caps.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>VPN Authority Review</strong>"]},"id":"104c39a3-d8da-49f4-92ae-a963cb530840","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/39AhRMUGL8P8mG4StNPK6W.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"VPN Authority offers an enterprise VPN service that is primarily routed through servers in the United States and the United Kingdom to circumvent geographic restrictions on streaming content. The company offers a network of servers, which it claims have been optimized to ensure a fast, secure connection. This multitude of servers compensates, in part, for the network&#39;s weak encryption algorithm.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/10347/best-enterprise-10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39AhRMUGL8P8mG4StNPK6W.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"39AhRMUGL8P8mG4StNPK6W","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39AhRMUGL8P8mG4StNPK6W.jpg","alt":""},"id":"494f471e-a04f-4a3d-a0db-ef302ff0527b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["According to the company, setting up VPN Authority only takes 15 seconds. You can set up an account by visiting the company website, logging in and downloading the appropriate software package for the platform you intend to use it with. VPN Authority works with all platforms and browsers, including gaming consoles and mobile devices. The company offers a single tier of membership, so there are no premium rates or advertisements embedded in the toolbar.","VPN Authority uses a simple 128-bit encryption system that falls short of the full 256-bit industry standard. The smaller encryption algorithm is potentially vulnerable to brute force attacks, though your data is unlikely to be compromised due to VPN Authority&#39;s multiple-server network and routine IP subnet masking.","VPN Authority offers multiple servers to deliver an uninterrupted stream of web content, audio and video. Using any of its U.S.-and U.K.-based servers gets you around regional restrictions and allows fast access to sites like BBC iPlayer, which can be problematic for non-U.K. browsers. The system allows unlimited switching for no additional cost, so you can hop from a lagging server to one with a lighter load without paying more.","It&#39;s simple to set up and start using VPN Authority&#39;s enterprise VPN service. Once installed, it works with virtually any operating system you are already using without significant alterations to your current browser configuration. Though the 128-bit encryption algorithm could be more secure, the service is routed through a remote proxy, which makes detection of your IP address unlikely. Speed is ensured by letting you choose to route your connection through the fastest available server. Switching to another, potentially faster server is always an option if your first choice begins to show a noticeable lag in streaming content or gameplay.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"06e5737a-2690-4f88-88e1-3f4a7a053241","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10347","url":"/best-enterprise-vpn-services-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-12-19T19:54:00Z","datePublished":"2016-12-19T19:54:00Z","name":"Best Enterprise VPN Services Review","synopsis":"Enterprise virtual private network (VPN) services create a secure connection between computers, or between computer networks, that spans already-existing internet infrastructure.","review":{},"strapline":"Enterprise virtual private network (VPN) services create a secure connection between computers, or between computer networks, that spans already-existing internet infrastructure.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-12-19T20:28:57Z","id":"7CAiuvfqSCBiYMPJHPhdZM","meta":{"title":"Best Enterprise VPN Services Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
