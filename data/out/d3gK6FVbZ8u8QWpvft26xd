This saves time and money, allowing you to tailor your messaging and targeting specific audiences&#39; needs.","<strong>Contact integration</strong>: Make sure the software can sync with your website&#39;s contact list.

The ability to directly send new products into the inboxes of current and potential customers has done wonders for the marketing world. In the body of your email, feel free to take a sales-like tone, but make sure to offer the recipients something they can&#39;t get on your website. For example, include a coupon or give them early access to a new product.","<strong>Bottom line</strong>: Approximately <a href=\"http://www.frankwbaker.com/mediause.htm\">40 percent of people</a> check their emails six to 20 times a day, according to Media Literacy Clearinghouse. Promotional emails are a fast and effective way to reach them.","<strong>New-Arrival Emails</strong>","Product launches are some of the most exciting and stressful events that a business experiences   that is, they are exciting if all goes well.

The traffic to your site draws visitors into your sales funnel, which keeps older posts profitable.","<strong>Bottom line</strong>: Content is the lifeblood of any strong email marketing strategy. A 2012 CEB <a href=\"https://www.executiveboard.com/blogs/does-your-newsletter-readership-rate-stack-up-to-other-companies/\">survey</a> found that 44 percent of companies had a 40 percent or greater newsletter readership rate.","<strong>Holiday Emails</strong>","Small businesses might not be able to afford physical mailing for their Christmas and holiday cards; sending a digital one is a cheaper alternative. According to a study published in Human Nature, <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116032/anthropologists-holiday-cards-show-size-your-social-network\">14 percent of people are replacing their physical cards with e-cards</a> this year, and businesses are beginning to follow this trend as well.

Also offer a deal when you can   93 percent of online buyers are encouraged to purchase when shipping is free.","<strong>Bottom line</strong>: Use your email marketing campaign to bring people back. Returning site visitors typically account for 12 percent of your traffic.","<strong>Product Use Emails</strong>","Customers usually don&#39;t buy a product because they don&#39;t know what it is or how to use it. This is especially the case for new products entering an undefined market space. Create a video explaining the benefits and link back to the product pages. Your audience is more likely to embrace this tactic than you might otherwise think; Litmus found that <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/07/email-marketing-stats.html\">82 percent</a> of consumers open emails from companies seeking their business.","<strong>Bottom line</strong>: Email is worth it, particularly when it comes to product use content.

Let them opt into how many times a week they want to receive communication from you. If you send too much unwanted communication, your customers will be diving for the unsubscribe button instead of the purchase one.","<strong>Step 5: Following and Improving Your Analytics</strong>","You can send an email every day, but if no one opens it or clicks through to buy something, then it&#39;s a waste of your marketing budget. Consider these five key performance indicators (KPIs) as you look to evaluate your campaigns&#39; success and profitability:"]},"id":"f8e6912e-e60a-4224-aec4-35f90a74b105","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Unique opens</strong>: There&#39;s a significant difference between unique opens and total opens. Unique opens track the number of individuals who have opened your email, while total opens quantify the number of times a message was opened. The latter number inflates when people open the email multiple times and is less reliable than unique opens.","<strong>Unsubscribe rate:</strong> A low unsubscribe rate means that people want to see your content   or that you&#39;re emailing a list of zombie accounts. To ensure the people receiving your emails are quality leads, consider using a <a href=\"http://blog.leadpages.net/two-step-opt-in-process-list-building/\">two-step opt-in process</a>. Also, high unsubscribe rates on content types can help dictate the types of emails you send.","<strong>Click-through rate</strong>: Your email marketing is meant to be a driver to your blog and website. If you&#39;re including complete content in your message, consider just putting snippets and links to the full article. Many services require opening an email to delete it, which boosts the open rate. Given this, click-through rate is a more realistic KPI.","<strong>Conversion rate</strong>: This is possibly the most important metric in tracking the effectiveness of the goals you set. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re looking to convince readers to sign up for a webinar, make a purchase or download an eBook. The conversion rate is the number of desired actions achieved versus number of emails sent.","<strong>Email revenue</strong>: At the end of the day, you should be able to compare the cost of your email marketing to your profit goals. Whether you track sales with an exclusive coupon code or follow the path to purchase with a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en\">URL builder</a>, make sure you&#39;re not losing money on this marketing tactic."],"type":"ul"},"id":"5d604a7d-73dc-42a2-83f6-8b93c1e6eecf","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When one of these is weak, it&#39;s time for a change.

You should constantly be looking to improve your KPIs, increase your acquisition list and try new forms of content.","Annually, you should consider implementing a complete overhaul of your email marketing strategy.
