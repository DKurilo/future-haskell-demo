It offers a solid feature lineup, including an adjustable tilling depth.","With one-handed operation, this rototiller offers exceptional balance for superior control, even when you&#39;re guiding the machine with one hand, ensuring you don&#39;t need to exert unnecessary effort and energy as you till. The forward-rotating, rear-facing 12-inch tines deliver a very fine till, even without counter-rotation. This Troy-Bilt garden tiller also has a reverse gear, allowing you to till back over a row without lifting and turning the tiller and making a second pass down the row quick and easy, allowing you to achieve a fine till suitable for a seed bed.","The Pony ES is equipped with Troy-Bilt&#39;s patented Bolo tines. This means that each individual tine has a unique shape, performing separate tasks yet working in unison to produce the finest possible soil, which more than makes up for the lack of counter-rotation.","For enhanced durability and to reduce maintenance and breakdowns, the Troy-Bilt Pony ES comes with a bronze gear drive transmission encased in cast iron, increasing strength, weather resistance and robustness. The 250 cc Briggs and Stratton engine offers ample power for the toughest tilling tasks. The standard electric start makes the machine quick and easy to start.","The tilling depth is adjustable up to 7 inches. However, the tilling width is fixed at 16 inches. So unless you leave at least 18 inches between rows and operate very carefully, you cannot till between rows. Additionally, the narrow tilling width means that, although this gas tiller is more than capable of cutting through virgin ground and working heavily compacted soil, tilling large areas takes a substantial amount of time.","The Troy-Bilt Pony ES features a rear-tine shield that protects you from the tines when they are in motion and shields your legs against flying soil and debris. For extra safety, it also has a protective front bumper, stopping you from running into plants and garden buildings. The plow-style handles with shaped handgrips offer comfort and extra control. To increase stability and traction, this power tiller has generous 13-inch agricultural tires with large, rugged grips that keep the tiller steady, even in slick conditions or when tilling heavy soil.","One downside is that you have to buy additional attachments separately. While these attachments – such as the furrower, which makes planting potatoes and creating straight rows fast and easy – are useful, they do pose an additional expense.","Overall, the Troy-Bilt Pony ES is a good choice for small and medium gardens, whether you need to cut new beds or perform regular maintenance. However, the lack of adjustable tilling width does limit its versatility."]},"id":"9e451682-0674-4fae-8351-dc4ac45454fc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62721","url":"/troy-bilt-pony-es-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T22:27:02Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T22:27:02Z","name":"Troy-Bilt Pony ES","synopsis":"A high-end power tiller, the Troy-Bilt Pony ES is durable and reliable.
