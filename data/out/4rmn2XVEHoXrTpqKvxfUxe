These full-size wireless keyboards maintain a consistent connection and are easy to set up and use.","Most of the keyboards in the Illuminated series use Logitech&#39;s proprietary Unifying receiver and connect to your device with 2.4GHz RF wireless. This receiver lets you connect up to six wireless devices on the same USB receiver, so you can hook up all your peripherals without tying up multiple USB ports. You can find a few models that use Bluetooth instead. Some have USB pass-throughs, and you can find some with AV ports, too.","These wireless keyboards from Logitech use scissor switches with the PerfectStroke system. As you depress a key, the scissor switch beneath ensures the weight is evenly distributed across the surface of the key, which prevents wobbling. This maximizes the lifespan of each key and increases keystroke accuracy. The low-profile scissor switches also provide adequate tactile response.","The full-size keyboards in this series have number pads, and the keys are well spaced to increase accuracy without creating extra travel time, which is the time it takes your fingers to move from one key to the next. Some Illuminated keyboards feature a variety of special keys, including programmable hotkeys and dedicated media keys. With the use of Logitech&#39;s SetPoint software, you can set specific functions and macros to keys and mouse buttons, as well as change a variety of other settings.","These keyboards aren&#39;t particularly ergonomic, so you likely need to purchase or add additional support, such as a keyboard wrist rest, to improve your long-term comfort, particularly if you use your keyboard for extended periods of time. Keyboards in the Illuminated series do have adjustable backlighting, so you can type or game comfortably in low light. Only the characters light up to ensure you can easily identify which key you need. Some models also feature hand-proximity detection, so the keys illuminate when they sense your hands approaching. You can find keyboards in this series with anti-ghosting that supports up to six simultaneous keystrokes and have polling rates of up to 500Hz."]},"id":"9ff615d8-eefd-4950-a21b-4421edbd6e27","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68434","url":"/logitech-illuminated-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-21T18:26:20Z","datePublished":"2016-09-21T18:26:20Z","name":"Logitech Illuminated","synopsis":"Logitech is well-known for its reliable computing peripherals, and its Illuminated wireless keyboards are a popular choice for consumers and business users alike.
