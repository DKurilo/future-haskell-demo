By far, this model provides the best value in a magnetic bicycle trainer.","Bike Lane Pro uses adjustable magnetic resistance with five levels that are just a push away with the handlebar-mounted control toggle. Magnetic trainers are less expensive than most fluid trainers, but they’re usually not the quietest option. However, the noise level of the Bike Lane Pro is not super intrusive, so you should be able to easily watch your favorite shows on your TV, tablet or smart phone while riding. Bike Lane Products states that its  trainer works with any quick release rear wheel, which makes attaching your bike to the trainer simple.","Smooth tires are always recommended for trainers. Since bike training tends to wear out a tire faster than road biking, it is common to acquire an extra smooth tire, or training tire, specifically for your trainer. The Bike Lane Pro  accommodates 26-inch, 27-inch, 28-inch and 700C  wheels.","Bike Lane Pro&#39;s frame measures 15.25 x 21.5 x 18.75 inches and weighs 22.55 pounds, making this one of the lightest trainers on our list. You can easily fold it up and store it away during the warm months when you bike outdoors or pack it in your car for a pre-ride warm up. Unlike most indoor bike trainers, which require you to purchase a riser block separately, this one comes with a riser block included. In addition, the Bike Lane Pro comes with a one-year warranty and a 100-percent satisfaction guarantee. Its customer service is quick to respond and pleasant to interact with.","The one missing feature that might be an issue with the Bike Lane Pro trainer is that it doesn’t have smart capabilities or Bluetooth compatibility, so you can’t use it to connect with popular cycling apps like Zwift. However, as a well-priced, no-frills trainer, the Bike Lane Pro is hard to beat. It’s one of the least expensive magnetic trainers, and it has the durability and convenience of more expensive products."]},"id":"e3c3fe26-7aac-411c-b3f1-060ef6bf5d24","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68560","url":"/bike-lane-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T15:42:00Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T15:42:00Z","name":"Bike Lane Pro","synopsis":"Bike Lane Pro provides a sturdy yet inexpensive bike trainer, and it even includes a front wheel riser to steady your bike while you exercise.
