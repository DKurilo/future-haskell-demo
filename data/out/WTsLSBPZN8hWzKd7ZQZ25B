It comes with a foam applicator for its crystal polishing formula and a brush head for daily facial cleansing. You also get one 0.68-ounce tube each of Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and Thermal Crystal Polisher. The polisher is self-warming and is designed to resurface dull patches on your skin. While you can use the facial cleansing brush daily, you should only use the microdermabrasion formula twice a week, on nonconsecutive days.","The Olay ProX has three speed settings. Our testers didn’t notice much difference between the low and medium settings, but there was a distinct difference between low and high. Unique to this brush, the Olay ProX has StaySpeed technology to provide a quick power boost when you press the brush to your face. This prevents a loss of speed during use.","With an MSRP of $37.49, the Olay ProX is reasonably priced, and replacement heads cost just $10.49 for two. In contrast, the most expensive brush we tested, the <a href=\"/clarisonic-review\">Clarisonic Mia 2</a>, costs $169, and its replacement brush heads are $27 apiece. However, the Mia 2 provides a better user experience. Our testers gave the ProX a B- in user experience, largely because its crystal polisher formula is hard to rinse off once you’re done resurfacing your skin, and it feels more abrasive than the cleansing puffs you attach to the <a href=\"/neutrogena-review\">Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System</a>.","“I had to rinse my face a few more times to keep it from feeling gritty,” one tester said. “Also, I think you’d have to be careful to not get the formula in your eyes.”","“I only used it once, and my face felt raw,” said another tester. “However, it did leave my face feeling smooth.”","The Olay ProX isn’t 100-percent waterproof, but it is water resistant. You can use it in the shower, but it should never be fully submerged. The unit operates with two AA batteries, which are included with your purchase. While most facial cleansing brushes are protected by a one- or two-year manufacturer warranty, the Olay ProX isn’t warrantied. If you need customer service, you can reach Olay’s parent company, Procter &amp; Gamble, by phone, email and live chat."]},"id":"74d86469-b626-4c61-a500-d25ee4ad9766","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65092","url":"/olay-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","datePublished":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","name":"Olay ProX","synopsis":"The Olay ProX is marketed as a microdermabrasion and advanced cleansing brush system.
