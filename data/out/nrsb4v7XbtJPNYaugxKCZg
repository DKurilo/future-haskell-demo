After the alarm is installed, there will be sensors through the entire car. From the door sensors to a window breaking to a feature called shock sensors, your entire vehicle will be protected. The alarms will even sound if the car is jacked up or towed.","When the alarm is triggered, one of six sirens will go off and your remote will also buzz to alert you to the disturbance. The LCD screen on the remote will show you what is happening to your car and in what area. After the alarm sounds, you can disable the engine with the starter-kill or simply disarm the alarm, if you know it to be false.","A remote start feature is option with the Black Widow car alarms. The remote start feature is especially helpful during extreme temperatures to help cool or heat your vehicle before you enter. The engine will run for a predetermined amount of time. Also, if someone attempts to put the car into gear without the key in the ignition, the engine will immediately turn off. This feature will help protect your car against theft.","Black Widow BWZ5 car alarms have an assortment of other, smaller features. There are keyless entry and trunk-opening features. The alarm also has a timer that can be used to time parking meters. There are valet settings and car finding beepers to help you find your vehicle in a crowded parking complex. There are also panic modes included with each alarm."]},"id":"1dad0011-8d22-439c-b6a9-00b5f7e0bb7e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Alarm Features"},"id":"21ccc95a-c585-4956-88a6-91b648092461","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The auto security system is packed with all the most useful features, which also means it is extremely complicated to install.
