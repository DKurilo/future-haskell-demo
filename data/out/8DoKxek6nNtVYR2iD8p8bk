You see, both processes are used to get around content restrictions on DVDs so that the owners can manipulate the data however they like. However, each method is designed for a different function and uses different functions to complete the process of duplicating the data on the disc.","Copying a file is usually as simple as left clicking with your mouse and selecting Copy or hitting the Control and C keys on your keyboard. Common software such as Windows Media Player can copy and rip CDs, but with DVDs, the process is much more complicated.","You see, disc media has digital security features such as CCS encryption that keep people from making copies. These security features are intended to keep homemade copies of the movies on these discs from being sold or shared, which takes profits from the people who sell legal copies of DVDs.","Let&#39;s look at each type of data-duplicating method more closely.","<strong>Copying DVDs</strong>","Copying a DVD is exactly what it sounds like. You use <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a> to remove the copying restrictions from the data and make an exact copy of the DVD on a new disc.","<strong>DVD Ripping</strong>","DVD ripping, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t mean copying a DVD to a disc. It is the process of saving a file in another format, which allows you to use the data with different media players on smartphones, video iPads and other devices. DVD ripping changes the data and makes it more accessible to you by allowing you to download and play it on multiple devices.","<strong>What Do You Need to Rip or Copy DVDs?</strong>","Most DVD copy software can do the work of DVD ripping and copying. Though there are products called DVD rippers, most people will have more versatility when using copying software since it can save the data in various formats and make copies of the DVD in the original format. This software also has other features such as scratch and data repair, enhanced compression tools and the ability to merge data.","You can obtain free DVD copy software and free DVD rippers by looking for downloads on the internet, but free software is often inferior to name-brand copying and DVD ripping software.<br/><strong>Which is Legal?</strong>","The biggest question on your mind may be the legality of DVD ripping or copying. Technically, neither process is legal. In 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was created to protect the copyrights of the owners of digital media. According to the DMCA, it is illegal to &#34;Circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.&#34; The act also states, &#34;No person shall, without the authority of the copyright owner or the law, intentionally remove or alter any copyright management information&#34; <em>[1201 (1)(A) and 1202 (B)]</em>.","What this means is that while making copies or ripping DVDs isn&#39;t illegal, removing the security features is. Unfortunately, it is impossible to copy or rip a DVD without removing its security features. The only way to legally watch the contents of a DVD on another media player is to use the Universal Digital Copy that is now included with many new DVDs.","No matter what you may read in tech chat rooms, DVD ripping and copying are two completely different processes. While they both remove copying restrictions, each process is intended for using the DVD data differently.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "," "]},"id":"097e3cc5-76a3-4059-8621-e2a87bf5d77d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6419","url":"/what-is-the-difference-between-dvd-ripping-and-copying","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alina-bradford","url":"/author/alina-bradford","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alina Bradford","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"B3tPrF8sxRUy8i2s9RVdDe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-09T17:55:07Z","datePublished":"2011-08-09T17:55:07Z","name":"What is the Difference Between DVD Ripping and Copying?","synopsis":"DVD ripping and copying are similar, yet very different.
