Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.

The Toshiba 55L7200U&#39;s features a nearly bezel-less screen with a hint of silver near the bottom. Within the small silver band, you&#39;ll find the dual, built-in 10-watt speakers, which are largely hidden. The swivel mechanism is easily adjustable for viewing at multiple angles.","This set also has a lot more going for it than a solid, functional design. The higher the refresh rate, the crisper and clearer the movement on screen will appear. With a refresh rate of 240Hz, the Toshiba 55L7200U is competitive with many LED TVs on the market. This feature is primarily noticeable with fast action scenes, with nature documentaries with wide, panning landscape shots or with sports programs with constant movement. The 240Hz refresh rate means huge motion blur and fuzzy pictures are largely a thing of the past.","The Toshiba 55L7200U is built like many high-end LED TVs on the market; its LCD screen is backed by a flat panel of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that enhance the screen&#39;s overall color and brightness. This allows the TV to brighten or dim individual pixels on the LCD screen, resulting in brighter, crisper whites and deeper blacks.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"8059005b-a9e9-4a92-be5c-039ad5850df9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"232e2027-afad-4fda-a951-6f0bee110056","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Toshiba 55L7200U competes well with some of the higher-end models when it comes to design and other features like an LCD screen that produces brighter whites and deeper blacks than most LED TVs on the market.
