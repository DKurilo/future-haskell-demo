But sadly when it comes to<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\"> LED TVs</a>, they aren&#39;t on top. The Sony Bravia KDL55HX800 does offer 3D comparable to the Samsung UN55C8000 and is offered at a much better price, so if 3D is a must-have and you want to save a little money this may be a good choice for you. The HX800 series is the most affordable 3D TV available from Sony, but unfortunately you get what you pay for with this unit. The LED TV itself is quite thick at 2.9 inches and has right around the same specs you would expect to find on a mid-range LED TV."]},"id":"2f963013-4966-46dc-a772-624260fc7925","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"c7e6261b-cc13-4fd1-ab7e-5eb80a0f872c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Much like Samsung and LG, Sony understands the need for the latest and greatest technology and has attempted to compete in the new realm of 3D TVs.

That being said when it comes to the overall picture quality when watching Blu-rays or TV you may be somewhat disappointed in well let areas. It&#39;s frustrating to us that Sony doesn&#39;t publicize the contrast ratio and the refresh rate for this TV. While this won&#39;t be a factor to most buyers, it&#39;s definitely concerning when a company as well known as Sony holds back information as important as this from consumers.  With that being said, we did find the picture quality to be very good in dark areas and to wash out a little in well-lit areas. Much like some of the higher-end LED TVs, the Sony Bravia KDL55HX800 will be a much better home theater TV than a living room TV if you want the best picture quality. There are plenty of adjustable picture settings, and overall the TV delivers where it counts."]},"id":"ae1df35c-b2a8-443a-a7fd-f93d77327c94","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Smart Features"},"id":"e9458ea7-a05e-4e80-ac41-0504ac53a05b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony Bravia KDL55HX800 has all of your basic HDMI connections as well as an Ethernet port, PC input and even a USB for connecting your camera or camcorder.
