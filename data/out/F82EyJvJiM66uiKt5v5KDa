You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","NTI Media Maker is unique in our lineup of <a href=\"/best-cd-burning-software\">CD burning software</a> applications in that it isn&#39;t just one program – it’s a suite of applications that perform tasks from ripping audio off CDs to building playlists, and burning audio and data discs. They&#39;re all bundled together in one interface.","It does a decent job of making copies, but there are a few things to take into consideration when using this application. Because it is made of multiple applications, we found the installation process to be a little difficult. The help and support documentation is also a bit confusing. If you don&#39;t know how to use a CD burning application then this product may give you a little bit of trouble when you first start using it.","If you just want the basic CD copying features then NTI Media Maker is up to the task. It does a good job of making clones of your favorite discs. You can also save the files to your hard drive if you don&#39;t want to burn another disc. There are also a few options when it comes to copying DVDs. It doesn&#39;t come with a decrypter, so instead of copying commercial DVDs, this application is more suited to making copies of your favorite home videos and unprotected DVDs. This is also a good application if you want to back up the files on your computer to CDs or DVDs.","When it comes to actually using the application, you will find it fairly easy. There is a slight learning curve if you&#39;ve never used this type of application before, but it isn&#39;t bad. One of the reasons why this particular product is easy to use is the drag-and-drop functionality. This means you just pull over the files you want. It doesn&#39;t have you mess with all of the nitty-gritty details that make other applications confusing. Some of the more computer-savvy users may not like the fact that it takes away so much control, but that is how NTI keeps the application easy to use.","We found the installation process a little cumbersome; because NTI Media Maker is actually a suite of applications, we had to install some of the components separately. Other than this small hiccup, the rest of the process was problem-free.","The help and support is limited to documentation. Media Maker organizes its topics smartly so you should be able to find the subject you are looking for. The only way to contact NTI for product support is through an online submission form."]},"id":"78b4e396-6fcf-4f6d-b716-01a36a863a49","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54c8ac74-d393-4401-a099-d18e9162689a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, NTI Media Maker doesn&#39;t offer anything special.

The last thing to keep in mind is that the help documentation is difficult to understand and there is no way to contact the company for help with the product.
