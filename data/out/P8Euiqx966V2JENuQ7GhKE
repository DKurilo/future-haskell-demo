What it lacks in luminescence and bonus features, it makes up for with a small and rugged design that ensures it can fit into your backpack or overnight bag without taking up much space.","Operation of the Dorcy 41-1017 camping light is simple. Its front face is equipped with a single power dial that turns it on or off. There are no intermediate settings to switch between low and high power, and there is no emergency flashing beacon light, but an array of four 5-millimeter LEDs emits light at 360 degrees. These LED bulbs produce 40 lumens of light, which is enough to illuminate up to 15 feet in all directions. This makes it more than sufficient to light up the interior of a tent or cast light to the perimeter of a small campsite.","Constructed of ABS plastic and weighing a mere 3.2 ounces, the Dorcy 41-1017 is one of the lightest outdoor camping lanterns on the market. It requires four AA-cell batteries, which add little to the lantern&#39;s weight when installed. Its diminutive measurements of just under 5 x 7 inches give it an added level of portability not available with larger, more powerful outdoor camping lanterns. This camping light can also run for long periods of time, lasting up to 70 hours on a fresh set of batteries.","A durable plastic handle on the lantern&#39;s top edge makes it easy to carry. The handle includes a built-in hanging hook for convenient placement both inside and outside of camping tents. The Dorcy 41-1017 has a simple and sleek design and is available in a variety of colors.","Simple in design and made of ABS plastic, the Dorcy 41-1017 LED camping light is both durable and lightweight. It is capable of burning up to 70 hours on four AA batteries, which means you don&#39;t have to burden your backpack with heavy replacement batteries. Its 40-lumen capacity is powerful enough to light areas up to 15 feet, which works well for single tents or small campsites."]},"id":"69044ad2-4270-4535-8b37-ba2de3d5fb8d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65248","url":"/dorcy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","datePublished":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","name":"Dorcy 41-1017","synopsis":"The Dorcy 41-1017 is a miniature battery-powered lantern that is among the most lightweight and packable LED camping lights available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Dorcy 41-1017 is a miniature battery-powered lantern that is among the most lightweight and packable LED camping lights available.","language":"en","dateModified":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"P8Euiqx966V2JENuQ7GhKE","meta":{"title":"Dorcy 41-1017 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Dorcy 41-1017 mini LED camping lantern emits 40 lumens and has an average battery life of 70 hours, making it effective for lighting small areas.
