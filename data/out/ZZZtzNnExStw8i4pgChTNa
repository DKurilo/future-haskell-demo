Thrustmaster&#39;s Ferrari 458 Spider works on both the PC and Xbox One. This isn&#39;t the best gaming steering wheel you can get, but it&#39;s a good pick for the right situations.","The 458 Spider is ideal for playing racing games in the living room if you don&#39;t want to invest in a gaming steering wheel mount. You almost need to have such a mount if you&#39;re using a wheel with force feedback. While there are positives to not having force-feedback motors, there are also downsides. You don&#39;t get any feedback from your favorite racing games, which hurts immersion and enjoyment.","While you&#39;re racing, you can rotate the 458 Spider 240 degrees, which isn&#39;t a large amount. Still, it&#39;s better than the 180 degrees that some wheels allow. What this means is that you can rotate the wheel two-thirds of the way to the right and left, instead of only halfway. With such a small turn radius, small movements on the wheel translate into large movements in the game. This is great for courses that are fairly straight, but bad for courses that need fine control.","You won&#39;t find a clutch in the pedal set, but at this price point, it&#39;s good to see a pedal set at all. There&#39;s nothing quite as immersing as slamming the gas and feathering the brake pedal during a heated race. The 458 Spider&#39;s pedals aren&#39;t the best you can find, but they serve their purpose well enough.","Should you have any problems with the 458 Spider, Thrustmaster offers a two-year warranty. That&#39;s plenty of time to notice any factory defects and get them resolved. You can contact the support team through email or by phone. There isn&#39;t a live chat option, nor an official online community."]},"id":"035e89b1-17a0-4492-9f18-f6926f527755","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7a7412f5-8c8a-48eb-b222-8635983dd080","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider doesn&#39;t have the most features and isn&#39;t the best gaming steering wheel you can get, but it gives you a much better racing experience than a keyboard or controller.
