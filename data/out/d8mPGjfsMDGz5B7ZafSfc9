You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","As the newest addition to the <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">Internet TV</a> crowd, <strong>The WB </strong>naturally brings some interesting new concepts with it. There are quite a few new features that can certainly keep you glued to your computer monitor instead of your TV.  ","One of our favorite new features allows you to create your own TV content by mixing and editing different sections of videos together. It’s like creating a playlist of favorites on other Internet TV sites but with far more options and the potential to create personalized content. It’s a great move for The WB because it allows you to watch your favorite shows AND feel like you’ve invested a bit of yourself into what you watch. That’s bound to create a little loyalty among users. ","The WB also has the advantage of popular content. The list of shows on the site includes many shows  with enormous TV fan bases (like Friends and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and a few with significant underground fan bases (like Firefly).  ","Even though The WB has all these things in its favor, the site still didn’t rank very high. This is largely due to the content library. Even though there are shows people like, the selection is pretty limited and there aren’t very many videos from shows that are currently on the air.","The WB certainly knows how to select popular shows for the video library. You can find Friends, Gilmore Girls, The O.C., Madtv, Firefly and a number of other shows you’ve heard of. There are even a few that you probably haven’t heard of.","The WB has a lot of great shows that were popular on TV, but the problem is, there aren’t too many videos available for shows that are currently on TV. If you’re looking for reruns, The WB can definitely help, but if you’re looking for current shows, you might be disappointed.","The WB also includes a lot of extras, like games and quizzes, that might be good diversions, but they definitely aren’t entertaining enough to stand alone. They’re just  good for a break from watching videos.","It’s nice to see that The WB didn’t try to complicate the process of watching your favorite TV shows. The WB site has an excellent search function that is probably the most comprehensive that we have seen. You can search by series, season, episode, character, location or even dialogue that occurs in the show you’re looking for. That’s a pretty extensive set of criteria.","The viewing pane in The WB is also pretty simple. At first glance, it looks like the controls are gone, but that’s because they’re spread across a long bar under the viewing pane instead of superimposed over it. It’s a little frustrating that they are set up so differently, but after a while we grew to like it because it doesn’t obstruct your view of the video.","The WB uses periodic video commercials when you watch a show. They aren’t too frequent and some shows don’t show any commercials at all. This seems unusual, although we certainly aren’t complaining. We just don’t know how long that will last.","There are quite a few nice features on The WB site, some of which you wouldn’t expect to find. The common ones, like embed, share by email, and pop out to a new window are present. But you can also do some amazing things with The WB version of the playlist.","You can save episodes to a playlist just like on many other Internet TV sites. But then The WB lets to take it a step further and personalize the videos themselves. You can mix and match clips from different episodes, add visual effects and generally mash up all your favorite shows into whatever you want. This kind of artistic freedom is virtually non-existent in other Internet TV sites. We praise The WB for making it possible for people to do more than just watch; they can also interact.","One of the biggest areas for potential improvement on The WB site is in technical support. There isn’t even a FAQ for you to refer to if you have simple questions or problems. There is email support, but it took us quite a while to find the email address."]},"id":"7bdbe30d-02fe-4214-a317-43d7a06f8e80","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f9961a48-29b9-4cb2-be7f-2c9568376929","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The WB is a fun website because it has a lot of popular programming and it lets you personalize your viewing experience more than any other Internet TV site.
