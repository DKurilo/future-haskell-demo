Got a tough medium to tame and mold? This compact router can tackle it. Weighing only 4.1 pounds, its 7.0 amp motor has 1.25 HP that delivers the power you  need for heavy or light tasks. Electronic feedback regulates and maintains the cut speed. This helps to reduce the twisting you feel with most routers when you start them, giving you better control and precision from the moment you turn on this router.","The Porter Cable’s 1-1/4 HP Compact Router with Plunge Base and Bag features an adjustable ring for directed bit depth changes. Multi-shaft detents helps you change your bits quickly. It has a large, low-pressure spindle button that locks, which makes changing your single wrench bits a breeze. The power switch is a rocker switch, which some craftsmen prefer.","This palm router has a turret that’s adjustable as well. You can choose from one of five positions that support replicated plunge cuts. Its motor starts soft, and maintains the motor speed effortlessly, which adds flow and continuity to your efforts.","The locking-in-position feature of the motor, a combination of the depth ring and clamping mechanism, gives you the stability you need. The depth travel with the standard base is up to 1.5”, and up to 2” with the plunge base. Additionally, setting a precise depth is easy with the integrated ruler on the front of the router that shows exactly how deep your current setting is.","The plunge base has large molded handles made out of rubber, which adds to your handling comfort. The motor housing is made from tough aluminum, and the sub base is 4” in diameter and will take universal template guides.","The Porter Cable’s 1-1/4 HP Compact Router with Plunge Base and Bag can handle almost any project you throw at it. It’s rugged and comes with a one-year warranty, as well. Your purchase includes the router with a standard fixed base, a plunge base, a wrench, a carrying or storage bag and an owner’s manual."]},"id":"3cec20af-c137-45b9-b192-84bea8485c06","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61660","url":"/porter-cable-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-17T19:36:12Z","datePublished":"2014-12-17T19:36:12Z","name":"Porter Cable 450PK","synopsis":"Porter Cable’s 1-1/4 HP Compact Router with Plunge Base and Bag is a palm router with a fixed plunge base that is durable, quite comfortable and gives you the control you need for your projects.
