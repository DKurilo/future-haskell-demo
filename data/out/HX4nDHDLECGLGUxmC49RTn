You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Don’t let the lower ranking of GarageBand discourage you from trying this visually exciting product.  Since the Piano Lesson section is a small component of the overall product, it ranked lower than most.  The strength of GarageBand lies in its many different aspects of creating music.  First, you can learn to play the piano basics required to enjoy this product with GarageBand’s lessons and then move on to mixing and recording your songs, editing and so forth.  You can share your songs by saving them to an iTunes library or creating your own iPhone ringtone or podcast.","Lessons are in the form of carefully orchestrated videos. They are clear, concise, and easy to understand with your personal video instructor, Tim.  A major drawback is only nine lessons are available and they attempt to cover the core of piano basics.  Subjects covered include the musical staff, notation, chords, rhythm, major and minor chords, scales, accidentals, and the final lesson on playing the blues.  You will need to do a lot of rewinding to understand some of these skills if you are a novice, but if you already have musical experience GarageBand is a good reinforcement of concepts.  ","Of all the products in our <a href=\"/best-learn-piano-online\">Learn Piano Online Review</a>, GarageBand has the highest quality video presentations.  They are well produced, easy to understand, and offer different views of the teacher (overhead hand view and full body side views).  The videos have clearly marked sections in each lesson making jumping back and forth easy.  Although you don’t need a MIDI keyboard to view these lessons, you will receive the most benefit if you do.  Once plugged in, you can play along with the teacher, slow down or speed up tracks, play with accompaniment, mix and mute levels, and even turn the instructor’s voice on and off as you practice. The ability to adjust the speed as you learn is a key factor to improving your skills quickly.  The online metronome helps you master the rhythms presented.  The fun begins when you purchase ‘Artist Lessons’ online. For $4.99 a lesson, you can learn from and play along with artists like Ben Folds, Norah Jones, Sarah Barasilles, John Legend, and Sarah McLaughlin to name a few. The instructor gives simple, easy to understand practice instructions and the video features make it easy to start and stop while mastering each lesson.  Since the lessons are very basic and simplistic, a glossary isn’t provided but would be a nice feature for additional review.","The key requirement for GarageBand is an Apple Computer. GarageBand comes preloaded on new Apple computers for no additional charge or is available when you purchase the iLife program if you have an older system. Although the initial program is preloaded software, you must download the lessons after opening GarageBand. The time needed to do this can be cumbersome – anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours per lesson.  But there are no CDs or DVDs to load or lose and once you plug your keyboard into your computer it is one of the easiest programs to use.  Garage Band features built-in help guides, tutorials and search features in addition to a detailed FAQs section and forum hosted by Apple.  Email assistance is also available."]},"id":"befaad53-fb51-4dc3-a750-27ebe5d515ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"db5ff382-9844-4b16-8aea-db5aad82f14b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Piano Lessons in GarageBand are most beneficial if you already have some piano knowledge and simply want to use the program for personal enjoyment or the Recording Studio Features it provides. The breadth of GarageBand is in the other aspects of the program, not the lessons. While <strong>GarageBand</strong> is entertaining, if you are serious about learning to be a proficient pianist we suggest you try one of our top rated products. But you can have fun with this product. With your keyboard hooked up and the variables available with the video lessons, you’ll really believe you are the keyboardist in a garage band before you’re done!"]},"id":"88f3392e-4d2b-45c8-970a-0107a75f236f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49041","url":"/ilife-garageband-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-03-19T13:36:12Z","datePublished":"2010-03-19T13:36:12Z","name":"iLife GarageBand 09","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":55,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-03-19T13:36:12Z","id":"HX4nDHDLECGLGUxmC49RTn","meta":{"title":"iLife GarageBand 09 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"iLife GarageBand learn piano online is visually exciting.
