Of course there are alternative digital die cutting units available that are much more flexible than the Cricut. For complete creative control and computer connectivity, consider cartridge-free die cutting systems.","Still, there are existing Cricut die cutting machine users (or cost-conscious consumers) who may still be interested in software that opens up their Cricut to more creativity and customization. Luckily, Cricut has come out with a design software suite that brings more flexibility and more inclusive artistic control. Still, there are limitations, so it s worth considering the alternative, third-party software available to use with Cricut die cutting systems."]},"id":"1c82e950-e1a2-4e34-a778-f9626338bb91","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/aiyzbHD8fWWVsxRp2csoWT.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/5875/cricut-software-1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aiyzbHD8fWWVsxRp2csoWT.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"aiyzbHD8fWWVsxRp2csoWT","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aiyzbHD8fWWVsxRp2csoWT.jpg","alt":"Cricut DesignStudio software"},"id":"17437e04-1c92-45d0-8dc4-de1c185ac7eb","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Pro:</strong> Cricut DesignStudio is made by Provo Craft, and it lets you connect your Cricut to a computer to do more with Cricut fonts and shapes.","<strong>Con:</strong> You still have to actually purchase the Cricut cartridges to use them in your designs.","Cricut DesignStudio is made by the same manufacturer as Cricut die cutting systems, Provo Craft, and lets you connect your Cricut to a computer.
