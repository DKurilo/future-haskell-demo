You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Waring Professional DF55 <a href=\"/best-deep-fryers\">Deep Fryer</a> is a compact and utilitarian home deep fryer that works well. It has a stainless-steel housing with black plastic accents. To test the Waring fryer, we made French fries and breaded chicken. Our testers ranked the Waring among the best deep fryers in our lineup in terms of taste and texture in the foods it produced. We followed the manufacturer’s instructions, and the resulting food was perfectly cooked. We were able to fit 1.9 liters of oil in the fryer and cook a max of 1.3 pounds of food, so it’s not a large fryer.","The 1,500-watt, immersion-style heating element didn&#39;t heat the oil as quickly as we expected, taking 20 minutes to reach optimal cooking temperature. However, it only took the Waring four minutes to recover its temperature once food was added, which was among the fastest heat recovery times among the fryers on our lineup.","Some users prefer immersion-style elements for the heating benefits, but they require hand-washing. Even so, this small deep fryer was one of the easiest to clean. The inner container is removable so you can easily lift it out to drain the cooking oil; Waring recommends hand-washing the stainless-steel container.","While the cooking performance, cleanup, and ease-of-use scores were excellent, we felt like the Waring DF55 was missing a few features. There isn’t a viewing window, so it&#39;s more difficult to monitor the progress of your food while it&#39;s cooking. Likewise, it doesn’t come with a timer, an oil filter or a method of storing used oil. If you’re in the market for a larger capacity deep fryer with a viewing window other convenience features, the <a href=\"/krups-review\">KRUPS</a> deep fryer is a good choice.","In terms of safety, we ranked this product among the best deep fryers we tested. Surprisingly, the metal exterior of the Waring deep fryer only reached 109 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the upper rim of the container and the lid get quite hot. Non-skid rubber feet prevent accidental movement, and the magnetic cord means you can cut power to the fryer instantly.","The Waring DF55 Deep Fryer comes with a one-year warranty, which is typical for countertop fryers. Waring provides email and phone support, online manuals, and a collection of instructional videos to help you get cooking. This fryer includes a collection of recipes as well."]},"id":"519c73af-8d71-4621-a2c2-ca5d61cfe8ae","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e264bea-b0d4-4df9-bbb8-6eefd88e6ec2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re looking for excellent fried foods and don&#39;t care about such features as a timer, viewing window or oil filtration, the Waring Professional DF55 Deep Fryer is an excellent choice.
