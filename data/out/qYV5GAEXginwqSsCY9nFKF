Most gaming mice feature programmable buttons, special functions, and high rates of dpi (dots per inch) and ips (inches per second). These features combine to offer a mouse that is more responsive and better equipped to play a fast-paced game than a regular mouse. Some gaming mice are meant for first-person shooter games (FPS) and are ideal for clicking and tracking in graphics-heavy games. Popular gaming mice include the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/roccat-tyon,review-2438.html\">ROCCAT Tyon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/corsair-vengeance-m65,review-2084.html\">Corsair Vengeance M65</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/steelseries-sensei-gaming-mouse,review-2185.html\">SteelSeries Sensei Wireless</a>.","<strong>Gaming Mice: What to Look For</strong>","Consider the features, functions and buttons on a gaming mouse before you decide which one to purchase. With a variety of options available at every price level, there is something for every style of gamer. Choosing the best gaming mouse is not so much about finding one that ticks all of the boxes, but rather finding one that suits your playing style. Knowing what to look for helps to ensure that you get the best option for your needs.","<strong>Speed </strong><br/>The dpi, ips and FPS designations refer to how quickly the mouse moves over a screen. The higher the dpi, the more the cursor moves when you move the mouse. The higher the ips, the faster the cursor moves. Essentially, a mouse with a higher rate of dpi moves the cursor further with a smaller adjustment of the mouse but requires more precision and accuracy. Some gaming mice have adjustable dpi, which allows you to change it based on the game. An FPS mouse is made for use with shooting games where the graphics are centered on the viewpoint of the character.","<strong>Features &amp; Buttons </strong><br/>Characteristics and buttons vary a great deal on gaming mice. The most fundamental options include nothing but the standard two buttons and a scrolling wheel. More advanced options can include dozens of programmable buttons, which you can assign to perform in-game functions using hotkeys, custom bindings and macros. The more buttons, the longer it takes to learn to use it, but the faster you can use those functions once you master the mouse.","<strong>Grip &amp; Alignment </strong><br/>Grip and alignment matter because they affect how you play. Left-handed mice are available. Grip options include claw and palm. If you prefer to hold the mouse with the tips of your fingers, then you need a claw grip. If you prefer to rest your palm on the mouse, then you need a palm grip. Smaller mice work better for people who prefer a claw grip, even if not specifically oriented for one type of grip.","<strong>Wired or Wireless </strong><br/>Choosing between wired and wireless gaming mice is mostly a matter of preference, but each option suits different types of gamers and gameplay. Wireless mice are more convenient, but they may lag, disconnect or respond more slowly than wired mice. They also require batteries or a charging unit.","Regardless of whether you are playing an FPS or a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), the type of mouse you choose can significantly affect your gameplay. When looking for a new gaming mouse, take some time to learn about the different options available in order to choose the one best suited to your style of gameplay."]},"id":"ca35c11b-a39c-4e7f-b14e-0c85d897f11a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"52f88f58-4996-424d-a998-a08480e657b7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LCLKJFC/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63320[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cooler Master</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARD5410/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63317[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Corsair</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IRHE892/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63325[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Logitech G502</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E4MQODC/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63319[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Logitech G602</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MHTF1MO/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63318[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Mad Catz</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MYTSDU4/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63326[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Razer DeathAdder</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E8CF268/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63321[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Razer Naga</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MSOIUOO/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63322[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ROCCAT</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009DYOPJ6/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63324[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ROCCAT Lua</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ILALMZS/?&tag=ttr_gaming-mice-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1582[art|NA[pid|63323[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">SteelSeries</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2baee33b-7d5d-4e3a-ad70-7b1a7ec7caa5","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1582","url":"/best-gaming-mice","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-25T00:05:33Z","datePublished":"2016-11-29T18:56:18Z","name":"Gaming Mice Review","synopsis":"Gaming mice offer customization and versatility with additional buttons and more features.
