You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP ProCurve 1800-8G Ethernet Switch has eight individual auto-sensing ports and an energy-efficient design so you can efficiently boost your wired internet speed. This <a href=\"/best-ethernet-switches\">Ethernet switch</a> comes with eight individual auto-sensing ports that can handle 10, 100 or 1,000 Mbps.","The switch features eight individual, interchangeable Ethernet ports on the front of the device, along with a coordinating LED light panel that indicates the activity of each individual port. The front-facing ports help make mounting simpler, and while the desktop switch comes with mounting hardware, you can only mount it in a horizontal position. This switch is also notably larger than some similar switches, so those interested in mounting want to ensure they have the proper space and location.","This switch has a fanless design to keep operation noises to a minimum, yet its energy-efficient design automatically helps the switch stay cool no matter how long it is running. Other energy-efficient features include the IEEE 802.3x flow-control feature, which automatically detects ports that are not in use and switches them to idle mode to conserve energy. This feature also automatically determines cable length to ensure efficient operation.","The switch does not come with a plug-and-play design, so you need to do some initial setup. However, HP does have a web-page interface designed to make the setup process relatively straightforward. This interface, known as the ProCurve Manager, can be used to monitor activity, control settings and enable certain switch configurations. Having the managed online portal also means you can add certain security features and add a management password to the web browser interface.","This HP switch has 1MB flash memory and 1MB RAM capacity along with a 16 Gbps switching capacity that helps ensure the right data packets travel through the right port. This switch comes with a QoS (Quality of Service) feature that helps prioritize data packets to boost download speeds and reduce buffering times. This feature also optimizes networked applications and cuts down on unwanted broadcasts so you can improve your network traffic. This is particularly important if you are using your switch to help with video, voice or data storage.","Overall, if you are looking for a managed Ethernet switch for your home or office setting, this HP model is worth considering. While it doesn’t feature the simple plug-and-play design that some products have, the online interface can open up new customization options with this switch that may be helpful if you have a larger network to manage."]},"id":"8dff8bd2-e160-4ba1-9479-02ffc034dc72","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66483","url":"/hp-procurve-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-07T15:37:20Z","datePublished":"2015-08-07T15:37:20Z","name":"HP ProCurve 1800-8G","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-07T15:37:20Z","id":"YPHnQbUXpDBNRw5XnpGema","meta":{"title":"HP ProCurve 1800-8G Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The HP ProCurve 1800-8G Ethernet Switch is an eight-port gigabit Ethernet switch meant for home or office use.
