Like the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Bluetooth headphones</a>, the K 845BT headphones have an ear cup remote, over-ear design and NFC capabilities. The short eight-hour battery life is inconvenient, but if you can frequently charge, these headphones provide a great listening experience.","The AKG K 845BT Bluetooth headphones have a decent soundscape for listening to music, movies, phone calls and audiobooks. A 20Hz to 20kHz frequency response is pretty standard for Bluetooth headphones, but the large 50 mm driver lends itself to a slightly more expansive sound quality.","Larger drivers like the one in the K 845BT headphones create more detailed audio. The audio isnâ€™t as clear as other headsets, but for general audio listening, they do well. These headphones also work in passive mode so you can continue listening without a charged battery. Although this set isn&#39;t noise cancelling, the around-ear design helps naturally seal out noise.","Top Bluetooth headphones are lightweight, and easy to wear for long music sessions. The AKG K 845BTs are heavier than most at 10 ounces but the over-ear design is plush and soft. Two colors are available, and a folding frame helps you carry and store these easily. Remote features are on the ear cup so you can change songs and volume during phone calls and movies. The eight-hour battery life is much shorter than comparable models, which usually last 12 hours and much more on standby.","These versatile headphones function in both Bluetooth and wired mode. A detachable cable is included so you can listen when your battery runs out. The wireless range lasts up to 33 feet so you can walk around without losing connection with your phone or tablet. The AKG K 845BTs are also NFC capable, which makes connecting so much easier.","AKG has the full gamut of help and support options. If you want to find instructions or advice, try looking in the FAQs or searching the user manual. Email, phone and a live chat feature are all available on the website should you need technical support too. A standard one-year warranty also covers the headphones from defects as well."]},"id":"3d57bf95-9c3c-4f50-8418-33fae4648f37","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"664970db-8b3d-40bd-a316-5f36f4391c92","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although this set has the shortest battery life of our Bluetooth headphones reviews, they are still a great addition to your audio library.
