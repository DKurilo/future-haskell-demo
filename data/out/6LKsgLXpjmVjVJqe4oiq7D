You can use it like a traditional router or set it up to increase your home&#39;s Wi-Fi range in conjunction with another router. The Airport Express does many things well, but it falls short in a few key areas, like its number of Ethernet ports and signal range. Even though it&#39;s a decent choice, it&#39;s not the best Wi-Fi range extender on the market.","The most impressive thing about the Airport Express is that it can operate on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands. This enables it to get solid throughput by both sending and receiving data simultaneously. One band captures your router&#39;s Wi-Fi signal, and the other rebroadcasts it. Wi-Fi boosters without both bands suffer from drastically reduced throughput, but the Airport Express doesn&#39;t have that issue.","We were disappointed by the range increase you get with the Airport Express. You&#39;ll only get about 150 feet of extra range in ideal conditions. While that&#39;s likely to be enough for a smaller house, if you need the Wi-Fi signal to go through floors or multiple walls, you&#39;ll probably run into issues. In the best conditions, you can make the most of the Airport Express&#39; theoretical data rate of 300 Mbps. That&#39;s not astonishingly fast, but it&#39;s good enough for most people.","Two antennas are built into the Airport Express to help capture and rebroadcast your router&#39;s signal. We like that those antennas are built into the device, as it creates a sleek and low-profile Wi-Fi extender. The Airport Express&#39; small size is a double-edged sword, though. Due to limited space, you only get one WAN port and one LAN port. In other words, you can&#39;t really use it as a bridge."]},"id":"613cd508-8b4f-4fab-a5cf-0f9d99cf07cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8510e436-8cb4-4502-b335-0f41884c2b65","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Apple Airport Express is a solid wireless router and Wi-Fi booster, but it makes some difficult compromises in order to achieve a small form factor.
