Dyson V6 cordless <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vacuum</a> struggled a little to clean carpeting, but it was great for wood floors. A major plus is its filtration system, which captures allergens and expels clean air.","The V6 stick vacuum received high marks in vacuuming performance because of its unique cleaner heads. We tested all stick vacs with different mixes of sawdust and pet hair on both carpet and hardwood. The V6 took several passes more than other vacuums on carpet with the direct-drive head, but its soft roller was made for hardwood. The harder surface was spotless after only four passes.","For the pet hair test, we embedded dog hair in our carpet samples, and the V6 performed admirably, easily picking up the fur. If you have pets, you’ll probably appreciate its filtration features, as the vacuum picks up dust and allergens in the air. At only 8 inches, the head is a bit smaller than those on other vacuums, so it takes longer to cover the area you are cleaning.","We also tested the V6 on medium-profile carpet soiled by sawdust. The V6 was OK and collected most of the sawdust in several passes. Keep in mind that the vacuum defaults to maximum power once you engage the vacuum trigger. It drains the battery, heats the motor and causes a lot of noise.","Dyson is known for its swivel steering, and the V6 lived up to the hype. The electric broom moved through the test area in any direction with little resistance. The vacuum has a nice, modern look and stores directly in the charging stand when it’s not in use. The included crevice tool works well in combination with the removable hand vac.","The Dyson V6 takes 3.5 hours to charge and runs for 20 minutes on its standard mode. But for big jobs, the maximum mode has a severely limited runtime – just seven minutes on full power. This makes the Dyson a great choice for small jobs, but you might find yourself running thin on power if you need an extra power boost.","The Dyson is also extremely light. The entire model weighs in at only 4.5 pounds, which is less than half the weight of many corded units. Even better, it doesn’t sacrifice power to save pounds. For its superior design, the V6 is also much louder than we expected at a test-rated 95 decibels, which was louder than all but one vacuum we reviewed. For a quieter vacuum cleaner, try the <a href=\"/hoover-linx-review\">Hoover LiNX Cordless</a>. "]},"id":"57c97ec4-3dd2-4fd9-bd27-f1e1f406bf1d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"01511699-6abf-4e84-bc9f-e2bf1b08b414","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The V6 receives high grades on its flawless design, wood floor cleaning and smooth motion.
