You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The budget phone category is tough to shop in. There are plenty of options available for less than $200, but the best smartphones at low price points still have to sacrifice if they’re to remain affordable. Maybe they’re made from flimsy materials and are prone to breaking. Maybe they’re packed with old hardware or don’t have quality-of-life extras like NFC. In the case of the Desire 530, HTC invested more in the look and feel of the phone that what’s hidden beneath the surface, and the result is a phone as frustrating to use as it is budget-friendly.","At first glance, the Desire 530 seems impressive. For under $200 you get a phone that feels svelte yet hardy, with a glass display and a soft-touch plastic casing that echoes the days of Nokia’s Lumia handsets. Its bright candy bar colors – I tested the Sprinkle White model, which peppers paint spatters of salmon and gray over a cloud-white finish – have a certain lovable bounce to them. There’s even a pair of holes in the case used to attach the included wrist strap, a move that makes the phone feel sporty, even if you never have reason to take the strap out of the box.","Despite all this, an idiom about books and judging covers comes to mind. Turn the phone on and you notice its 720p display, spread out over 5 inches of real estate. That calculates out to a pixel density of 294 dpi – low enough that, while you might not be able to easily pick out the screen’s pixels, images look grainy and undefined, and text can actually be uncomfortable to read.","Even worse, virtually every action taken on the Desire 530 is slow, jittery or just doesn’t work like you expect it to. Swipe from one home screen to another – the simplest thing you can do on a phone – and it hiccups as it tries to manage the animation. Press the power button and it takes about a second for the display to turn on. I even noticed it miss my swipes here and there, usually when the processor was trying to calculate something else in the background.","This is all due to the generally low speed of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 210 processor, the cheapest model Qualcomm has that still includes support for 4G LTE. As we do for all our smartphone reviews, we ran the Desire 530 through a battery of synthetic and real-world benchmark tests, and the results were profound. The phone performed worse than every other Android phone we’ve ever tested – and that includes phones from 2014. Put another way, you can get better performance out of a used device or a model that’s two or three years old than you can from the Desire 530."]},"id":"c3df54f1-e339-4a1a-a1cb-23f4a73e3ce5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"06767512-8dbf-4068-88dd-312e5f0bfff4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Nobody expects a sub-$200 product to compete with the world’s top smartphones, and it would be unfair to review the HTC Desire 530 as though its only competition were $700 flagships. There are, after all, plenty of other phones out there for around the same price – new phones with lower specs and used ones with higher specs – and they’re the real alternatives.","The problem for the Desire 530 is that those alternatives are almost always better options. Willing to buy used? You can get a refurbished 2014 Moto X – a flagship two years old and still going strong – for the same price or cheaper than the 530. Have to have new? The Asus Zenfone 2 has a better screen and a slightly faster processor with better software optimization, so those laggy slowdowns aren’t as noticeable.","Whatever choice you make, it’ll probably be better than the Desire 530. HTC’s latest budget entry may look great on the outside, but from a usability standpoint it’s too hamstrung by its own cost-cutting measures to be worth your time."]},"id":"74e6d778-df4b-4f55-b913-09fc8ac0c6a5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68123","url":"/htc-desire-530-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-07-29T21:06:52Z","datePublished":"2016-07-29T21:06:52Z","name":"HTC Desire 530","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":38,"verdict":"HTC kept the Desire 530&#8217;s price down by sacrificing its display and processor, the two critical components you need for a remotely decent phone experience.
