I recorded the speaker playing this tone on a loop, then used frequency analyzing plugins to create the average frequency signature. From this frequency signature, I graded the performance by comparing it to the original audio frequency file.","The best part of the XS-65ic-RGB is the balance. All three frequency ranges earned B+ grades for accuracy. In addition, when I evaluated the speaker as it played a variety of music, I found the balance to be exceptional. It may not have the most accurate performance, but the balance almost makes up for it. No single frequency diminishes the others. By comparison, the <a href=\"/kicker-speakers-review\">Kicker KM654cw</a>, which is the other speaker with lights, the audio performance was bottom-heavy, with the lows overpowering the midrange and high frequencies."]},"id":"391020bb-8da7-420d-bf01-5fe867738ad1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Power Handling"},"id":"8c6293b3-42b9-4797-86aa-da6072f88b24","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The XS-65ic-RGB received a C+ in the comparative loudness test, which is about what I expected from a speaker with an 89-dB sensitivity rating. The sensitivity rating is the volume that manufacturer measures at one meter when using 1-watt of power or a 2.86-volt current. However, since manufacturers often put out the best possible ratings based on optimal conditions, I measured the volume of each marine speaker at four levels using the same stereo to power the speakers. The test showed that the sensitivity rating isn&#39;t always as clear cut as it seems. For example, the <a href=\"/clarion-review\">Clarion CMQ1622RL</a> has a lower sensitivity rating than the XS-65ic-RGB, but it was the loudest speaker.","A significant downside to the XS-65ic-RGB is its other power-handling specifications. It’s continuous power handling is 60 RMS watts, the lowest I&#39;ve reviewed. And the peak power handling is 120 watts, which is only 20 watts higher than some marine speaker&#39;s continuous power handling. With most marine speakers, these power-handling specifications matter more than with similarly designed car speakers because they must contend with an open acoustic space and noises from the engine, wind and water. However, if you&#39;re buying these speakers for the ambient lights because you throw boat parties, then the power handling is less important, as the speakers don’t need to be as loud when your boat is stationary."]},"id":"3d466322-8564-4037-b22b-6c23dc47773c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Durability"},"id":"b26414a7-d04a-42f5-b969-2c9e822dd366","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While there are popular speaker brands that make marine speakers, Wet Sounds is one of the few speaker manufacturers that prioritizes marine audio equipment, with <a href=\"/fusion-review\">Fusion</a> being the other. This means they take marine-grade standards very seriously. The XS-65ic-RGB has a polypropylene woofer and a titanium tweeter, which means it can easily handle water without warping and degrading. It has one of the most robust rubber gaskets that I&#39;ve seen. This creates a watertight seal so that the internal installation space doesn&#39;t take on water. The grille and frame are made of stiff, noncorrosive Nylas, a nylon-fiberglass composite. It&#39;s designed to handle the harsh conditions of a boating lifestyle.","The LED lights are a fun feature. According to the manufacturer, you can change the lights to an unlimited number of colors by using the remote. It&#39;s more accurate to say that it&#39;s capable of illuminating colors within the visible spectrum. In my tests, I only got it to produce 12 colors. That said, I wasn&#39;t using the remote and was just touching the wires in various configurations. However, the lighting comes with a downside: The installation requires more wiring than standard speakers.
