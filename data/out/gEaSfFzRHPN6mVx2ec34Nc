The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-sound-bars\">Sound Bars</a> here.</em>","The Samsung HW-H450 boasts one of the sleekest designs in our lineup. At first glance, its all-black, rectangular design appears to not have any buttons or a display. It actually has an inconspicuous display that only illuminates when the sound bar is powered on and after a function has been activated. After a few seconds, the display goes dark again so you don’t have to look at any intrusive or distracting lights. All of the buttons are located on the side.","This Samsung sound bar has several listening modes: Movie, Clear Audio, Sports, Music, Night and Standard. The Night mode automatically lowers the volume and softens the highs and lows to create a softer sound quality. When you use the sound bar in this mode, you can watch movies and listen to music at night and not disturb others.","We tested the HW-H450 with a number of movies and songs to evaluate its bass response, clarity and surround sound characteristics. As we watched “Star Trek Beyond,” we enjoyed the dialogue clarity, but other TV sound bars we tested were still clearer and sharper. We found that the sound was a bit dull, lacking brightness and clarity.","The sound bar did have well-balanced volume. Sound effects did not drown out the dialogue. One of the most common issues with TV speakers is that the dialogue is too quiet and the action is too loud. The HW-H450 balanced the sound to provide powerful, even volume.","During “Mad Max Fury Road,” the bass response was above average. The 6-inch additional subwoofer created a well-rounded bass response – it wasn&#39;t the most powerful subwoofer we reviewed, but it gave the audio a depth we could feel. The bass response was most noticeable during our music test. The song &#34;Idioteque&#34; by Radiohead has a driving kick drum that is prominent throughout the song. The bass was both heard and felt but not overpowering, hitting just the right spot in the sound spectrum to enhance the music.","When we played the song “Relax” by Lettuce, the Samsung HW-H450’s sound wasn’t as full as that of the best sound bars in our review. It didn’t display the sharp detail in the high frequencies – the hi hats and snare weren’t as crisp as they were with top performers. This isn’t to say the sound bar sounds bad, just that it’s average.","Most of our criticisms are about its surround sound simulation. This 2.1-channel sound bar struggled to send sounds to different sides of the room – they all seemed to be coming from the center, and it failed to display any depth.","This sound bar has optical and HDMI connections. These are both digital connections that send a clear audio signal from your TV to your sound bar, but HDMI is preferred because it can transmit higher resolution audio compared to optical. The HW-H450 doesn’t have analog audio ports. If you have an older television that doesn&#39;t have an HDMI or optical port, it may be difficult to connect it to this sound bar.","The sound bar is not Wi-Fi enabled, but it does offer Bluetooth connectivity, which you can use to stream music wirelessly from a mobile device. Bluetooth does have range and quality limitations compared to Wi-Fi. Only the best sound bars in our lineup have Wi-Fi connectivity.","We evaluated each sound bar&#39;s remote control. Good remote controls are lightweight, comfortable to hold and use, and functional. The Samsung remote is a great size and weight, and the volume buttons are intuitive enough you can turn the volume up or down in the dark just by feeling them. The remote is also grippy so it doesn’t slide out of your hand. This was one of the most enjoyable remotes to use out of all the ones we tested.","This sound bar is covered by a one-year warranty. Samsung provides many avenues for customer service, including live chat, email and phone support. Phone support is your best bet for the most accurate service, but live chat is helpful if you have a quick question you need answered."]},"id":"fa076e6e-167b-4b6a-86f0-c6e2ca47e9ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7db774b7-d91a-4199-bcce-cb2c78177230","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung HW-H450 is a good sound bar at an affordable price.
