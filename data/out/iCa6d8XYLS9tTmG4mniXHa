Most <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing companies</a>  understand that you&#39;re looking for a great deal and try to tempt you to sign up for their services by advertising low rates or free equipment. However, these excellent rates are often limited to specific types of transactions, and free equipment offers come with contractual strings attached. When a great promotion catches your eye, ask the following five questions:","<strong>1.\tIs this a flat-rate, interchange-plus or tiered plan? </strong>There are several fee schedules to choose from, each with advantages for specific types of businesses:"]},"id":"1b09c284-e647-43cd-9306-493d32f7b9d5","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":[""],"type":"ul"},"id":"d19f68ea-5a86-44da-a9e2-1b4ba87e418a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Flat rates are good for businesses with small sales tickets, as well as those that that process credit cards seasonally or infrequently.

However, if your customers prefer to pay using rewards or corporate cards, or if you accept payments online or over the phone, you will pay a higher rate."]},"id":"143a60fc-3c9d-414c-b3aa-c4cfa62fc5cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>2.\tWhat exactly is this rate for?</strong> Sometimes you’ll see an amazing rate advertised – for example, 0.25 percent plus a small per-transaction fee. Further inquiry, however, may reveal that this rate is the processor&#39;s interchange-plus markup, and it&#39;s added to the card networks&#39; interchange rates. Or you may discover that this rate is part of a tiered pricing plan and applies only to swiped debit card transactions, and that regular credit cards cost around 1.60 percent, and rewards and card-not-present transactions may cost more than 3.50 percent or even higher.","In either case, it&#39;s important to realize that the promotional rate doesn&#39;t represent the full processing cost that you can expect to pay. Whether or not the advertised rate is a good deal for your business depends on a variety of factors, including which type of cards your customers prefer to use and your average sales ticket size.","<strong>3.\tHow much is the per-transaction fee?</strong> If you have very small sales tickets, you need to pay close attention to the per-transaction fee tacked on to the processing rate. Although the average per-transaction fee is only $0.20, this charge can add up quickly if you run a high volume of very small-dollar transactions. In such cases, it may be advantageous to consider a pricing structure where you pay a higher processing percentage rate but no per-transaction fee, such as many flat-rate plans offered by <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-credit-card-processing\">mobile credit card processing companies</a>. However, if your sales tickets are generally high-dollar, a lower processing percentage and an average per-transaction fee may be the better option.","<strong>4.\tWhat kind of cards do your customers use? </strong>Very often, the credit card processing fees you pay depend on the type of cards your customers use. Cards with rewards or other privileges like mileage points offer nice perks for customers but cost you more to accept. Corporate, government and international credit cards also process at a higher rate. If your customers are of the Platinum Visa set, you should compare the rates for those kinds of cards, not the starter rates for swiped debit cards that the credit card processing companies usually advertise.","<strong>5.\tWhat’s in the contract?</strong> Before you sign a contract so that you can get free equipment, read it thoroughly (all three parts: application, terms of service and program guide) to make sure the deal you&#39;re getting is as good as it&#39;s supposed to be. Most contracts lock you in for at least three years and automatically renew for additional two-year terms. As you read the contract, look for additional processing or monthly fees, early cancellation penalties (sometimes called early deconversion fees) or liquidated damages. Many equipment contracts are noncancellable, so even if your business goes under, you&#39;re still personally responsible to fulfill any remaining contractual obligations. Look for service fees for equipment and additional charges for services you may not need. Also, check to see if the processing rate is locked in and, if so, for how long. Few companies guarantee a rate schedule for any length of time.","In nearly every instance, a better option is to purchase your equipment outright and choose a credit card processing company that offers month-to-month service and doesn&#39;t charge early cancellation fees.","It’s natural to be drawn to a great rate, and there are good deals to be had. However, unless you check for the line connected to the hook, you may be in for an unpleasant and expensive surprise. Don’t get reeled in! Ask questions about rates, fees and service terms, and read the contract carefully. Make sure you understand exactly what you&#39;re getting and what your obligations are before signing anything."]},"id":"22ffe3b7-893f-4cc9-8add-8c1c8bf6e7bd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10215","url":"/lowest-fees-scam","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T13:52:37Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T13:52:37Z","name":"The Lowest Credit Card Processing Rates – Are You Being Baited?","synopsis":"There’s no dispute that price is a major consideration in choosing a credit card processor.
