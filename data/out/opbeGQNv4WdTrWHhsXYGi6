The OKC SP-16 SPAX, dubbed &#34;The Unstoppable One&#34; by Active Junky testers in the field, is small and light, but it offers excellent penetration capability for easy chopping under any condition.","This unusual-looking blade has a full flat taper with a flat bevel and a secondary flat bevel, which gives it increased power for digging into the wood. The head is made with 1095 carbon steel with a 57-59 hardness rating. This is a greater-than-average hardness rating of most camp axes and is well within the norm for camping knives. However, while it&#39;s a powerhouse for making (twigs) out of the strongest logs, it&#39;s also harder to sharpen than most of the camping hatchets we evaluated, so make sure you carry a good tool with you if you plan on putting this axe though a workout.","This handy hand axe does more than take on logs. The unique head design lets you chop, shred or rip. As such, it&#39;s great for when you need to do some heavy work like tearing down a dock or ripping up some hardwood pallets for a bonfire. The narrower blade on the back works great for digging, plying and hooking, such as to grab a log to drag. Our testers said it was more firefighter than flyweight.","The Kraton handle resists the elements and has finger grooves to improve grip. The testers found they had excellent control of this camp axe.","The distinctive medieval shape of this camping axe makes the sheath a little more difficult to attach but very necessary for safety and blade protection. This comes with two kinds of sheaths â€“ a leather Cordura and a full cover sheath in camouflage fabric.","Ontario Knife Company has an excellent reputation for cutlery, including knives and axes. It supplies the U.S. military and other government agencies. It offers a limited warranty against faulty workmanship or materials, but not damage from abuse or improper care. Overall, this camping hatchet is a good choice when you need a sharp axe that works as a multitool."]},"id":"d3ccc857-e624-4a1f-b83f-b805489de8bd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68361","url":"/ontario-knife-company-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T18:54:41Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T18:54:41Z","name":"OKC SP-16 SPAX","synopsis":"If your camping adventures involve more than setting up a few tents and a friendly fire after a long hike, you may want a camping hatchet that makes short work of chopping.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If your camping adventures involve more than setting up a few tents and a friendly fire after a long hike, you may want a camping hatchet that makes short work of chopping.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-12T18:54:41Z","id":"opbeGQNv4WdTrWHhsXYGi6","meta":{"title":"OKC SP-16 SPAX Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The OKC SP-16 SPAX has an unusual design which offeres excellent chopping capability for a camping hand axe.
