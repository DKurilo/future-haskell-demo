The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\"><em>Weed Whackers here</em></a><em>.</em>","With a four-cycle engine and 25 cc of displacement power, the straight-shaft Honda trimmer HHT25SLTAT is lighter, quieter and easier to use than most competing weed trimmers are, whether they have four-cycle or two-cycle engines. This Honda trimmer has enough power for almost any residential trimming need and it works quickly and easily. The Honda trimmer fares less well when it comes to available attachments, but the three it does use come included with the trimmer. This gas trimmer&#39;s warranty is a good value.","The Honda trimmer stands out in two ways. First, its quiet four-cycle engine means that you don&#39;t have to mix gas and oil for fuel. Second, its straight shaft lets you maneuver the weed eater under any porches, steps, fences or playground equipment on your property.","When you open the heavy-duty weed whacker&#39;s throttle and start the machine humming, you&#39;ll be able to cut swaths 17 inches wide. The 25 cc engine means you have enough power to get at tall weeds and grass, and its 19.6-ounce fuel tank means you won&#39;t be running back to the garage every 20 minutes for more fuel.","This Honda grass trimmer is easy to use but powerful enough to remove any brush, tall grass and weeds that plague your property. When your line becomes too worn to use, simply tap the head on the ground for more nylon string. This power tool is controlled by a trigger mechanism that allows you to change the speed of the engine. The machine is also fitted with a debris shield to keep green waste off your face and clothing.","Honda Power Equipment&#39;s engineers increased their string trimmer&#39;s ease of use by improving its start technology, making line replacement simpler and adding anti-vibration features. However, this trimmer&#39;s ability to run on straight gas makes these other usability factors pale in comparison. The machine still requires lubrication, but the oil system works just like the one in your car, so you can be confident in your ability to keep the machine in top-notch condition. Just don&#39;t forget to check the oil, or you&#39;ll risk destroying your new power tool.","The Honda trimmer only accepts one kind of an attachment â€“ a brush blade that comes with its own debris shield. You can also accessorize with a single harness. The blade, safety shield and harness come standard with purchase. The best trimmers accept more attachments.","Gas trimmers, like most machines with many moving parts, require maintenance from time to time. When you purchase the Honda trimmer, you can attempt repair jobs yourself by perusing the free online manual. You can also visit or call service centers for assistance, but you can&#39;t send an email to its manufacturer, American Honda Motor Co. Inc. The trimmer comes with a two-year warranty plus a lifetime driveshaft warranty."]},"id":"a7f8b710-dda2-40bf-99e2-d8fe2cf3aee8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ac6a8d32-1d32-44e5-b357-2140852c17b9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Honda HHT25SLTAT is powerful and reliable, but it lacks the customization options that many residential landscaping pros look for in a yard trimmer.
