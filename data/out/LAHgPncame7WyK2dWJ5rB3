This free media player software is surprisingly fast and does not use much CPU power. Unfortunately, its playable files are limited, and it does not have many support options.","ALLPlayer 6.2 does not require a lot to run. If you are using Windows 8 or higher, you’ll have no problem running the software. However, make sure not to install the optional bloatware, as that could slow down your computer. After installing the software, we placed our test DVD in the disc drive and were happy to see ALLPlayer recognize and start playing the movie in 18 seconds. This is significantly faster than most of the paid DVD players. While playing a movie in full screen, the program only used 9 percent of our computer’s available CPU power. If you want to watch a movie while working on homework or browsing the web, you won’t have to worry about any system slowing or stuttering while using ALLPlayer.","Despite its name, the base version of this fast DVD player software does not play all file types. Although it can read DVDs, WMVs, MPEG-4s, and RealVideo files, it cannot play DVD-ISO image archives, high-definition H.264 files or VC-1 videos. It also cannot play high-end Dolby or DTS file types. According to the support representative we spoke to, all other file types can be read if the user downloads additional plugins. Advanced users won’t have a problem doing this, but beginners may have trouble finding and installing the additional plug-ins.","The image quality of the software was underwhelming, and our test DVD looked pixelated during playback. The software features several extra tools that make it easy to use, including digital zooming, parental controls and playback that picks up where you last watched. It does not include playback smoothing or region changing.","The software does not include any built-in support documentation or automatic upgrades, and the only way to contact support is by email. We received a response to our email fairly quickly, and we suspect that you’ll get whatever information you need in one or two emails."]},"id":"d84e8b6c-b0e9-4453-8961-df8ccb86e0c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f29e3b8c-3a81-4636-b74e-934a57282008","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ALLPlayer 6.2 is free media player software with some great tools and strong performance.
