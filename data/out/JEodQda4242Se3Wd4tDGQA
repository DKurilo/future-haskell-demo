To evaluate the best tire brands, I compared the prices, available options and tread-mile warranties on the most common tire sizes for sedans, SUVs and trucks. From this evaluation, General Tire emerged as a generally average brand to fit the rather bland name. However, the 45-day road test period stands out against most of the competitors&#39; 30-day road test periods. That said, its parent company, Continental, offers 60-days to test out new tires. ","General Tire&#39;s sedan sized tires cost an average of $95 per tire. This is about $6 cheaper than the market average for the same size tire. The SUV tire size averages about $151 per tire. Only <a href=\"/cooper-discoverer-a-t3-review\">Cooper</a> and <a href=\"/hankook-optimo-h727-review\">Hankook</a> have better priced SUV tires. For the common truck sizes, General Tire averaged $173 per tire. This is the lowest average price for a truck tire. However, with relatively few truck tire options to fit common sizes, some brands with more variety have more affordable options.","General Tire&#39;s tread-life warranty covers 19 tire series. This is about average and doesn’t cover winter tires. The best tread-life warranty, covering the AltiMAX, has a mileage of 75,000 miles. The average warranty has about 57,000 expected miles. By comparison, most tire brands&#39; best tread-life mileage is about 83,500 miles with an overall average of 56,000 miles.","The performance options with General Tire are underwhelming. Each rim size had below-average options. The 15-inch rim averaged just two options; the 16-inch rim averaged four options; and the 17-inch rim averaged three options. By comparison, most brands had at least four, seven and five options, respectively. To put it simply, General Tire typically has an all-season tire and a winter tire to fit your vehicle&#39;s wheels, but not many options beyond that.","The truck tire options are also below average with an average of three options. One common truck size, 245/70R17, had seven performance options. This was the most options General Tire had for any of the tires I researched. By comparison, the best brands had twice as many options fitting this same size tire. However, other truck tire sizes were often only two or three. One size, 215/85R16, had no options at all.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>In many ways, General Tire is a middling tire brand. The tires aren&#39;t expensive, but they aren&#39;t the most affordable either. The tread-life warranties show the tires are expected to last, but they aren&#39;t eye-popping warranties either. The biggest issue is the lack of performance options. If you enter a tire size in the search tool and there&#39;s only one or two options, you&#39;re less likely to find the tire to fit your performance needs."]},"id":"970c7dcb-f4b5-4d4d-8075-0c38efd9bc54","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67971","url":"/general-tire-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-13T17:37:22Z","datePublished":"2016-06-13T17:37:22Z","name":"General Tire","synopsis":"Founded in 1915 alongside four other major tire manufacturers in Akron, Ohio, General Tire was purchased by the German tire brand, Continental in the late 1980's.","review":{"rating":74,"verdict":"General Tire is an affordable tire brand with average tread-life warranties and limited performance options per size, but the road test period is good.","pros":["Every tire has a 45-day road test period."],"cons":["The performance options per size are very limited."]},"strapline":"Founded in 1915 alongside four other major tire manufacturers in Akron, Ohio, General Tire was purchased by the German tire brand, Continental in the late 1980's.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-09T00:00:00Z","id":"JEodQda4242Se3Wd4tDGQA","meta":{"title":"General Tire Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Altimax Arctic is a snow tire from General Tire.
