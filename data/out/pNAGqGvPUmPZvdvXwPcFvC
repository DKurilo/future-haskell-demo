It has a very intuitive user interface, especially if you’re upgrading from VEGAS’ consumer-level application, VEGAS Movie Studio. It excels at creating visual special effects, 3D titling and compositing, and it even allows you to author DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Its ever-expanding tool set makes it a good choice for pro video editors who want the power and granular control needed to make the high-quality videos demanded by their audience.","VEGAS Pro has all the features professional editors need to create their video projects. Tools like chroma key, white balance, image stabilization, stereoscopic 3D editing, multicam editing and masking are all present and work well. If you’re a new editor, it may take you a while to get the hang of all the tools VEGAS Pro has to offer. Fortunately, this pro video editor has built-in interactive tutorials that show you how many of the tools work. So, even if you’re not a pro, you can learn to use this program effectively if you’re willing to put in the time it takes to learn.","Proxy-first workflow is one of the features that make this software a unique entry in our lineup. This tool allows crews in remote locations to send proxy footage back to their home base for editing with a camera-mounted adapter. This is an amazing tool because it allows editors to begin work on footage only moments after it’s captured from pretty much anywhere in the world. The only requirement is an internet connection.","Another unique tool is the VEGAS Pro Connect iPad app. This app lets you perform basic desktop functions on your tablet. For example, you can control playback, drop markers and collaborate with other editors who also have the app. You can even download a proxy version of your project to take with you. Then you can play back your project and make notes that sync when you connect with the desktop app again. This is a great collaborative tool.","This professional video editor also features intelligent upscaling, which means you can take your regular HD footage and enlarge it to 4K resolution. This is great because it allows you to use footage that may be older with clips filmed with the newest ultra-high-resolution cameras. This is good because VEGAS Pro has extended its camera support to include the RED digital cinema cameras.","One thing that may dissuade from buying this program is its price tag. At the time of this writing, the program will run you about $600. That’s about $150 more than the next most expensive application and more than twice that of industry-standard programs like <a href=\"/adobe-premiere-pro-review\">Adobe Premiere</a>, <a href=\"/final-cut-pro-review\">Final Cut Pro</a> and <a href=\"/media-composer-review\">Media Composer</a>.","It’s worth noting that VEGAS Pro was sold by Sony to MAGIX, which makes its own professional video editor. Since MAGIX took over, VEGAS has improved dramatically, introducing previously omitted features such as motion tracking, video stabilization, dynamic media bins and more.","VEGAS Pro is a worthy entry in our review of the best professional video editing software. It has all the tools and features you need to create highly polished projects, from YouTube videos to feature films. All you have to do is learn how to use it properly and the sky is the limit."]},"id":"904df510-d3bd-4f28-b875-e0c28994b3e9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54648","url":"/sony-vegas-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
