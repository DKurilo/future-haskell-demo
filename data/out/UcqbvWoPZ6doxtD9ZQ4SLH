Many of the <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaners</a> we compared were very good at one or two things and bad at a lot of others. This machine was not as flashy as some or particularly amazing at anything; however, it was noticeably above average for almost everything we measured except for price, noise and weight.","Our tests confirmed that it cleans effectively. With each pass, you can feel it scrubbing and doing its job. It cleared dried grape juice in just four passes, which means that it ttied for the second best in our comparison. It was also second best for water extraction, collecting 28 ounces in the same amount of time as it took some of the machines in our comparison to collect 10 ounces. It also has a heated air feature to help dry carpets even faster. Soggy carpets are one common complaint about using these machines, so getting water extraction right is a huge win for the Power Scrub.","This unit has a good price tag. You can find it for less than $150. That is more than fair for what you get. It offers lots of cleaning power for each dollar of that investment.","The cleaning path is over 11 inches, which will help you cover a lot of ground quickly but is not so wide it makes storage inconvenient. The cord length is only average compared to others, but 20 feet should be plenty. The tank capacity is 4 quarts, so you won&#39;t have to stop and empty it constantly, but it is not so big that the machine is heavy and hard to move.","This is not the lightest machine we compared, but it was still easy to steer around obstacles. It also has a built-in handle that will make it more portable if you need to take it up and down stairs.","The Power Scrub was easy to set up. There was no need to measure soap and water. You just fill the tank with each and the machine mixes it in the proper amounts for you. This machine is also easy to clean. It pulls apart in the spots that matter so you can empty and clean the tank, clean the brushes and refill it with little effort.","Carpet cleaners aren’t quiet, but some of them were so loud and high-pitched that we wanted earplugs just to stand near them. There were a couple machines that were quieter, including the <a href=\"/bissell-powerforce-review\">Bissell PowerLifter Powerbrush</a> and the <a href=\"/rug-doctor-review\">Rug Doctor Deep Carpet Cleaner</a>. That being said, however, the Power Scrub was not painfully loud. ","This carpet cleaner comes with a long hose and a nice selection of attachments for cleaning your whole home, not just your carpeting. You get an upholstery tool, stair tool, crevice tool and spinning brush tool for stubborn messes. They can all be stored in a mesh bag that comes with the cleaner and hooks onto the machine. It lacks any specific brushes for getting the edges when cleaning carpets, but it seemed to get far enough into the corners in its normal mode. However, if you are picky about that, you can break out the hose and crevice tool for a trip around the edges. ","Hoover backs up this product with lots of customer service options and a 2-year warranty. There were units with longer warranty coverage, but 2 years seems fitting for this machine&#39;s price point."]},"id":"30468359-d61f-48ac-87ec-30fb12295ed3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58128","url":"/hoover-power-scrub-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T16:09:14Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T16:09:14Z","name":"Hoover Power Scrub FH50150NC","synopsis":"The Hoover Power Scrub offers the right mix of features and capabilities at the right price.
