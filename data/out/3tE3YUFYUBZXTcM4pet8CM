You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Calphalon electric toaster comes in two- and four-slice models. The <a href=\"/best-toasters\">four-slice toaster</a> includes dual toasting controls. This is good if you cook for people with different toasting tastes because you can make toast on two different shade settings simultaneously. The Calphalon has nine shade settings. The shade dial does allow you to select a setting between the nine preset levels. This will help you to find your desired browning level.","It has the standard toasting functions included on most electric toasters: a bagel function, a defrost function and a cancel button. It also has a reheat function, a premium feature found in the best toasters we reviewed. If you don’t get to your toast quickly and it becomes cold after the toasting cycle, the reheat cycle on the toaster will warm the toast without browning it any further.","The toaster includes cool-touch sides, so you can use the toaster without fear of burning your hands while touching the toasting controls. Be aware, however, the cool-touch design is only applied to the sides of the toaster. The top does become hot during the toasting cycle. The Calphalon does have high-lift slots to help with this problem. The high-lift slots lift the toast out of the slots so you don&#39;t need to reach down inside to retrieve smaller pieces of bread, like an English muffin.","The dark plastic sides of the Calphalon do make it look like cheaper electric toasters. This toaster wouldn&#39;t earn a permanent place your countertop if you’re looking at it strictly from a design aesthetic point of view. This toaster does have a hideaway cord and removable crumb trays, which are both features we like to see on toasters of this quality. The crumb tray helps you to clean up quickly, and the hideaway cord lets you store it without the unraveled cord taking up any addition room. The toaster also weighs just 6 pounds, which is lighter than similar toasters. That makes it easier for you to move it around the kitchen.","The Calphalon toaster includes a one-year manufacturer’s warranty. This is a standard warranty for a kitchen appliance. It is a limited warranty that covers only product defects and not wear and tear. Calphalon includes a FAQs section, an email form and a support phone number on its website. If you do have any questions about your toaster, Calphalon provides resources to answer them."]},"id":"adf5d18b-1096-4085-92d5-703314a71caa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c978dd9d-69b8-4f21-84d1-e839079e413b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Calphalon is a well-built toaster that includes cool-touch sides and a reheat function.
