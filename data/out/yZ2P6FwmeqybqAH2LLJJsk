This freestanding electric range is small enough to fit in small kitchens, and its finished sides mean it looks in place anywhere you put it. It also weighs significantly less than electric ranges of similar size. The Hotpoint RB780RH is a basic range with all the standard features you expect. The ceramic glass cooktop has four burners and easy controls, but this model lacks extra features like expandable burners. Still, this is a good option to consider if you want an electric range with a smooth stovetop on a budget.","This kitchen range weighs only 145 pounds, making the Hotpoint the lightest option in our lineup. Standing 47.5 inches tall, 29.87 inches wide and 28.75 deep, this stove and oven combination is small enough to fit in tiny apartment kitchens. This is also a freestanding model, which means you can surround the oven with cabinets or leave the sides exposed. The Hotpoint is available in standard appliance colors: solid white, black and stainless steel with black.","There are two 6-inch and two 8-inch burners on the stovetop. Unfortunately, none of the four burners expand to a larger size, but each packs a modest amount of power. The two 6-inch burners produce 1,500 watts while the larger elements reach 2,000 watts of power. This is lower on the power scale for similar ranges, so tasks like boiling and searing may take longer with this range. The control panel has two indicator lights to warn you when the surface is hot or the oven is on.","The oven chamber holds up to 5 cubic feet inside. This is enough space to create meals for a small family, but this oven&#39;s lack of power may make preparing large meals take longer than you want. The baking element churns out 2,585 watts of baking power while the broiling element produces 3,410 watts. The four-pass elements on each of these produce some power, but neither compare to other models with wattage in the 4,000s. Inside the oven, there are two racks and six different notches on which to arrange them. You can slide these racks up or down the chamber to accommodate large cookware.","Whether you have a powerful range or something a little more modest, in-oven spills are inevitable. While the Hotpoint is basic, it still has a self-cleaning mode. The automatic self-clean heats the oven chamber to soaring temperatures, burning and crisping any baked-on residue, since ashes are easier to clean than baked-on lasagna. When the auto clean is active, the cycling light will illuminate to warn you of the high temperatures. You can also view a cool down time on the control display to know how long cleaning will last. The heat self-clean does take time, about three hours.","The Hotpoint doesn&#39;t have a convection fan to circulate heat through the chamber. If you&#39;re interested in an electric range out of necessity, this won&#39;t be much of an issue, but many avid cooks swear by the power of convection. The <a href=\"/lg-electronics-review\">LG RE3083</a> is one of the electric ranges in our lineup with convection functionality.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Hotpoint RB780RH is a basic range. It lacks extra features like a convection fan, expandable burners and extra wattage power. Its finished sides, small size and low price make it a good choice for remodeling on a budget, especially if you don&#39;t cook very often but still want a flat-top stove. It is a valid option for small kitchens."]},"id":"39af7757-2a85-4429-a0d0-cce864cd56fd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64739","url":"/hotpoint-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-07T21:16:03Z","datePublished":"2015-05-07T21:16:03Z","name":"Hotpoint RB780RH","synopsis":"The small size and low price of the Hotpoint RB780RH allow you to overhaul your kitchen and get a new electric range at the same time.
