You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Parrot MINIKIT SLIM <a href=\"/best-bluetooth-car-kits\">Bluetooth car kit</a> is simplistic in design and functionally, but we appreciate this simplicity in the ever-complicated world of electronics. We love that this Bluetooth car kit, while not bursting with high-profile features, will meet all your essential needs from a Bluetooth device while still keeping you safe while you drive.","On the Parrot MINIKIT SLIM website, they state that any Bluetooth-capable phone will be compatible with this Bluetooth car kit. However, there&#39;s also a compatibility page on the product website where phone models of well-known brands such as Apple, Samsung and Motorola are listed as having been tested and found compatible with this Bluetooth car kit. While the list is pretty extensive, it does not include every phone in the known universe. Although they claim universal Bluetooth compatibility, it might be wise to take a moment and make sure you&#39;re phone has made the &#34;tested and compatible&#34; list.","This Bluetooth car kit has a unique button setup that proves to be quite tricky to operate and requires some time to get used to. There are two main buttons on either side of the &#34;jog wheel&#34; located in the center of the Bluetooth kit. In order to access the menu, volume control or phonebook, the jog wheel must be pressed a certain number of times to get to each destination. In order to place a call, you must first access the phonebook with the jog wheel. In order to find your desired contact, you must use the wheel to click through to the first letter of your contact&#39;s name. The wheel is very sensitive, so the slightest of touch must be used to reach your target function.","OK, we know that sounded tedious, and it definitely can be; fortunately, there&#39;s another way to access your Bluetooth functions, a simpler way: voice recognition. Press the green key on the right side of the jog wheel to launch the &#34;voice recognition&#34; feature. From this point, you can access all of the contacts in your phone book via voice prompts (that is, if your phone supports this feature. If not, the jog wheel must still be used).","The feature list for this Bluetooth car kit is simplistic, much like its design, but it will handle all of your one-the-go communications needs with ease. One feature we miss seeing with this device is the battery indicator light. Instead of the indicator light, a series of beeps occurs to warn the driver of a low battery.","We found the jog wheel feature to be an odd navigation tool, but one could learn to love it, particularly if their phone does not support the voice prompt feature. For the majority of phones that will support the voice recognition feature, we prefer this technique. When any contact who is programmed into your phone calls you, or you call them, their name will be announced. This is, of course, only if your phone supports voice announcing. If not, you will just hear the phone number.","We appreciate Parrot considering both the American and other populations into consideration, offering voice announcements in over 19 languages.","Simplicity is the key element of the Parrot MINIKIT SLIM. The Bluetooth car kit&#39;s front is almost empty except for the two buttons and jog wheel at the very top of the device. The design looks almost cheap in comparison to many of its counterparts, but its simplistic design may appeal to many.","On the front of the MINIKIT SLIM, you will find a:","Green button: This button answers calls, places calls from the phonebook, jumpstarts the voice recognition feature and handles dual calls.","Red button: The red button hangs up calls, switches the device on and off, cancels functions and exits out of any jog wheel menu you are accessing.","Rotary button (or jog wheel): accesses the menus, adjusts the volume and, when the voice recognition feature has not been activated, finds the contact names in your phonebook.","Parrot has made sure that all customers, new to this product or not, will have easy access to any information needed to answer a simple question. They can also upload the firmware and find step-by-step pairing directions. One help option that we love is the &#34;ParrotNorthAmerica&#39;s Channel&#34; on YouTube. Here, videos illustrating features and setup tips have been produced to reach all audiences.","Although not as in-depth as many of its counterparts, the MINIKIT SLIM user manual provides enough information in its 10-page length to answer most, if not all, setup and early use questions."]},"id":"d16f5a32-bdb7-4e7d-a427-9ecb5af7eaee","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29f52f02-c2b5-49b0-be8b-beaf5bd5727b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Simplistic.
