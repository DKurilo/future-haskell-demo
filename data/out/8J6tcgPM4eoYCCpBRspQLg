It displays your speed and distance travelled, along with other factors that measure the ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. With ANT+ sensor compatibility, it can also monitor your biometrics while you train. Though its design is simple, it is decently easy to use and does a solid job tracking the basics for bike GPS units in this class.","The Super GPS feels fairly well made and durable, and its interface is intuitive for the most part. It has a monochrome display that features adjustable backlighting, which is useful when riding in especially light or dark conditions. And you don’t have to search through a menu to adjust the brightness; there’s a dedicated button on the device. You control the other bike GPS features with the buttons located on either side, which are visibly labeled and make the device a bit easier to use.","One of the best parts of the Super GPS is its outstanding battery life, which is rated for 24 hours. While most other cycling computers last just 12 to 15 hours with standard usage, having a longer-lasting battery is great for those who are marathon trainers.","While the Super GPS doesn’t have fully detailed maps that can display things like street names, it does have simple preloaded maps. You’ll see a line representing your path and an icon representing you as you ride, and the device will display basic data about your progress along the course. It also offers turn-by-turn navigation so you can easily explore new paths without worrying about getting lost. There is also live tracking and Strava segments if you like to incorporate those elements into your training regimens.","The cycle computer can store up to 400 hours of your ride data and courses, so you can compete against your past performances on a loaded course and track your new progress. It is also one of the most customizable devices on the market, letting you customize alerts, auto presets, fields and page counts.","Like other bike GPS units, the Super GPS ships with a one-year warranty. You can contact Lezyne’s customer support representatives via phone or email with questions, but there’s no live chat support option. You can also peruse the myriad of informational resources on the manufacturer website, which include a FAQs section and tutorials."]},"id":"7f975e43-8543-4690-8dbe-b2d567ff65ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3ec9e26b-d8ba-42b9-a9a3-d613beaceca1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lezyne Super GPS is a solid budget-friendly cycling computer.
