However, they were pleasantly proven wrong when putting the Victorinox SwissTool Spirit X to the test. It performed exceptionally well in trials and relative to other full-function multi-tools tested.","At first glance, this Swiss Army multi-tool is a less obvious member of the Victorinox family with an iconic red grip with white cross logo. The simple stainless steel design simply means business and performance. It proved to one of the best multi-tools tested.","The SwissTool consistently powered through trial scenarios and performed better than many of its competitors with fewer functions. All the tools this Victorinox multi-tool offers means that they are nestled tightly together, so unlocking and unfolding each of can take practice. The narrower handles can also head to pinched hands and fingers if you aren&#39;t paying attention.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Performance","<strong>Best For:</strong> Casual to demanding tasks, including backcountry adventures, rescue and survival situations","<strong>Tester&#39;s Comments:</strong> “This tool is a wolf in sheep’s clothing with a wide array of high-performing tools in a compact package. Carrying it is a joy, size-wise, while the overall look is more surgical than stoke-inducing. Put it to work and the anticipated disappointment ends with the first bend, cut, drive or saw. Say yes to this one, come what may in your world at home or away. Active Junky gives it two thumbs-up.”","<strong>Trial Results</strong>"]},"id":"bb09498e-d707-4062-87ee-1aa9213458a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Point Break:</strong> Only two squeezes with a single handgrip successfully severed the wire. It control is acceptable, but be careful of hand pinching during use.","<strong>Around the Bend: </strong>Fairly easy to manipulate wire into S bend with no noticeable jaw deflection and above-average power.","<strong>Rope &#39;Em In: </strong>The thinner knife blade provided the cleanest cut of any other multi-tool tested and required little effort to cut and maintain control.","<strong>No Turning Back: </strong>This tool provided stable and consistent torque while using the driver head. The screw head reached mid-level screw depth with minimal blade slippage.","<strong>Eyes on the Pries:</strong> Testers selected the short, sharpened blade for the prying test, with its locking mechanism to provide stability and power transfer. However, patience is a virtue with this blade&#39;s smaller width.","<strong>Lumberjack Olympics:</strong> The saw blade&#39;s tooth configuration made steady progress. The blade locked in place and made clean carves but only offered minimal wood penetration."],"type":"ul"},"id":"0d9d7714-6f11-458b-96c8-3eb55a1ece34","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67968","url":"/victorinox-swisstool-spirit-x-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-10T19:37:05Z","datePublished":"2016-06-10T19:37:05Z","name":"Victorinox SwissTool Spirit X","synopsis":"With 26 functions and only 4 inches in length, Active Junky testers were at first skeptical about the performance of this multi-tool.
