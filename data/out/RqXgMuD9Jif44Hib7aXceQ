Macs remain fairly safe from viruses, so the emphasis of this Mac antivirus software is to protect you from phishing swindles and social networking website attacks so that you maintain control of your identity and personal information. McAfee doesn&#39;t offer the best virus protection for Mac products. However, like the best Mac antivirus products, McAfee recognizes phishing sites and rates them with a risk factor color code. If anyone tries to send you infected files, it scans and attempts to clean them. It also tries to block threats from Apple Mail and iChat. If any threat arrives via an external drive, McAfee tries to block it. It also protects your friends and family because it will not let you send potentially damaging files or email. McAfee repairs and removes infections from files, and it understands how to neutralize viruses, Trojans, worms, bots and rootkits. Unfortunately, in tests conducted by independent software labs such as AV-Test, McAfee could not match the performance of the best antivirus products for Mac. Whereas a handful of Mac security software products achieved 100 percent detection rates at AV-Test, McAfee detected just 26.5 percent of the Mac malware samples it was exposed to.","Like some of the virus scanners for Mac, this Mac antivirus software includes a proprietary firewall. The firewall is not difficult to use. It lets you shut down all traffic in both directions if necessary, and it lets you define trusted networks. You can also establish rules about where specific kinds of traffic on your computer can go. Or you can block certain categories of traffic from entering.","McAfee provides a useful support webpage that directs you to technical support, customer service or services to do with virus removal. Online technical support is free. A virtual technician is able to diagnose and fix many problems. For those it cannot fix, it collects the data that will assist the person who helps you via live chat. Telephone support is also available if the McAfee Virtual Technician cannot resolve a problem. An active and supportive user community is also hosted online, and it is well organized. As long as you maintain your product subscription, updates are continuous and automatic."]},"id":"c0467ddf-569d-4431-bbd6-a6824cfd086e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"67ebe63c-7682-4313-8b73-a5c2deb2f88e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["McAfee Internet Security for Mac helps Mac users where they are most vulnerable: phishing attempts to steal your personal identity.
