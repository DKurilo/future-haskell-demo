Although they don&#39;t have a passive mode or noise cancelling, this set is well designed for long-term wear and compact storage.","The sound quality of the Creative WP-450 headphones is about average for an on-ear design. The frequency response is 18Hz to 22kHz, which is a bit wider than the best Bluetooth headphones. However, there is no noise-cancelling function so you&#39;ll be able to hear a lot of extra noise from your environment.","As an on-ear design, these headphones are some of the lightest. Since they only weigh 4 ounces, much less than comparable headsets, you can wear them without getting a headache. However, on-ear designs do heat up since they sit right on your ears and can be uncomfortable after a while. You can use the WP-450 headphones to make and receive calls. The calls are clear since these headphones cup your ears. One drawback is the microphone is located in the right ear cup, so it is a little far away from your mouth. Those you call may notice your voice sounds a bit muffled, but they should still be able to understand you.","The button layout is similar to many other Bluetooth headphones. The track forward/back button along with the volume button are housed on the inner lip of the right ear cup, making them easy to access and memorize by touch. The outside of the ear cup has the pause/play button and the call button. The WP-450s will only last around eight to nine hours on one charge, which is low for top Bluetooth headphones.","The Creative WP-450s have a wireless range up to 33 feet so you can move around without losing connection with your Bluetooth device. Also, aptX technology improves sound quality that you normally wouldn&#39;t get with Bluetooth headphones. These headphones are also one of the only set of our Bluetooth headphones reviews to not include a detachable cable. Without one, you won&#39;t be able to listen passively when your battery dies.","Creative has all your support bases covered. These headphones have a one-year warranty and you can download drivers and manuals from the Creative site. Creative does provide a technical support email, but there is no phone number listed on the website. The Creative site is fully loaded with discussion forums and FAQs, and you can follow Creative on Facebook and Twitter, giving you more access to answers and troubleshooting information."]},"id":"ddbbb9ca-f67b-4461-8939-6157ecdde5b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e189b325-65bf-43da-9b1d-125daf39102f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Creative WP-450 Bluetooth headphones have clear call quality and an intuitive button design that makes it easy to navigate.
