You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sharper Image offers a <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">slide to digital image converter</a> that connects via USB to your personal computer. This 4-in-1 Digital Image Converter converts your photos, slides and negatives using 5-megapixel image sensor that captures images in just five seconds. If you have hundreds or thousands of slides to digitize, this is an important feature. It includes software for adjusting exposure and color balance, so correcting flaws is easy.","Compared to other converters on our lineup, this Sharper Image slide converter has a relatively low-resolution 5 megapixels. This converter is comparable to most others in its ease of use. It is also compact and easy to move when needed.","Unlike many of the converters we reviewed, the Sharper Image does not work independent of a computer. You will need to connect it to your PC via the USB port in order for the converter to function and same images. This converter does not come with a display screen, and there is not TV-out jack, so the only way to view the images you take is on your computer screen. Since your images are saved directly to a PC, you do not really need one.","There is no integrated memory and no SD card slot. When this unit converts slides to digital files, it saves them directly to your PC. Converting media and saving images directly to a PC without the hassle of using a memory card can be a good thing. With a USB cable, you simply plug in the unit. You do not have to install software to use the device, but if you want to use the editing features, you will have to install the included software. In testing, we found installing the software to be simple. It was easy to use and worked well.","The Sharper Image includes all of the components you need to start converting. It comes with a 135 mm and 110 mm film holder, one slide holder and one photo holder.","The converter, it comes with a one-year warranty. You will find a FAQs page, customer service number and an email address located on the Sharper Image website. The FAQs page is not overly helpful with troubleshooting issues. It has general company information rather than product support. Although we found it frustrating getting through to a person, we found the agents to be knowledgeable once getting through."]},"id":"4db03b27-2460-4231-ae15-4beac719599e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a4b6a53d-4e3c-4c5c-97e0-09087dcdcd0c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This unit works well if you are interested in transferring media directly to your PC.
