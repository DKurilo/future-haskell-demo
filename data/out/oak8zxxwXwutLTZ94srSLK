You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","While the Yamaha Pocketrak PR7 has features that allow it to excel in common recording situations like lectures and interviews, it&#39;s designed with musicians in mind. The crossed XY microphone records audio comparable to the <a href=\"/best-digital-voice-recorders\">best digital voice recorders</a> so that you capture your harmonies and melodies accurately. It even comes with the WaveLab LE audio-editing software so that you can edit the audio further. However, its ability to only record to two tracks limits it somewhat.","It records in a high-fidelity 16- or 24-bit linear PCM format. The crossed XY microphone design provides excellent accuracy in the localization and depth of the audio, which makes it excellent at picking up live performances or differentiating between voices in a meeting. The only downside to the design is the lack of adjustability. In some situations, you may want an uncrossed setup to achieve a different ambient effect on the recording or broaden the reach.","For musicians and songwriters, a portable recorder can be a powerful tool, and the PR7&#39;s strengths lie in this area. It has a metronome, allowing you to practice and record to specific time signatures. The metronome is an excellent way of experimenting with how a melody sounds with different tempos. It also features a tuner, which can help tune instruments like guitars or make sure your voice is in tune.","You can record up to two tracks per audio file. This is better than most digital voice recorders, which only allow you to record to one stereo track, but not by much. It gives you the ability to record a left track and a right track separately. The best handheld recorders allow you to record up to eight tracks, which you can mix to a single audio track. And while it has a 3.5-mm mic and line input that allows you to add an external microphone or keyboard, it lacks the higher-quality XLR/TRS inputs. In addition, when you plug into the mic and line input, the built-in microphones are disabled, which limits your ability to record onto the two tracks.","It comes with 2GB of internal storage with the ability to add up to 32GB of external storage through an SDHC card, which is approximately 50 hours of high-quality 16-bit audio. It also has a 29.5-hour battery life, which is above average. However, the battery isn&#39;t rechargeable."]},"id":"8129c7bb-576b-4eb4-80ed-71de93fdbd35","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b8b34c57-84e7-4fff-a5f7-4396d1d22013","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Yamaha Pocketrak PR7 is great for simple recording situations like dictations, lectures and meetings, and it also excels as a tool for musicians and songwriters with features like a metronome and tuner.
