You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo manager software</a> that has a wide variety of editing tools; however, these tools are not as easy to use as those in other products we reviewed are. Some of the tools make you work through a preview window instead of showing you the changes in real time. The preview image takes a moment to update with some of the editing tools.","You&#39;ll find the same types of editing tools in Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 that you would in other photo manager software we reviewed, but the delay in some of the tools makes them less useful. Additionally, the controls are not as convenient to use as the controls in other software we reviewed are. For instance, the highlight, mid-tone and shadow tools only have number values you can adjust instead of a sliding bar. We also had some difficulty adjusting the depth of field to achieve the look we wanted.","PaintShop Photo Pro X3 lets you tag your photos with keywords, search for file names and rate your photos. If you have several photos of the same subject, you can group them together in a stack. This digital photo management software allows you to stack your images so you can find them quicker. PaintShop Photo Pro X3 makes it easy to move between the organizing and editing portions of the software.","You can use this application to share your photos and videos with friends and family on Facebook, Flickr and YouTube. To share your photos and videos, you&#39;ll need to use the Project Creator software that comes with Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3. Since you have to take this extra step to share your photos, it may be faster to add them to your social networking site pages yourself instead of using the separate software.","PaintShop Photo Pro X3 preserves RAW files from your digital camera so you can maintain the rich, authentic colors that you captured. Once you import your photos into this photo manager software, you can see the metadata for each photo. You can change files names and assign organizational tags to help you find the pictures in the future.","Many of the tools allow you to view the changes you make to your photos in the image itself instead of through a small preview screen. The menu to alter the photos covers part of the image, which makes precise adjustments more difficult. It takes some time for the changes to update, especially with the depth-of-field tool. The Express Lab and Full Editor have different layouts. It may be confusing to work with both interfaces.","This photo manager software is compatible with Windows 7, Vista and XP operating systems. It isn&#39;t compatible with Macs, however. Most of the photo manager software we reviewed is only compatible with Windows operating systems.","Corel has a learning center and a help section with a search feature. The manufacturer also provides email and phone support. You can find a manual and product tutorials online."]},"id":"cb247b05-ee63-4379-b575-18a891307e38","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f2014b04-c8f7-448b-be32-9c1483faa88f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 can help you take your photos from over exposed and grainy to vibrant and smooth.
