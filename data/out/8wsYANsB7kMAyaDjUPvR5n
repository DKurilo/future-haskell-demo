While it offers good massaging action and versatility for cleaning, it doesn&#39;t massage your legs and has only limited massage action types.","The uComfy Shiatsu Foot Massager with Heat weighs 12 pounds and measures 17.7 x 15 x 18.1 inches, so it isn&#39;t a portable model, although it is small enough to stow in a large bag or a suitcase if necessary. You slip your feet inside the foot openings, so the device provides massaging action all around your feet, apart from the heels. If you have large or wide feet, the machine may feel tight or restrictive, and, when activated, the massage action may pinch and exert an uncomfortable amount of pressure. Additionally, those with large feet may find they cannot get their whole foot inside the unit.","To increase versatility, this model has five different intensity settings, ensuring you get a comforting massage rather than a painful one. The graduated intensity settings also allow you to slowly increase the intensity of the massage during the course of the program. However, there are no program presets and you cannot make your own automatic program. Instead, you have to bend forward and manipulate the controls located on the center console during your massage.","This shiatsu foot massager has a kneading shiatsu-style massage and a vibration massage. It doesn&#39;t have rollers for a reflexology massage for your soles, but it does have a heat option to help loosen your muscles and increase comfort. You can use a single option or combine two or more settings, which increases versatility. For easy maintenance and improved hygiene, the foot covers are removable via zippers and are machine washable. Because this machine plugs into a power outlet, the length of the cord restricts where you can use it. The presence of four feet on the base of the machine means you can safely use it on a carpeted surface without the motor overheating, as air can circulate all around.","The uComfy Shiatsu Foot Massager with Heat is a high-end model that offers massage to the feet but not the legs. If you&#39;re looking for something that pays more attention to yourÂ  calves, you&#39;ll want to look at the <a href=\"/human-touch-review\">Human Touch Reflex Pro</a> instead. The uComfy offers varying intensity settings and some different massage actions."]},"id":"43717f7e-febc-4de0-9521-b5813690e4bd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63301","url":"/ucomfy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T14:31:16Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T14:31:16Z","name":"uComfy Shiatsu Foot Massager with Heat","synopsis":"The uComfy Shiatsu Foot Massager with Heat offers multiple massage intensity settings and provides massage action to the tops and bottoms of the feet.
