The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 <a href=\"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters\">VHS to DVD Converters</a> here.</em>","The number of problems we ran into when testing the KWorld DVD Maker was impressive, landing this VCR to DVD converter close to the bottom of our lineup. It’s difficult to use with Windows Vista and Windows 7, and it is incompatible with the included PowerDirector and PowerProducer software. Essentially, if you’re using Windows XP with Windows Movie Maker, KWorld will work; otherwise, look for another product.","KWorld DVD Maker includes many standard features that you’d find in other VHS to DVD converters: S-video and composite cables, a USB connector and so on. Strangely, it also comes with an additional audio connector, which is rather confusing when compared to other converters.","We could not install the correct drivers on our Windows Vista or Windows 7 machines; we were only able to finally get the converter to work once we switched to our old Windows XP computer, and even then we still had problems. Once we got all of the kinks worked out, we were able to convert our tapes to DVDs without too many complaints.","The KWorld DVD Maker would not install the drivers on a Windows Vista computer. We tried contacting customer support, and we tried several different Vista machines with no luck. When we used the KWorld DVD Maker on our Windows XP machine, we were able to use the product with Windows Movie Maker, but we still ran into problems when we tried to use the software that is included with the purchase of VHS to DVD converters.","If you&#39;re willing to accept that the KWorld DVD Maker will not work well on Vista or with the software provided, then it is easy to use. However, it took us hours to discover that it is impossible to use the product with the included software and that it is not compatible with most other software. Why a product would be shipped with incompatible software is beyond us.","If you only want to use this product with Windows Movie Maker on an XP machine, it is fantastically easy to use. Simply plug in the KWorld DVD Maker and insert the driver CD. Download the driver, restart your computer and you will be able to use the device with Windows products. Don’t waste your time trying to use the included software, though.","Be sure to keep track of the CD with the drivers because we had to reinstall the drivers every few days for the KWorld VHS to DVD converters. Since the drivers are not easily available online, keeping the CD at hand is imperative.","To use any of the help options, including downloading drivers, you have to sign up and verify your KWorld account. There is a FAQs section, user&#39;s manuals and drivers on the manufacturer’s website. There is no online chat or telephone support. Instead, KWorld offers an online ticket system where you leave a complaint or question. We left three different questions, one of which was answered almost a week after we posted it, and the solution did not solve any of the problems we had with the software."]},"id":"4b867963-6778-4bb9-a39a-989cdaa5602d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"82eee254-2134-4def-9c04-4db08bb19321","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KWorld DVD Maker is difficult to use, there are few help options and the video capture device is not compatible with most software and some operating systems."]},"id":"ad09a617-6449-4d17-807f-222c6ba683fd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49800","url":"/kworld-dvd-maker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
