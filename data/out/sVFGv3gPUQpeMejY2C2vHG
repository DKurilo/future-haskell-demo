There’s certainly no downside to having the increased functionality.","This PC camera is also able to produce high-resolution still images. The HD Pro boasts the highest megapixel count of any camera in our review at 15 megapixels. Like most webcams, it achieves this through interpolation – a process by which the camera uses algorithms that add pixels to artificially enlarge an image. Although you’re not going to achieve the level of quality you would when shooting at 15 megapixels natively, it’s still decent for a webcam.","In addition to surpassing the other units we tested when it comes to specs, the HD Pro also outperformed its competition. In our test, we looked for image sharpness, distortion, color accuracy and low-light performance. Unsurprisingly, this cam excelled in each of these areas and rendered the best footage in our comparison.","Audio is also very important when you’re looking at a webcam. Lifelike, high-quality video really works best when it’s accompanied by equally high-end audio. That’s why the HD Pro is fitted with two microphones, one on each side of the camera.
