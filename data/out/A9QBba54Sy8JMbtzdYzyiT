Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","BlackBerry has lead the smartphones market when it comes to multitasking and accomplishing business-oriented tasks. And the Blackberry Torch 9810 keeps BlackBerry lovers happy with a few improved business and organizational features, but that’s about it. The BlackBerry Torch features a touchscreen and QWERTY keyboard, an improved operating system and an average multimedia system. Unfortunately, smartphones do have their  flaws and this product has several. To learn about higher-ranked models, check out our side-by-side comparison of <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a>.","The overall design of the BlackBerry Torch 9810 is impressive, compared to other smartphones. Featuring a 3.2-inch touchscreen and a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, this device was designed to make navigation simple and quick. Below the touchscreen there is a trackpad. We like the trackpads on other BlackBerry devices but feel the touchscreen on this model is large enough to enable easy navigation without the need for one.","Thanks to a new operating system, this top smartphone features a pinch–to-zoom effect. By pinching your fingers on the display screen, you can zoom in and out of the display. This makes browsing the internet and reading emails much simpler and more user-friendly than other smartphones.","BlackBerry Torch 9810 provides several multimedia features but nothing too extraordinary. A 5MP (megapixel) camera with flash, along with auto-focus and image stabilization is featured on this phone. Also, the smartphone offers 11 photo modes and the ability to record video.","This device features an integrated social network and has the ability to access RSS feeds, as well as apps. A few featured apps included are Primetime2Go, Evernote and the Kobo eReader. It also includes a music player that allows you to view full-album art and track listings, which is a multimedia feature we like that is found on smartphones.","We didn’t have any problem with the calling features on this product. The calls are easy to hear and the calling menus are straightforward. Dialing a call, placing the call on hold or even 3-way calling is simple to do using this BlackBerry smartphone.","The battery life on the BlackBerry Torch 9810 is not nearly as strong as the Apple iPhone 4 or the Droid X. The BlackBerry 9810 features a battery life of 330 minutes and up to 432 hours of standby time. The phone didn’t seem to drain the battery too quickly for us, but of course the more frequently you use your phone, the quicker your battery is drained.","This smartphone provides 8GB of memory, which should get you fairly far, but it also has the ability to expand to 32GB with a micro SD card.","A vast improvement over previous BlackBerry operating systems, the Blackberry OS 7 is included on the Torch, which features new animations, graphics and a webkit-based browser. There are not a lot of differences between it and the interface of the OS 5, so BlackBerry users who want an upgrade won’t be confused in navigating the improved operating system.","Not only is the new BlackBerry OS 7 a great addition to the phone, the Torch provides a few additional features that give it a little security and pizzazz. For example, the 9810 provides password protection with a keyboard lock, which prevent others from going through your emails or other important documents. Also, a sleep mode is offered on the smartphone to avoid the battery from quickly draining."]},"id":"a0efcfcb-9f79-443d-a6f1-2c892de19fdb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7a4ba1ef-2762-4a5d-8f7a-155224b4a84e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BlackBerry Torch 9810 has a few new features, such as the BlackBerry OS 7, but it still doesn’t feel quite up to par with other smartphones.
