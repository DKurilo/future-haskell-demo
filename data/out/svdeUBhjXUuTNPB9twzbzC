It&#39;s an excellent <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-boosters\">cell phone booster</a> if you live and drive in an area where cell phone signals are weak, because you can use it in your car and home.","The most valuable feature of the Drive 3G-Flex is its versatility. It&#39;s the only cell phone signal booster available that you can use in your car and your home. It comes with a DC car adapter and an AC wall adapter. The cell phone signal amplifier is about the size of a candy bar and the antenna uses a magnetic mount, which allows you to easily remove it from your car and take it inside when you return home. The only downside to this transition is the lack of a second coax cable for the house. Removing the cable from the car every time you want to take it inside quickly becomes more hassle than it&#39;s worth, though you can purchase a second cable.","The amplifier has a max gain of 45 dB. This is 5 dB below the maximum gain allowed by law and lower than the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-3g-review\">weBoost Drive 3G-M</a> and other products we reviewed. This gives it a wireless range of around 6 feet, which is ideal for cars and trucks but not wide enough for vans and RVs. For a home installation, it can&#39;t fill a room like a home cell phone booster, but it&#39;ll cover your desk area.","The biggest downside is the lack of 4G LTE compatibility. It only boosts frequencies in the 850MHz and 1,900MHz range, which means it boosts 3G and 2G data. 4G offers faster downloads and better call quality, but the coverage area isn&#39;t as comprehensive as 3G and 2G, which means that you&#39;re not as likely to find 4G in rural areas anyway. But if you do need 4G compatibility, the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-4g-m-review\">weBoost Drive 4G-M</a> is a great option.","The 4-inch antenna attaches to the roof of your car with a magnetic mount, which doesn&#39;t damage the finish and makes it easy to remove. It also comes with a window mount for installing in your home. The antenna&#39;s average forward gain is 2.62 dBi, which gives it a shorter range than the 5 dBi antennas of the best cell phone boosters available. However, it has a better peripheral range, which makes it better for mountainous terrain where signals are weaker."]},"id":"5759c09b-5ef6-44cf-974f-5feb3c12d0f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9af1c38a-0d42-4f99-9cac-4922705dbec1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The weBoost Drive 3G-Flex is the only cell phone signal booster for car and home use.
