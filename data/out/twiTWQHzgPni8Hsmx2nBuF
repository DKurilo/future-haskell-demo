Their <a href=\"/best-touchscreen-monitors\">touchscreen displays </a>have the same thin bezel design and screen size; they also weigh the same, only 7.9 pounds, and feature the same glassy, reflective surface. Looking at the touch monitors side-by-side, it’s difficult to distinguish between the two, save for the ViewSonic’s bright and colorful company logo.","Because of the ViewSonic’s thin bezel, it sits low on the surface of the desk. This makes the multi-touch display less comfortable to use than models with wider bezels that lift the display off the desk. With a tilt range of 50 degrees, the TD2230 isn’t quite as flexible as our top picks but beats many of the other monitors we reviewed. It takes a little effort to change the display’s angle, and it bumps along your work surface whenever you push or pull the monitor to adjust how close it sits to you. ","You can lower the ViewSonic’s stand so it’s flush with display, which makes it lie flat on a desktop surface. While this bonus feature isn’t practical in an office setting, it does make playing touch games, like checkers, more satisfying and fun. ","The ViewSonic TD2230 has a lower average power consumption than many of the displays we reviewed. It also comes with an eco-mode that runs the touchscreen at 19 watts. The eco-mode impacts the display’s brightness and color accuracy but makes it cheaper to run the monitor over time. ","The ports line the sides of the monitor on the back of the display. There are HDMI and DisplayPort connections and audio in and out ports as well as three USB 3.0 connections. The connections come covered with removable panels, which give the monitor a cleaner look. ","Because of their location, the ports are more accessible than those on many of the other touchscreen monitors we reviewed, but the cables come out the sides of the display, which isn’t very attractive, especially if you mount it on the wall. Still, it makes sense to have them there – since the monitor rests directly on the desktop, this prevents putting strain or pressure on the display’s cables. ","A monitor’s gamma score measures how well it represents dimension and depth, which is extremely important when playing games, editing photos or watching videos. A low gamma reading means the display appears washed out, while a high gamma reading means the display is lost in shadow. The ViewSonic has the best pre-calibrated gamma score of the monitors we reviewed. ","The ViewSonic’s 1080p resolution and short .24825-millimeter pixel pitch make it one of the sharpest displays in our comparison. In addition, its seven-millisecond response time is average compared to other touchscreen monitors. The display also has the shortest input lag of the monitors we reviewed, which means information gets to the center of the screen quickly, another important feature for high-end gaming."]},"id":"54e162fd-5d25-4a11-9eb1-2cc2cb4c344b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"70b0cc28-3935-489e-b342-8bdc2e31fab9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While we don’t generally consider touchscreens monitors to be the best for gaming, the ViewSonic TD2230’s gamma correction score, short input lag and sharpness mean it is a good option for gamers who want a multi-functional touchscreen display.
