These devices are usually coupled with a software component that you need to install on your system.","Once you have the cassette you want to convert in the deck and connected to your computer, all you need to do is press Play on your deck and Record in the software and it will capture the audio as it plays back.  After the converter software has captured the audio, you can export it as an MP3. Then you can do pretty much anything with it. You can burn it to a CD, sync it to a <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a>, upload it to the internet or import it into an audio editing application for further work.","<a href=\"/best-audio-converter-software\">Converting the audio</a> found on cassette tapes can be a time-consuming process. That’s because it’s not a simple file transfer that only takes a few seconds. Cassette to MP3 converters must record the audio in real time as it plays in the deck. If you’re converting a whole cassette, this can take up to an hour. Then you have to go into the application to listen to the captured content, edit the audio, separate the tracks and a few other things. These are all pretty simple things to master, but it can be quite involved as well. Just know that if you’re converting a lot of tapes, you’re probably looking at a long-term project.","<strong>Key Attributes</strong>","There are a couple of ways these converters connect to your computer. Most have an integrated cassette deck that allows you to easily slide in the tape you want to convert. Others require you to connect your own deck to your computer via RCA cables. These ones let you hook up any analog device, like a record player or 8-track deck, and convert audio from those devices as well.","All of the products we reviewed can connect to your computer through a USB port. This is the most convenient way to connect, because all computers have multiple USB outlets. Most of the products can draw their power through the USB connection. But there are also alternate power supplies for these devices; some have DC adapter outlets, some also take AA batteries.","The conversion software that comes with these products is critical to their performance. The best cassette converter applications have the ability to automatically detect and segregate tracks on a music album. They also allow you to control the volume of the audio as it is being recorded. Additionally, the best applications work on both Windows and Mac.","Most of the devices we reviewed double as portable cassette players good for everyday use. While this is nice for retro-style lovers, they don’t offer any functionality outside of playing and converting tapes. Our top-pick, Tape 2 PC, is a full bodied, double-deck unit with additional ports in the back that allow you to connect not only to your computer, but devices such as record players and your home entertainment system. "]},"id":"d0a52daa-4d98-44d7-ac80-62e4869074c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"What We Tested, What We Found"},"id":"caf50b55-3f93-483f-9df5-a4467d474abf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<u>Audio Quality</u><br/>In our tests, we acquired a brand new commercial cassette tape and used each of the products we reviewed to digitize it. We then compared the resulting file against a digital download of the same content. We examined the converted files for hissing, static, warble and clear sound. The results varied widely. The best products produced high-fidelity audio files that were nearly indistinguishable from the digitally downloaded versions. Other products that had lesser components yielded lower-quality sound. But none of the cassette converters we reviewed created files that were unlistenable.","<u>Ease of Use</u><br/>All the products we reviewed are fairly straightforward to use. All you have to do is connect your tape deck to your computer, start playing your tape and record it with whatever software you have installed. But there are a few features that make some products easier to use than others.","The best cassette converter programs have step-by-step workflows that take the guesswork out of capturing audio on a tape. They walk you through the program’s interface and tell you when to start playback on your cassette deck.","Once you’re done recording, these programs allow you to input the metadata for each track. This includes data such as album name, artist, song name and more. Filling these out makes it easier to integrate your converted cassettes into your digital media library in programs like iTunes and other media players.","<u>Automatic Track Detection </u><br/>Another convenient feature is a converter application’s ability to detect when one song ends and another begins. These applications sort all the songs in an album. In general, we found this feature to be effective. However, you should be careful; if there are songs that have pauses or silence that aren’t at the beginning or end of a song, this can result in the application mistakenly splitting one song into two. You can easily avoid this problem by turning off the automatic track detection feature and recording those songs separately.","<u>Storage</u><br/>Generally speaking, content on cassettes doesn’t take up much space on your hard drive. In our tests we found that a converted three-minute track can take up between three and six megabytes. This isn’t very much, but if you have a large library of cassettes you want to convert, it can add up quickly. However, this doesn’t mean you should pick a product that creates smaller files. We found a direct correlation between smaller files and degraded audio quality.","<strong>Best Free Cassette to MP3 Converter Software</strong>","The software that comes bundled with cassette converters is generally free to download online. It’s the hardware that you need to pay for. If you already have a the necessary equipment to connect a cassette player to your computer, there’s no reason to purchase it again.","<a href=\"https://www.ionaudio.com/ez-converter\">EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter</a> is the program that comes with our top two choices in this category, and you can download it directly from the ION Audio website. This is our recommendation for software to capture and convert sound from a cassette tape. Other free programs like Audacity are clunky, have antiquated interfaces and are generally not user friendly to people who don’t already know something about audio capture and editing.","<strong>Summary</strong>","Cassette to MP3 converters allow you to easily transfer songs and other audio onto your computer. The best products make this process as simple as possible, create high-quality sound files and offer applications that are specifically designed to work with the devices they’re sold with."]},"id":"5cf4f78b-a878-4547-beea-0ca2b658bb93","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f9a3f460-c60e-412f-b039-eeb5ec233dda","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VG802I/?tag=ttr_cassette-to-mp3-converter-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|806[art|NA[pid|52429[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tape 2 PC</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038OLL2Q/?tag=ttr_cassette-to-mp3-converter-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|806[art|NA[pid|52431[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tape Express Plus</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W2LE67S/?&tag=ttr_cassette-to-mp3-converter-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|806[art|NA[pid|65694[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cassette2USB Converter</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007WSGA98/?&tag=ttr_cassette-to-mp3-converter-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|806[art|NA[pid|65695[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tape-2-PC Portable USB Tape Player</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADXLBS4/?&tag=ttr_cassette-to-mp3-converter-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|806[art|NA[pid|65697[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cassette-to-MP3 Converter Capture</a>","<a href=\"http://www.sharperimage.com/si/view/product/Cassette-to-MP3-Converter/201799\">Cassette to MP3 Converter</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7dfac7f2-da21-4c78-9c39-fc656b49f29b","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_806","url":"/best-cassette-to-mp3-converters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
