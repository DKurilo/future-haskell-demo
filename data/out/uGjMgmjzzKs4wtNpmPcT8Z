So it’s easy to see why some electric cooktop shoppers might shy away from the Frigidaire Professional 30” Induction Cooktop because it’s in Frigidaire’s Professional line of appliances. But rest assured, multitasking moms and culinary savvy dads; the Frigidaire Professional is full-featured without the fluff."]},"id":"5024be4f-5477-4c65-9eb4-7d5690c09485","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/iyEJ3EfphEkrc8u8nRouxB.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The sleek, black-and-stainless-steel design of the Professional cooktop will match most modern kitchen décor styles and will look great even if it doesn’t integrate seamlessly. In an interesting twist on traditional round burner design, the heating elements on this <a href=\"/best-induction-cooktops\">induction cooktop</a> features silver-toned starburst-like designs that match the stainless trim on the cooktop’s borders.

When the burners are off, an “H” appears in the temperature settings display for any burners that still have some residual heat.","This electric cooktop has a few great safety functions as well. If you remove a pan from the burner without shutting it off, the temperature display flashes to alert you. And if you don’t turn it off manually within three minutes, it turns off by itself. A lock feature prevents little hands from turning the burner on accidentally.","Self-installation should be fairly simple, as this drop-in style cooktop needs a cutout that’s only about a quarter-inch to half-inch smaller than the 30-inch-wide cooktop itself. But if you need a bit of help, product support includes wiring instructions and installation manuals, as well as a user guide and general FAQs. A help line is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily except Sundays. There’s also a number to call if you want to order parts, or the Frigidaire website can help you locate a parts supplier. You can’t buy the Professional cooktop from the manufacturer’s website, but there is a link to help you find a retailer.","Whether you’re a novice in the kitchen or a dinnertime pro, the Frigidaire Professional 30” Induction Cooktop is a great introduction to cooking on the best induction cooktops.
