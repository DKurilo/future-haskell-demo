The charging pod and earpiece are necessary parts of the setup, so the headset won’t work at all if you lose either piece. There are no buttons or ports on the headset itself, so you use the case to both charge and pair the device. However, a no-button design keeps the headset super simple.

We spoke with Adam Robertson, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Jabra, and asked what to should consider when shopping for a Bluetooth mono headset.","“It comes down to the value of the conversation and the environment you’re going to be in,” he told us. “If you know these two things, you can start your shopping experience or research at a good point. If you don’t know that, you could end up spending too much and buying too much for what you need. Or worse, you could end up spending too little and then not being happy with the experience.”","Price<br/>On either end of the spectrum, Bluetooth mono headsets cost less than $20 or more than $100. We found the sweet spot falls between $40 and $80. Products in this price range offer a great balance of performance and value. Extra features, such as a charging case or USB dongle for UC function, cost extra and can sometimes even double the price of the device.","Call Quality<br/>A headset’s performance on a call relies on audio and voice working together seamlessly. Hearing difficulties put a severe strain on the conversation – both parties should hear the other end of the line clearly. Headsets with two or more microphones help to filter environmental noises like wind or traffic out of your calls. Generally, the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better, so larger headsets have a bit of an advantage here, though many smaller headsets performed well in our tests.","Factors such as volume range and even the fit of the device can play into the headset’s performance during a call. Some products, like the Motorola Boom 2+ and Sennheiser Presence have fairly low maximum volumes, which could pose a problem in particularly loud environments. The Jabra Eclipse’s fit style helps block ambient noise, which allows you to hear your calls more clearly and listen at a lower volume.","Comfort &amp; Fit<br/>In our tests, we found that the weight of the headset directly correlated with how comfortable it was to wear for an extended period of time. The Jabra Eclipse, the most comfortable headset, also weighs the least, whereas the three heaviest earpieces received the lowest comfort grades. Other factors affect the overall fit and comfort of a Bluetooth headset as well, including the wearing style, earbud options and ear hooks.","All the products we tested come with multiple earbud options. After several rounds of wear-testing, we recommend ear gels that somewhat direct sound into your ear canal and in-ear loops for stability. Over-ear hooks can also help with stability, though testers found that headsets built specifically for over-ear wear instead of in-ear wear – like the Plantronics Voyager 5200 and Jabra Motion – are generally less comfortable, heavier and less stable.<br/><br/>Unified Communications<br/>In Bluetooth headsets, a unified communications (UC) specification means that the headset comes with a USB dongle and a wider range of connectivity for multiple platforms. Five of the nine products we tested have a UC upgrade option, but this is only important if you plan on using your Bluetooth headset extensively for business and need the extra functionality. The upgrades are expensive – some even doubling the price tag. Any of the non-UC options will work great for hands-free phone use. Still, it’s a nice option if you often need to use your headset for conference calls or other office functions.","<strong>Other Bluetooth Options</strong>","Although mono Bluetooth headsets are great for calls in an office or during your commute, they aren&#39;t ideal for all situations. Truck drivers, for example, often use heavy-duty Bluetooth headsets with heartier noise cancellation features and padded ear cups like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BlueParrott-B450-XT-Canceling-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B01M3MMFA5?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">B450-XT</a> by BlueParrot.","With smartphones shedding their headphone jacks, the number and quality of Bluetooth stereo headphones on the market has shot up as well. These products have the advantage of better audio quality than Bluetooth mono headsets. Bluetooth headphones also have built-in, hands-free calling functionality. In addition, you can hear the other end of the call with both ears, though the mics on mono headsets are usually better than those on headphones. But if you infrequently make hands-free calls, Bluetooth stereo headphones are a better investment, as they are more adaptable.","If you like the idea of headphones instead of a mono headset but don’t want the cable connecting the two earpieces, consider true wireless headphones. These tend to be a bit pricier than normal Bluetooth headphones and many Bluetooth mono headsets, but, again, they offer better audio quality than a mono headset and don’t have any strings to hold you down."]},"id":"fc0e76a0-1c41-4d38-8366-29b0ca2459c5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9931f0fe-f377-456b-a333-672da4ecf8ea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/jabra-stealth-review\">Jabra Stealth</a>","<a href=\"/plantronics-voyager-3200-review\">Plantronics Voyager 3200</a>","<a href=\"/plantronics-voyager-5200-review\">Plantronics Voyager 5200 -
