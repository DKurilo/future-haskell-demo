We apply strict standards to test each product’s performance and user-friendliness. This experience has helped inform many of our conclusions about other heating, ventilation and air conditioning products. When we don&#39;t have the extensive equipment necessary to perform industry-standard testing, we also consult with knowledgeable experts at regulatory and industry associations to find comparative, objective information about the products we test. When we test products in house, we strive to gather data that matters to a typical consumer.","When, as in the case of space heaters, we haven&#39;t yet tested the physical products ourselves, we apply the same due diligence to make sure our information and conclusions reflect the mission of Top Ten Reviews.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","As we researched and evaluated space heaters, we looked at the specifications provided by the manufacturers to get a general idea of each model&#39;s capabilities and performance. We also looked at each product’s price to determine if it&#39;s a good value for the money. Finally, we looked at how much each space heater weighs to see if it can be easily carried between rooms or put into storage during warmer months.","<strong>How Much Do Space Heaters Cost?</strong>","The space heaters we evaluated cost an average of $93, as we included some fancy models in our research. If you need something basic to keep a room warm there are many options available for around $50.  ","<strong><br/>What to Look For</strong>","Energy Source<br/>Space heaters come in two main types: electric and propane. Electric models are the best choice for indoor heating and don&#39;t require you to buy any fuel canisters. In contrast, propane space heaters are better suited for outdoor environments and are much more portable. Be aware that you shouldn&#39;t use propane space heaters indoors without adequate ventilation to prevent the dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide.<br/><br/>Heating Power &amp; Energy Consumption<br/>A space heater’s energy source, heating power and energy consumption indicate whether it’s powerful enough to warm a given space effectively. Electric models list power in watts, while propane heaters use British thermal units, or Btu. In general, you need 10 watts or 34 Btu per square foot in a room. This means a space heater rated for 1,500 watts or 5,100 Btu can effectively heat a room around 150 square feet.","If necessary, you can convert watts to Btu to get a better idea of how much space a heater can heat. Multiply the watts by 3.41 to get a Btu rating. For example, a 1,500-watt space heater can produce around 5,100 Btu. However, remember that heating power and energy consumption are linked, so larger, more powerful heaters cost more to run than smaller ones.","Safety<br/>Space heaters pose a higher risk for fire than a home furnace. Although these heaters are designed to sit on flat surfaces, their lightweight designs make them prone to falling over, which can put them in contact with flammable materials. For this reason, choose a space heater with a tip-over sensor that shuts the device off if it&#39;s knocked over. The best space heaters also have other important safety features such as an overheat shutdown, which turns the unit off when it gets too hot, and a cool-touch exterior, which prevents accidental contact with the heating element.","Some propane heaters have a feature called an oxygen depletion sensor, which turns them off before the volume of breathable air in a space reaches a dangerously low level. However, this isn’t a complete replacement for good ventilation and a carbon monoxide detector.","Here are some tips to keep in mind when using your space heater.
