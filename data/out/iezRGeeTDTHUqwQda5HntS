The two-way remote has an LCD display to alert you to various types of alarms, such as an impact or a door opening. The two-way remote is the main reason to purchase a midrange car alarm over a cheap $30 alarm because the remote notifies you when an alarm is activated. Rather than wondering if the alarm you hear is coming from your car, the remote vibrates or beeps to let you know it&#39;s your car.

In fact, remote start is one of its primary features. When the temperature is extremely hot or cold, having a remote starter is a great way to ensure your car’s interior is comfortable when you need to leave, so long as you’re willing to let your car idle. This feature starts the engine so the heat or AC can get to work adjusting the interior temperature. But if someone attempts to put the car in gear without inserting the key, the car immediately turns off, so it is still secure.","This Avital car alarm also has an assortment of other handy convenience features. It comes with four auxiliary ports for expanding the controls and features, such as a trunk release option. It comes with keyless door entry and a valet mode for the alarm.","At less than $100, the Avital 5305L features a loud 120-dB siren with a dual-stage sensor and a two-way remote and remote start system.
