You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Boston Acoustic A360 is a set of <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">floor standing speakers</a> that features two 6.5-inch ceramic glass low-frequency drivers, one 3.5-inch midrange driver and a 1-inch tweeter. This four-speaker design makes for an incredibly accurate and flat frequency response. Speakers with a flat response are good for listening to music that was recorded, mixed and mastered in high fidelity.","The A360 received consistently good scores from our panel of audiophiles in our music-listening test. During this test, we played them a clip from Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” because the song is a good example of impeccably recorded and mixed audio. Because they are such accurate speakers, we weren’t surprised that the A360 conveyed the quality recording with little to no coloration. It was arguably the most accurate pair of speakers we tested.","For our movie-listening test, we chose to play “Mad Max: Fury Road.” This movie has a plethora of loud action scenes with amazing sound effects. The A360’s accuracy did not lend itself well to those action-packed scenes. In fact, one of our panelists described the speakers as “boring” during this test. Accurate speakers are great for listening to music, but when you sit down to watch a movie in your home theater, you need ones that can excite and convey emotion. Ultimately, the A360 were lacking in the midrange and bass frequencies compared to the best performer in our movie test, the <a href=\"/emotiva-airmotiv-t1-review\">Emotiva T1</a>.","An 89 dB sensitivity rating puts the A360 near the bottom of our lineup for speaker efficiency. A less efficient speaker needs to be supplied more amplification to deliver content at the same volume as a more efficient speaker. When listening to the A360, we had to turn our AV receiver up approximately 15 percent higher to achieve the same volume as the most efficient speakers in our test.","These speakers are covered by a five-year warranty. In addition, they are available in either a black or white finish, in case you want to match them to your home décor."]},"id":"9eba4f06-f758-4048-8d08-6680c53db1f2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f3a91df6-aef5-4906-909f-fba4c3f44353","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Boston Acoustic A360 play music with such a high level of accuracy that you get a glimpse into what the sound engineer may have heard while mixing an album.
