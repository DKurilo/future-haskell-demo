However, in our tests Apex Movie Converter struggled. It failed to convert many of the files formats we tested including inputting MP4, MOV and VOB files, especially to an AVI format.","To convert your video you select a tab at the bottom of the application correlating with your personal media device or computer. Unfortunately, after that selecting the codec becomes very confusing. In trying to be comprehensive Apex Movie Converter allows you to select your desired codec; however, we found most of the selects to be confusing, even to the experienced user. For example, in the WMV selection you can choose from 24 options relating to Windows Media 8 specifying whether your connection is Dial-up, LAN, Broadband and more. If the video is on your hard drive already, none of that matters. And, by the way, Microsoft is up to Windows Media 11, going to show how out dated this software truly is.","Perhaps the worst aspect of Apex Movie Converter is the annoying “swish” sound that it makes every time you mouse over a selection on the tool bar. And they never returned our emails."," "]},"id":"c45839ce-261c-40ff-b777-965bc63b7c93","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2517","url":"/apex-movie-converter-super-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
