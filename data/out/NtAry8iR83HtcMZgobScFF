It has a simple interface with uncomplicated tools, features and functions to help you create beautiful artwork, graphics, logos, fliers, simple floor plans and more.","Intaglio has two simple toolbars at the right and top of the interface that make it easy to use. One houses standard drawing tools, shapes and object-manipulation tools. The other lets you choose stroke colors and sizes, flip objects horizontally and vertically, and perform other functions. When you open a new drawing, it appears like lined graph paper, but you can eliminate the grid and work on a plain white canvas.","The software offers several shape tools, including star, polygon, arc, rectangle, circle, Bezier curve, and others that you can use independently or combine in your artwork. These make it easy to create specific items without having to sketch freehand. In case you prefer or need to draw freehand, though, there is a freehand line feature. Any line you draw is automatically smoothed to take out abrupt fluctuations from an unsteady hand or mouse.","The Intaglio drawing program for Mac lets you write text along a path and convert text to path, should you need that extra flare or curve in your messages. It does not let you create and save paragraph styles to use again, though.","You can create multi-page drawings and artwork with this vector-based Mac drawing program. Additionally, it lets you convert your creations between vector and raster formats. However, Intaglio does not offer a clip art or image library. However, you can import images to use in your designs by dragging and dropping them onto a canvas.","This software for Mac includes 19 drawing tools. When you combine them, they let you create detailed artwork, graphics and other design projects. You can change the width and opacity of the main drawing pen to fit your needs. The fill tool allows you to add color to a set path you designate, or to an entire area. Intaglio also offers a text tool and scissors tool, should you need to break up compound paths, as well as a shape-builder tool to combine disparate shapes into new shapes.","This application lets you work in layers and apply filters. You can also take advantage of the ruler and grid to help with your artwork. This Mac drawing software does not offer distort tools, which let you manipulate and customize shapes.","It&#39;s compatible with a pen tablet, which makes this drawing program for Mac even easier to use. It&#39;s also compatible with an iPad, which gives you a mobile option to create artwork and designs. Intaglio offers snap-to alignment, which lines your images or shapes up on a grid. This is useful if you are creating fliers or a detailed plan. It also offers drag-and-drop functionality, so you place shapes directly on your canvas and they snap into order. It does not offer customizable brushes or templates.","Intaglio offers a few customer support options, including a user&#39;s manual, online FAQs, a help viewer you can access from the application, and a forum where you can interact with other users. You can also email the developer with questions and concerns. The company does not provide telephone support or video tutorials.","Intaglio provides the necessary features, tools and components to create artwork professionally or as a hobby. It lacks templates and clip art, which could be helpful for novices, but Intaglio is still a good platform to create your art."]},"id":"cea78ef5-2670-427f-8a3e-4024c6654aaf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53944","url":"/intaglio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-11-11T15:13:17Z","datePublished":"2011-11-11T15:13:17Z","name":"Intaglio","synopsis":"Intaglio is among the most basic Mac drawing software.
