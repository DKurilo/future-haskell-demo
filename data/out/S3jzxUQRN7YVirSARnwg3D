However, its other controls took a bit more time to master.","This Oster model holds a maximum of 3.7 liters of oil, which is the third largest capacity of the fryers we reviewed. We began our testing by adding oil up to the max fill line and setting the fryer to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. It took 14 minutes 15 seconds to reach that temperature, which is about average.","The Oster CKSTDFZM37-SS1 cooked 6 ounces of French fries in just five minutes. They turned out golden brown and properly cooked, with the right degree of moisture and doneness. A few were slightly dark, but overall, they tasted great and had crispy outsides and firm, fluffy interiors. We got equally good results when we cooked breaded chicken strips, which also came out of the oil nicely cooked. They were moist and just the right degree of crispy for our taste testing panel.","When you add food to oil, the temperature drops temporarily. This Oster model reheated the oil back to the set temperature in just three minutes and 30 seconds, which is among the faster reheating times of the fryers we tested.","However, this Oster model’s controls have a slight learning curve. For example, the time control dial is somewhat confusing at first. The timer also turns the machine on and off, but that isn’t immediately apparent. You must turn the timer dial to the &#34;on&#34; setting before you set the temperature. If you want a deep fryer that&#39;s comparably priced with easier controls, look at the <a href=\"/hamilton-review\">Hamilton Beach 35021</a>.","We ran into a similar situation with the temperature control. It doesn&#39;t include 325-degree or 350-degree Fahrenheit settings – temperatures many cooks use frequently. Instead, the settings are 265 degrees, 300 degrees, 340 degrees and 375 degrees Fahrenheit.","This 1500-watt deep fryer includes helpful features like an on light and a light that shows the fryer is ready to use. You also get an audible sound to let you know when the food is done, according to the timer setting.","For safety, the fryer has a break-away magnetic power cord – it’s easy to detach in case you need to quickly cut power to the machine. However, during testing, the outside of this fryer got quite hot, up to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the third-hottest of the fryers we tested.","The Oster CKSTDFZM37-SS1’s lid makes the fryer safe, clean and convenient. This lid has a dual filter that cuts down on odors and oil splatter, and you can cook with the lid closed. That lowers the risk of burns from hot oil splatter and keeps your countertop clean. You get a window on the lid so you can watch your food cook, though it tends to fog up quite a bit.","In general, it was easy to clean this fryer. We washed it by hand and got it tidied up in little time, although you can put its removable parts in the dishwasher."]},"id":"8e201d9e-ee2a-48bd-b3be-eca6e05fa25c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59016","url":"/oster-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-06T14:41:11Z","datePublished":"2014-03-06T14:41:11Z","name":"Oster CKSTDFZM37-SS1","synopsis":"We got good results cooking with the convenient Oster CKSTDFZM37-SS1 deep fryer, aided in part by its handy timer.
