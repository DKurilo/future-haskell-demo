The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-hd-camcorders\">HD Camcorders</a> here.</em>","The JVC GX-R450B is one of the most unique cameras we&#39;ve seen. It’s the only HD camcorder we tested that was weather resistant. Though it’s a little pricey and more difficult to use than others, thanks to this unusual feature we still think it&#39;s worthy of consideration.","Image quality is not the strong suit of the R450B, which seemed to struggle in low light and lacked the same clarity and color reproduction that the best camcorders we reviewed displayed. We didn’t think that its footage was particularly bad, but it’s certainly not the reason to buy this camera.","Among its extra precautions for repelling water, dust or snow, the R450B has a hard time keeping up with its competition in regards to usability. In our tests, in constantly lagged behind the others, unencumbered by any weather protections. It seemed to us to be of a tradeoff for weatherproofing than a flaw in the camera.","We did however appreciate that the camera comes with 32Gb of internal storage just like the <a href=\"/canon-vixia-hf-r72-review\">Canon Vixia HF R72</a>. Although its ports are a little trickier to access, you won’t have to access them as often if you take advantage of this extra space. It’s a small bonus, but it helps.","The JVC offers a long 40x optical zoom, which reinforces its position as a great camcorder for the outdoors, where wide-open spaces often require an optical advantage. Unfortunately, there is no optical image stabilization. Although the R450B offers a digital stabilizer, it doesn’t retain the same natural look that optical stabilization achieves in other camcorders like the <a href=\"/panasonic-hc-v-review\">Panasonic HC-V770K</a>."]},"id":"0404641d-aa0a-42b3-8797-7abb06695350","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c692820c-b3f9-4e25-b060-128a7bf99d05","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The JVC GX-R450B is one of the more expensive models we tested for this review, though it underperforms in image quality and ease of use.
