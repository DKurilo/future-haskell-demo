However, this doesn&#39;t mean that the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1204-best-iphone-7-screen-protectors.html\">iPhone screen protector</a> itself is indestructible. While it may protect your iPhone screen from harm, the screen protector will show cut marks and scratches on it. If you drop the phone and it lands on the screen protector, the screen protector may likely shatter; however, the iPhone screen underneath should withstand the blow unharmed.","The tempered glass on this model is 0.5mm thick. There&#39;s also a SLIM model that is only 0.26mm thick. The Spigen iPhone screen protector passed the pencil hardness test with a 9H classification. The pencil hardness test ranges from a 9B rating, which is the softest measurement, to a 9H, which is the hardness rating. However, this doesn&#39;t mean that you can take a saw or a sword to it and it will come away unscathed. If you scribble across the surface with the edge of a pair of scissors using moderate pressure, it shouldn&#39;t mar the surface. If you drop your phone and it goes sliding across the concrete, there will likely be some scratch marks on the protector. If you knock your iPhone off the table and it slams to the ground, chances are it&#39;ll shatter the Spigen screen protector but that the iPhone screen underneath will be fine.","The best iPhone screen protectors are easy to keep clean. The Spigen GLAS.tR has an oleophobic coating that resists oil. You still may notice fingerprints and face smudges on your phone, but they&#39;ll be easy to rub off the screen. Additionally, since this screen cover is made of glass, it has a very smooth feel to it.","This phone screen has a completely clear design. If you can apply it to your phone without any dust getting between the screen and your screen protector, you won&#39;t be able to tell the screen protector phonies there. However, since the adhesive is across the whole screen, it can be a little more difficult to place it on the phone without trapping dust particles. Additionally, the adhesive is very effective at holding the iPhone screen protector to your phone, but you may find it very difficult to remove if you decide you want to. This also means that you only have one chance at placing it squarely on the phone.","The Spigen iPhone 6 screen protector is thicker than some similar products. Although it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll notice it on your screen, the Home button will feel recessed. To remedy this, Spigen includes six Home button stickers: two black, two white, one yellow and one pink. You can add a sticker that raises the Home button up so that it&#39;s not noticeably sunken in because of the screen protector. These Home buttons are not made of glass, so they&#39;ll have a different feel from the rest of the surface of the phone.","This iPhone 6 screen protector comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. It also comes with a limited warranty that covers manufacturer defects. Unfortunately, the company won&#39;t replace the product if it breaks or if you have trouble placing it on your iPhone. Spigen lists FAQs on its website and an email form.","Spigen has two types of designs. In addition to the glass screen protector, this company has a PET film protector called iPhone 4/4S Screen Protector Steinheil Ultra. Its hardness measures 4H, and it&#39;s dry apply, doesn&#39;t feel tacky and is easy to install."]},"id":"2034ede8-46b7-405f-a3b1-c7db378adcc1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7b0c26a8-58b1-4194-8d12-24705ee0de23","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Spigen GLAS.tR is a thick, hard surface that will absorb a lot of scratches and blows without marring your iPhone screen.
