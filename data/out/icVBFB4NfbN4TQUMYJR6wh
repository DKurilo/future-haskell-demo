So instead of selecting a narrow list of hot tub models to directly compare, we looked at the overall brands and evaluated each manufacturer on the variety and quality of its available products. To do this, we dove deep into manufacturer websites, brochures and product information, as well as online forums and user reviews. ","Because buying a hot tub is such a subjective process, we partnered with Buyer Zone to help pair you with the best hot tub for your specific needs. You can fill out the survey to get customized recommendations.","<strong>How To Choose A Hot Tub</strong>","Before buying your hot tub, you should always have the features you want in mind. Here are a list of features to consider:- ","<strong>How Big Should A Hot Tub Be?</strong>","When choosing a size, consider how many people plan on using the hot tub and the space you have available. Most hot tub manufacturer’s websites list both the dimensions of each hot tub and how many people that can sit comfortably within the tub. ","<strong>How Much Does A Hot Tub Cost?</strong>","The cost of a hot tub can anywhere from $3,000 for a budget-priced tub to over $16,000 for a top-of-the-line spa with custom upgrades. Generally, inflatable hot tubs are the cheapest, above ground hot tubs more moderate priced, where as inground hot tubs are the most expensive. ","Hot tub manufacturers rarely list the prices of hot tubs online because there are several factors that affect the price of each sale, including geography, dealer promotions and even the time of year. This also allows the seller to negotiate a higher price with people that don’t have good bartering skills. ","Many hot tub companies break up their selections into price-range-based categories to help shoppers choose a budget-appropriate tub, but some do not have any price guidelines available without inquiry. The price categories are budget, entry-level, mid-level, premium and luxury. Some hot tub dealers offer financing options with payment plans.","The final price of your hot tub can differ significantly from the price of the tub itself when you include any upgrades or extras, installation and operating costs. "]},"id":"2fd0ec91-7df9-42b0-9814-7a879cfc5b73","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"How to Shop for a Hot Tub"},"id":"b6058eea-5771-4a94-bd52-67588b4b4574","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Here are a few simple things to take into account before buying a hot tub:- ","<strong>Plan where you are putting the hot tub</strong>","Think about the best position for the hot tub. This will be a major factor in deciding the type of hot tub to get and the features it needs to pack. If you are placing the hot tub outside it is best to choose a model that holds heat well, so you’re not wasting energy constantly reheating it. You might also want to consider the view, the distance from the house, and even how visible you will be to your neighbors. Plan the location of your hot tub carefully. If you are placing the hot tub indoors, you might want to choose an area that is well ventilated so condensation doesn’t damage your home. ","<strong>Know the features you want</strong>","Knowing the features you want in a hot tub will allow you to narrow down the list. It will also place a limit on the amount you spend, cementing a firm cost in your mind. ","<strong>Test the hot tub for yourself</strong>","We’d recommend viewing a hot tub in person, if it is possible, to do a wet test. It is best to try the hot tub out before buying it, as the moulded seats are designed for an average size person and if you are on the smaller or taller size these seat can become uncomfortable. ","<strong>Hot Tub Therapy Options</strong>","The number of jets in the tub, in addition to the placement and type of hydrotherapy the jets deliver are important features to think about when purchasing a hot tub. Hot tub manufacturers use different techniques to imitate a variety of massage types from deep tissue to light caress. Some use a combination of water and air, some use high-pressure and others use high-flow jets. If you want a full-body massage, look for a hot tub with lounge seats and leg or feet jets. Some spa models combine hydrotherapy and aromatherapy for a more relaxing experience. ","<strong>Hot Tub Filtration &amp; Sanitation</strong>","The filtration and water sanitation systems in your hot tub keep the water sparking and clean. Spa models use different combinations of chemicals, filters, ozone and UV-C light to make sure your water stays clean. Most of the models we evaluated use multiple filters to remove dirt and small debris from the water. Many also offer ozone or UV-C sanitation options as standard installation or upgrades. These systems eliminate or neutralize bacteria as well. ","<strong>Hot Tub Build Quality</strong>","When shopping, look into the materials used in the hot tub’s construction. Most hot tubs use an acrylic interior shell supported by a frame made of either treated wood or metal and surrounded by a wood or synthetic cabinet. As long as it isn’t exposed to elements, the frame should last the lifetime of your hot tub, no matter what it’s made of. ","Pay more attention to the hot tub’s insulation, as this directly affects operating costs. A poorly insulated spa costs more to heat because the heater has to run more to keep water at a set temperature, and overworking the components can lead to early malfunction. Getting a well-insulated hot tub is particularly important in locations that reach low temperatures. To this end, look for a full-foam insulated hot tub rather than a model with partial foam insulation or one that just uses a thermal wrap. ","<strong>Hot Tub Upgrades and Extras</strong>","Most hot tub manufacturers offer a variety of upgrades and extra features. In addition to an amazing soak, most manufacturers offer Bluetooth sound systems, mood lighting and waterfall or fountain water features. Many top-tier models also have built-in coolers and external seating. Some also have smart capabilities, such as an optional Wi-Fi module or companion mobile app. These smart tubs make remotely controlling or monitoring your spa easy, and they have the added benefit of making it easy to contact your local hot tub dealer.","<strong>Hot Tub Appearance</strong>","Most of the hot tubs we reviewed come in multiple shell and cabinet styles, with manufacturers offering more options for higher-tier product lines. Though not necessarily the most important aspect of your hot tub, appearance does play a role in the relaxing effects of your spa. Choosing a shell and UV-resistant cabinet in colors that blend in with your backyard creates a more laid-back setting, rather than an eye-sore. "]},"id":"e91a1e40-5bad-4fd1-8d15-10a10115ad4e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0473a0c1-7bc2-4111-b818-58fbe0063790","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.bullfrogspas.com/\">Bullfrog Spas</a>","<a href=\"http://calspas.com/\">Cal Spas</a>","<a href=\"http://www.calderaspas.com/\">Caldera Spas</a>","<a href=\"http://www.d1spas.com/\">Dimension One Spas</a>","<a href=\"http://www.hotspring.com/\">Hot Spring</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jacuzzi.com/\">Jacuzzi</a>","<a href=\"https://www.marquisspas.com/\">Marquis</a>","<a href=\"http://www.masterspas.com/\">Master Spas</a>","<a href=\"http://www.sundancespas.com/\">Sundance Spas</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a184779c-2bc7-4375-b6db-8eadea5e81a3","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1257","url":"/best-hot-tubs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-09T22:49:25Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T19:36:25Z","name":"Best Hot Tubs: Soak Away Your Worries","synopsis":"Hot tubs have great benefits whether you are relaxing, entertaining or need one for medical purposes.
