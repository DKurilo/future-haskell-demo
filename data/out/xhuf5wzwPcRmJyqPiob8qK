Everyone from architects to astronauts are heralding a 3D printer&#39;s ability to create scale models and real objects from one machine.  And because the technology is fairly new, there&#39;s a need for those who can understand, operate and innovate with 3D models and printers. If it sounds like a tech career that&#39;s up your alley, it may be time to dust off your book bag and consider a degree in an area where 3D printing and design is prevalent.<br/><strong><br/>Engineering</strong><br/>Whether mechanical, software or industrial, with 3D printing comes the need for engineers who can operate the devices. What&#39;s more, engineers will use 3D printers to model and draft various components for manufacturing and, eventually, perhaps even buildings. A degree in engineering is an ideal way to get your foot in the 3D printing door, particularly if there&#39;s an emphasis on 3D printing and modeling as part of your curriculum. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"7a3c3ba7-d452-41e4-ac74-4272e6eb4c2f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8149","url":"/top-5-degrees-for-a-career-in-3d-printing","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-curtis","url":"/author/j-curtis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.
