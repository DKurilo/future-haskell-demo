You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Ryobi RY14110 is a robust lawn-cutting machine with outstanding features, and the highlight is its self-propel function. Even though the coveted self-propel function is an unusual and extremely helpful feature for an electric mower, the RY14110 falls short of our top <a href=\"/best-electric-lawn-mowers\">electric lawn mowers</a> because it is a bit more difficult to use. But it is a high quality and powerful mower, nonetheless.","The Ryobi RY14110 houses a 48-volt battery that charges while plugged into the mower or removed from it. The good thing about a 48-volt battery is it doesn&#39;t take long to charge, and it is more powerful than a smaller battery. But it also discharges more quickly, leaving you with only a half-hour of quality, self-propelled cut time. If you don&#39;t use the self-propel function, the mower&#39;s charge can last close to 45 minutes.","The Ryobi RY14110 performs three main mowing functions:"]},"id":"5c385444-aa67-4443-b935-cc31f14ec800","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["In mulching mode, the RY14110 cuts the clippings into fine mulch, which is then distributed right back into the grass. This helps replenish hydration and nutrients back into the rooted grass for a healthier lawn. To engage this mode you have to attach the included mulch plug.","In discharge mode, this mower discharges grass and other clippings out of the side of the mower through an attached chute. To use this mode you have to attach an available side-discharge chute","In bagging mode, this battery-powered mower gathers grass clippings in an attached bag."],"type":"ul"},"id":"6dfaddb1-24cd-40c0-919b-ff459215776e","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When you use bagging mode, you should remove the mower&#39;s mulch plug and side-discharge chute and attach the bag behind the mower.","The mower features a one-touch height adjustment lever, which raises and lowers the wheels of the mower to between a 1.5-inch and a 3.75-inch cutting height.","When you initiate the RY14110&#39;s self-propel feature, the mower accelerates rapidly, which can catch you off guard the first time you use the mower. Additionally, you cannot adjust the mower&#39;s speed to your personal walking pace like you can with other self-propelled mowers.","The problem with having a self-propel feature that is somewhat difficult to use is that this mower is very difficult to move without a self-propel function. Weighing in around 90 pounds, the RY14110 is a heavy electric lawn mower.","Though it is heavy, this battery-powered mower is very easy to store thanks to its removable battery and foldable handle. The removable battery also makes charging between mowings easy.","The Ryobi features a highly durable steel deck and high-density plastic wheels that are designed to last through years of use. To achieve maximum charging cycles, the battery must be maintained per Ryobi&#39;s directions, which you&#39;ll find in this mower&#39;s operator&#39;s manual. It&#39;s best not to discharge a sealed lead-acid battery completely, and Ryobi suggests storing the battery indoors, in a controlled climate.","The Ryobi RY14110 is the only electric lawn mower in our review that features a three-year warranty. On top of the great warranty, you have access to a great online database complete with FAQs and other information about the RY14110.","The RY14110 is not available for purchase online, and it is sold exclusively by Home Depot. Ryobi&#39;s website also features a link to the outdoor supplier, as well as an affiliate service center locator. You can also find a complete operator&#39;s manual online that details how to care for and use this electric mower."]},"id":"98875be0-3c43-4b94-99ea-a0d0cfbcb323","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b765f533-e2d4-459d-bb60-f3201b934e4d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ryobi RY14110 is a highly durable lawn mower with excellent mowing and mulching capabilities.
