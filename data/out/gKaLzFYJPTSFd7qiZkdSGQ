You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Flexispy really does allow you to spy on your kids or any person who uses a smartphone you own. You can basically see or listen to anything that happens on the target phone – anything that you feel comfortable knowing about. It is worth finding out about privacy laws where you live before you use all of this <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-parental-control-software\">parental control cell phone software&#39;s</a> features. It has the capability to allow you to listen to phone conversations, and to read all emails and texts. You can basically bug a room with Flexispy too, recording ambient sounds at times you specify using the targeted smartphone.","You will not find many ways to prevent access to websites or other content on your child&#39;s phone with Flexispy&#39;s cell phone parental controls, even with its premium product, Flexispy Extreme, like you will with many similar products in our review, but you will know everything they search for after the fact. That includes everyone they contact in any way and everything they say – along with activities on Facebook, Skype, LINE, WhatsApp and more.","You can do all of this without your child or employee knowing because Flexispy runs in the background. This also makes it really difficult to disable, which is a good security feature. GPS and other tracking capabilities can help you locate the target phone if it ever gets lost or stolen.","Unfortunately, Flexispy lacks some advanced features. This software does not provide any options for blocking numbers from calling or texting the monitored phone or for blocking any websites from being viewed on the smartphone. There is no option to set alerts and notifications if any inappropriate content is stored on the device either.","Flexispy&#39;s logging capabilities provide the most value to users. This mobile phone safety software provides basic logging features such as call history logs. This allows you to view all phone calls made and received on the monitored smartphone.","A text message log is also available that allows you to see all text messages sent and received on the phone. Flexispy shows you an exact copy of each text message, whether the message has been deleted on the cell phone or not. You can also log all emails sent and received from the phone, and you have access to the phone&#39;s address book. You can view all contacts stored on the device to see if your child has added any additional contacts.","After you have purchased and installed Flexispy, you will receive an online account where you can view your child&#39;s smartphone activity. Along the top of the online account is a menu listing all the available logs. By clicking each tab, you can view the most recent logs. Your results will appear in a list format. If you have a large amount of information associated with each activity, you will have to sift through all of that information to find the details you are looking for, however. The information is laid out in a semi-organized manner; you just have to look carefully to find the information you need.","If you have any questions regarding Flexispy and using the software, there is a FAQs section to answer several generic questions. There are no additional resources such as a knowledgebase or a user manual readily available if you need additional help. However, if you do have questions, you can use the company&#39;s online live chat support to ask a customer representative. There is no email or phone support."]},"id":"68ede42a-0e29-4a73-81c9-7c3cd356471f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c784bbcb-c60e-401e-9c1c-355dedd1d412","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Flexispy is adequate cell phone parental control software if activity logs are the most important feature to you.
