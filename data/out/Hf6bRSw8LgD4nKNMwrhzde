The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-patio-heaters\">Patio Heaters</a> here.</em>","The Dayva Patio Heater produces a 40,000 Btu output and can heat an area about 20 feet in diameter. It’s a simple outdoor heater with a latched cabinet for the base and concealed wheels for maneuvering it around. You can turn it on with a push-button electronic ignition, which is high on the shaft to keep it out of the reach of small children. It also includes a safety tilt feature and several designs to match the look of your patio.","The full-size patio heater doesn’t require any special installation or assembly. It comes fully built and reaches a height of 91 inches, close to 8 feet. The outdoor heater comes in stainless steel, hammered bronze or hammered black. The base is small and rectangular, just big enough to hide the propane tank, which you have to purchase separately. It’s also set up to use natural gas if you prefer.","One thing the Dayva lacks is an additional table, which might be a deterrent if you plan to use this patio heater in a restaurant. Other outdoor heaters include a small space for guests to place their drinks, a simple feature that the Dayva doesn’t have. It also is meant more for function rather than aesthetics. The design is simple, not striking.","The bright side is that the construction is durable so it should last a long time. It’s a good addition to your backyard patio along with some surrounding tables. It also is safe for family use. The safety-tilt feature makes sure the unit will shut itself off if the patio heater is tipped beyond a safe angle.","The wheels underneath the base are cleverly hidden without sacrificing utility and will help you move the outdoor heater around as needed. Even with wheels, you should consider the help of a friend. The patio heater weighs about 80 pounds and could be up to 100 pounds with a full tank.","This is a basic model with a nice 34-inch hood that provides a warm radius. It’s not the best-looking patio heater available, but it does exactly what it’s supposed to do. The high ignition switch makes it safe for small children and the anti-tilt feature offers peace of mind if you’re concerned about safety."]},"id":"76a4a478-5bc3-4a5f-afab-991d098020e7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61426","url":"/dayva-international-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
