The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-electric-fireplaces\">Electric Fireplaces</a> here.</em>","The Elite Flame EF5035C wall-mount electric fireplace is a good unit to consider, but it does lack a few features that make a fireplace a bit more convenient, which made it fall down a bit on our lineup. It has a unique curved design, which will give any living space a sleek, modern upgrade, and dual heat settings. You can even just enjoy the flame effect without enduring the heat if you like.","This Elite Flame electric fireplace has three settings – high, low and no heat. The no-heat setting only provides a flame effect, so you can enjoy the ambiance a fireplace can provide without the unit heating the room.","This fan-forced unit heats up to 400 square feet of living space quickly and efficiently. It draws 1,500 watts of power and has a 5,200 Btu capacity on its high setting, which is pretty standard for the electric fireplaces on our lineup.","This wall-mounted electric fireplace has an attractive curved design, which you don’t see on many units. It has fairly standard measurements of 35.4 x 22 x 5.5 inches. The unit weighs 26.5 pounds, which is pretty light compared to most electric fireplaces on our lineup.","This Elite Flame wall electric fireplace has log inserts to give it a realistic fireplace look. Additionally, the LED-lit flames are very lifelike. Whether you decide to use the heat function or the flame-only effect, you can enjoy the ambiance a real fireplace can give you.","You can control the fireplace from across the room with the remote control. It lets you control the flame and the heat setting. This unit doesn&#39;t have touchscreen controls, though, so if you&#39;re not using the remote control, you have to access the control panel on the side to work the fireplace, which is a bit inconvenient.","Additionally, you don&#39;t get a timer function on this unit, which can be an issue if you have a habit of forgetting to switch appliances or electronics off when you&#39;re done using them or as you leave the house. However, if the unit does get too hot, the automatic shut-off function kicks in and powers the fireplace down, which is a nice safety feature.","This unit includes the wall-mounting hardware you need to install it, so you don&#39;t have to hire a professional to do the work for you. If you plan to mount this unit near a TV – either above or below – or near any furniture, it&#39;s recommended that you give it at least 24 inches of clearance. This is actually a smaller clearance than most electric fireplaces require, which is 36 inches.","You have the standard one-year warranty coverage on this wall-mount electric fireplace. You can contact the manufacturer by phone and email for support, but the manufacturer doesn&#39;t provide the product manual or FAQs on its website."]},"id":"b6f025be-7aaa-4bd3-a523-94a6f8e1df0a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2e634fcd-63ee-45fa-b8d6-b1f2a0fbcea2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Elite Flame EF5035C electric fireplace heater has a modern, sleek and curved design.
