For example, under each setting (Applications, Network, IDS &amp; IPS, Windows and Activity Options of the Administration Center) you can create and edit rules.","Tiny Firewall is one of the few firewall programs that will allow the user to assign read, write, create, and delete privileges to registry files. This will allow an advanced user the ability to set security levels on important registry files so a Trojan can&#39;t invade and override these. You also have the ability to set network security rules for your network, but again if you are not an expert it will take time to learn how to use this properly.","With intruder detection and prevention, you can create your own set of rules to oversee potential intrusions, but again, advanced features are a challenge to use. The documentation does a poor job at explaining how to use this and other features.","With the activity monitoring screen, you&#39;ll see a running programs option where you can instantly add any program to a trusted list or to a blocked list. You can also select to have the program tracked, or watched."]},"id":"b8eb4e6e-c852-46eb-ac89-0ee3b9f84848","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"User Experience"},"id":"838827cc-5e1d-4205-b9fb-78f233a618d7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though powerful, Tiny Firewall is too confusing for the beginner.
