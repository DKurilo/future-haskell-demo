The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-budget-vacuums/\">Budget Vacuums</a> here.<br/></em>","The Navigator Lift-Away by Shark is an affordably priced vacuum cleaner that takes the best features of a canister vacuum and combines them with the simplicity of an upright model. The model is designed as a sealed system and has HEPA filtration. This means that the dust you vacuum from your home is sealed in the collection cup, reducing the allergies and pollen in the air.  This model is definitely a &#34;does it all&#34; machine, and it sits at the high end of the budget vacuum pricing range.","The Shark Navigator Lift-Away&#39;s defining feature is that it you can use it as either an upright vacuum or a canister vacuum. The handle for the upright mode functions as the wand for the canister mode. This model comes with a dusting brush, two crevice tools and a turbo brush tool for stairs and other upholstery. This model weighs 12.5 pounds. The canister itself only weighs 7.5 pounds, and has an ergonomic handle on the top so it is easy to carry. The bottom is flat, so you can set it down while you dust walls and ceilings.","The Shark has powerful suction that can tackle a variety of dirt. It uses the same cyclonic technology as its other Shark models, using high-speed air to separate larger debris from dust. This keeps the filters clean and the motor free of grit. You can use the Lift-Away on either carpets or bare floors safely. It has a convenient switch to turn the deep-cleaning brush bar on for carpets and off for bare floors. While the Lift-Away does not have a height adjustment for carpet types like some other machines do, it has a suction control dial. The brush bar auto-adjusts to optimize cleaning.","The Navigator Lift-Away has a swivel handle that allows you to negotiate around and under furniture and in tight places. However, the vacuum can fall  over easily when used as an upright because of this feature.","Shark has added great features that make this model easy to maintain. The 1.2-quart dirt cup empties from the bottom with a simple release button, so this task is fast and clean. The machine will turn itself off to avoid belt wear if you block the brush â€“ so the belt is warranted for the life of your Lift-Away. And while the filters do need to be washed or rinsed, the HEPA filter is intended to last for the life of the machine. Shark recommends that you wash the HEPA filter once every two years as needed. The pre-motor filters should be checked and washed about every three months. Shark offers a generous five-year warranty on the Lift-Away.","The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a unique and powerful vacuum cleaner designed for households with pets, bare floors, carpets and rugs, carpeted stairs, and other surfaces. Because it&#39;s a lightweight and maneuverable machine, it works well where a hand vacuum or small shop-vac would be useful."]},"id":"da2c2e8b-bf17-4134-89e5-b2fe9ce72117","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59987","url":"/shark-navigator-lift-away-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-15T14:57:36Z","datePublished":"2014-07-15T14:57:36Z","name":"Shark Navigator Lift-Away","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
