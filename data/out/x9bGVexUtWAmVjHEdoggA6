You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM may not be one of the best GPS devices on the market, but it works well and includes some excellent features for the price. It has all of the essential navigational features you’d expect to see in a <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> as well as a fairly intuitive interface and a touchscreen display with a higher-than-average resolution.","You can use this device right out of the box, thanks to the preloaded maps of the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. It also boasts 7 million preloaded points of interest, like gas stations, hotels and other attractions, as does a similar model, <a href=\"/magellan-roadmate-7771t-review\">Magellan’s RoadMate 7771T-LMB</a>. The 5630T-LM also makes it easy to program and save your favorite waypoints and create icons for them, making them accessible via Magellan’s OneTouch Favorites menu. If you need to stop at multiple places on a particular drive, you can program all of them in and the GPS system automatically provides you with the most efficient route.","While on the road, the car GPS gives you plenty of notice for moving into the necessary lane for an upcoming turn and tells you the name and number of your next freeway exit. It can display 3D landmarks so that you can more easily and accurately navigate to your destination. It even tells you how fast you’re driving as well as the speed limit of the road you’re currently on. You also have the option to rotate the 5630T-LM into portrait mode if you want to see more of the route that’s ahead of you.","For the entire time that you own the device, Magellan provides free traffic camera alerts, which warn you of upcoming speed cameras based on crowd-sourced data. You’ll also get free map updates for the life of the device, where you can apply up to four map updates per year, ensuring that you’re always receiving navigation based on the most up-to-date information. Additionally, if your destination is in a bustling city, the 5630T-LM can tell you where nearby parking lots are and, wherever possible, entrance addresses and hours of operation.","The GPS has a 5-inch resistive touchscreen. Although it lacks the more responsive and crisp capacitive touchscreen, the RoadMate 5630T-LM does have better resolution than most other devices at this price point – 640 x 480 pixels. One of the largest downsides of this GPS is its underwhelming battery life capacity. At just 30 minutes, it’s significantly shorter than most other devices in our comparison. The unit ships with an industry-standard one-year warranty."]},"id":"d3b06516-50d2-4a5a-96ac-b938fc2ec015","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69769","url":"/magellan-roadmate-5630t-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-03-12T16:30:36Z","datePublished":"2018-03-12T16:30:36Z","name":"Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"The Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM misses the mark with battery life but offers otherwise feature-rich navigation assistance.","pros":["It has a microSD slot and 4GB of internal storage."],"cons":["It has the shortest battery life of any unit in our comparison."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","id":"x9bGVexUtWAmVjHEdoggA6","meta":{"title":"Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM is a powerful GPS, although it&#8217;s missing some premium features."},"products":[{"slug":"magellan-roadmate-5630t-lm","url":"/product/magellan-roadmate-5630t-lm","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","name":"Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","id":"cuwmthTtLfu7LpN9RwqKxY","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LkDTotj7Hovh2hKSMBAX54.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","mimeType":"","name":"faf7906bc0fd3af95c0871a7f90ffc35.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/faf7906bc0fd3af95c0871a7f90ffc35.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","id":"LkDTotj7Hovh2hKSMBAX54","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LkDTotj7Hovh2hKSMBAX54.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM is a powerful GPS, although it&#8217;s missing some premium features."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LkDTotj7Hovh2hKSMBAX54.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","mimeType":"","name":"faf7906bc0fd3af95c0871a7f90ffc35.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/faf7906bc0fd3af95c0871a7f90ffc35.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","id":"LkDTotj7Hovh2hKSMBAX54","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LkDTotj7Hovh2hKSMBAX54.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 5630T-LM is a powerful GPS, although it&#8217;s missing some premium features."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/magellan-roadmate-5630t-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gps","url":"/electronics/gps","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","name":"GPS","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:57Z","id":"PaNWioUkFhvsXZKxXS5PLR","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
