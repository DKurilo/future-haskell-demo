of its mobile phone integration, the Panasonic KX-TG7875S is the way to go if you always need to be reachable. This is the most expensive <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phone</a> we reviewed, but it’s also the most feature-rich. And it’s the KX-TG7875S’s collection of useful features that makes it our pick for the best cordless phone for business.","<strong>Performance</strong>","In our tests, the Panasonic KX-TG7875S had one of the shortest charge times and the longest standby time. It also has a useful backup power function, so you can make calls during a power outage. You just place a charged handset on the base to supply it with power and use another handset or speakerphone to make and answer calls.","This isn’t a plug-and-play phone. Yes, you can technically just plug it in and use it immediately, but it has a ton of features and settings to play with. We recommend taking time to familiarize yourself with these options so you can configure the phone to your needs. If you don’t want to read a user manual to get the most out of your cordless phone, check out the <a href=\"/vtech-review\">VTech CS6719</a> or <a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic KX-TGE433B</a> instead – they are much simpler.","In general, the phone looks nice and professional, and it would look good in a home or home office. We noticed the handsets’ black-and-orange dial buttons are a bit difficult to read in certain light, but overall, they are well-designed and comfortable to hold. The Panasonic KX-TG7875S system comes with five handsets, and you can expand it up to six.","<strong>Features &amp; Settings</strong>","The Panasonic KX-TG7875S includes a handset locator, intercom function, talking caller ID, headset jacks, an answering machine and call blocking. It can also link to up to two cell phones via Bluetooth. This Link2Cell functionality lets you make and answer cellular calls on your handsets and alerts you when you receive a text message. You can also set up message forwarding to your cell phone.","Because it has more features than the other phones we reviewed, the KX-TG7875S’s interface is a bit unwieldy. For example, to block a call you have to go through several menu directions, while other phones have a dedicated call-block button."]},"id":"b3ab59f7-1753-4d1d-8caf-fde9644bba52","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0d51bed5-ada6-4007-b360-744c640eb0ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic KX-TG7875S has a bit of a learning curve.
