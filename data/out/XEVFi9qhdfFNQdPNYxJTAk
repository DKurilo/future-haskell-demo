You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The <strong>TNT</strong> site isn’t really a great place to go looking for <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">Internet TV</a> shows. In fact, the only reason to go there is if you are a rabid fan of TNT shows because there isn’t anything else there. And on top of that, there aren’t even that many episodes of actual TNT shows.","TNT seems more like a site designed to tease you with the prospect of full episodes only to let you down with a bare-bones selection and a mess of clips that you don’t even care about. It’s pretty disappointing when compared to so many other Internet TV sites that have more content than you can possibly see. ","As mentioned above, the TNT site is pretty short on full episodes. Instead there are hundreds of clips and montages promoting the various shows on the network. The TNT site is most useful if you need a quick refresher on the last episode before the next one comes on TV because the TNT site has a lot of “Recaps” of the latest episode. That’s fine, except we want to see full episodes!","TNT also tries to proffer “web exclusives” as a reason to use the site, but there are very few of them and not really as interesting to the average viewer as full episodes of their favorite show.","TNT has a pretty drab design, although we admit that the color scheme doesn’t really affect ease of use. But the site does have a buggy feel because some links to videos took us to completely different videos. The options for embed or share videos are easy to see and all the categories of videos are organized with a tabbing system.","The TNT site uses a combination of video commercials and image ads that aren’t too obtrusive on the viewing environment. In fact, we actually like the way TNT handles advertisements because some of the commercials during a show are promos for the next episode of the live show that will be airing on TV. Commercials are far less annoying, we found, if they are directly related to the video we’re watching.","The features on the TNT site are very straightforward. There are links to share the video, embed it (only for clips), and highlight the video for social bookmark sites. We also liked a special feature that lets you choose which scene in the full episode you want to jump to instead of requiring the viewer to move the little slider bar to where they estimate they want to jump to. It’s a lot easier to use the scene selection tool.","TNT offers email support and a FAQ for when you run into problems. You can also try asking for solutions on the user forum."]},"id":"5373243b-12c1-49a9-90e2-1970fd10a17a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"973762d0-a85d-45b3-b4c1-f804140fb8a6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TNT doesn’t rank well because it has such a narrow selection of content that only applies to fans of a few select <strong>TNT</strong> shows."]},"id":"451d4b4c-7ebb-4f58-abf8-b2baf3d0b450","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2590","url":"/tnt-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-08-26T16:52:29Z","datePublished":"2008-08-26T16:52:29Z","name":"TNT","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":68,"verdict":"Drab design, poor selection prevents TNT from scoring higher in our evaluation.","pros":["TNT produces some of the most original programming on television."],"cons":["Selection is barebones, very few full episodes are found on its servers."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-08-28T20:34:05Z","id":"XEVFi9qhdfFNQdPNYxJTAk","meta":{"title":"TNT Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of TNT.
