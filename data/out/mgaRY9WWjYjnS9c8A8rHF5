To give your children the head start they need, it&#39;s important they learn how to type quickly and accurately while they are young. The better your kids can type, the better they can communicate. Typing skills give your children an advantage in school and set them on the right path in today&#39;s competitive job market.","Keyboarding classes are offered to students entering high school, but why wait? Public and homeschool children alike need correct and consistent instruction to learn proper typing technique. Letting your child loose on a keyboard can encourage improper posture and poor typing habits, which may be tough to break later in their life. Typing software specifically for kids establishes a structured and engaging space that motivates your child to learn. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent about 10 hours evaluating kids typing software and even used some of the programs ourselves. As we compared the programs, we considered the number of lessons and games they have as well as if they have basics such as timed typing tests. In addition, we noted if they teach how to type on other keyboards like a 10-key numeric pad.","While we consider testing serious business, we also had a little fun. In our evaluation, we noted how high-quality each program’s graphics look, how fun its games are and whether it gave us encouragement along the way. Taking user reviews and YouTube video tutorials into account, we favored more intuitive programs that don’t require you read a user manual to get started.","As your children learn to type quickly and accurately, they also learn to communicate more effectively. Programs with engaging games and awards help kids of any age learn to type properly without making it seem like drudgery. Typing software gives children a chance to learn typing techniques, proper posture, language skills and the joy that comes from independent learning.","<strong>What to Look for When Shopping for Typing Software for Kids</strong>","Lessons &amp; Drills<br/>No matter the target age, typing software for kids should start with the basics of proper finger placement and movement. The best software begins with lessons focusing on individual fingers and each hand. After your children learn proper finger placement, the remaining lessons boost their accuracy and speed. Keyboarding drills, timed typing tests, and engaging, multi-level typing games all reinforce the skills taught in each lesson.","The best lessons move gradually by focusing on a few keys at a time before building to letter chains, words and sentences. This can take a while, so it&#39;s important for software to have fun games to keep kids typing and practicing their new skills. The best software teaches children about good posture and proper hand and wrist positions while typing. This can help avoid future problems with carpal tunnel syndrome and various neck and back ailments.","Features<br/>Because each child learns differently, it&#39;s important to find typing software that gives you the reigns as a teacher or parent. Each program lets you customize features like challenge levels, word-per-minute goals, timed lessons, typing tests and more. Some kids keyboarding programs let you create custom practice material that allows children to write their own stories or practice with text from their favorite books. Features like this make learning easier and encourage your child to interact with the software. Other engaging features include audio dictation, keystroke sounds and virtual guide hands over the keyboard.","Beyond interactive features, the best software rewards your child for hard work with pop-up encouragement and printable certificates of achievement. These can help kids stay motivated and give them a sense of progress while learning how to type.","Progress Reporting<br/>Real progress will be obvious when you watch your kids type, but progress-reporting features are essential to really measure how well they are doing. Words per minute (WPM) and accuracy scores are common metrics on progress reports, but some reports break these down further and produce data for each finger, hand and key.","Help &amp; Support<br/>At minimum, typing software includes a user guide or manual explaining how to use the program. Many keyboarding programs target home and school use, so you can find information online via FAQs and technical support. Email and telephone support are best for further questions. Some keyboarding programs have in-app support containing indexes, definitions and guides to using the software.","<strong>When Should Kids Start Learning How to Type?</strong>","Typing is an essential skill that everyone needs to learn. Whether you’re typing up a paper for school, sending an email, posting an update on social media, or even drafting a report or memo for work – all of these require you to know how to type, so it makes sense that parents want their kids to learn this valuable skill as soon as they can.","And while young kids are sponges when it comes to learning new things, there may be a benefit to waiting until your child is between 7 and 10 years old (it can vary, depending on the kid) before introducing them to typing. While the task itself isn’t tough, there are myriad reasons – physical and intellectual alike – why kids should put off learning to type until they are this age.","Physically, kids younger than 7 lack the fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination or finger span to be able to touch type efficiently and effectively. Developmentally speaking, control over the body first starts with core muscles and large motor skills, then moves outward and becomes more fine-tuned over time. This is the same reasoning behind not putting your child in violin lessons before they turn 7 or 8. Kids can tinker with typing when they are younger, familiarizing themselves with the concept or keyboard layout, and it may help them improve their motor skills, but it’s best to wait until they are at least 7 to start teaching kids how to type in earnest.","This age also lines up with when children are learning to better express themselves using written rather than spoken language. Another reason to wait is screen time. If you’re concerned about keeping your young kids away from too much screen time for as long as possible, it’s best to wait until they’re older for typing lessons."]},"id":"756f03a5-be3d-4654-a29b-e9e843bd3694","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"abac086e-4c52-4228-a587-29fba9bb1f88","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/typing-instructor-for-kids-review\">Typing Instructor for Kids</a>","<a href=\"/typing-quick-easy-review\">Typing Quick &amp; Easy</a>","<a href=\"/mavis-beacon-review\">Mavis Beacon Keyboarding Kidz</a>","<a href=\"/mickey-s-typing-adventure-review\">Mickey&#39;s Typing Adventure</a>","<a href=\"/all-the-right-type-review\">All the Right Type</a>","<a href=\"/ultrakey-review\">UltraKey 6 Personal License</a>","<a href=\"/garfield-s-typing-pal-review\">Garfield&#39;s Typing Pal</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1d15e086-f640-4141-96bf-e5d925939db9","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_341","url":"/best-typing-for-kids-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-30T04:41:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-30T04:41:00Z","name":"The Best Typing for Kids Software of 2019","synopsis":"Typing software teaches children correct finger-to-key movement across the keyboard and includes lessons to keep them motivated.","review":{},"strapline":"Typing software teaches children correct finger-to-key movement across the keyboard and includes lessons to keep them motivated.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-12T21:37:36Z","id":"mgaRY9WWjYjnS9c8A8rHF5","meta":{"title":"Best Typing Programs for Kids 2019 -
