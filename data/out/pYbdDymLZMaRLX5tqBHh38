Our research shows there are numerous metal detecting clubs across the country. If you find yourself struggling, a quick Google search for your nearest metal detecting treasure hunter group could result in not only helpful pointers, but also some new friends. If you live on the coast, the Quick Draw Pro might not be for you though. The instructions specifically say it is not for use on wet sand saltwater beaches.
