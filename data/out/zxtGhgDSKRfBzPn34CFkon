You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE Cafe CGS990SETSS is a <a href=\"/best-double-oven-ranges\">gas-range double oven</a> that offers convection technology, five burners and a handful of features. It also provides up to 6.7 cubic feet of cooking space, a sleek stainless steel finish, and both knobs and a touch display to control the variety of features and settings.","The two ovens on the GE Cafe are different sizes. The upper oven provides 2.4 cubic feet of space, while the lower oven is 4.3 cubic feet. Each oven also uses a different cooking technology. The upper oven uses traditional cooking capabilities, while the lower oven boasts convection technology. With convection cooking, a fan inside the oven circulates the hot air, which makes food cook more evenly and faster. The <a href=\"/kitchenaid-review\">KitchenAid</a> double oven range has two convection ovens that run on electric power and a five-burner stovetop that runs on gas.","The five burners on the gas cooktop provide plenty of power for different cooking levels, with one of the highest maximum Btu powers available on these stoves. The power on the cooktop ranges from 5,000 Btu to 20,000 Btu, which is about as wide a range as you can find. The burners with less power are ideal for simmering.","There are only two racks for the ovens. Most double ovens offer at least three, as more racks allow you to cook multiple dishes at once in the same oven. However, for some flexibility, the upper oven features two rack positions, and the lower oven has four.","The controls for the GE Cafe are on the front panel. This is the preferable placement, as you don&#39;t have to reach through steam or over splattering oil to adjust the temperatures and times for either the oven or the cooktop. You control the ovens with a touch display and the stovetop with knobs.","This double oven&#39;s cooking settings include delayed bake and a warming option, so you can set it to turn on at a specified later time or to remain warm enough to keep from food from cooling off or overcooking. It even includes a Sabbath mode, which allows you to keep the oven on for extended periods of time at a specified temperature. You can use this feature for baking and roasting but not with convection cooking. Furthermore, this range double oven has a built-in meat probe to ensure your food is cooked to the desired temperature. However, it does not feature a quick preheat setting to save you time in a pinch.","GE covers this oven under a one-year manufacturer warranty. This is the average amount of time these appliances are covered. Some double ovens are covered for two years or more, though.","The GE Cafe CGS990SETSS provides many of the features you need in a gas-range double oven. The appearance is clean and modern, and it gives you 6.7 cubic feet of cooking space. It also has five powerful burners that can do it all, from simmering to searing, and the lower oven features convection capabilities. This double oven range provides the power and the capabilities to prepare numerous dishes at once."]},"id":"5ae8b761-8a05-422e-8b43-0a513a84829b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67566","url":"/ge-cafe-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-01-14T20:49:00Z","datePublished":"2016-01-14T20:49:00Z","name":"GE Cafe CGS990SETSS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product is no longer available from the manufacturer.
