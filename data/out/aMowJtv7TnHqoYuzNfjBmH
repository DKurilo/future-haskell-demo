Fixed-rate mortgages for purchase are available for 15- or 30-year terms, or you can go for the “Yourgage” and choose your own term from eight to 30 years. You can put as little as 3 percent down, and Quicken’s PMI Advantage lets you opt for a higher interest rate instead of a PMI payment or prepay your PMI up front to reduce total costs. This mortgage lender also offers 5/1, 7/1 or 10/1 adjustable-rate mortgages with as little as 5 percent down (the number before the slash refers to the fixed-rate term, after which the rate is adjustable annually).","Quicken Loans provides FHA and VA loans for purchase or refinance, and the FHA Streamline refinance lets FHA borrowers apply for lower payments without an appraisal. The jumbo mortgage option can lend up to $3 million to borrowers with credit scores as low as 700.","<strong>Rates and Fees</strong>","While the Rocket Mortgage site does not disclose any rates until you apply for preapproval, Quicken does list national rates for the day. Those assume the purchase of two discount points, however, making the rates look deceptively lower than competitors’. The listed APR appears slightly higher than those of the best mortgage companies. No information is listed about closing costs until you complete an application, but other sources say origination fees are 0.5 percent for conventional loans and 1 percent for FHA and VA loans.","<strong>Customer Experience</strong>","Quicken Loans has topped <a href=\"https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2018-primary-mortgage-servicer-satisfaction-study\">J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction survey</a> for the past few years. It has an A+ rating with the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/us/mi/detroit/profile/consumer-finance-companies/quicken-loans-inc-0332-8059\">Better Business Bureau</a>, and it has relatively few complaints in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau database. If you’re ready to shop for a mortgage, the company’s reputation for fast and easy service is a clear advantage. You will have to give up your personal info to get accurate information from Quicken Loans, however, so don’t begin the process until you are ready to have your credit checked.","When you apply through Rocket Mortgage, rather than having to look up all of your bank statements and pay stubs, you may be able to link to your accounts directly through the website, streamlining the process (that idea may seem invasive, but so does every aspect of applying for a mortgage). The site will help track your progress through the process and keep you up to date on your status before closing.","Quicken Loans does sell its mortgages to investors (that’s the business model of most nonbank lenders), but it still services 99 percent of the loans it writes. So even if your mortgage is sold, Quicken will most likely handle the customer service end of the deal. But if what you want is a truly personal approach to your borrowing experience, you’re better off going to a smaller local bank or a big one with a local branch."]},"id":"2c7649ce-40ee-4ae5-82db-9417cf6fe608","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70249","url":"/rocket-mortgage-by-quicken-loans-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sabrina-rojas-weiss","url":"/author/sabrina-rojas-weiss","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sabrina Rojas Weiss","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"tVZv6ejiouijuHU3n7n49Y","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-25T17:39:43Z","datePublished":"2018-09-25T17:39:43Z","name":"Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans","synopsis":"Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans is a way to quickly apply for a mortgage online.","review":{"rating":39,"pros":["Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans makes it extremely easy to apply for a mortgage completely online, with the ability to access your bank and employment information directly from the application form. Quicken, now the largest mortgage lender in the country, has the highest customer satisfaction rates, too.
