The picture is ultra-smooth, with vibrant and accurate color representation. The darkest parts of the screen are absolutely black and the brightest parts are vivid and pop off the screen. The picture looks as if you are looking through a window. It&#39;s about as close to real life as we&#39;ve seen. The picture quality is simply outstanding.","We watched a number of movies and 4K programs via our Sony 4K media player. One standout moment was during a live musical performance by Emi Myers. Her dress appeared a vibrant red, and the drummer&#39;s actions were smooth without blur. You could see his sticks move seamlessly through the air. The standup bass on stage displayed warm wood grain coloration that you could visibly point out. The contrast was also great enough to actually see the honeycomb pattern inside of the stage lights. Most TVs fell short in one area or another, but the LG outperformed the competition. Some would have flat color, making her dress look less saturated, or we would notice jitter as the drummer played. The OLED TV really made its mark during this viewing test.","The picture looks good from straight on and from the left and right of center. The picture remains the same top quality. Many other 4K LED TVs we reviewed tend to wash out or darken when you view them from an angle. This was not an issue with the LG OLED TV.","To further test the TV, we used our pattern generator, sensor and Calman software to determine each set&#39;s contrast ratio and color accuracy. As we suspected, the LG OLED55E6P had the best contrast ratio and color accuracy in our lineup. The contrast ratio was as close to infinite as we had seen and the color accuracy on the cinema mode was the best performance we&#39;d seen from any TV. This further backed up what our eyes already knew – that this is the best 4K TV in our lineup.","One of the special features that this LG OLED TV boasts is 3D capabilities. It comes with a pair of 3D glasses. Pressing the 3D button of the remote control will activate this setting.","Sound quality is never great in TVs, but all things considered, this LED TV actually holds its own. The 40W speakers are located on the bottom of the panel facing the viewer. Since the speakers face the viewer, the sound actually comes toward the viewer instead of away, like most TVs that place their tiny speakers on the back or sides of the TV panel. These speakers seem louder than others, but by no means are they great."]},"id":"74f4f79c-ef93-4fba-9117-997744b93a81","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"616bed6d-5ea0-4b68-b112-e20074acc86c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/6fzxKT6GEdaj4n883wWxqk.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"If there is one knock on this TV, it&#39;s not actually the TV – it’s the remote that comes with it. While this magic remote has all the extra features that would usually make any remote great, such as voice search and gesture control, it&#39;s simply uncomfortable to use compared to others. It&#39;s big and heavier than others. There is a bunch of wasted real estate at the bottom of the remote that makes it much longer than it has to be. The scroll wheel in the middle of the remote isn&#39;t very pronounced as it sits almost flush with the surface of the remote, making it harder than others to use. Some buttons are raised, such as the volume and channel buttons, while some are flat, like all of the numbers. Everything is neatly labeled and easy to find. It just isn’t nearly as comfortable to hold as other remotes.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68207-lg-oled55e6p4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6fzxKT6GEdaj4n883wWxqk.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6fzxKT6GEdaj4n883wWxqk","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6fzxKT6GEdaj4n883wWxqk.jpg","alt":""},"id":"06760312-ec9c-4b91-ba23-83b82170c758","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LED flat panel TV features four HDMI inputs and three USB inputs as well as older composite inputs, an optical input for a sound bar and an Ethernet port, all of which are fairly standard practice for LED TVs."]},"id":"2d308de1-0aad-4353-a73d-63d7522aac4c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Smart Features"},"id":"86b50243-f016-427e-a131-ea1b8e387ca7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/qeigEgfgWfN2QCiJwLGHFf.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Even though the remote isn&#39;t the most comfortable to hold, it certainly has its share of features.
