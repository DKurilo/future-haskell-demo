During our most recent refresh we spent more than 40 hours researching and evaluating the best models on the market. Out of dozens of models considered, we chose the ones with the best power and performance, convenience features, blower design and support options. Among other things we considered things like power source, weight, length, airspeed, vacuum functionality and vibration rates when deciding which model is the best for you.","In addition to extensive online research, we reached out to professionals and people who regularly use leaf blowers to get their informed opinions about the best products as well as usage and maintenance tips. We talked to Kevin Walker of KGW Services, a Massachusetts-based landscaping company, whose crew regularly uses leaf blowers during landscaping projects.","Walker feels some of the best brands of leaf blowers that he’s used in his landscaping business are Echo, Redmax, Husqvarna and Stihl. He said a gas leaf blower like the Echo PB-2520 is the best value for the money. He likes to use small Toro electric blowers for cleaning up stonework and other small jobs. However, he said he would like to see more options for electric battery blowers.","His crew uses mostly gas blowers, except for a couple corded electric blowers they keep on hand for smaller jobs, since gas blowers pack more punch for most jobs. Walker says he tries to steer clear of big store brands. He has a Ryobi model that worked well for its first tank of gas but would fail after that. “It has neat design ideas, but no reliability,” he said. Speaking of design Walker said he would like a manufacturer to develop a left-handed machine or a machine that lets you switch from the right to left hand with minimal effort.","When it comes to usage, Walker feels vacuuming is a more efficient way to get rid of big piles of leaves, instead of trying to blow a big pile from one location to another. Instead of using leaf blowers with a vacuum function, however, Walker says his crew uses a dedicated leaf vacuum that mulches the leaves it sucks up into a large enclosed dump trailer. This saves his crew members’ backs and time. He said leaf blowers are also useful in blowing away cobwebs and debris from entrances and worksites, pollen from cars and grass clippings from the sidewalk in the summer – and on a rare occasion very light snow in the winter.  ","As for maintenance, Walker said electric blowers don’t require any and the gas blowers require very little. For gas blowers the air filter occasionally needs to be changed or cleaned and his crew adds Star Tron fuel treatment to the fuel before storing the leaf blowers for the winter, which will keep the fuel fresh for when you need to use it in the spring.","When we evaluated leaf blowers, we scored machines with extra features like vacuum function, cushioned handles and anti-vibration higher than models that lacked these features. Landscaping companies like KGW Services use separate devices for vacuuming leaves, but we found that people who use leaf blowers for regular maintenance around their homes have more need for a vacuum function to clear a pile of leaves from a backyard or to suck a large spider web out of a corner.","<strong>How Much Does a Leaf Blower Cost? </strong>","Electric leaf blowers, whether they are battery-operated or chorded, are generally more cost-effective and require less maintenance. They are also less powerful and almost impossible to repair. The top-rated electric blowers are between $60 and $110. All the gas blowers we reviewed range in price from $130 to $180 and require a mixture of gas and two-stroke oil. If you regularly maintain a large yard we suggest spending a little more to get a gas-powered blower. Electric blowers are better suited for light-duty work in small yards.","<strong>How We Picked the Best </strong>","When we compared the best leaf blowers, we considered the following criteria: ","Power &amp; Performance<br/>We evaluated both gas and electric leaf blowers. We investigated how far each blower could move a pile of sawdust or lawn debris, such as grass clippings or leaves, and how quickly it moved it. The best leaf blowers could blow debris more than 17 feet.","We also assessed the weight and noise level of each model since both influence how long you can comfortably use the blower. We also checked whether the blower has other beneficial features, such as variable speed settings and whether it has a vacuum function. In addition to evaluating the power, weight and the noise level of each leaf blower, we also judged the maneuverability of each leaf blower.","Gas or Electric?<br/>When buying a leaf blower, you need to determine whether you&#39;d prefer a gas-powered or electric model. If you select a gas leaf blower, you’ll need enough strength and mobility to rev up the engine by using a pull cord, since it often requires a hard yank.  In addition, many gas-powered blowers consist of a two-stroke engine, which requires a mixture of gasoline and oil that you&#39;ll need to prepare and keep on hand.","If you choose an electric leaf blower, you must either remember to charge the battery before use (if it has a battery) or, for corded models, find an outlet that gives you the best access to your yard. Another consideration before you buy is the issue of a cord getting tangled around objects like sprinkler heads and shrubs.","If you prefer total control over the blower&#39;s speed and you have a big area to cover, choose a unit that offers substantial power and maneuverability. If you have a smaller yard and only plan to do the occasional simple cleanup, then one with less power and maneuverability will work nicely.<br/><br/>Conveniences<br/>The best leaf blowers offer variable speeds, which allows you to set the speed of the blower for the job at hand, usually through numbered knobs near the blower’s handle or by how far you squeeze the handle lever. A vacuum function, while not essential, can be quite helpful. If the blower comes with a vacuum function, then look for vacuuming accessories, like attachments, for more specific jobs.","<strong>Leaf Blowers: Other Considerations </strong>","Blower Design: How Comfortable Is the Blower to Hold?<br/>Most blowers feature a soft-grip handle, and it should be at a good angle and made with a soft cushioned material to ease strain on your hands. The rest of the design should fit your needs. If you plan to use the blower for several different functions, look for one with adjustable extension tubes. The overall size of the leaf blower, and how easily you can carry it, also influence your ability to use it.","All power tools, and <a href=\"/best-electric-lawn-mowers\">lawn care machines</a> are no exception, produce vibration. The more the leaf blower vibrates, the harder it is to use over an extended period. Anti-vibration technology is also a large part of comfort, and it makes the leaf blower easy to maneuver with less annoyance. Look for blowers with specific features that reduce the amount of vibration the machine produces.","Noise Level: Should You Use Ear Protection?<br/>Most leaf blowers are unavoidably loud, so it is important to choose one that has the least potential for disturbing people. Although the noise levels are similar between most, a few are quieter than others. The quietest machine is the Black &amp; Decker LSWV36, which only produces 86.2 decibels.","The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) recommends wearing hearing protection any time you&#39;re exposed to sounds louder than 85 decibels, so you should wear ear protection when using any of our suggested leaf blowers.<br/><br/>Corded or Battery-Powered Leaf Blower?","There are two types of electric leaf blowers: battery-powered and corded. One advantage of battery-powered models is that they&#39;re portable; they don&#39;t require you to be tethered to an electrical outlet. However, they have some downsides. For example, it takes hours to fully recharge the battery on these models, and they require additional storage space for the charger. ","Corded models may be good for you if you don’t blow leaves very often or if you have a smaller yard. Even though corded blowers have basically unlimited runtimes, the length of the extension cord will limit you.","Warranty and Support: What If Something Goes Wrong?<br/>The best leaf blowers should also be backed by great support and service. An instruction manual is essential for every leaf blower, because many require some form of assembly. It’s best to get a brand that provides both a physical copy and an online one (in the event the physical copy is misplaced). Having support through email and phone is also useful.","In addition, a multiple-year warranty is ideal, especially if you use your leaf blower frequently.
