You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sony Internet Player with Google TV provides a way to connect your HDTV to the internet and the wealth of media available online. Instead of connecting directly to your TV, this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-streaming-players,review-2140.html\">home media server</a> connects to your TV via your cable box and enhances your cable watching experience by adding internet content into single interface, powered by Google.","One advantage to the single interface on this media player is that since the cable and the Sony box share the same HDMI input, you don&#39;t have to switch inputs when you switch between live TV and Sony Internet Player&#39;s apps and services. This means you can do things like set your DVR to record your favorite cable TV show and then check your Facebook account without any input switching.","Another nice feature that fits in well with our multi-tasking world is a picture-in-picture function that allows you to do things like check your Twitter account while you&#39;re watching a movie.","On the down side, you are not able to access your personal media files unless they happen to be available online.","The Sony Internet Player gives you access to online content via Google TV. Early on, Google TV struggled, but the newer version found on the Sony Internet Player is definitely an improvement. It really could use another software overhaul, but it appears as if the service is moving in the right direction.","One flaw with this version of Google TV is that dedicated apps like MLB.TV, NBA and NHL are still missing, despite being readily available on many home media devices out there. Additionally, browser-based video streaming on Google TV&#39;s software is blocked by such major content providers as ABC, CBS, NBC, MTV, Fox and others. And to add insult to injury, Google TV doesn&#39;t support Google&#39;s own movie rental service on this device.","One stand out feature is the stunningly designed remote. If it was as easy to use as it is nice to look at, it would be approaching perfection. However, the remote is relatively complicated. It&#39;s not entirely intuitive, with the most often used buttons (the channel, volume, play and pause) not in the most prominent or logical positions. Play, pause, forward and rewind are small buttons on the front. And the volume and channel are rocker buttons on the side. Once you get used to it&#39;s not at all bad, but it does require patience.","The QWERTY keypad is helpful for navigating through Google TV&#39;s features, but like the rest of the remote, it takes some getting used to. The backlit keyboard is a nice feature.","Sony&#39;s customer support is available via phone, email or live chat, and representatives can help with any issues or questions you may have as you are getting everything set up."]},"id":"ab41f92c-51de-4ab8-8210-33a506ed6856","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ed0d7b77-f28e-40eb-9c8d-f5629a698a2d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony Internet Player media server is essentially a portal to the web for your TV.
