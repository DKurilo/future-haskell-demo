You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Zadro Portable Sunlight 365 is an inexpensive LED blue light lamp that can help with light therapy. Its compact size makes it a great travel accessory; however, the plastic body is susceptible to warping if exposed to heat variations, so you should protect it from extreme temperatures. It comes with many features for a customizable experience and can easily slip into a purse or briefcase for use at home or work.","This sun lamp pumps out 10,000 lux of light, which you can use with most <a href=\"/best-light-therapy-lamps\">light therapy</a> programs to fight the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder and jetlag. Unlike larger units, the Zadro Sunlight Machine uses a combination of 35 LED lights to achieve these light levels. LED lights have several considerable benefits over traditional light bulbs. For instance, these smaller bulbs shine with greater intensity without generating any heat, and they last for years.","You can control the light intensity, too. This blue light lamp comes with onboard buttons that adjust intensity from 10 percent to 100 percent of 10,000 lux. When you press the buttons, the light intensity changes immediately. The LED lights prevent flickering, and they do not generate any buzzing noises. This quiet, heat-free performance lets you put the lamp next to other electronics without any concern of overheating, and you can use it at work without creating additional distractions.","This lamp is compact and portable. It measures 7.5 inches on the longest edge and comes with a handy kickstand to prop up the device. The sun lamp comes with a travel pouch to protect it during travel. The plastic body may warp if exposed to excessive heat or wide temperature variations. If you plan on traveling with this unit, be sure to pack it in such a way that it will be safe from extreme temperatures. If you&#39;re looking for a small LED light that won&#39;t warp as easily, you might be interested in <a href=\"/lightphoria-review\">Lightphoria</a>. Zadro is the least expensive unit in our comparison. However, Zadro only covers this compact light box with a 90-day warranty, which is the shortest in our comparison.","Blue light lamps like the Portable Sunlight Machine create a unique spectrum of light that works with light therapy. It doesn&#39;t create UV rays, so you do not need to worry about sunscreen or extra eye protection when using it. The lamp can be placed next to books and computer screens, where you can enjoy the experience from a periphery, and you can adjust intensity as needed.","This unit comes with an internal timer and clock. The lamp is battery-powered and you can purchase an adapter for charging. The sun lamp&#39;s front display uses backlighting that illuminates the information even when the lamp&#39;s primary lights are off."]},"id":"d75abbb5-9a22-4bea-81c6-ce3cd8e2f4e2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64167","url":"/zadro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-14T21:07:21Z","datePublished":"2015-04-14T21:07:21Z","name":"Zadro Portable Sunlight 365","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":47,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-11T00:00:00Z","id":"gqnsRqA6t9rtefgWWwoFbW","meta":{"title":"Zadro Portable Sunlight Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Zadro Portable Sunlight is an LED blue light lamp.
