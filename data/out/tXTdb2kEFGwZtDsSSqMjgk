Its MSRP of $149.99 is in the midrange of our <a href=\"/best-electric-razors\">top 10 electric razors</a>, and it earned a B rating for user experience in our testing. Unlike our favorite rotary razor, the <a href=\"/philips-norelco-7500-review\">Philips Norelco 7500</a>, the Remington did not provide a uniform shave, and it irritated our testers’ faces. Neither shaver, however, performed as well as the foil razors we tested.","In fairness, users of rotary razors typically get less smooth results than users of foil shavers. Further, based on our research and testing experience, your best bet for a truly clean shave is a manual razor. On the flip side, rotary razors can be quicker, easier and safer to use.","If you’re looking for the closest shave we found, we recommend the <a href=\"/panasonic-arc4-review-review\">Panasonic Arc4 ES-LA93-K</a>. Our testers who used this time-tested foil shaver achieved excellent results. If you want a foil razor but are loyal to the Remington brand, we recommend the <a href=\"/remington-f8-wetech-review\">Remington F8 WETech</a>. With an MSRP of just $69.99, the F8 WETech is our best value pick.","Comparable to the F8 WETech, the HyperFlex XR1470 has a long-lasting battery that gives you 60 minutes of use time between charges. Its LED indicator tells you how many minutes you have left, so you won’t be caught off guard with a low battery. Though a full recharge takes 90 minutes, which is longer than average, a quick-charge function can provide enough juice for a single charge if you don’t have time to wait. As with half of the razors we tested, this one does not have a corded-use option. However, it does have a sturdy charging stand.","This electric razor is waterproof and can be used with shaving foam or gel. You can shave at the sink, in the shower or dry, and the HyperFlex XR1470 is washable under running water. Its shaving head flexes and pivots to follow the contours of your face, chin and neck, and unique to this razor, its blades have an anti-microbial coating. The motor also has a turbo setting to give you a 10-percent power boost when you’re shaving through denser facial hair. Like each of the razors we tested, this one has a trimmer for detailing.","The HyperFlex XR1470 has universal voltage adaptation and a travel lock, but it doesn’t come with a travel pouch. Its warranty is a standard two years, and customer service is available by phone and email."]},"id":"87dc5a8e-d954-420e-b699-9d1355565498","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69554","url":"/remington-hyperflex-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-31T15:42:42Z","datePublished":"2017-07-31T15:42:42Z","name":"Remington HyperFlex XR1470","synopsis":"The Remington HyperFlex XR1470 is an average rotary razor with an average price.
