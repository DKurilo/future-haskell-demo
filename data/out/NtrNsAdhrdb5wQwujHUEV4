Our in-house experts were especially impressed with Minted&#39;s paper and envelope quality, but the print quality, while providing accurate color, was a little fuzzy. This service is the most expensive printing company we reviewed, but it also allows you to completely personalize your cards in ways other companies don&#39;t. If you want to make a statement for a formal event or occasion, Minted is the way to go.","Minted has some of the most tasteful <a href=\"/best-photo-cards\">photo card</a> designs we have seen in our review. This company regularly sponsors challenges that allow users to vote for their favorite designs by independent artists, making room for more variety. This also allows Minted to carry greeting card designs people actually want to buy rather than having dozens of stock designs. Unlike other photo card publishers, this company is more like a collective of independent designers than a big corporation. That puts the focus on great art, which really shows in Minted&#39;s selection of personalized holiday cards. You can also pay a Minted artist to create a custom design for your special event.","You’ll need to spend a lot more than $35 in order to get any cards from this service. The least expensive paper option - the smooth signature cardstock - cost $73 before taxes and shipping factor in for 25 cards. That’s about $2.92 per card. Minted does offer large quantity discounts but the price is far more than you’d spend with other companies. We were charged for both standard shipping and taxes. The amount this will total depends on the state you live in and your proximity to Minted’s printers.  For anyone looking for photo cards on a budget, you might want to consider <a href=\"/amazon-review\">Amazon Prints</a>.","Testers found our sample of the most basic paper offered by Minted to be noticeably good. The standard envelope was thick and sturdy, much better than others in our comparison. It has a feeling of classy stationery more than bargain-level convenience. The already-gorgeous designs are accented with customization options like your choice in backer patterns for flat cards or interiors of folded cards. You can customize further with the option to have your card cut with scalloped edges and other distinct borders. The image quality was really good as was the color accuracy.","We also ordered a set of 25 Triple Thick cards. You might even call these ridiculously-fancy thick. They feel more like wood or foam core and will more likely snap in half than crease. But that’s unlikely since they are such sturdy cards. The color accuracy was good but the images appeared a little blurry compared to the other cards. Minted’s logo is printed on the backside of the card in small letters as is the name of the artist who designed the card. <br/>This site lacks a few of the added features we saw with other photo card services. Minted does not mail your cards for you, but it prints your addresses on the envelopes to save time. You can even have recipients&#39; addresses written in a creative font that coordinates with your photo card.","Minted does offer paper proofs, but you’ll need to specify that you want one when checking out. The smallest number of cards you can order is 25. In addition, you can get a high-quality digital proof, created by a designer, which is almost as telling as a paper proof in regard to what your final card will be.","The best photo cards are the ones you can make on your own, and Minted allows that in many ways. One way is the wide selection of paper for your photo cards and envelopes. You can line envelopes with different papers that complement your design as well.","We could not find any completely blank designs, but you can find just about everything else on the website – birthday cards, Christmas cards, baby shower invitations, graduation invitations and many more, ready to customize with your own text and photos with Minted&#39;s easy interface. The offerings for the holidays were especially impressive and cover a truly wide range of special days, including Thanksgiving, New Year&#39;s, Kwanzaa and more.","This online service makes it easy to find the card that would work best with your photos by offering a range of search filters. You can narrow your template selection to the number of photos you have and whether they are vertical, horizontal or square. You can also upload a photo and see how it would look in many templates with just a couple of clicks.","Minted got our cards to us decently fast. Delivery times depend on many factors, including how far you live from whichever photo card maker you choose, but we were impressed with our experience with this company. Once you make an order, Minted will email you a digital proof of your card. You must approve this design before the cards will be printed and mailed.","If you ever get confused, you can refer to Minted&#39;s strong customer service, which is available via live chat, phone and email. A detailed FAQs page also offers the answer to many questions so you do not have to wait in line for a response.","Minted does not offer every service we saw from competitors, but this company&#39;s photo card designs are sophisticated and memorable. You can tell that talented designers are involved in every step of the process with Minted photo cards. It’s probably due to this that the cards cost more than any other service we tested. The high price makes this a less-desirable choice for the average buyer. But if you consider yourself a patron of the arts and want elegant cards, this is the service to use."]},"id":"18f9f89d-805b-4b6d-abc1-a3025d61d642","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57813","url":"/minted-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-17T17:28:15Z","datePublished":"2013-10-17T17:28:15Z","name":"Minted","synopsis":"Minted's site is easy to use, and the card samples we ordered had some of the best design quality of any company in this comparison.
