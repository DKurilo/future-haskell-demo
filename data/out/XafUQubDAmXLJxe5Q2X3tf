For example, you can make interest-only payments while you’re in school and start paying principal plus interest when you’re no longer in school. Another option is to make a minimum monthly payment of $25 while you’re in school. These options both give you a head start on paying off your loan. Private loans are unsubsidized, so interest accrues while you’re in school. If you can afford making some kind of payment while you take classes, you’ll be that far ahead when the loans come due.","The most common option is to defer making payments while you’re enrolled in college. With Ascent this deferment lasts up to 60 months. You need to be enrolled at least half time.","Ascent’s loans have terms of 5, 10 or 15 years. The term often depends on the type of interest rate. If you have a variable rate on your loan, you can get up to a 15-year term, while fixed-rate loans have a maximum term of 10 years. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"b10ed897-1437-4197-afcf-1c25a43c47be","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ascent doesn’t have any origination, disbursement or application fees.
