This category of products would be easy to compare features and make blind recommendations, but we prefer to test in real-world scenarios so that we can detect unique features and shortcomings that you won’t find in bullet-point marketing materials. For instance, we found that the placement location of outdoor sensors is dependent upon the metrics they are capable of measuring. A sensor that measures wind and rainfall should be placed in an open area. Sensors that measure only temperature and humidity are more accurate in shaded areas.","All the weather stations we tested were assembled and installed in one reviewer’s backyard. That allowed us to record measurements three times per day and compare them against reputable local and national weather reporting.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We ordered all the weather stations in this comparison from authorized retailers and made note of the packaging and reported any shortcomings in the product reviews. We unboxed and assembled each product, and recorded our experience with the assembly process. We found most of the products that require batteries didn’t include them in the retail packaging, which is surprising considering the cost of some of the products.","Once we had all the modules assembled, we tried various mounting positions to find the most accurate placement positions. We mounted the outdoor sensors in the best possible locations and went inside the house to determine how easily each product’s outdoor sensor synced up to the accompanying indoor module. We found that some of the sensors had trouble connecting if the batteries weren’t installed in the sensor before the console was powered up.","We collected data from the stations and compared that to reputable local and national weather reporting services. We were lucky enough to have a couple of rainstorms roll through during our week of testing. That allowed us to test every measurement device on all 10 weather stations in our comparison.","<strong>How Much Does a Weather Station Cost?</strong>","You can drop as much a $1,000 on a weather station. However, you don’t need to spend more than a few hundred dollars. The stations we reviewed cost from $40 to $150. If you just want to know the temperature, you don’t need to spend more than $60. However, if you want to know wind speed, rain accumulation and other metrics, expect to spend $100 or more.","<strong>What Features to Look For When Buying a Weather Station</strong><br/> <br/>Wind and Rain Measurements<br/>Most of the basic weather stations in our comparison have sensors that measure only outside temperature and barometric pressure. If you want to know how windy it is outside or to measure rainfall, choose a weather station that has an outdoor sensor capable of tracking those metrics.","Indoor Consoles<br/>We found weather stations that include a well-lit and organized indoor reporting console were easy to read and allowed us to quickly check the important metrics without fumbling through menus. Also, some of the accompanying indoor consoles were powered by batteries, which we found to be an annoyance compared with consoles that are powered by an AC wall plug.","Durability<br/>Weather stations that are rated for high winds and extreme temperatures can last longer in unforgiving climates. The products we tested that can measure wind and rainfall need to be placed in an open area.
