Certain events may be unusual, but if you feel they warrant some kind of acknowledgement from you, a well crafted custom greeting card could do the job. ","<strong><strong>Here are 10 unique reasons to send a greeting card:</strong></strong>","Hang in there: After one of the worst recessions in history, millions of people have been laid off, fired, downsized   call it what you will. No matter how well prepared people think they are, this can feel like a punch in the stomach. If one of your friends is suddenly jobless, a card expressing support can lift their spirits tremendously.","<strong>I haven&#39;t forgotten:</strong> Quite often after an individual dies, that person&#39;s loved ones are surrounded by people offering condolences, food and all kinds of assistance. However, it also is commonplace for all that attention to fade away in fairly short order, while the bereaved person is still in pain. Depending on the individual involved, you might provide an extraordinary amount of comfort if you sent a lovingly worded card letting the individual know that you haven&#39;t forgotten the deceased and wish the survivor well.","<strong>A very happy unbirthday:</strong> If you know someone who loves to celebrate birthdays, why not have a little fun and zap off a mid-year unbirthday card? Make your birthday card design colorful, fill it with whimsical and light-hearted sentiments and make someone smile.","<strong>You&#39;re number one with me: </strong>You can never go wrong sending a cheer up card to someone who did not get particular job, win an award or achieve something. There&#39;s no need to dwell on why they should have gotten what they wanted. Instead, just express your confidence in them and list a few of their outstanding qualities.You are a class act: You might want to send a card when a friend handles a delicate social or professional situation wisely and well. Congratulate this person for exhibiting poise, graciousness and courtesy. Maybe no one else noticed, but you did, and your friend will no doubt be grateful that someone acknowledges that.","<strong>Just thinking of you:</strong> A card expressing this sentiment does just that   it lets someone else know you are thinking of him or her. You never know when a family member or friend might feel lonely or discouraged, so a card like this will be welcome indeed. If that individual is happy already, well, this just adds more happiness to an already pleasant life.","<strong>The only thing that matters is you:</strong> Okay, so your klutzy cousin tripped and accidentally splashed red wine on your expensive suit at a party. Why not send a card telling him that you love him no matter what, and that the most important thing that happened at the party was that you got to enjoy his company? He&#39;ll feel relieved and happy, and this could go a long way toward preserving a good relationship between the two of you.","<strong>Congratulations (even if it&#39;s something really small):</strong> Make a friend happy by noticing even a small achievement. Send a nice note if someone who was setting out to lose 50 pounds has so far lost five. Maybe someone getting a C in a class has managed to get a B-minus. Tell your friend that every step forward means progress, and that&#39;s a good thing.","<strong>Condolences on the death of a pet:</strong> Some people might consider this a silly exercise, but pet lovers everywhere know that dogs, cats and other animals are like family, and when one dies, it really is like losing a relative or dear friend. Treat this with the same dignity as a condolence card for a human, and it will go a long way toward comforting your friend.","<strong>No particular reason at all:</strong> This might be one of the best reasons to send a greeting card. Even if everything is going wonderfully well in someone&#39;s life, it&#39;s always great to hear from a loved one who says something positive and wishes you well. Why send a card like this? Well, why not?"]},"id":"7f94f863-5bf7-455b-88fe-d73f9173e5e3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7322","url":"/10-unique-reasons-to-send-a-greeting-card","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-23T16:34:53Z","datePublished":"2012-05-23T16:34:53Z","name":"10 Unique Reasons to Send a Greeting Card","synopsis":"With all the modern communication devices, products and avenues available, there are roughly millions of ways to express your feelings to someone special, even in the midst of an unconventional situat","review":{},"strapline":"With all the modern communication devices, products and avenues available, there are roughly millions of ways to express your feelings to someone special, even in the midst of an unconventional situat","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-31T21:44:12Z","id":"Ed8zmN2kTzNoThn8LokfEB","meta":{"title":"10 Unique Reasons to Send a Greeting Card","description":"There always have been unusual but meaningful reasons to send greeting cards.
