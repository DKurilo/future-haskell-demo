As digital resolution improves, the file size of photos increases, so you can really benefit from software that can quickly process large files, in large batches, and that also incorporates granular editing tools for fixing small details. While professional photographers strive to take perfectly composed shots with flawless exposure levels, most photos could still use subtle touch-ups. Serious photographers also need the file organization and conversion tools found in professional editing software. ","While <a href=\"#Photoshop\">Adobe Photoshop</a> has been a benchmark for professional photographers and digital artists, there are many other substantive competitors to consider.

Many people like using one program for organizing and another for editing. Some programs are often used in tandem, such as Photoshop and Lightroom. Some programs, like Portrait Professional, can be used alone or as plugins for Photoshop. Features to look for when you choose professional <a href=\"/best-photo-editing-software\">photo editing software</a> include organization and importing tools, the ability to edit batches and individual photos, the ability to customize your workflow and the options for publishing and output.","<strong>Organizational Tools<br/></strong> If you shoot a high volume of photos, organizational tools are critical. Some sports photographers will shoot thousands of photos in bursts to publish only a handful from a single event. Wedding photographers also take hundreds of shots to document one significant event. For these and many other instances, the most important part of post processing involves the ability to quickly sort through large batches of photos rather than make significant changes to individual photos.","<strong>Actions and Customization<br/></strong> Many photographers develop their own style of post processing. Once you’ve established a unique style and pattern of processing, much of what you do can be automated through recordable actions or presets. Many photographers display primarily black and white, or photos that emulate film processing, or something unique to their own brand. If you find yourself using the same actions or techniques of your own, you&#39;ll want photo editing software that can automate those actions to save you hours of extra work.","<strong>Publishing and Output<br/></strong> If you are working with high numbers of photos or if you frequently publish online to a blog, website or photo hosting service, it helps to have export options that are more sophisticated than simple saving features. Some photo editing software can include sharpening, resizing, adding color profiles and making other finishing touches to batches of photos. Likewise, if the majority of your work goes online for sale, blogging or other methods of publishing, some professional photo editing software can do this automatically.","<strong>Learning Curve<br/></strong> The more robust editing suites are some of the most complex consumer programs to learn. If you’re new to Photoshop or PaintShop, it may be worth investing in a formal class to get traction on the basic features. There are also countless YouTube channels, blogs and more formal online classes to help you understand the features of these programs.","A simpler option may be finding a program you can pick up quickly. Some programs will walk you through a workflow step-by-step, and if you don&#39;t need to work through multiple layers of edits, there are plenty of simpler options that streamline the editing process.","Professional photo editors play an essential part in a photographer’s workflow. Whether you spend hours on individual photographs or quickly make minor edits to batches of photographs, you can find photo software that will work for your needs.

While they’re both powerful post-processing applications in different ways, they work best in tandem. Perhaps a useful way to think of the two is that Lightroom is best for importing, exporting and large-scale editing; Photoshop is better for dialing down to finer editing, editing selections, creative work and spending time on single photographs.","If you shoot large numbers of photographs in a single setting, an organizational tool like Lightroom is indispensable. With Lightroom, you import the photographs directly by the program. Then you can quickly tag, rate or delete photographs in an efficient way with single keys or clicks. Lightroom recently added a facial recognition system that quickly learns to categorize your subjects. The software also creates collections, either manually or automatically, and you can organize by category, rating, subject or another method.","Lightroom also allows you to quickly burn through large numbers of photographs. If you have a large number of photographs taken in the same setting and the color is off, you can highlight them all and correct the white balance all at once. Likewise, if you discover that a batch of photographs needs any kind of editing such as exposure, contrast, lens distortion, vignetting or final sharpening, you can change the photos all at once or copy edits from one photograph to others in the batch.","If you use both Photoshop and Lightroom together, you can move from your organization in Lightroom to more ambitious changes in Photoshop; once you’re done in Photoshop, the changed photograph will again appear in Lightroom ready for exporting or publishing along with the rest of your batch. Lightroom features a wide array of exporting options, and any of your chosen methods of pre-printing sharpening, color and printer profiles, and book or online publishing can likewise be done in large batches.","Much of Lightroom&#39;s user interface is intuitive. The panels that guide you through your workflow are prominently displayed and easy to move through. You can begin navigating the program without any special training. Most people will benefit from some minor training or online resources to become really efficient with their work. Adobe offers a lot of online resources, including instructional videos. Because Lightroom is used by so many photographers, there is a wealth of free training available online if you want to become extra efficient with your time in the program.","Lightroom is a powerful professional photo editor that works as a standalone application, but it works especially well combined with Photoshop.

PhotoPlus feels a little like PC programs from years ago, with tiny icons and light-gray and white panels.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/10278/best-profession-10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GxvuWgpMSHxHHxEgBr3Hn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"3GxvuWgpMSHxHHxEgBr3Hn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GxvuWgpMSHxHHxEgBr3Hn.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1c07e75a-4ccd-4d22-81a5-d9314d9522b3","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can import and organize in a straightforward way. Once you install the program, the Organizer will automatically grab all the photos in your image folder. You can organize by star rating and various tags, but not by facial recognition, flagging or other tools commonly found in photo editing software. Likewise, the organizational tools are scarce and not very powerful. However, importing is quite easy, and you have the option of culling out photographs and tagging them during the import process. You can also open multiple files for editing and cycle between them in one session. For organization, however, X8’s Photostack is one of the weaker options if you’re looking for an all-in-one program.","The intended workflow isn’t as intuitive as it should be for a professional photo editor. There isn’t a clear progression between importing and organizing, making global and regional corrections, and exporting your images. You open separate windows for each, and unless you know what you’re looking for, you can miss whole windows of tools. There’s a dedicated Cutout Studio for making selections. The Photofix window does have most of the tools you’d expect, and you can make quick changes to white balance, exposure, brightness and contrast.","PhotoPlus has a large number of editing options, although it&#39;s missing some important ones. For example, you can make lens correction adjustments including vignetting, color fringing and barrel distortion, but there aren’t lens and body profiles, and none of the actions are automatic. There are, however, great options for working with layers and intuitive tools for fixing old photographs and enhancing portraits. The surface blur tool allows easy removal of blemishes and wrinkles without removing important facial detail.","There is a generous filter gallery for applying effects, and you also have a split screen available to see a before and after. You can add filter layers over the original – so the process is nondestructive. You can also make the layers interact with each other, with varying levels of opacity and blending modes. X8 also has non-destructive editing; for example, you can crop to specific aspect ratios and later change your mind.","You have a few options for sharing that include Facebook and Flickr, and you can geotag your photos and see the results on a global map. You can print to just about any paper size, in CMYK, and there are a few layouts to choose from to print multiple photos to single sheets. You can print in varying resolutions and color profiles, and you can export in the common file types for sharing photos.","One of the best features for new PhotoPlus users is a Learn tab in the startup window. You’re greeted with video tutorials for making the most of each of Serif’s features. Serif PhotoPlus also has an extension help system online and an in-program help tab for quick answers. There are a few trainings online from third-party channels as well. There are so many available tools in the program that the learning curve is steep, so you’ll likely need to delve into some of the available training materials to take advantage of all the offerings.","If you’re looking for a cheaper alternative to some of the all-inclusive programs for photographers on the market, Serif PhotoPlus X8 may be a good choice. The dated appearance, weaker organizational options and basic tools may be drawbacks for some, but PhotoPlus is feature-rich photo software that has a lot of offer. Hobbyists will appreciate the options that mirror higher-end editors, but professionals would miss the logical workflow and powerful organization of other editing programs.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"1c2ca9a3-5af4-4789-a589-461d68a5d680","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10278","url":"/best-professional-photo-editing-software-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-22T16:24:50Z","datePublished":"2016-11-22T16:24:50Z","name":"Best Professional Photo Editing Software Review","synopsis":"Whether you’re a professional photographer or a serious enthusiast, post-processing and organizing are an essential part of photography.","review":{},"strapline":"Whether you’re a professional photographer or a serious enthusiast, post-processing and organizing are an essential part of photography.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-04-20T14:35:18Z","id":"cLFTBxtfVtCKvuch2RgiSm","meta":{"title":"Best Professional Photo Editing Software Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
