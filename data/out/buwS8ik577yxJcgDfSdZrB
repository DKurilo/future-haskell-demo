First, you download the free Whistle 3 app and create a profile for your pet. We really liked the personalization options that let you enter in not only your pet’s name, but their breed, weight and even a photo.

While it doesn’t track the movement of your pet by the second, it updates every few moments so you can see what direction your pet is going. We noticed the updates lagged more in town surrounded by multi-story brick and metal buildings than it did out on hiking trails, but every time the location updated it was always extremely close to where the tag was. Our tests show you should be able to figure out where your pet is within about 100 feet – even less if your pet is sitting still.   <br />\n  <br />\nThe tag itself can attach snuggly to any collar with its rubber strap, and it only weighs 1 ounce. The dog we tested it out on didn’t even notice she was wearing it. It’s also waterproof (we dunked it to make sure) and durable. It stayed on while we hiked – and our test dog ran among the trees and bushes.

When we took this tag out on a hike, our part-time temporary furry employee, Chikaya, decided to run back and forth along the same stretch of trail several times.

These trackers typically have a range of a few miles and can be ideal for places where cell phone service is spotty. While they’re less common, some pet trackers require you purchase SIM cards separately from a cell phone service provider. You must then install the card yourself, so make sure to read the fine print and realize you might have to spend even more money if a SIM card is required.","Installing a SIM Card<br/>If your pet tracker requires a SIM card, installing it correctly is important. Slide out the SIM card tray and lay the card in place correctly, following the shape of the tray. It should be obvious which way the card needs to go. Now comes the important part: make sure to position the device on its side so you can slide the tray back inside horizontally. If you do this vertically, there’s a chance the card will slip off and fall into the device. It’s nearly impossible to get the card out if this happens, and if you end up taking it apart to do, so the tracker’s integrity will be compromised.","<br/>Battery Life<br/>Battery life for pet trackers varies by what type of tracker it is and what mode it’s in. For instance, keeping a tracker in live track mode is going to use more battery up than simply keeping it in monitor mode and setting up a geofence so that you get a notification if your pet crosses a predetermined boundary. Some trackers include an extra set of batteries you can switch out for continual use. Battery charging times also vary. Whichever unit you buy, make sure you know how long the battery lasts. A tracker won’t do any good if it’s dead.","Durability<br/>Adventurous dogs who go hunting, hiking and exploring in rugged outdoor areas need a tracker that can withstand some abuse. Note whether a tracker is waterproof or just water-resistant, and select one made of sturdier plastics and rubber. If you’re the loving owner of a demure kitty or pipsqueak of a puppy, then durability isn’t as important.
