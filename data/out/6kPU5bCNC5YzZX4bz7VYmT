The full-size Miss Geico is the fastest offshore catamaran in the world. Unfortunately, the same can&#39;t be said about the radio-controlled boat version. While it looks great skimming across the water, it lacks the handling, durability and run time of the <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">best remote control boats</a>.","To test each of the remote control boats in our review, we took them to a local reservoir and had a lot of fun carving out wakes in the water. While we had fun, we were also closely evaluating the handling, speed and durability of each boat. We also measured the run time of each boat, which reflects the battery&#39;s ability to power the boat&#39;s motor. The Miss Geico didn&#39;t fare very well in these tests.","When we put the Miss Geico on the water, it was impressive at first. The bright yellow hull looks great on the water. And when you accelerate from a start, the front of the boat lifts off the water as it cuts over the surface. However, we found that it doesn&#39;t handle left turns very well, which isn&#39;t uncommon for a racing catamaran, because they&#39;re designed to race in clockwise courses. To turn left, a wide arc is required. And the faster you go, the wider the arc. Conversely, the right turns are sharp. It&#39;s far too easy to turn too sharply and turn the boat on its end. For these reasons, it received a C- grade for handling.","Pro Boat&#39;s specification suggest it can reach speeds over 25 mph. We used a radar gun in our tests and the fastest speed that we were able to achieve was 20 mph. For comparison, the fastest boat in our tests was 28 mph. However, it took on a significant amount of water into the hull, which likely affected the top speed. We recommend using marine tape (which we didn&#39;t use) to seal the hull cap so it doesn&#39;t take on water.","The biggest disappointment with the Miss Geico RC boat is the run time. After just three minutes, the boat stalled and never started again. That said, we don&#39;t think this was due to the battery. When we tested the battery, it still had plenty of charge left. In addition, when we charged the battery up again and put it back into the boat, the motor simply failed to work. The boat was dead on the water, creating only a low buzz as we tried to accelerate. We checked all the wires and replaced the batteries in the transmitter and it still failed to start again. We suspect that the brushed motor may have seized up, perhaps from the water the hull was taking on in the few minutes on the water."]},"id":"291d4ca1-49d6-4d14-bef3-00610138d054","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4177667a-064c-4439-a8eb-8953bffa2a3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pro Boat Miss Geico looks great on the water, as it&#39;s identical to the famous full-size version of the boat.
