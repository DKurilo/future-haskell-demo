DeskJet 3755 All-in-One is a <a href=\"/best-compact-printers\">compact printer</a> that stands out in our review as one of the few devices that has a compact design but isn’t portable, and it is one of the few non-portable units that is still built to be easy to move. If you want the best home printer, you may want to look elsewhere, but if you want one of the best printers for college students or apartment dwellers, the HP DeskJet 3755 is a pretty good choice.","The DeskJet 3755 measures a compact 15.86 x 6.97 x 5.55 inches – not much larger than a shoebox – and weighs only 5.13 pounds. While that is heavier than the portable printer scanner combos in our review, like the <a href=\"/hp-officejet-mobile-review\">HP OfficeJet Mobile 200</a> or the <a href=\"/canon-pixma-ip-review\">Canon Pixma iP 110</a> it’s a far cry from the 15 to 40 pound weights of regular home inkjet printers. It may not be built for portable use – there’s no battery, and even though it’s small, it’s not small enough to tote along to class or the office – but it is delightfully compact and moveable. If you’re regularly moving from one apartment or dorm room to another, this is the printer to get. It’s small enough to move on your own without risking a back injury, fits nicely onto a small desk and offers enough functionality to meet all of your printing needs.","Print quality is good but not perfect. Regular documents are marked with several pinprick-size ink spots, and color printing suffers from noticeable banding. Black-and-white documents print at a reasonable speed of 7.89 pages per minute, but color documents print much slower at 3.75 pages per minute. As an all-in-one, the DeskJet 3755 boasts a built-in scanner and copier, but the machine’s small size necessitates a scroll scanner that scans as it feeds individual pages through instead of a flatbed scanner. The overall scan and copy quality is okay, but at default settings it copies at just three-quarters size.","HP’s ink prices usually aren’t bad, but the per-page cost of printing is high for an inkjet printer, with two standard-size ink cartridges (black and tri-color) selling for between $12 and $14 apiece. Since the cartridges can produce more than 100 pages, the print cost works out to 25 cents per page. HP does offer larger XL high-capacity cartridges, which reduce the cost to 19 cents per page, but that’s still a tad high compared to the 15-cent average for traditional inkjet printers. That said, HP does offer a cheaper alternative through its InstantInk subscription service, which delivers discounted ink by mail as you need it. For most users, the price of the subscription is much more affordable than buying the same ink cartridges without it.","The printer’s input tray holds up to 60 pages at a time, and its fold-out output tray can hold up to 25 printed pages. That’s a level of convenience that portable printers can’t match.","Then there’s the question of connectivity. The DeskJet 3755 connects via USB and Wi-Fi, and it works with both Windows and Mac systems. Its mobile printing options include support for Apple AirPlay and Google Cloud Print, and HP’s own ePrint app has an array of mobile printing features for smartphones and tablets. However, with the printer’s smaller size, you give up niceties like printing from USB storage or SD media cards – features that are common on larger inkjet printers. Such is the price of compact convenience.","The HP DeskJet 3755 All-in-One is covered by a one-year warranty. You can reach technical support through a number of channels, including phone, email, social media and live chat on HP’s site. Other support options include online manuals, troubleshooting tools, FAQs and customer forums."]},"id":"14df2fbf-764a-43a0-a166-b9cef875bdc7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"38e4d9f0-e143-4174-abc5-d2be3d9494ec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP DeskJet 3755 All-in-One may not be built for use on the go, but it’s one of the best mini printers on the market, offering all-in-one functionality in a compact design that’s easy to pick up and move.
