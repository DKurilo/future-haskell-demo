If you don’t like your digital redesign, you can tweak different aspects of it, or simply scrap it and start over. This software is a handy tool to have before you get started on the real thing and could save you quite a bit of cash since you’ve done much of the planning before consulting a contractor.","With this home design software for Mac, you can start creating your home from scratch or use a design template from the quick-start menu. You can easily drag and drop rooms into a floor plan that will automatically snap together – the Room Addition tool lets you add a sun room with a mouse click, for example – which makes it easy for beginners to get projects underway quickly. Among other things, this software lets you position electrical wiring and plumbing pipes.","This product gives you automatic dimensioning as you design floor plans. You also get home plan templates that you can customize, as well as a cost estimation tool that allows you to prepare a budget for your home remodel. The estimating tool is one of the handiest for your remodel project. Once you&#39;re satisfied with your design, the cost tool can produce a spreadsheet detailing material quantities, costs and schedules, and can break down the cost per room.","This home design Mac software can render your plans in multiple views, including a basic floor plan, framing, wireframe, 2D and 3D elevations, and aerial and cutaway views. You can even view the outside of the home from all angles using the helicopter and satellite modes. However, Punch Home Design Studio does not create movies that record 3D walkthroughs of your designs, unlike some competitors. In addition, you can export your finished product only in 3D, not 2D.","Punch Home Design Studio offers a kitchen builder to help you design your dream kitchen. You can create custom cabinets with the designer tool, and customize features as small as the drawer pulls and the door hardware, giving you the utmost control over the finest details of your 3D model home.","Punch Home Design Studio offers a plethora of design objects, colors, materials and more to help you create a realistic home design. It offers over 2,000 items in its objects library that you can place in your designs for a realistic rendering. Once you find your desired object in the large library, you just drag and drop it into your 3D model, which makes the process simple. The library offers appliances of varied shapes and styles, interior and exterior furniture, and even houseplants for those cozy finishing touches. It also has blinds, cornices and curtains for the windows. For landscaping, you get more than 4,000 types of vegetation in this software’s plant library, so you can choose to your heart’s content.","To help you use this software, you can view video tutorials. In addition, there is a list of FAQs on the website. Unfortunately, phone support is complicated. To get it, you must check the home page and call the toll-free number, which is intended to place orders but you can get to someone for support that way."]},"id":"d8e6eb91-1167-4986-88d1-04675d9cab56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d76fce3c-3751-411a-b1cb-823a322845ba","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Punch Home Design Studio for Mac can help you whether you&#39;re planning your dream house, redesigning your kitchen, repainting the interior or exterior of your home, or landscaping your yard.
