Aiseesoft offers a converter with a respectable feature set, exceptional conversion speed, high converted video quality and plenty of customer support. We were most impressed with the video quality that this converter maintained, even with its blazing speed; in only one minute of conversion time, Aiseesoft will produce a video that is four minutes long with a clear, accurate picture.","Aiseesoft is primarily a web-based company that specializes in video and audio conversion software. They pride themselves on the quality of the movies that their software produces, emphasizing both their high-quality audio conversions and their ability to convert video while maintaining fidelity to the original movie. We tested the software for each of these claims, and we found each claim to be well-supported.

This DVD to iPad converter software brings every necessary option that you’ll need to place high-quality videos on your iPad, even though it lacks an audio extraction tool. The application is still strong without this feature, however, and you will find that it serves your needs wonderfully as it is.","The conversion preview window is large and shows plenty of detail, giving you a good idea of the image quality that your final video will exhibit. It does not flow like a regular movie, however. Since the conversion speed is so high, it jumps from frame to frame very quickly and often jerkily. This is not reflected in the final video, though, so it’s not a huge concern. Below the preview window, Aiseesoft’s DVD to iPad converter displays two progress bars that show the length of time required to convert the entire project as well as the individual track that is currently in progress.","The standard features that allow you to add subtitles and adjust output parameters are present, allowing you to customize your video file easily. If you want to conserve space on your iPad, Aiseesoft’s DVD to iPad converter allows you to make changes in the output file to decrease the amount of space it takes up. And with their file merging abilities, you can combine multiple movie tracks and special features into one video, further saving space on your iPad."]},"id":"1bace57c-6176-4f59-8066-49ab16f4f6ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output"},"id":"f18f53e7-3c87-4372-ab3d-fd8ed8b9499e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aiseesoft features one of the quickest conversion times of any product we reviewed.

If you need to get your library of DVDs onto your iPad in a hurry, Aiseesoft will be one the best choices for this task.","The converted video that Aiseesoft’s application produced was smooth and accurate. We did notice that the picture was a touch darker after the conversion, but it was barely noticeable. The video fit our iPad’s screen wonderfully (in widescreen mode, of course), and it played without any problems.
