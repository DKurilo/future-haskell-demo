However, our testing showed that although this <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">meat thermometer</a> works well, there is little to differentiates it from many competing brands. It doesn&#39;t quite compare to the best thermometers we reviewed, and it&#39;s significantly more expensive than others.","This digital meat thermometer is manufactured with high-quality materials, including a stainless-steel probe that is shatterproof and water-resistant. This 4.25-inch probe can register temperatures between -58 and 572 degrees Fahrenheit with a three-second initial response time. Over the course of multiple tests, we noted that it took on average a quick eight seconds to register a final temperature readout.","The body of the instant-read meat thermometer has a backlit digital display with large, easily visible numbers. On the device’s back is a convenient temperature chart, listing ideal heats for a variety of meats. This proves especially helpful if you regularly cook a variety of meats, since each requires a different temperature to get the right level of doneness. Next to the device display are multiple buttons that control the thermometer&#39;s power and temperature measurement. You can also see the minimum and maximum temperatures the device has read while it has operated. Unfortunately, each of these buttons give a loud beep when pushed, which became annoying in our testing.","While the speedy response time and wide temperature range place this model above other food thermometer we reviewed, it is ultimately an average model. The very best meat thermometers we tested outperformed it. It comes equipped with many of the same standard features as other meat thermometers, and its fold-out construction and two-year warranty speak to the fact that it has been designed for longevity. If you’d prefer a more moderately priced meat thermometer, take a look at the <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">ThermoWorks Thermopop TX-3100</a>.","The CDN ProAccurate Folding Thermocouple TCT572 is designed for mobility and durability, and it performed well in our tests – achieving an initial response time of three seconds, and a final readout in eight seconds. Still, it is not the fastest thermometer we tested, and we found it to be functional but average, which was disappointing given its high price tag."]},"id":"d47d296a-8392-454a-bb53-1a17484d3898","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58139","url":"/cdn-proaccurate-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T19:55:18Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T19:55:18Z","name":"CDN ProAccurate TCT572 Folding Thermocouple","synopsis":"The CDN ProAccurate Folding Thermocouple TCT572, with its fold-out probe, is quite portable and also houses a temperature gauge capable of reading a wide range of temperatures in a matter of mere seconds.","review":{"rating":90,"verdict":"Although this meat thermometer obtains a final readout faster than other devices, there&#039;s little else here to give it value over less expensive models.","pros":["It reads a wide range of temperatures, from between -58 to 592 degrees Fahrenheit."],"cons":["The individual buttons beep loudly every time they&#8217;re pushed."]},"strapline":"The CDN ProAccurate Folding Thermocouple TCT572, with its fold-out probe, is quite portable and also houses a temperature gauge capable of reading a wide range of temperatures in a matter of mere seconds.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-14T00:00:00Z","id":"niiSFmr6xo8kw5T3qtw6Nh","meta":{"title":"CDN ProAccurate DTQ450X Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Although this meat thermometer obtains a final readout faster than other devices, there&#039;s little else here to give it value over less expensive models."},"products":[{"slug":"cdn-proaccurate-tct572-folding-thermocouple","url":"/product/cdn-proaccurate-tct572-folding-thermocouple","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:46Z","name":"CDN ProAccurate TCT572 Folding Thermocouple","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:46Z","id":"zxPoQdbHgNhSpBBEWn57TM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:30:46Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HvrRmzMuEq7Zwey5HqMAmR.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:46Z","mimeType":"","name":"f401e29b5f97ebd996de7aa41bf90313.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f401e29b5f97ebd996de7aa41bf90313.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:46Z","id":"HvrRmzMuEq7Zwey5HqMAmR","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HvrRmzMuEq7Zwey5HqMAmR.jpg","alt":""},"title":"CDN ProAccurate DTQ450X Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Although this meat thermometer obtains a final readout faster than other devices, there&#039;s little else here to give it value over less expensive models."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HvrRmzMuEq7Zwey5HqMAmR.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:46Z","mimeType":"","name":"f401e29b5f97ebd996de7aa41bf90313.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f401e29b5f97ebd996de7aa41bf90313.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:46Z","id":"HvrRmzMuEq7Zwey5HqMAmR","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HvrRmzMuEq7Zwey5HqMAmR.jpg","alt":""},"title":"CDN ProAccurate DTQ450X Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Although this meat thermometer obtains a final readout faster than other devices, there&#039;s little else here to give it value over less expensive models."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/cdn-proaccurate-review","label":"","tags":[]}
