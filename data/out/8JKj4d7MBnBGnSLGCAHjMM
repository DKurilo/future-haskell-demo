The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-donut-makers\">Donut Makers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","If donut holes are more your thing than full-size donuts, there are donut makers for that, too. The Nostalgia JFD100 donut maker can make seven donut holes at once, and it just takes five minutes.","You get nonstick cooking plates on this unit, which adds some convenience both during and after use. During use, the nonstick plates come in handy when the donut holes are done cooking – they slide out of the plate without a problem. And after use, when you go to clean the plates, the nonstick plates make cleanup easy and quick.","This electric donut maker has two indicator lights on top of the unit. One light indicates that the unit is on and the other indicates that it is preheating.","This unit comes with a couple accessories – a decorating tool and an injection tool. You can use these tools to finalize the donut holes after they are cooked. These are perfect for allowing kids to help out in the decorating process.","The Nostalgia donut hole maker is small, measuring just 8 inches long, 10 inches wide and 4.25 inches high. It weighs just 3.6 pounds. Its small size makes it easy to store away in a cupboard or even just on the countertop.","This donut hole maker has a few different features that add convenience and safety. First, it has storage on the bottom of the unit for the power cord when it&#39;s not in use. This not only nicely keeps the cord out of the way when the donut maker&#39;s not in use, but it also adds a safety feature – the cord isn&#39;t hanging around when you&#39;re not using the unit.","Second, this unit has an easy-to-use latch on the lid. This makes it easy to open when it&#39;s in use and hot. The latch clicks shut when the lid&#39;s closed, which secures it while the device cooking or not in use. This donut-making equipment has 1,300 watts of power, which is more powerful than many electric donut makers.","The Nostalgia donut hole maker is great for a family or as a gift. You can easily and quickly make up some donut holes right from your own kitchen. Its power cord storage and easy-open latch add welcome convenience."]},"id":"2809165f-3cb8-4a13-8c4f-de8c4b0cbaba","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60867","url":"/nostalgia-electronics-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-20T15:57:20Z","datePublished":"2014-10-20T15:57:20Z","name":"Nostalgia Electronics JFD100","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
