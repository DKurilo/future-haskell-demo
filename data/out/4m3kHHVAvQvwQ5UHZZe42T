These were some of the best results, which means that your food isn&#39;t likely to get dried out during cooking.","When on the high setting for 4 hours, we measured the internal and external temperature of the device. The boiling inner liquids reached 195 degrees Fahrenheit, which will help your food reach its doneness level relatively quickly for a slow cooker. For the exterior, we measured both the front of the device just above the digital display as well as the sides of the unit just below the handles. Above the timer, the device measured 100 degrees while the sides measured 95 degrees. This was much cooler than any other device in our comparison, which means this device&#39;s surface is much less likely to burn you or any little hands in your kitchen.","You will find 10 recipes in the accompanying slow cooker instruction manual to help inspire you and get you cooking. Should you lose your manual, you can find it on Crock-Pot&#39;s website.","This unit did not come with any additional accessories like a temperature probe or meat rack.","We weighed this device at 11.9 pounds when there was nothing inside the ceramic bowl, which makes it neither the heaviest nor the lightest of the six-quart slow cookers we tested. We also measured the length of the cord as 25.25 inches, which is two and a half inches shorter than the longest cord we measured but should give you plenty of space to reach your outlets."]},"id":"30bd8f99-c93e-4a82-9711-7200510fafc2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/UCsP7qMwSjQ8XbhfQzeUJ7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/reviews/69905/crock-pot-sccpv-2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UCsP7qMwSjQ8XbhfQzeUJ7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"UCsP7qMwSjQ8XbhfQzeUJ7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UCsP7qMwSjQ8XbhfQzeUJ7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1239da23-e3f9-48ff-b5f0-d7398da926cc","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can set the timer on this six-quart pot anywhere from 30 minutes to 20 hours in 30-minute increments.

In comparison, most manual setting slow cookers do not offer an automatic warm feature and require you to turn to the warming setting yourself.","The side handles were just a little warm during cooking but plenty cool enough for you to lift and move.
