This <a href=\"/best-encryption-software\">Mac encryption software</a> is a front-end program that manages and hides the sensitive files you want to protect. You can choose to encrypt your information with AES 256-bit or 128-bit. AES 256 is the highest grade of encryption you can apply to your files and is virtually unbreakable. Though the security is tight, Protect Files lacks some other features that would make it even more convenient and secure to encrypt files on your Mac.","This is one of the fastest file encryption programs for Mac we encountered. It took just over four seconds to encrypt the test file, earning it a perfect score for speed. Additionally, there is no wait time to access and decrypt a file.","The software earned a 72 percent score for file compression. We began with a 134.5MB file, which grew to 333.6MB after encryption. This is common with the protective padding that comes with AES encryption. You can expect slight changes in file sizes with encryption software that uses the AES algorithm, but not a change this large. The best encryption software for Mac keeps file sizes small or relatively close to the original size after encrypting the files.","This is an encryption-only program, with no extra features to protect your passwords, manage your history or organize your files. Its main function is to hide files from your desktop. With a quick toggle, you can make files on your computer appear visible or invisible.","The lack of extra features doesn&#39;t make Protect Files a bad program. This keeps the interface simple, so you can hide your files quickly and effectively. Protect Files is easy enough to use to earn an 80 percent score in our evaluation.","Protect Files lacks extra features like password enhancement and file shredding but still uses passwords to protect the database and individual disks in the database. Be sure to choose a memorable master password for your encrypted files, because Protect Files lacks any password recovery features. This is good news for protecting your information, but bad news if you ever forget the master password.","Protect Files works for Mac OS X 10.7 and up. For technical support, you can find the user manual on the developer&#39;s website. The only way to contact support directly is through a ticket system on the company&#39;s website. However, there are extensive notes on the program and its many functions on the site."]},"id":"d7115597-f6b7-4b12-8211-b4789cb2450b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91178faf-37af-45be-b70f-060307cd36ea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Protect Files adds to the encryption capabilities already on your Mac.
