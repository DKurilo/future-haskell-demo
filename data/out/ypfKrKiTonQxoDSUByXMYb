Although the Bold is a little heavier than the Tour, the only distinct difference is the optical trackpad found on the 9650. This new trackpad is a great improvement over the navigation balls on many BlackBerries and it allows you to easily view and select menus with a simple click."]},"id":"d975f2c1-0aea-4035-a502-7c056a9570a5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"23b88f0d-a451-4365-9352-fc652ab0e517","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The multimedia features aren’t anything to jump for joy about but at least they&#39;re there. A 3.2MP (Mega-pixel) camera and camcorder is found in the 9650 and a BlackBerry Media Sync easily syncs photos as well as iTunes and Windows Media Player to offer users some type of music experience.","Social Networking might not be at the top of your must-have list if you&#39;re looking for a BlackBerry, but the 9650 still allows for a little time to catch up on the latest gossip. BlackBerry works with several social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Flickr, along with several Sprint services such as Sprint Navigation, Sprint Football Live and the Spring Music Store to keep you in the latest loop. Along with social networking comes instant messaging on apps such as Windows Live Messenger, Google Talk, Yahoo! Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger.","Email still remains the selling point of BlackBerries and the 9650 provides access to up to ten personal/business POP3/IMAP4 email accounts. BlackBerry Push Technology also allows email and data to be automatically sent to your BlackBerry and a handset can sync with your company’s BlackBerry Enterprise server to deliver corporate email quickly. And if an important document comes through email, a built-in attachment viewer allows for reading and editing of Microsoft Office, Corel WordPerfect, PDF, JPEG, GIF and other files."]},"id":"578e4c59-b890-4f20-94bf-3c3156a5db4e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Camera"},"id":"41d31e4a-1432-4013-a465-a19a0bc272cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["BlackBerries are not phones intended to be used sparingly throughout the day.
