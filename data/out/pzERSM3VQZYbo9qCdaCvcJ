Whether you&#39;re dealing with a virus or some kind of hardware malfunction, there is nothing more frustrating than losing your important files and images. If nothing else, this computer crash taught you to back up your files often. But right now, you need hard drive restoration.","The most obvious solution for finding lost files is <a href=\"/money/small-business\">data recovery software</a>. You should look for software that can recover deleted or corrupted files. This type of software isn&#39;t necessarily comprehensive, so make sure the software you choose can handle your particular problem.","Usually, laptop hard drives will not work without the original hardware, so if your motherboard malfunctions, you might think that you lost access to all of your files. More distressing is a situation where the hard drive itself malfunctions. Fortunately, PC services can transfer the files over to an external hard drive for around so you can recover your files.","However, if your hard drive malfunctions, you&#39;re looking at some expensive solutions. Hard drive restoration is difficult, and professional restoration services use environmentally controlled laboratories. Fortunately, you don&#39;t always need to hire one of these services. If a virus corrupts the files, data recovery software or PC specialists can help you delete the malicious software and restore your important files.","If the hard drive is broken, you&#39;ll have to work with a hard drive restoration lab, and this is a costly endeavor that doesn&#39;t always work. You have to mail or hand deliver your computer to a lab for an initial check. The lab then analyzes the hard drive to see if the data is recoverable. If the lab can pull the information, you will be stuck with a hefty bill before you receive any of your data.","Hard drive restoration is expensive and unnerving, as you now know. I hope you can recover your important files by one of the methods I mentioned. This experience will certainly motivate you to back up your files by using reliable data backup software in the future."]},"id":"8280a7f9-ad1c-4f99-bb2f-f0e39719906f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8391","url":"/my-laptop-crashed-can-i-recover-the-files","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ben-davis","url":"/author/ben-davis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ben Davis","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"L52JmDizAnNgRQPUr9kch6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-21T19:08:08Z","datePublished":"2014-03-21T19:08:08Z","name":"My Laptop Crashed!
