Much of your home, and many things in your life, can now be powered with the use of solar technology, including how you cook your meals. Regardless of whether you&#39;re cooking in the outdoors or just in your backyard, solar ovens can be a great way to cook food.","Solar ovens cook with just the use of the sun, and you can even use them on cloudy days. Many solar ovens can reach the same temperatures as standard electric or gas ovens can. You can bake, boil, grill and even steam food with these ovens, which include the <a href=\"#GoSun\">GoSun Sport</a>, the <a href=\"#One_Earth\">SolSource Solar Grill</a> and the <a href=\"#Sun_Chef\">Sun Chef Cooker</a>.","There are many benefits to cooking with a solar-powered oven. No electricity or fuel is required, so you can move around and store these cookers without trouble. You can also use one in an emergency preparedness situation, and they are very safe because they pose no fire danger, unlike <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-camping-and-backpacking-stoves\">camping stoves</a> and other outdoor grills.","<strong>Solar Ovens: What to Look For</strong>","Because there are many different kinds of solar ovens, there are a few things to consider before you determine which one is right for you and your situation. You should consider the oven&#39;s cooking ability, features, size and warranty to ensure you choose the right unit.","<strong>Cooking Ability</strong><br/>For the most part, the cooking ability of a solar oven is similar to that of conventional electric and gas ovens. Many solar ovens can reach the same temperatures that conventional ovens can, and the cooking time is similar too. With many solar ovens, you won&#39;t be limited as to the type of food you can cook. Many solar ovens can bake, boil, grill and fry food just like any conventional oven, which will let you make full meals, desserts, bread and much more.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>The features on each solar cooker vary, but each one has the standard features. These include solar reflectors and a cooking surface or area. Features that you find on some solar ovens include a built-in thermometer, included pans and other cooking dishes and utensils, and a carrying handle and collapsible reflectors on ovens that are portable.","<strong>Size</strong><br/>The size of the oven is important to note when you&#39;re deciding how you will use the oven. If you&#39;re simply looking for a solar oven for emergency preparedness, a smaller oven that you can store in your emergency preparedness stock is likely the way to go. If you&#39;re looking for a solar cooker that you can use regularly, whether at home or outdoors, any size is sufficient.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>The warranty length varies by solar oven, but each oven should come with a standard one-year warranty from the manufacturer at minimum. Many manufacturers offer additional warranties on certain parts of the oven and a 30-day money-back guarantee if you&#39;re not satisfied with the product.","Solar ovens are a great way to cook meals, whether you&#39;re in the outdoors, an emergency preparedness situation or the comfort of your own backyard. These ovens don&#39;t require fuel or electricity, so they are portable and a great way to be green.","<strong>All Season Review</strong>"]},"id":"1b89b8da-d26b-4139-988e-725c4d233c20","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/pN2GuzibNs8SfVWZ7HNZg4.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The All Season Solar Cooker is one of the most unique solar ovens out there because of its ability to utilize solar technology from sunup to sundown.
