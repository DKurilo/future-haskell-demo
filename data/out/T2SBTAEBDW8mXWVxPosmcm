In graduate school and in market research, however, you need more than a few friends to fill out your questionnaires. But sometimes it&#39;s difficult to find respondents. Fortunately, if you follow these five helpful tips, you&#39;ll start to get better survey results in no time.","For any of these tips to work, you need to understand two truths. First, you don&#39;t have to handcraft every survey. <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Survey software</a> can help you build and distribute your surveys, and once you&#39;re ready to collect the results, it will organize and present the information in a way that will make your reports professional and easy to read.","Second, you must know your audience. You will get better results and a better response rate if you present your survey to people who have opinions about your subject. In other words, someone who lives on the rural plains will not be interested in a survey about small apartments. Once you understand these two things, these next five tips will help you get better survey results than you&#39;ve ever had."]},"id":"fdd96161-d6ff-42b3-82dc-f0ebe3d1177d","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Short, Personal Invitations</strong>","Your audience deserves your respect. Don&#39;t waste their time with spam invites or long explanations of what you&#39;re doing. When you send your survey invites, keep them short and sweet. Your respondents may have questions about your survey&#39;s privacy policy or about the results, and unless you include your contact information, they will have no way of knowing if the invite even came from a person. Also, you should be able to explain the invitation and the survey deadline in fewer than 500 words.","<strong>Explain Your Goals</strong>","Many people will take a survey just to express their opinions. However, people don&#39;t like to waste their time, so make sure that your respondents understand what you are trying to accomplish. Are you working on a thesis project? Are you trying to improve your company&#39;s products and services? If your audience understands your goals, they are more likely to help you with your survey research.","<strong>Offer Incentives</strong>","The cheapest survey incentive is an outlet for your audience&#39;s opinions, but sometimes that&#39;s not enough. If you have a research grant, try offering a gift certificate to people who complete your surveys. If you are gathering research for a business, it is especially important to incentivize your survey. When you ask people to fill out your survey, you&#39;ve already told them that their opinions are valuable. If you attach an incentive to your survey, you will indicate exactly how valuable those opinions are.","<strong>Send Reminders</strong>","Sometimes, people get busy. If a few people haven&#39;t taken your survey, don&#39;t take it personally. Send them one or two reminders as you approach your deadline. It&#39;s possible that your email got lost in the shuffle of everyday life, and a simple reminder will get them to take your survey. Like the first tip, make sure that your reminder is both short and personal.","<strong>Publish Your Results</strong>","People like to see how their opinions fit with other respondents&#39; thoughts. If you are able to, make sure to publish the raw data immediately after the survey closes. Also, email your respondents with a link to the results. This email should include one last thank you, and it will go a long way toward getting your respondents to participate in future survey research.","If you follow these simple tips, you&#39;ll get much better survey results."]},"id":"18c0e4fe-42f1-40c2-a029-9dc26f00ce0b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8007","url":"/how-to-get-more-people-to-take-your-survey","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ben-davis","url":"/author/ben-davis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ben Davis","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"L52JmDizAnNgRQPUr9kch6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-02T13:16:32Z","datePublished":"2013-08-02T13:16:32Z","name":"How to Get More People to Take Your Survey","synopsis":"When you're an undergraduate in a research-methods class, it is commendable to get a dozen classmates to take your survey.","review":{},"strapline":"When you're an undergraduate in a research-methods class, it is commendable to get a dozen classmates to take your survey.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-11T22:44:01Z","id":"T2SBTAEBDW8mXWVxPosmcm","meta":{"title":"How to Get More People to Take Your Survey","description":"Survey research can help you get excellent information from real people.
