The 24-hour timer lets you schedule when the cooler turns on and off, so you don&#39;t have this AC window unit running when it&#39;s not needed – a great plus when you&#39;re away at work during the day.","If you&#39;re concerned about saving money, this window mounted air conditioner is a great choice because it features an energy saver mode that turns the AC unit off when the ideal temperature is reached.","It comes with a digital thermostat that can detect the temperature of the room and includes a remote control for your convenience. These features allow you to adjust the temperature without having to get up from your location and are especially useful if you plan to use the ac unit for your bedroom. The Sleep mode gradually increases the temperature to ensure that you get a comfortable rest.","At 56 decibels on the highest setting, this AC unit’s noise level is also relatively quiet, which makes it work well for an office space. To put this in perspective, an ordinary conversation is about 60 decibels.","This AC window unit comes with a loss of power protection with auto-restart, so even if your power goes out, this AC will come back on with its setting intact – including any timers you’ve set.","With a washable and reusable filter, you&#39;ll always know that the air inside your room is clean. The air conditioner also has a light that comes on to notify you when it&#39;s time for the filter to be cleaned.","There&#39;s no reason to suffer through the summer. With the energy efficient Soleus Air SG-WAC-06ESE-C, you can keep your bedroom or office cool all season without breaking your budget."]},"id":"420acb9b-d718-486c-b473-79dec85006da","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57234","url":"/soleus-air-sg-wac-06ese-c-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-08T19:37:07Z","datePublished":"2013-08-08T19:37:07Z","name":"Soleus Air SG-WAC-06ESE-C","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
