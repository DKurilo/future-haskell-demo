Among these products is the Oplink Connected line of DIY home security systems. The security system is attractive and uncomplicated. Oplink Connected also provides subscription-based DIY alarm monitoring services that can help you defend your home and family from various environmental and security emergencies. Oplink&#39;s customer support services are very competent.","Oplink Connected is a recent product line with security cameras, motion sensors, door and window sensors, sirens, key fobs, and panic buttons available for purchase. This means that the company doesn&#39;t quite have every type of security device that you normally see in DIY home monitoring systems. You won&#39;t find garage door sensors, glass-break sensors, recessed door sensors or pet-immune motion sensors in the Oplink Connected security system. These devices can add an extra layer of security to your home.","The company sells several types of starter kits, each emphasizing different priorities such as security, fire, elderly care and video. The best thing about the Oplink Connected starter kits is that because you can find them at a number of online retailers, you don&#39;t have to buy them directly from Oplink. Each system is fully customizable, though you might pay more to add more equipment to your DIY alarm-monitoring plan.","A few alerts help Oplink Connected keep an eye on your home and connect you with first responders if necessary. These alerts track intruders at your door, smoke and fire, unsafe levels of carbon monoxide, flooding, and freezing temperatures that can damage the plumbing in your home. Oplink also offers an alert for personal safety or medical emergencies. Oplink does not offer alerts for power failure or natural gas leaks.","Oplink allows you to self-monitor your DIY home monitoring system at no cost. Self-monitoring comes with alarm status reports, live video feeds and full automation control using a smartphone or web browser. You typically pay extra to access these features with other DIY home security companies. If you decide to pay for Oplink&#39;s DIY alarm monitoring service, you also get 24-hour professional monitoring and push notifications. To add cellular monitoring capability to your system, you must buy a 3G USB modem and pay an extra fee.","If you have a technical issue with your system, you can contact Oplink via phone, email and live chat. This is especially helpful during the DIY installation process. For additional help, you can also access in-depth tutorials and FAQs on Oplink&#39;s support website. Oplink Connected equipment carries one-year warranty."]},"id":"43660fd8-4e2b-4699-a488-365352be2294","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b0e4b54b-e218-43d1-8ea3-49dd7b50097c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Oplink&#39;s equipment is attractive and functions well.
