For example, at 19.5 inches, its screen is smaller than that of any other monitor in our comparison, and its resolution is only 1600 x 900 compared to the 1920 x 1080 high-definition displays of the other models we tested. This lower resolution makes some sense because of its screen size, but it also makes the monitor stand out from the crowd, and not in a good way.","We decided to include the ASUS VT207N in our comparison because it uses the same touch technology as the other monitors we reviewed and it’s made by a popular brand.","The VT207N looks like a standard, commonplace display. It doesn’t have edge-to-edge glass like the <a href=\"/acer-t232hl-review\">Acer T232HL</a> or some of the other best touchscreen monitors, and it has a wide rounded edge instead of the ultra-thin bezels most multi-touch displays feature. The monitor has a black frame under the glass, which is typical for large tablet-like touchscreens, but it is so thin that you’re likely to bump the bezel as you use the touch features. This ASUS model does have a glassy, smooth surface, which is desirable because its more comfortable to use than a matte screen.","It has a tilt range of only 30 degrees, the smallest range in our comparison. This includes five degrees of forward tilt, which, while helpful in reducing glare, doesn’t make the monitor comfortable to work on for long periods of time. In addition, the bezel edge isn’t flush with the display, so it’s a little hard to find a place to rest your hands. For these reasons, this monitor isn’t a good choice for composing documents or using other common office programs.","The on-screen display controls are raised push buttons on the bottom right of the monitor. Because of their location, they are easy to bump while you work, which can disrupt your workflow – it would be better if ASUS moved them away from the screen.","This monitor doesn’t feature any of the latest ports; it doesn’t have an HDMI or DisplayPort connection, and there is only one upstream USB port that must be connected to enable the touch functionality. The ASUS VT207N doesn’t have a headphone jack or onboard speakers."]},"id":"f2e8441e-6709-4721-8d64-079e07f660fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c4f1a9ef-5c58-4095-a466-79552c0c00d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ASUS VT207N has the same touchscreen technology as many of the other monitors we reviewed, but it’s not the best option out there for most consumers.

It’s priced more competitively with standard displays, and if you don’t mind a smaller screen size, the VT207N is a perfectly good monitor – it’s just not the best touchscreen."]},"id":"0cd97c73-eb09-4506-b03a-4435c201937b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69497","url":"/asus-vt207n-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-06-30T19:40:24Z","datePublished":"2017-06-30T19:40:24Z","name":"ASUS VT207N","synopsis":"The ASUS VT207N is different from the other touchscreen monitors we reviewed.","review":{"rating":45,"verdict":"If you&#8217;re looking for an inexpensive, 10-point multi-touch monitor but don&#8217;t need a high-definition display and don&#8217;t plan to use it for long stretches, the ASUS VT207N is a solid option.","pros":["This monitor has a glassy surface, which is smooth to the touch and more comfortable to use than a matte screen."],"cons":["It has the smallest tilt range and screen size of the monitors we reviewed.
