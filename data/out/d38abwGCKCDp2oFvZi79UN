As Gibson stands in a corn field, trying to track down an intruder, he pauses, listening to the night. The rustling of the corn in the wind is suddenly interrupted by a very subtle, but unnerving clicking noise coming from behind. This juxtaposition between silence and sound is repeated throughout the film. Then there is also the scene in the basement where the lights are turned out and all you have is the sounds coming from your home theater speakers. M.
