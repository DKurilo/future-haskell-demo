Snow car tires are designed for severe winter weather and provides an unparalleled level of grip on slick surfaces. If you live in an area that receives only mild winters, its benefits may not be fully appreciated or make as much of a difference.","The reason behind the quality is the design of the tread. It utilizes winter grip technology, manifested through a combination of four key features. The first is an increased number of tread blocks, designed to provide even more biting edges to safely maneuver on snowy surfaces. The second feature is the inclusion of micropumps, which absorb water from the surface and evacuate it via a centrifugal force, creating increased tread contact.","The third impressive feature is this tire&#39;s Cross Z Sipes, designed in a tridimensional pattern to increase the rigidity of the tire and increase the stability of its handling. The final feature is the Flex-Ice compound, a full-silica material that helps the tire retain its flexibility at lower temperatures for improved performance and firmness at moderate temperatures to reduce wear.","Because it is designed for winter weather rather than as a general tire, you won’t use for the majority of the year. This tire will last several years, though not as many miles as an all-season tire. The Michelin X-Ice Xi3 comes with a 40,000 mile warranty, which means you’ll be able to use it for multiple winter seasons.","When it comes to surviving the winter, tire stores will generally recommend purchasing snow tires. The Michelin X-Ice Xi3 is for the commuter that lives in severe weather regions, so if you only receive mild snowfall you’ll want to consider a mild snow tire instead. However, if you receive regular snow and continuously traverse ice, this tire will get you home safely each night."]},"id":"950a43de-7f02-48e4-9d95-9b7445779dc9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58028","url":"/michelin-x-ice-xi3-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T15:03:03Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T15:03:03Z","name":"Michelin X-Ice Xi3","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
