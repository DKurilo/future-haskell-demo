The DiskGO Secure comes with security software already included on the flash drive. As the name would imply, the Edge DiskGO Secure is designed for quick transfer and transportation of data files and is ideal for fast-paced lifestyles. This USB flash drive delivers fast speeds and is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems. However, the security software will not work with Mac systems.","File transfer speeds depend on the storage capacity of the USB drive, with the larger capacities working at faster rates. Edge&#39;s tests for the average 16GB drive found that it can read up to 170MB per second and write at a maximum speed of 20MB/s when connected to a USB 3.0 port. These are competitive speeds among pen drives of similar capacity and price range. You should note that like all 3.0 drives, this model will still works with less advanced ports, but at slower transfer speeds.","While the basic DiskGO is available in 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB storage capacities, the Secure model only has the 8GB-32GB options available. The flash drive weighs only 0.2 ounces and has a capless design, which are both ideal features for using the drive on the go. The only easy-transport feature it lacks is a place to connect the drive to a lanyard or keychain.","Where the DiskGO Secure shines is in the area of data security. Included on the memory drive is CryptArchiver software, which offers either 256-bit military grade or 448-bit Blowfish encryption. The software also gives you the ability to password protect your data for added security. Mac users should beware, however, that this software is compatible only with Windows operating systems.","The DiskGO is missing some convenient features, such as online backup or data recovery, and it doesn&#39;t have a light to indicate when a read or write is in progress.","This USB stick comes with a limited lifetime warranty, and you can contact Edge for technical support via email or a toll-free telephone number. You can also visit the company&#39;s website for community support forums, FAQs and other product information."]},"id":"3c5117ed-18cf-4e14-a1a5-e68b39b03ea5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a623628d-8893-4f5c-8250-a779bbb1a483","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Edge DiskGO Secure 3.0 gives you speedy data transfers in a no-nonsense USB flash drive, and the included security software offers encryption and password capabilities, so you wonâ€™t have to sacrifice the security of your files."]},"id":"c79f140c-4b96-49f6-acaf-1a8b75d4789f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2381","url":"/edge-diskgo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-brown","url":"/author/ryan-brown","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ryan Brown","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"HR3J5H9LhLCfWmFnumxwPW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-05-14T23:22:42Z","name":"Edge DiskGO Secure 3.0","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
