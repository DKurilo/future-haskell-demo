Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The TomTom ONE 130 is an entry level <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> unit. Its relatively low price is its strongest selling point and indeed it does pack quite a lot of punch for the money. Many of the features of higher priced navigation GPS devices may be nice to have but are not important for a GPS unit, but we do consider some of the features that are left off the ONE 130 to be important.","The most important feature that is missing is text-to-speech capabilities. That is the feature that allows the navigation GPS device to give you audible directions that include the name of the street that you’ll be turning on. Without text-to-speech, the device can merely say, for example, “Turn right in 30 yards” rather than telling you what street to turn on. The drawback is that it tends to draw attention to the written map on the GPS device, drawing your eyes away from the road. This situation is aggravated by the ONE 130’s speaker, which has a reputation for inadequate volume.","Additionally, this unit’s screen is smaller than most contemporary models measuring just 3.5 inches diagonally compared to 4.3-inches which has become the standard. The difference may not seem like much but it matters when you’re trying to find information with just a quick glance. This device also lacks voice recognition and IQ Routes that we found on pricier TomTom models. We think for most users it will be worth the extra investment to get a unit that will search for you based on the sound of your voice. Taking time to type in every landmark you are looking for will be annoying, especially if your journey is already well under way. And you don&#39;t have to pay much more to get a unit with IQ Routes, which help you avoid traffic by routing you away from known traffic spots based on the time of day, pedestrian traffic, day of the week and other factors.","Characteristic of TomTom devices, the ONE 130 has a very responsive touchscreen that makes data entry easy. It can receive real time traffic data but only if you opt to purchase the accessory receiver.","Besides its attractive price, portability is a major plus for this navigation GPS device. The EasyPort mounting bracket folds neatly into the slim unit for stowing, though it takes just a bit of practice to get accustomed to mounting and dismounting it on the windshield."]},"id":"8ed816f0-0a26-4494-be89-95a767deeeec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f3570012-1838-4b0a-9cdf-53ea84a9d2ea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This navigation GPS unit does all of the basic tasks well and includes access to TomTom&#39;s world class maps, but for just a bit more money you can get many more bells and whistles. For most navigation GPS users we think it will be worth the investment to have access to a larger screen, louder speaker, traffic-avoidance routes and voice recognition. All of these will lead to much less time with your eyes off the road and on the small screen. That makes for a safer driving environment for the user and those sharing the road. If you are just looking for a basic navigation GPS receiver, though, TomTom ONE 130 is worth your consideration."]},"id":"78d2d935-8a5c-4c94-b6c5-fd9e03649e23","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_44957","url":"/tomtom-one-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-03-23T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-03-23T06:00:00Z","name":"TomTom ONE 130 ONE 130","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":54,"verdict":"It may be worth the higher price to get features like voice recognition, traffic avoidance routes and better speaker volume, all of which are lacking on this unit.
