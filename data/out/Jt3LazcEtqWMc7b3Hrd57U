Small in size but big in features, this contemporary emergency radio boasts a large solar panel, quick recharging time and access to all seven NOAA weather band stations.","For 90 seconds of cranking you get up to 40 minutes of playtime. Like most crank radios, the actual time is dependant up on the volume you run the radio at. The size of the crank matches the size of the radio itself, which seems big, but it tucks away nicely and still allows for a smooth turn with either hand.","With the FR160, you get a large solar panel that can give you a solid charge in less time than other crank radios that have a solar panel. There is also a headphone jack as well as a USB port to charge your cell phones. This seems to be a pretty standard feature on most crank radios, and with 10-15 minutes of cranking, you will get about one minute of talk time on your phone. This may seem small, but if you are in an emergency, this will work just fine. The three LED lights are very bright and don&#39;t suck the battery power as quickly as the radio does.","The FR160 crank radio can also access all seven NOAA weather stations. You will be able to listen to shortwave weather stations, as well. The antenna is very powerful and long enough that you can get most any frequency.","This crank radio is very durable and comes with port protectors for all the ports. It is splash proof, not waterproof; light rain isn&#39;t going to hurt this device. I It is also built with a rubberized exterior, which makes gripping easier and protects it from bumps along the way.","As with all Eton products, you can get a specifications and a user manual for the FR160 online. Between these resources and the Eton website, you can get any information on the device you need. Contacting Eton is quick and easy to do through an email or a toll-free number. Any questions we had when testing this product, Eton answered promptly."]},"id":"c6747912-96c7-490b-82eb-fb5846a5cc98","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2bcfd12e-775e-4e48-8d31-14ab7921991e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There may be other crank radios out there with more features but if you are looking for a crank radio that is simple and will get the job done, the Microlink FR160 from Eton deserves your attention.
