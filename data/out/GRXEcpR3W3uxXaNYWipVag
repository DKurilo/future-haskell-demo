Homeleader K18-010 is a <a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\">meat grinder</a> equipped with an above-average motor in terms of power and performance. It can handle large quantities of meat, though only in short increments due to the motor’s proclivity toward overheating. It makes up for this shortcoming somewhat by including multiple cutting blades as well as a vegetable shredder.","This home meat grinder is rated for up to 800 watts of performance at more than 1 horsepower of grinding output. This enables it to grind an average of 3 pounds of meat per minute, though it&#39;s been reported to grind through double that on certain types of meat. Between uses, you can easily disassemble this unit and rinse it for sanitizing each of the removable parts. Though the unit has a powerful motor, it&#39;s prone to overheating. Many users recommend using the device in 10-minute increments and then allowing the device to cool down for several minutes. In the event of overheating, jams become more frequent and the motor’s plastic parts can become more prone to accelerated wear. If you want greater grinding performance, check out the <a href=\"/choice-products-review\">Best Choice Products Meat Grinder</a>.","This electric meat grinder comes with three separate cutting plates and blades, which means you can achieve varying types of grinds, while also having sufficient blades to evenly wear them over the course of many months. Most grinders only come with a single blade, which means you’ll experience diminishing levels of performance over time even as you regularly sharpen the blade. With three blades, you can prolong this process without having to begin purchasing replacement blades.","In addition to the numerous cutting accessories, this stainless steel meat grinder also comes with a kibbe attachment as well as a sausage funnel. If you want to use this grinder for adding vegetables to your grinds, you can make use of the vegetable shredder attachment, giving you the ability to control the fat, spices and ingredients for all aspects of your meat blends. Each of these items, along with the grinder itself, are protected with a full one-year warranty on all parts and labor associated with repairs."]},"id":"1fb3ec5b-4430-4e75-b93e-81a43c318d7b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f65f5a35-8926-46f4-b5da-50f954b8b52d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Homeleader K18-010 is an exceptional value for its price point, offering a powerful motor that can process a wide range of meats and vegetables.

If you’re a casual grinder, you’ll quickly find use in this powerful unit. However, if you’re a hunter who needs to grind an entire deer or elk, you’ll need something more heavy duty."]},"id":"5508abec-2e39-452d-9996-bf9ca262c6f5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66391","url":"/homeleader-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-30T22:32:57Z","datePublished":"2015-07-30T22:32:57Z","name":"Homeleader K18-010","synopsis":"The Homeleader K18-010 is a meat grinder equipped with an above-average motor in terms of power and performance.
