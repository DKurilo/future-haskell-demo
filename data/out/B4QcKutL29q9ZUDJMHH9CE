It had an easy set up, and the battery took two hours to fully charge. We highly recommend sealing the hatch with tape to prevent water from leaking into the hatch. Because of its size, the boat easily takes in water, especially if there are some waves. It was able power through choppy water caused by boats and jet skis at a mid-sized reservoir, but this boat would probably struggle in larger, rougher bodies of water, especially if it was windy.","We found the boat works best in backyard pools. At a nearby reservoir, it handled the water fine, albeit slower and not as well as other RC boats. Also, the Blackjack 9 had a longer run time in the pool than it did at the reservoir.","Typically, remote control boats are stronger at turning on one side than the other, but the Blackjack 9 actually handles both left and right turns with ease. The boat isn’t very fast though – only reaching speeds of about 10 mph, making it suited more toward kids and beginners.","The Pro Boat Blackjack 9 is ready to run out of the box. Included with this boat is a transmitter as well as batteries for it and the boat itself. You may want to purchase an additional battery since the run time is so short. The transmitter for the boat has a pistol-grip design similar to other remote control boats or cars, and it&#39;s easy to control and has a wireless range of 400 feet. A small stand is also included that you can use to showcase your boat when it&#39;s not in use.","Pro Boat offers a 30-day warranty. They also sell replacement parts that you can order online or by phone. If you need support or your boat malfunctions, you have several various ways to reach the manufacturer. You can do so by email, telephone, or post on the manufacturer&#39;s online forums and social media accounts. Online, you&#39;ll be able to find YouTube videos with action footage as well as a downloadable instruction manual."]},"id":"803a3b6d-4d95-4685-adc4-8adeffec89c5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4edbcd26-d687-45ab-b519-006b7c1f3b81","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pro Boat Blackjack 9 may fall short for some hardcore boaters, but if you are a beginner RC user or have children, the Blackjack 9 may just be the boat for you.
