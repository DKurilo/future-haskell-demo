This uses a suction cup mount to stick to your windshield or dash. During testing, the stand held up, but it feels flimsy. The monitor draws power from your vehicle’s DC outlet but, for a more permanent installation, it can be wired in. It powers on with your car and displays footage from the camera when your car is in reverse. <br />\n  <br />\nThe product we tested works with a digital wireless signal, but also has the same product number as a previous iteration that uses an analogue signal, which does not work well in Bluetooth-enabled vehicles.

You can adjust the camera angle up or down to fit your vehicle’s needs. You need to wire it into your reverse lights for power so it will come on automatically when you put your car into reverse. This may require drilling a small hole for the wires to go through into your trunk. The camera shows you a 110-degree shot of what’s directly behind your car. It automatically senses lighting conditions and switches to night vision when things get too dim – this narrows your field of view but still shows you the area directly behind your vehicle. <br />\n <br />\nAfter you shift into reverse, the camera and monitor come on, but you should wait a moment before moving, as it can take the display a moment to stabilize the image.

Its battery-powered camera mounts above your license plate and activates whenever you turn on the monitor.","The system is just those two parts: the camera and monitor. They connect automatically when both are powered via a digital wireless signal. Digital wireless signals work better than analogue signals over longer distances and without interference from other signals like Bluetooth. Unlike most of the other models we tested, the QuickVu camera doesn’t wire into your vehicle’s rear lights for power. Instead, the camera uses AA batteries, which you have to swap out periodically – about once a month according to the user manual. It’s a little more high-maintenance than other systems that draw power from your car, but that’s the trade-off for the easier installation. The rear camera houses the wireless transmitter and batteries as well, so it is a little bulky, though it won’t obstruct your license plate. The camera angle isn’t adjustable – as the housing is all one solid piece – so we advise testing out camera placement to make sure it adequately covers the area behind your car. The camera has a light sensor and seven LEDs that light up when it’s dark, so you can back it up at night as well as during the day.<br />\n <br />\nThe monitor features a 4.3-inch LCD display that plugs into your cigarette lighter. The standard mount that comes with the set uses adhesive to stick to your dash, though other mounts are available. We tried out a suction-cup style mount, and it worked well. The camera activates whenever you turn on the monitor – so it works as soon as you start your car for a set amount of time, or you can manually turn it on or off using one of the three buttons on the back of the monitor. We liked this option, as you don’t start reversing as soon as you start your car – and it allows you to check your rear blind spot whether or not your car is in reverse.

For our assessment, we specifically looked at rear-view cameras with included monitors.","In addition to extensive online shopping and research, we physically test each system to find out things you can only learn by hands-on experience, such as which monitor mounts actually stay where they’re supposed to or whether the camera’s night vision mode severely restricts your field of view.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent over 40 hours getting to know these backup cameras, studying their specs and features and testing them in our lab. We picked out 10 of the best and most popular backup camera and monitor sets in the market, got our hands on them, and tested them to find their strengths. We further narrowed down our selection to the top eight when two products didn’t stand up to our evaluations.","We tested the functionality of each product by powering them up in our lab. We used a few types of DC converters to power up each camera and monitor set, went through each system’s setup process and examined their performances in both bright and dark lighting conditions. We quantified our hands-on testing by assigning each product grades based on ease of installation, ease-of-use and tested performance.","These grades include product details, such as form factor, desirable features and price. We calculated scores and finally formed our ranked list of the top eight backup cameras. From our ranked list, we recommended top-performing products and products that particularly stood out during testing.","<strong>Why Buy a Backup Camera</strong>","Most new vehicles have a built-in backup cam, but all new vehicles will include backup cameras as a standard feature as of May 1, 2018, because of the Rear Visibility Standard. If you have an older car you may be tempted to wait until your next car, but it’s an important safety feature you can have now. Amber Andreasen of Kids and Cars, a non-profit organization dedicated to keeping children safe in and around vehicles, told us, “You don’t have to wait. Because they’re standard in all vehicles now, after-market ones are affordable – there’s a backup camera out there for everyone. So it’s a small price to pay for such an important safety feature.” <a href=\"https://www.kidsandcars.org/\">KidsandCars.org</a> reports that backovers are one of the leading causes of non-traffic vehicular child deaths, with 44 reports of children under the age of 14 dying from backovers in 2017. “Not only will it protect children,” she added, “But backup accidents happen all the time, and no one wants to pay for a crazy expensive new bumper.”","Visibility<br/>The whole point of a backup camera is being able to see what’s behind you, so you should look for a camera with a wide field of view – all the products we looked at had at least a 110-degree scope, with some expanding up to 170 degrees. For context, a human’s horizontal visual field falls somewhere between 114 and 130 degrees. A larger field of view is better than a narrower one, but it’s also important to take into consideration things like the camera’s angle and how far you can see behind you. Some cameras we tested can be aimed further up or down. These are better than fixed cameras, generally, as the same angle isn’t ideal for both a low-to-the-ground sedan and a taller SUV. Many products can also be mounted in different spots to get the ideal configuration for your vehicle.","Another important factor to consider is a product’s night vision performance. Nighttime is when you need as much visibility as possible, so be sure to purchase a camera only if it has night vision. Most backup cams we tested use infrared LEDs to help illuminate the area behind you, in addition to the light from your tail lights. You have a smaller field of view at night, as areas off the sides get lost in darkness, but it’s much better than reversing blind.","Weather-Proof<br/>Most quality backup camera systems advertise their IP rating and safe operating temperatures. IP ratings are made up of two numbers. The first, you want to be a six. This means the device is protected against dust, which is important since the camera will be hanging out behind your car. The second number is its water rating, which you need to be a three at the very least (rated for heavy rain), though we recommend finding something with a six or higher (rated for high pressure water from any direction). If you live in an area where the temperature regularly drops below freezing, it’s worth checking to make sure your backup camera will work at lower temperatures. Most products we reviewed have advertised operational temperatures of -10 degrees Celsius to 50 degrees Celsius, or 14 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit.","Wired Vs Wireless<br/>Most of the products we tested are wireless systems, though both the <a href=\"/pyle-plcmdvr72-review\">Pyle</a> and <a href=\"/rear-view-safety-091406-review\">Rear View Safety</a> models are wired. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages to both styles. Wireless systems are less reliable and more prone to interference, especially systems that transmit data using analogue signals. Wired systems are more permanent fixtures. They usually require professional installation, but since the connections are wired, it is easier to add other cameras, like a dash cam, to the system. We prefer wireless systems for their flexibility and DIY installations.","<strong>How Much Do Backup Cameras Cost?</strong>","The backup cameras we tested cost an average of $138. Most units come with one monitor and even those with several camera hookups usually only come with one camera, so purchase extra cameras separately as needed. Also factor in the cost of professional installation if you select a wired setup, which can cost hundreds of dollars depending on where you live.","<strong>How Much Does It Cost to Install a Backup Camera? </strong>","We contacted local car stereo installation representatives and big-box electronics retailers and obtained quotes using Amazon Home Services to find out how much it costs to install a backup camera in a midsize vehicle. The local installers quoted us $150 for camera and dash module installation. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vehicle-Backup-System-Installation-In-Store/dp/B07C5LKCM9\">Amazon Home Services</a> provided the lowest quote, $100, and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/rear-back-up-camera-installation-on-cars-trucks-or-suvs-hardware-not-included/5198012.p\">Best Buy’s Geek Squad</a> was right in the middle, at $129. Unfortunately, Amazon Home Services’ certified backup camera installation is currently available only in large metropolitan areas. Nonetheless, it’s worth checking out because, when you enter your ZIP code, the form immediately tells you if the service is available in your area.","You also have the option to install a backup camera yourself. Wired and wireless systems both require you to run cables from the back bumper to the dashboard or, in some cases, the battery. We don’t recommend removing door panels and splicing wires if you don’t have any experience with DIY automotive projects.
