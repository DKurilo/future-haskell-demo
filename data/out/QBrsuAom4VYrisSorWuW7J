You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","The Gigaset C530H is not the <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">best cordless phone</a>. Its battery life and caller information storage capacity is impressive, but that’s not quite enough to make up for its vast weaknesses. Many cordless home phones on the market today only allow you to pair an average of four or five additional handsets with the base, but with the Gigaset C530H, you can actually expand up to six.","The battery life for each of the landline phone’s handsets is longer than most other units we reviewed by a slim margin of 14 in comparison to 12, although there are units that can last for as long as 48 hours. The 530H does have a 320-hour standby time, however, so if you’re not constantly on the phone it’s a long-lasting option. You can also add up to six additional handsets, if you want, and rotate between them while one recharges.","The handsets are backlit, making them easier to see and use, especially at night. They have a large 1.8-inch TFT color display. You can customize the color scheme, ringtone and screensaver for each, including individual ringtones for your VIP entries. Or, if you don’t want to answer the phone, the handy voicemail indicator simply lets you know whenever you have a new voicemail. The best feature of the C530H is its ability to store up to 200 individual contact entries in its phonebook – double what any other unit we evaluated can do. It can also record and list your 60 most recent calls, along with their caller ID data.","The Gigaset C530H ships with a two-year warranty from the manufacturer – double the length of any other warranty in this lineup. You can download the user manual from the company’s website, if needed, or peruse the other informational resources there as well. If you want to speak with the customer support team, you can do so via email."]},"id":"aeee471e-d0f7-44dc-a96c-0df41fc6cfed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d0d923d1-d76b-475e-8cc6-44bb898d48c0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though it’s missing many of the features of the best cordless phones, the Gigaset C530H boasts the largest phonebook and caller ID log storage capacity as well as above-average battery life.
