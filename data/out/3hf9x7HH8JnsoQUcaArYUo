To open Audiozilla, you right-click on the audio file you want to convert, select Convert with Audiozilla and choose an output file format.","This is one of the few converter programs we tested that can extract audio from CDs. To convert a file from CDA format to MP3, you just insert a CD, select the files you want to convert and use the right-click menu to finalize the conversion process. Audiozilla is compatible with 20 audio file formats, but it&#39;s only able to convert those files to nine output formats, including MP3, WAV, WMA and FLAC.","We tested each program with five different video file formats – M4V, MOV, MP4, MPG and WMV – to see if it could extract the audio data. Audiozilla successfully extracted audio from M4V, MP4 and WMV file formats. The best software in our review, <a href=\"/switch-plus-review\">Switch Plus</a>, converted all the video file formats we tested, so Audiozilla did not perform as well as other programs in this area.","We also timed each <a href=\"/best-audio-converter-software\">audio converter</a> as it compressed a large 625MB WAV file into a 26MB MP3 file. We tested each program using the same computer settings and ran only one converter at a time. Audiozilla produced one of the slowest MP3 conversion times in our review. While 30 seconds of extra time per file might not seem like much, when you convert a library of large files, the extra time adds up quickly.","You can access the conversion settings for each of the output formats in the general settings menu. To open the general settings, you right-click on the file you want to convert and select the Settings option at the bottom of the conversion menu. Each format has slightly different settings; for example, you can set the sample rate higher on certain output formats than you can on others. This converter neatly organizes each output setting so you know exactly which one you are adjusting.","Audiozilla has some unique features compared to other software we tested. It is easy to extract audio from CDs, and the way it integrates with your computer is a nice touch – you can just right-click on an audio file and start your conversion. This software is slower at converting WAVs to MP3s than other programs we reviewed, but it allows you to extract audio from some video files, which iTunes can’t do."]},"id":"7765180f-0711-4a74-acde-7c894b2b38f1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66220","url":"/audiozilla-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-14T22:15:11Z","datePublished":"2015-07-14T22:15:11Z","name":"Audiozilla","synopsis":"Audiozilla is one of the most unique audio converter programs we reviewed – it doesn’t have a flashy user interface or a ton of features, but rather, it integrates right into your computer","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Audiozilla is one of the most unique audio converter programs we reviewed – it doesn’t have a flashy user interface or a ton of features, but rather, it integrates right into your computer","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-14T22:15:11Z","id":"3hf9x7HH8JnsoQUcaArYUo","meta":{"title":"Audiozilla Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Audiozilla is a fast and easy way to convert audio files from CDs into other formats.
