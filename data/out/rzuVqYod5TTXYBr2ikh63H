The best debt settlement companies will recommend the ideal option for you. Several of the programs we reviewed partner with credit counselors, and some offer debt consolidation loans.","<u>Credit Counseling</u>: In some cases you may not meet the debt requirements to enroll in a settlement plan. If you don’t meet the minimum debt amount, you’ll be referred to a credit counseling agency. These are non-profits that can give you guidance on budgeting or enroll you in a debt management plan. In a debt management plan the credit counselors will negotiate a reduction on interest rates and fees with your creditors. These take longer than a debt settlement plan, typically five to seven years, and can also be detrimental to your credit score.","<u>Debt Consolidation Loan</u>: While debt settlement and debt consolidation are used interchangeably by many in this industry, an actual debt consolidation loan is different from a debt settlement plan. With a debt consolidation loan you get a loan to pay off your creditors and then only make payments to one lender, usually a bank or a credit union, though a few of the settlement companies in our review have a separate division that offers debt consolidation loans.","A debt consolidation loan has more stringent requirements than a debt settlement program. You may need to meet income requirements or have a certain debt-to-income ratio. You may also need to provide collateral, such as home equity, to be eligible.","<u>Bankruptcy</u>: This is the final resort for managing your debt. Bankruptcy is a legal process that can allow you to get rid of your debt. Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which has strict income requirements, can liquidate all your debt, though some of your assets will be sold to pay it off. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy requires you to work with your creditors to create a payment plan. Bankruptcy is very damaging to your credit score and can impact your future eligibility for loans and lines of credit. A bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for seven to 10 years and can reduce your score by up to 200 points.","<strong>How to Settle Debt Yourself</strong>","You can settle debt yourself, without the assistance of a debt settlement company. In fact, some creditors refuse to work with settlement companies. However, it can be time-consuming to negotiate for yourself and may not be the best option if you have a lot of creditors to settle with.","DIY debt settlement follows a similar process to settling with the help of a company. You stop making payments and start saving up with the goal of making a discounted payment on your entire debt amount. To settle your debt, you need to be at least 90-days delinquent on your payments. The longer you’ve missed payments, the more likely your creditors will settle. After five months, your creditors will send your debt to collections agencies, which may make them more willing to settle with you.","Creditors typically prefer lump-sum payments, though in some cases you may be able to negotiate a reduced-cost payment plan. Also, it may be easier to negotiate a settlement if you’ve had a hardship like losing your job or a medical problem that keeps you from making regular payments. <a href=\"https://www.credit.com/debt/ten-tips-for-negotiating-with-creditors/\">Here</a> are some other tips for negotiating your own debt settlement.","Another reason to negotiate your own settlement is you won’t have to pay fees to a settlement company. Debt settlement companies take 15 to 25 percent of the amount you settle – if you use a company and settle for $10,000, you’ll also pay up to $2,500 in fees.","No matter how you settle your debt, it will hurt your credit. Late payments show up on your report no matter what you do, but when you negotiate, try to get your creditors to mark your debt as “Paid as Agreed” rather than “Settled.”","<strong>Is a Debt Consolidation Loan a Good Option?</strong>","Another common option for dealing with debt is a debt consolidation loan. This is a personal loan you use to pay off your existing debt. By combining all your debts into one loan, you only have one monthly payment and one interest rate. You can find a debt consolidation loan through a bank or another lender. Many debt settlement companies also offer debt consolidation loans or work with third parties if they find a consolidation loan is the best option for you.","To be eligible for a consolidation loan, you need good credit. Lenders won’t approve loans if you have a score below 630, and you typically need a score of 720 or above to qualify for the best rates. Rates usually range from 13% to 30%, though you’ll end up saving some money since you only pay interest on one loan.","If you have poor credit and are worried you may not be approved for a loan, you can try to find someone to co-sign with you. Getting a co-signer increases the likelihood of getting approved, and if they have good credit, your loan will have a better rate. Keep in mind that a co-signer is also responsible for your loan, so if you miss payments, it affects their credit.","Another option for debt consolidation is a balance transfer credit card. Like a loan, you move existing balances onto one card with a single interest rate. As a bonus, the balance transfer card acts as a credit card you can use for emergencies. Keep an eye on balance transfer fees, which can be as much as 5%. Some cards only let you transfer a certain percent of the card’s balance, which can include fees.","<strong>Warning Signs You Might Have a Debt Problem</strong>","Credit and debt are useful, often necessary, tools to help you pay for things you may not otherwise be able to afford such as college, a home and other large purchases. However, debt can get out of hand, to the detriment of your finances. Here are some ways to spot a debt problem:","You Don’t Have Any Savings: Your inability to build an emergency fund may be directly linked to your debt. If all your extra money goes to pay off debts, you can’t save, which likely leaves you accumulating more debt if you do have an emergency.","You Only Make Minimum Payments: Having many debts or otherwise pinched finances can keep you from making more than the bare minimum monthly payments. This may keep you afloat in the short term, but it means it will take longer to pay off your debts because interest will continue to accrue and add to the amount you owe.","You Use Credit Cards to Tide You Over: Another sign your debts are becoming a problem is you use your credit cards to survive until you get your next paycheck. Budgeting can help you stretch your money so you don’t have to use your credit cards.","You Use Cash Advances: Taking a cash advance from you credit card to pay another bill is a sure sign your debts are becoming a problem. Cash advances only add to your problem, with fees and added interest rates.","You’re Late on Payments: This is the biggest red flag. Missing a payment on one or more bills means you’ve reached a breaking point with your debt, and you may need to look for ways to lighten your load.","<strong>Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche: Strategies to Manage Your Debt</strong>","Before signing up for a debt settlement plan, take stock of your debt and finances – you may be able to dig yourself out of the hole your debts have created on your own. There are several strategies for paying off debt, and the two most common are the debt snowball method and debt avalanche method.","The debt snowball method was popularized by <a href=\"https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-the-debt-snowball-method-works\">Dave Ramsey</a>. With this strategy, you first list your debts from smallest to largest. You then pay as much as you can on the smallest debt while making minimum payments on the rest. You pay off the smallest debt first and then continue on through your larger debts. As you pay off each successive debt, you have more money to make larger payments on the next smallest debt.","The debt avalanche method is similar to the debt snowball method, but instead of looking at the each debt’s balance, you look at its interest rate. You make larger payments on the debt with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on all your other debts. The idea behind this strategy is that high rates cost you more over the life of the loan, so paying high interest debts down first saves you money in the long term.","<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2017/07/20/debt-snowball-versus-debt-avalanche-what-the-academic-research-shows/#422d381454a0\">Experts</a> disagree about which of these methods is best. Studies have shown that there is a psychological effect to paying off debts that helps those using the snowball method keep at it. Most experts note that the avalanche method is more cost effective, since the snowball method can result in high interest debts continuing to accrue.","<strong>How Do Different Debt-Relief Methods Affect Credit Scores?</strong>","There are many ways to manage your debt. However, many methods affect your credit score, some more adversely than others. If your debt load is out of control, your credit score may be the least of your worries. Still, it&#39;s good to consider what your score may look like after you take care of your debts.","Using a home equity loan or a personal loan to consolidate your debts has the least impact on your credit. You use the money you borrow to pay off your old debts and then just make payments on the new loan. Personal and home equity loans tend to have a neutral or positive effect on your credit. However, if income problems caused your debt, you may continue to struggle with your new loan.","If you opt to pay down your debt by making minimum payments, you may see a minor negative impact on your credit. You’ll continue getting credit for making on-time payments, but your score also factors in the amount of credit you utilize. As such, static or growing balances could lower your score. In addition, only making minimum payments is more expensive in the long run, since interest accrues and further increases your balances.","Opting for a debt settlement program may be a better option. This type of program allows you to pay off your debt for a reduced amount. To go this route, you need to stop making payments, which can lower your credit score by as much as 100 points. Once the debt relief company you hire settles your debts, they’ll be marked as “settled” on you credit report, which may affect your likelihood of being approved for credit in the future. Settled debt remains on your credit report for seven years.","Bankruptcy is the most drastic option, and it can lower your credit score by as much as 200 points. If you file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, it remains on your credit report for 10 years. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays for seven years. No matter which chapter you file, you may notice the effects, especially when you apply for new credit."]},"id":"df7da3da-bb4a-438f-a30d-3a07353d408a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"17bdc308-c4ea-4065-a91f-c3e76cbff05b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.nationaldebtrelief.com/apply/?src=toptenreviews\">National Debt Relief</a>","<a href=\"https://blltrk.com/?a=218&c=1539&s1=DebtSettlement\">Freedom Debt Relief</a>","<a href=\"http://www.neweradebtsolutions.com/debt-settlement-overview/\">New Era Debt Solutions</a>","<a href=\"https://www.guardiandebtrelief.com/\">Guardian Debt Relief</a>","<a href=\"https://www.pacificdebt.com/debt-solutions/debt-settlement/\">Pacific Debt Inc.</a>","<a href=\"https://trkac1.com/?a=23&c=15&s1=DebtSettlement&campaign_id=496\">Accredited Debt Relief</a>","<a href=\"https://www.linkconnector.com/ta.php?lc=017408000012006062&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.curadebt.com%2Fdebtform%2F%23step1&atid=DebtSettlement&lcpt=0&lcpf=3\">CuraDebt</a>","<a href=\"http://www.premierdebthelp.com/\">Premier Debt Help</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ovlg.com/signup/?aff=1cb7d75dca44b5b1ff6e43d586077372&pn=\">Oak View Law Group</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"ffcf67b9-d2fb-408e-9842-3749f6d2bfd9","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_516","url":"/best-debt-settlement-companies","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-05-03T18:04:43Z","datePublished":"2017-08-22T21:45:55Z","name":"Best Debt Settlement Companies","synopsis":"If you have multiple debts and are behind in your payments, debt settlement is a debt management option where agents talk with your creditors and attempt to negotiate down your debt.
