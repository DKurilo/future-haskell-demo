You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Magnavox DVD and Blu-ray players are fairly basic compared to other brands. Although these products only offer light to modest feature sets, the robust build, budget-friendly price tag and solid image quality still represent good value.","Most Magnavox <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD players</a> are region-specific, although you may find some that are region-free. Be sure to check before you finalize your purchase if you plan to play discs from multiple regions. Select models feature internet connectivity and allow you to stream content from a variety of streaming, catch-up and on-demand services. The majority of Magnavox budget DVD players do not provide internet access, so they don’t support streaming services. However, most players, at all price points, do provide USB ports, so you can access media stored on USB drives and peripherals.","Magnavox Blu-ray and DVD players connect to your television via HDMI cables, and some offer a wired Ethernet internet connection. Select models also feature Wi-Fi connectivity for convenient wireless streaming. These players lack Wi-Fi Direct, but you can still connect an array of peripherals via the USB port.","Magnavox has varying image quality across its product range, with a minimum of 720p HD and some models offering 1080p Full HD. These devices lack 3D playback and Ultra HD, but unless you have a big-screen, 4K, 3D-capable television, this shouldn’t be a deal-breaker. To cater to those with large libraries of old and low-resolution DVDs, Magnavox DVD players do offer upscaling, bringing low-resolution DVDs to near-HD image quality.","The low-end Magnavox DVD players don’t offer many extra features, other than a remote control. These items are pretty basic, with few frills, although each player features the Magnavox user-friendly GUI, so these products are well-suited to the technologically challenged. Some of the upscale models from Magnavox allow streaming from certain services, including VUDU, Netflix and YouTube. A parental control feature lets you control what content your youngsters can access.","The slim, compact design of Magnavox Blu-ray and DVD players makes them a popular choice for when space is at a premium. Blu-ray players with internet connectivity support BD-Live, letting you chat online, download bonus content and play games."]},"id":"95fbf13c-95df-4c96-ae3a-8ca2c71c8798","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53446","url":"/magnavox-mdv3000-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-16T18:33:56Z","datePublished":"2011-08-16T18:33:56Z","name":"Magnavox","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-16T18:33:56Z","id":"u53wf3TSQ9c7mzMvUcmC7L","meta":{"title":"Magnavox Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Magnavox DVD players are budget-friendly and offer plenty of useful features.
