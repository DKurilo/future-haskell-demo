You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Dyna-Glo 5-Burner is a solid, affordable <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">gas grill</a> that has a couple of nice extras, making it a good grill for this price range. It has a spacious 530 square inches of primary cooking area. Our testing showed it fits up to 24 burgers, with a warming tray that can fit eight buns, but its wide-spaced grates can make grilling burgers tricky.","The push-button ignition starts this propane grill quickly and easily, and it heats up fast. It took three minutes and 45 seconds to reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit in our test, which is much faster than average. The fastest was the <a href=\"/char-broil-review\">Char-Broil Stainless</a> at two minutes forty four seconds. It cooks evenly overall, but it retains heat best in the middle and not as much on the sides, which was true of several of the top-rated gas grills we tested.","One potential drawback with this barbecue grill is that the grates are spaced farther apart than most of the other grills&#39; grates. In fact, we lost a hamburger patty on our first try using it. The quarter-pound hamburger patty slid smoothly through the grates when we turned it. It happened so fast, we didn&#39;t have time to stop it from falling through. Most meat, of course, isn&#39;t as thin as a hamburger patty, but you&#39;ll want to be aware of this and know your burgers, hot dogs and similarly narrow meats are at risk of being sacrificed to the grill.","The stainless steel grates are nicely durable, but they took extra rubbing to clean after use. Like most outdoor grills with stainless steel grates, the Dyna-Glo will never look like new after its first use.","The pull-out propane tank is the standout feature on this model, which is otherwise fairly standard. This is an uncommon feature that makes it very easy to set up and dismount the propane tank when it&#39;s time to refuel. It also has a side burner that&#39;s great for cooking up stir-fried vegetables and other foods that may not easily lend themselves to grilling. You can also purchase rotisserie accessories separately for this grill.","The warranty on the burner is five years, and the parts warranty lasts for one year. This is shorter than average, but you can get some good use out of it before the warranty expires. It comes with an assembly manual, and you can download an owner&#39;s manual online in case you lose it. If you have questions or concerns, you can reach Dyna-Glo&#39;s customer support via phone or email."]},"id":"5abe2620-a07c-42f7-8923-fc79e512a8da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"93f323ca-9f0f-440d-b651-273d69f1f98a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dyna-Glo 5-Burner can accommodate a big group of guests with its capacity for 24 burgers at a time.
