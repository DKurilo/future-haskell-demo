Both companies provide powerful antivirus software, but do so in very different ways. While <a href=\"/kaspersky-review\">Kaspersky</a> is a juggernaut, it is also expensive and a power drain, even its lower end versions, while <a href=\"/best-antivirus-softwareeset-nod32-review/\">Eset</a> is a much more basic setup that is on the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of cost, though not entirely that of scope. Eset seeks to box everything into a very few options, while Kaspersky has a wide range of products that can be daunting for less-advanced users.","When it comes to antivirus software, naturally the first issue is whether it provides adequate coverage. When it comes to coverage, Kaspersky vs. Eset are neck and neck. They are both leaders in the field, and with good reason. The features will change depending on which sub-product you choose, especially with the wide variety offered by Kaspersky. Both give outstanding coverage against viruses, worms, phishing, Trojans, malware, spyware, adware and email invasions. Their packages offer coverage for both homes and businesses, depending on the needs of the consumer.","Since both offer such comprehensive coverage, declaring a winner in Kaspersky vs. Eset is extremely difficult. Kaspersky is aimed much more toward the corporate world, offering packages that begin with coverage for three computers, while Eset allows for single computer coverage at a discounted price. Eset is clearly intended for personal use as well as small businesses.","In terms of ease of use, Eset works much more as a fire and forget single setup software that requires very little   if any   user input after you have installed and configured the software and works very well for any person or business that wants antivirus software that is innocuous and runs almost totally unnoticed. Kaspersky can be set up to also have a low-grade influence, but it is often such a noticeable power drain while it is running that it will still be felt even if it is not directly asking for user input. This again shows Kaspersky s devotion to more powerful corporate machines rather than those in the homes of basic users.","In terms of service and prevention, Kaspersky vs. Eset uses two very different ideological approaches. Kaspersky uses a database provided by users that stores information on browsing habits and potential infections. Eset employs a detection system that identifies potential threats based on file behavior rather than user history. Both have dedicated service and system revival services in the event of an infection, so while they may use different approaches, both are immensely dedicated to accomplishing complete security.","The question of which antivirus software between Kaspersky vs. Eset will accomplish the required tasks depends entirely on your needs. Both will give you outstanding protection against virus invasions, spyware, adware, Trojans, phishing and hacker attacks. Kaspersky will work better for more powerful machines that can offer the extensive power necessary to run the software, as well as a slightly more complicated setup, while Eset offers similar protection that is not as heavily customizable, but uses much smaller amounts of processing power to provide antivirus protection.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"a8b4e0ec-ff6a-4aa9-8fe5-dc664e8edf3c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6061","url":"/kaspersky-and-eset-go-head-to-head","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"m-w-byrne","url":"/author/m-w-byrne","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"M.W.
