There are no traditional in-home systems in this service&#39;s offerings, and rightly so – traditional in-home systems are fraught with potential communication issues and have a severely limited range. With a mobile medical alert device, your aging loved one can go anywhere and speak to the emergency responders easily. The mobile system is always the safer option, but they typically cost close to $40 per month. With GreatCall, however, you get a high-quality mobile device and the fastest emergency response time at a monthly cost lower than most service&#39;s outdated in-home landline systems. This is why GreatCall is one of the best options for a medical alert system - the service provides one of the best safety-net at the most affordable monthly cost.","GreatCall&#39;s devices include the Lively Mobile, Lively Wearable, Jitterbug Flip and Jitterbug Smart. We ordered and tested the Lively Mobile. ","<strong>Pricing</strong>","The Lively Mobile is the most comparable device GreatCall offers. There are three tiers of service options for the Lively Mobile. The base tier costs $24.99 per month, making it the most affordable mobile alert system on the market by a significant margin. In fact, GreatCall costs less per month than most traditional in-home landline systems. Only <a href=\"/medical-alert-review\">Medical Alert</a> and <a href=\"/bay-alarm-medical-review\">Bay Alarm</a> have medical alert systems at a more affordable cost per month, but these systems require a landline and don&#39;t provide the quality of a mobile system.","The second-tier costs $29.99 per month (the same price as most landline systems) and provides 24/7 access to registered nurses and board-certified doctors. You can get prescriptions by phone and medical advice. This tier also makes the Lively Mobile compatible with the GreatCall Link, a caretaker app designed to keep you informed on your loved one&#39;s status. These are features you don&#39;t find with other mobile alert systems. Some services have caretaker tracking apps, but at a significant cost.","The third-tier costs $39.99 per month and adds fall-detection and product replacement. Even at nearly $40 per month, it&#39;s still more affordable than every mobile system with fall detection. And if the device stops working or is broken in any way, GreatCall replaces it at no cost. (We experienced the value of this firsthand. In 2017, while testing fall detection, an overeager intern broke it during fall detection tests and they quickly sent a replacement.)","<strong>Emergency Response Performance</strong>","While the exceptionally affordable mobile alert system price is an great reason for GreatCall being the best medical alert system, it&#39;s the call response time that really puts them over the top. With over two weeks of daily tests, GreatCall earned an A+ for call response speed with an average response speed of 14 seconds. In one test, the call was answered in eight seconds. The slowest time, 17 seconds, was still faster than other services. By comparison, the second fastest services (<a href=\"/medical-guardian-review\">Medical Guardian</a>, Medical Alert and <a href=\"/acadian-oncall-review\">Acadian OnCall</a>) were twice as slow on average, and these services were almost twice as fast as the overall average.","This blazing response speed is a consistent aspect of GreatCall. In 2017, I tested medical alert services in similar fashion and many of the call response speeds were different this year. Some services that were comparatively slow last year were much faster this year, and vice versa. However, GreatCall recorded similarly fast speeds last year. This is the second year in a row where it&#39;s average speed was twice as fast as the second fastest service. In a situation where seconds matter, this is a big deal.","The quality of the emergency responders was good, but it wasn&#39;t elite compared to several of the other services, which is why it received a B- grade. In almost every call, the tone of the operator was enthusiastic and empathetic. They didn&#39;t sound like they were reading from a script and they seemed genuinely invested in my safety. In addition, they always verified my name. This was all great. Too often, I was met with operators reading from a script with a monotonous, sleepy tone. However, one of the biggest reasons GreatCall received a lower grade was because the operators only confirmed if I was okay once, at the beginning of the call. As soon as told them I was either testing the device or that the call was an accident, the operators rushed to end the call. Only once, an operator stayed on the line to confirm my address and GPS location.","In a way, the rush to end the call after learning the senior doesn&#39;t need help is justified, as they want to make sure operators are available for actual emergencies. Unfortunately, many seniors are hesitant to admit they need help, even if they pressed the help button. So, confirming with the senior that they&#39;re okay multiple times is the safer option, especially when the operators asked at the beginning and end of the call. That way, they&#39;d give me a chance to change my mind concerning the need to ask for help. It&#39;s just an added layer of protection. ","<strong>System Performance</strong>","The Lively Mobile has the best speaker for a mobile alert device. The quality of the communication with the emergency responders never wavered. While not as loud as most mobile systems, as it averaged just 74 dB, the volume of a mobile system isn&#39;t as necessary as an in-home system because you&#39;re never more than a foot away from the speaker. Rather the clarity of the speaker is what&#39;s important, as several mobile systems I tested sounded dreadful.","The one minor concern with the Lively Mobile is the white flashing light. When the device is charged and there is a cellular signal, a white glowing light slowly toggles between on and off. I like how the light lets you know its connected to a cellular signal, but it also draws attention to the device and many seniors resist medical alert systems for this very reason - they don&#39;t want people to know they use a medical alert device. For example, throughout the testing process, my parents continually asked me for my recommendations. My grandmother is 92 and still lives on her own. They&#39;ve been considering getting her a medical alert device for their own peace of mind. However, when I showed them the GreatCall, they didn&#39;t think my grandmother would wear it, in part because the light. This issue is not uncommon. Fact is, there is an unfortunate stigma with medical alert devices and many seniors resist wearing anything resembling a medical alert device as a result. That said, GreatCall has informed me that an update is forthcoming to reduce the glow of the light so its not as noticeable. Still, even if the light is diminished, it&#39;s still going to be a concern, however minor, so long as it visibly advertises itself as a medical alert device. ","<strong>Additional Services &amp; Add-Ons</strong>","As mentioned, GreatCall is a unique medical alert service with unique products. The Jitterbug Smart is a smartphone designed specifically for seniors. It doesn&#39;t have a contract. The interface features larger buttons and a simplified navigation, making an ideal option for seniors who haven&#39;t used smartphones before. As with every GreatCall device, it&#39;s also connected to GreatCall&#39;s 5Star call center, so they can easily call for help just as easily as with the Lively Mobile device.","The Jitterbug Flip is another phone designed for seniors, though it&#39;s not a smartphone. Instead, it&#39;s a simple mobile phone designed with larger buttons and a connection to the 5Star call center.","The Lively Wearable is worn on your wrist and connects with an app on your smartphone. It turns your phone into a mobile medical alert system, as you just need to press the help button on it to call for help using your phone. It also provides basic fitness tracking abilities and lets you set up personal fitness challenges and goals. ","<strong>Summary</strong>","GreatCall has a mobile medical alert system priced more affordably than most outdated landline systems. The call response speed is incredibly fast and the quality of the Lively Mobile is unmatched, though the glowing white light is a turn-off.
