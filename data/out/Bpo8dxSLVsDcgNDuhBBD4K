You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Handicare Sterling 2000 is a curved <a href=\"/best-stairlifts\">stairlift</a> for homes with spiral staircases and intermediate landings. Its design and features are similar to those of the Handicare Sterling 1000, a straight stairlift.","Homeowners with curved stairs can have a hard time finding stairlifts that fit their staircases. To solve this problem, Handicare provides various options for the Sterling 2000. Depending on the shape of your stairs, you can choose one of three options: a small radius spiral, a flat 90 or a flat 180. In addition, there are eight parking options for the top and bottom track ends.","The layout is not the only customizable aspect of the Sterling 2000 – its rail and seat are also available in different color options. There are three seat options for this stairlift: the standard seat, a fixed and narrower seat, and a perch seat. In addition, you can choose a deluxe extra-wide seat and powered seat swivel, folding hinge and footrest. While these powered options are more convenient than the standard manual options on the stair elevator, they are also not as long-lasting, and they add to the maintenance and repair costs of the stairlift.","Despite the different options available, the Sterling 2000 has a stiff core that is barely adjustable. Its seat is padded but shallow and becomes uncomfortable after prolonged use. The standard Sterling 2000 handicap stairlift has a weight limit of 254 pounds, which is comparable to the <a href=\"/acorn-curved-stair-lift-review\">Acorn 180</a>. However, there is a heavy-duty version with a maximum weight capacity of 302 pounds, which is comparable to the <a href=\"/ameriglide-review\">AmeriGlide Horizon</a>. While this stairlift is sturdier than the standard model, it is still not strong enough for the heaviest users.","With a maximum stair angle of 56 degrees, this Handicare stairlift is suitable for homes with steep stairs. In addition, its 24-volt batteries serve as a power backup to keep the stairlift moving during power outages. However, those batteries only charge at stations placed at the foot and top of the rail track. Therefore, they charge slowly and deplete quickly after heavy use.","The Sterling 2000 lacks some of the fancy features of more expensive stair elevators, but it does have features that are standard for curved stairlifts. There is a toggle in one arm of the stairlift for controlling the movement of the carriage, safety sensors to stop the carriage before it runs into an obstruction and a safety belt to keep you secured.","What the Sterling 2000 lacks in advanced features, adjustability and aesthetics, it makes up for in customization, reliability and generous warranties on parts."]},"id":"50c76b9c-b939-42dd-894b-6e1bb0133760","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60690","url":"/sterling-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sheryl-huggins-salomon","url":"/author/sheryl-huggins-salomon","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sheryl Huggins Salomon","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"PEDnkfQBmpWyHpYTiEznSY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-02T18:43:28Z","datePublished":"2014-10-02T18:43:28Z","name":"Sterling 2000 Stairlift","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-02T18:43:28Z","id":"Bpo8dxSLVsDcgNDuhBBD4K","meta":{"title":"Sterling 2000 Stairlift Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Handicare Sterling 2000 is a curved stairlift with multiple options to fit most stairs.
