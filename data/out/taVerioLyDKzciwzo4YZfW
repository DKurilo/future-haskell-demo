You can expect to get around 20 jump-starts out of a single charge, and it also doubles as a portable device charger with its 2.1-amp USB output. The USB input allows you to charge the GB40 with any USB wall socket.","The GB40’s USB charging capability makes it a great tool to have in your glove box. It only weighs around 2 pounds, so you can take it anywhere and charge your phone, tablet or any other device that uses a USB charger.","This pocket-size jump-starter has the longest jumper cables of any ultra-portable model we researched – their 23-inch span makes it easy to position the GB40 in a safe place before you get back in your car to turn the key. The cables are insulated with high-temperature silicone, which makes them durable and flexible in extreme temperatures. The alligator clips on the ends of the cables are spark-proof, so sparks won’t fly everywhere if you happen to touch them together.","On the front panel, there is a Light Mode button that turns the dual-LED flashlight on and off. Using the button, you can choose from seven light modes, including SOS and emergency strobe. You can also use the flashlight to identify the positive and negative terminals on your battery. Don’t worry if you connect the clips to the wrong terminals though – the GB40 has reverse polarity protection that keeps the jump-starter from discharging the battery if you hook it up wrong.","If the GB40 stops working in the first year you own it, you can use the manufacturer warranty to have it repaired or replaced. NOCO has the best support options of all the jump-starter and battery charger manufacturers we researched. We called its customer support team to ask a couple questions and found the staff to be well-informed and friendly. You can also contact NOCO by email or live chat. Live chat is the fastest way to find answers to most questions."]},"id":"9816e5bd-125e-4cb0-ac70-cdd04ba0201c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69547","url":"/noco-genius-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-26T13:44:31Z","datePublished":"2017-07-26T13:44:31Z","name":"NOCO Genius GB40","synopsis":"Much like the Stanley J5C09 and the GOOLOO GP200, the NOCO GB40 uses a lithium-ion power source to deliver 1000-amps of jump-starting power, which is enough power to jump-start V8 gas motors and V6 diesel motors.","review":{"rating":34,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Much like the Stanley J5C09 and the GOOLOO GP200, the NOCO GB40 uses a lithium-ion power source to deliver 1000-amps of jump-starting power, which is enough power to jump-start V8 gas motors and V6 diesel motors.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","id":"taVerioLyDKzciwzo4YZfW","meta":{"title":"NOCO Genius GB40 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The NOCO GB40 is a safe and easy-to-use replacement for the jumper cables in your trunk.
