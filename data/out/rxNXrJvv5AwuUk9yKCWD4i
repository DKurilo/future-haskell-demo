The EC110S’s remote control, timer and multiple fan speed settings help it cool your room to a comfortable temperature without running up a stratospheric electricity bill.","As we write this article, the sleek-looking Luma Comfort EC110S costs around $150, so it’s less expensive than most portable evaporative coolers. In addition, it has a maximum airflow rating of 500 cubic feet per minute (CFM), so it is much more powerful than similarly priced units.

If you run it eight hours a day for three months a year, you can expect to pay about $10 annually for the electricity it uses – that’s much less than it costs to run a traditional window-mounted air conditioner. However, if you need to cool a room of only about 175 square feet, a more efficient unit like the <a href=\"/arctic-cove-evc350-review\">Arctic Cove EVC350</a> may be better.","This Luma Comfort model’s water tank holds 1.76 gallons, so it isn&#39;t particularly large. However, its size makes it easy to carry when you refill it. We like that the cooler has a water level detector that senses when the tank is low and alerts you when it’s time to refill the reservoir. The cooler automatically turns itself off if the water dips below the minimum level so the unit doesn’t malfunction – this hands-off safeguard makes the EC110S more user-friendly than some other portable evaporative coolers."]},"id":"691cf0c5-bdbb-4ddd-8d49-ca1052c1fdc3","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/MNW6T8MZXTRp2daFNf4pwM.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/66065-luma-comfort-ecs110s2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNW6T8MZXTRp2daFNf4pwM.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"MNW6T8MZXTRp2daFNf4pwM","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNW6T8MZXTRp2daFNf4pwM.jpg","alt":""},"id":"328a47c6-9fee-479f-84ba-c130cff022c7","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The EC110S is an attractive portable swamp cooler that blends with most decor.
