The Roomba 560 is part of their 500 series, an older line, but still a fantastic product.","Spinning side brushes, counter-rotating brushes under the unit and a powerful vacuum are responsible for cleaning your home of dust, pet hair, dirt and other allergens. After a three-hour charge time, the robot vacuum can run for 90 minutes, cleaning, on average, four rooms before it needs to be recharged. You can also schedule the Roomba 560 to clean up to seven times a week. The robot vacuum will return to its charging base on its own when its battery is running low.","This robot vacuum works on all floor types, linoleum, wood, tile or carpet without getting stuck moving from one surface to another. It is equipped with an infrared sensor to determine different rooms and an acoustic sensor to sense excessively dirty areas. When the automatic vacuum cleaner detects a particularly dirty spot, it goes into spot mode, giving the area a little more attention.","In the Roomba 560’s box, you’ll find the robot vacuum, two virtual walls, extra filters and a rechargeable battery. We love that Roomba includes the virtual walls so you don’t have to purchase them separately. Virtual walls can be activated to stop the Roomba from entering certain rooms or accessing off-limits areas. It doesn’t have room memory, however, or a full bin indicator.","On Roomba’s website you’ll find a plethora of help and support content to answer any questions you may have about the 560. They have FAQs, video tutorials and a downloadable user manual. If you need to speak to a company representative, an email and phone number are available for technical support. However, we emailed technical support with specific questions about the robot vacuum and never received an answer back."]},"id":"be217510-14bb-4a6c-9c71-889cc110dcf5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a47f17d6-bb9c-4a76-8a33-e26bda431e74","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Roomba 560 is a stellar robot vacuum with most of the features you’d want in a vacuum cleaner.
