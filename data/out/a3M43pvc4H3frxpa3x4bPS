It&#39;s a useful tool to have around in emergencies, thanks to its secondary role as an all-purpose charger. The Scorpion has two USB ports, the maximum number available on an ultra-portable jump-starter, and can charge two mobile devices at the same time.","The Scorpion can deliver 300 cold cranking amps (CCA) of power to your vehicle’s battery, which is enough to jump-start a small- or medium-size car. You should consider a larger jump-starter, such as the <a href=\"/clore-jump-starter-review\">Clore Jump-N-Carry</a> or the <a href=\"/gooloo-review\">GOOLOO</a>, if you have a car or truck with a V8 engine, especially if you live or travel in cold climates.","There are a few inconveniences you should consider before you purchase the Scorpion. First, it has very short jumper cables – you need to position the device within 6 inches of the battery terminals to connect the clamps. In addition, it doesn&#39;t have a reverse polarity warning, so you need to double check that you connected the cables correctly – the device’s built-in LED flashlight comes in handy when you try to identify which terminal is positive and which is negative.","For safety, the Scorpion has overcharge protection. Since it has this feature, you can plug the jump-starter in to recharge and then walk away. Leaving the device plugged in after the battery reaches full charge doesn&#39;t damage it in any way.","This charger comes with all the cables you need to jump-start your car and charge mobile devices, including a lighting cable and micro USB cable. All the cables, the power supplies and the jump-starter stow away in the supplied zip-up case, which easily fits in a glove compartment. The Scorpion comes in four colors: blue, red, green and black.","The Brightech Scorpion has a three-year manufacturer warranty, so you have quite a while to notice any problems or factory defects. Some of the ultra-portable jump-starters we researched only have 90-day warranties, so the Scorpion is exceptional in this regard."]},"id":"981ed0e5-17b0-4159-a3d6-65096e2c1426","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67884","url":"/brightech-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-05-19T14:41:26Z","datePublished":"2016-05-19T14:41:26Z","name":"Brightech Scorpion","synopsis":"The Brightech Scorpion acts as both an alternate power source for your electronic devices and a car battery jump-starter, though it has less jump-starting potential than some larger models.
