your music with the Denon AH-D600 headphones for rib pounding bass. For good <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">bass headphones</a>, the AH-D600s do a great job of reproducing hammering bass, but not with the crystal-clear precision of the best headphones for bass. The over-ear design is comfortable, but the headphones feel wobbly and don’t stay put.","The AH-D600s have all the design specifications for headphones with good bass. The 108 dB of sensitivity and 1,800 mW of power let you listen to all the lowest lows and highest highs. With an incredibly low frequency response of 5Hz, you can actually feel the music. The 50 mm driver is larger than most to keep your bass booming. The headphones sit over your ears, and the closed design helps keep the bass deep and rattling. However, the overall bass performance and music clarity is muddy at low volumes and only a bit more vibrant at higher volumes.","The inline remote works really well with Apple and Android devices, making it easy for you to crank the volume or end a call. Even though the mic is located on the ear cup instead of inline, voice clarity is still very vivid. Noise isolation doesn&#39;t require additional batteries, which is a benefit. Due to the closed design, outside noises are faint, but without added noise isolation, music really leaks out of these bass headphones.","The cushioned leather ear cups fit big and little ears alike and are relatively comfortable once you adjust the headband. However, the weight makes the AH-D600s feel heavy when you move your head, and they can flop when you&#39;re walking around town. These bass heavy headphones also don’t fold, which makes them a bulky and harder to store than other sets. The double-sided cord is a little inconvenient, but the option of two cords (one with remote and one for home use) is very useful.","Denon has many support features, but they are hard to access. They provide phone numbers, but no email addresses or live chat capabilities. The FAQs page looks voluminous, but there are no questions about the AH-D600s specifically. For further help you have to log in with a Denon account or give representatives access to information about your social media accounts. The only redeeming qualities are the one-year warranty and the long list of downloadable PDF manuals."]},"id":"744e7675-452b-4eb4-8b1c-71f3188be101","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d43e18bf-78f0-433f-9a41-ebf027645b9c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For heavy bass headphones the Denon AH-D600s are a great set, particularly if you have the stamina to listen all day at extremely high volumes.
