You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Video baby monitors are useful around the house, but most have a limited range restricted to your home. To combat this, the Snug Baby Monitor V2 replaces the handheld display with your own smartphone. With the live stream through the SnugCam app, you can watch your little one remotely. This makes it a convenient <a href=\"/best-baby-video-monitors\">video baby monitor</a>, though the video and audio quality aren&#39;t the best.","Setup is a quick – you only need to connect your home Wi-Fi and mobile app to the Snug V2 camera to get started. Excluding your phone, all the materials you need come in the box. The included Ethernet cable connects the camera directly to your router for setup, though there&#39;s also a wireless setup option that uses a QR code to connect the app to the camera.","From your phone, you can control the camera unit&#39;s direction by swiping horizontally or vertically. While this is easy enough to figure out, it is clunky at times and doesn&#39;t let you move the camera quickly. The Snug V2&#39;s camera lagged a little in our tests as it panned and tilted, which affected its overall video quality. Still, in both standard and HD mode, the picture was clear and sharp.","Its video quality is average, but the Snug has an impressive night-vision range. Using 10 infrared LEDs, the camera can see up to 10 meters, or 32 feet, in low-light settings. This is useful if you plan to mount the Snug camera in your baby&#39;s nursery or playroom. The LEDs are visible but subtle enough that they won&#39;t disturb your baby.","The audio quality on this baby monitor is average and sounds similar to a phone call. We could understand words and cries clearly through both units. But as with the video feed, we experienced a slight delay in the audio, earning the monitor a 75-percent audio quality score.","As with other smart baby monitors, you can capture video and images from your parent unit with the Snug Baby Monitor V2. You can&#39;t share what you capture directly from the app, but the camera unit has a slot for a 64GB SD card to retrieve what you record. Multiple people can watch the same video feed, so you, the babysitter and your spouse can all watch the baby from inside or outside of the house. For a secure connection, you can add a password for the video feed.","The Snug V2&#39;s camera is under warranty for two years, the longest in our comparison of video baby monitors. If you need to contact customer support, you can use phone, live chat or an email form on the website. The company doesn&#39;t have a social media presence, so you can&#39;t contact it on Facebook or Twitter."]},"id":"689e8182-b495-49dc-b3a3-a3d650e3113d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"69ccb4b2-45ad-483f-887b-8758e26bbdaf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Using your phone as the video monitor, the Snug Baby Monitor V2 allows you to watch your baby from home or work.
