You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Introduced in the U.S. in 2012, the Freestyle InsuLinx <a href=\"/health-and-beauty/health-care\">blood glucose monitor</a> is specifically designed for diabetics who take insulin but don&#39;t use an insulin pump.","The touchscreen on the Freestyle InsuLinx is bright and easy to read. The screen measures 2.08 inches by 1.70 inches, and it has a backlight that makes it easy to use in almost any lighting condition. The test strip port is lit to help you load the Freestyle InsuLinx glucose test strips, and the glucose monitor uses patented ZipWik tabs that provide quick uptake of blood samples.","You can use the Freestyle InsuLinx meter to track and analyze your blood glucose levels over time. Its built-in electronic logbook holds up to 165 days of test readings, and it also allows you to input and store insulin doses and meal markers so you can see how your levels react to different scenarios. All of this can be accomplished with just a few taps of the screen.","This glucometer uses a small blood sample of only 0.3 microliters, and it can read levels between 20 and 500 mg/dL. The Freestyle InsuLinx glucometer uses three CR 2032 batteries, which power up to 3,000 tests, and the unit only weighs 3.3 ounces with the batteries installed. The entire unit measures 2.4 inches long by 3.8 inches wide by 0.6 inches thick.","Freestyle also has software available that works with the InsuLinx blood glucose meter to track glucose levels and insulin data. The Freestyle Auto-Assist 2.0 software provides information in easy-to-read reports on the screen, via email or through printouts. The Snapshot report gives a general summary that includes notes about trends, while the Modal Day report offers a visual graph of your daily blood glucose pattern for a set range of time. For an overview of insulin and blood glucose data combined, there is a daily statistics report, and the logbook report displays a full table of all entries for each day. The software works on both MAC and Windows operating systems and requires a printer to print reports and a USB cable to link your glucometer to your computer.","With the touchscreen and logbook, the Freestyle InsuLinx meter offers some positive features for tracking glucose and insulin use. The manufacturer also includes a lifetime warranty. One drawback is that testing is limited to only fingertips, and no other testing locations are available. However, the small sample size required, the backlit screen and the long battery life make it worth a look."]},"id":"1ff860ac-c42c-44ba-84d3-90e37475c40b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60910","url":"/freestyle-insulinx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:53:13Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:53:13Z","name":"Freestyle Insulinx","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-23T15:53:13Z","id":"mVhVTkADnQnG44sWS4SarH","meta":{"title":"Freestyle Insulinx Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Freestyle InsuLinx monitors your blood glucose levels and tracks your insulin doses.
