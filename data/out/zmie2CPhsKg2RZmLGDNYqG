We did extensive online research, read professional and user reviews, and consulted with professionals who manufacture, repair and use these devices. We also have firsthand experience using various models and know their quirks, strengths and weaknesses. We reached out to experts and industry insiders to expand our knowledge beyond our online research and personal experience. We talked to Kristi Howard, the Director of Product Marketing for Black &amp; Decker Outdoor Products. She gave us valuable information about standout features, design elements and maintenance. We discuss this more in the maintenance section below.","To get expert advice about environmental considerations we contacted Simon Mui, a lithium-ion battery expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. He said in addition to being much easier to use than their gas counterparts, electric trimmers create much less noise pollution and have zero emissions, which is a huge benefit to you, your neighbors and the environment.","One environmental concern with electric tools is disposing of the battery when it dies. As a solution to this Mui said, “Don’t throw batteries in the trash. Today’s lithium-ion batteries don’t use toxic metals, but the materials can corrode over time.” Mui said <a href=\"https://www.call2recycle.org/\">Call2Recycle.org</a> provides a network of over 34,000 recycling centers and drop-off locations throughout the country at no cost to consumers.","Despite the advantages of electric trimmers, professional landscapers commonly use gas trimmers because they are more powerful and it’s much easier to fill up a gas tank than continually recharge batteries when you are using them all day. In consideration of this, we asked Mui if he was aware of a battery in development that would allow professionals to eventually replace gas-powered tools with electric.","Mui admitted that for someone who is whacking weeds all day, a battery-powered trimmer is probably not the best option. He suggested the possibility of using a corded electric trimmer, however. Mui also felt that professional-grade battery-powered trimmers weren’t out of the question in the future. “If Tesla can design a class eight semi-truck to run on batteries, I’m sure someone can figure out how to spin a 4-ounce trimmer line for a long time,” Mui said.","<strong>How We Picked the Best </strong>","During our evaluation, we considered each weed eater’s weight and compared it against how powerful the machine is. We also took note of how customizable and versatile each model is – features such as an adjustable shaft and variable power settings let you optimize your weed eater to different tasks.","We also factored in the width of each weed eater’s cutting path. The wider the cutting path, the more weeds you can take out in a single pass. However, narrower cutting paths are better for tight spaces.","Additionally, we compared each weed eater’s power supply, noting whether it comes with a battery or needs to be plugged into an outlet to run. Battery-operated weed whackers are limited by how long their batteries hold a charge, while corded models tether you to the power supply.","We also evaluated the safety features of each tool, looking for features such as a starter safety device and cord retainer, both of which prevent accidental electrocution when using a weed eater. Other considerations included whether the machine has a dedicated edging position and an edging guide, since these make the weed eater much easier to use – the best weed eaters have both.","<strong><br/>How Much Do Electric Trimmers Cost? </strong>","Like other electric yard tools, corded electric weed eaters are the most affordable. Batteries for electric tools are costly and the price for battery-operated tools reflects that. The most expensive trimmers in our lineup are the battery-operated WORX WG191 and the Kobalt 130X-06, but you can find battery-operated trimmers for much cheaper. An internet search shows that battery-powered trimmers are priced between about $60 and $200. You can buy corded trimmers for as low as $20, but the good ones start at around $40. The more you pay the better the features, but you should be able to find very good battery- and cord-powered trimmers in your price range.","<strong>Maintaining Your Electric Weed Eater</strong>","While electric trimmers don’t require nearly as much maintenance as their gas counterparts, there are things you can do on a regular basis to keep them running well for an extended period. Kristi Howard, of Black &amp; Decker Outdoor Products, said a common problem with electric string trimmers involves people using the wrong gauge of extension cord to power them. Howard said you should be sure to use an extension cord that is heavy enough to carry the current your product will draw.","“An undersized cord will cause a drop in line voltage resulting in loss of power and overheating,” Howard said. “When in doubt, use the next heavier gauge.” She said the letters WA on the cord jacket indicate a cord that is suitable for outdoor use. Regarding corded vs. cordless trimmers, Howard feels they are comparable in terms of power. Corded trimmers are generally less expensive than battery-operated trimmers and are easy to maintain, but they have less mobility.","To properly maintain an electric trimmer, Howard suggested checking for damaged parts and cleaning off the air intake slots before each use to avoid overheating. She said you should never immerse an electric string trimmer in water or clean it with a pressure washer, and you should store it indoors, out of reach of children. “Keeping your trimmer regularly maintained should minimize your need for larger repairs,” Howard said.","<strong>Gas vs. Electric Weed Eaters</strong>","Professional landscapers usually prefer gas weed whackers for a few reasons: power and unlimited time and reach. In other words, gas models don’t limit you by the distance of a cord or battery life. Professional landscapers also need all the power they can get for jobs like clearing large fields of tough weeds and scrub. As such, gas weed whackers are often the best choice for serious yard work.","Electric trimmers have enough power to trim and edge a lawn and keep most weeds that spring up around the yard under control. They are also easy to start and use. Further, they are ergonomic and better for the environment, and you don’t have to breathe in fumes.","<strong>Important Features to Consider When Choosing an Electric Weed Eater </strong>","When looking for a new string trimmer, pay attention to the design, power options, string features and warranty. For instance, most of the trimmers we reviewed are cordless, and batteries are a nice convenience, but they don’t last forever. A corded trimmer may be a good fit for a small yard. The following considerations will help you select the best electric string trimmer for your lawn.","Trimmer Design<br/>Because you will be carrying around the weed eater, its overall weight is an important consideration. We compared how heavy the grass trimmers are, as well as if they have an adjustable shaft length for extra, customizable comfort. A dedicated edging position makes it easier to get a precise cut against sidewalks without having to hold your trimmer at an odd, uncomfortable angle.","Straight-shaft weed trimmers let you stand further away from what you are cutting, which keeps you safer. Safety is important, so we also looked to see if the trimmers we reviewed include devices that keep cords from getting in the way, as well as if the starter switch is protected from accidentally starting.","Power &amp; Battery<br/>One of the most important things to consider when purchasing an electric string trimmer is if it has the power you need to accomplish the type of work you do. We looked for weed whackers that have high amps for corded models and high-voltage batteries for cordless ones. The more power a weed trimmer has, the tougher the grass and weeds it can tackle. We evaluated and compared cordless and corded electric string trimmers and found that regardless of the power source, if you choose a trimmer with enough power, you can trim efficiently.","When choosing between a corded and cordless weed eater, consider the type of work you need the trimmer to do and the size of your yard. Buying a trimmer that requires an extension cord limits your mobility, but that may not be a problem if you have a small yard. The advantage of using a cord is you don’t have to worry about the battery eventually dying and needing to be replaced, as they tend to do. However, a cordless trimmer gives you limitless mobility, so it’s likely the best option if you have a large yard or need to trim in a remote location.","String Features<br/>We looked for trimmers that are easy to restring and have great line-feed capabilities. The width of the cutting path is also important to consider when you choose an electric trimmer. Look for a grass trimmer with a cutting path wide enough to clear large areas with each sweep, yet narrow enough for you to use in tight spaces. The average cutting path is 13.5 inches wide.","In addition, we evaluated an even mix of single- and dual-feed lines. A single-line head is sufficient for most types of lawns. However, having an extra line gives you more cutting power with each swipe, which can come in handy if you have a lot of tough grass or weeds in your yard. A dual-line head is slightly harder to maintain and may result in more down time when you have to deal with a tangled spool.","Warranty &amp; Support<br/>The industry-standard warranty for electric string trimmers is one year. We looked for trimmers that met or exceeded this standard. The manufacturers of the best electric string trimmers also provide repair or service center locations and phone or email support.
