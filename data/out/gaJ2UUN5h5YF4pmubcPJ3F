Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE Profile PGS950SEFSS is a <a href=\"/best-double-oven-ranges\">gas double oven range</a> that features a powerful cooktop, convection technology, 6.7 cubic feet of cooking space and five burners. It also boasts several additional features, such as delayed bake and a warm setting.","The lower oven has convection cooking technology. When you use the convection feature, convection bake and roast modes are available. In the convection bake mode, heat is distributed through the lower baking element, and in the convection roast mode, the oven distributes the heat through both the upper and lower heat elements. There is no convection broil mode, though, which would offer a great way to cook seafood, vegetables and some breads.","The upper oven on the GE Profile is smaller than the lower oven, with 2.4 cubic feet of space. The lower oven boasts 4.3 cubic feet of space. Three oven racks are included, with two rack positions on the upper oven and four on the lower.","The gas-range cooktop has five burners. There are four circular burners, one in each corner of the cooktop, with an oval burner in the middle for long dishes. The cooktop reaches a maximum of 20,000 Btu, which is excellent for searing and boiling. One burner features up to only 5,000 Btu so you can use it for simmering.","There are a handful of controls and settings on this double oven range. You get basic features such as a timer and self-cleaning capabilities. With the heat self-cleaning feature, the oven reaches high temperatures for a designated amount of time to remove cooked-on food and debris. There is also delayed bake, which lets you set the oven to turn on later when you&#39;re not there, and a setting that allows you to keep food warm for a period of time without overcooking it.","All of the features and controls are located on the front of the oven. You don&#39;t have to reach over hot or steaming pots and pans to adjust the temperature and setting of the oven or cooktop. However, this can also be a concern if you have small children in your home, as the controls would be easy for them to reach as well. There are knobs to control the cooktop, while a touch control pad is there for the different temperatures and settings of each oven.","GE includes a one-year manufacturer warranty on this oven&#39;s parts and labor. This is the average length for a parts and labor warranty on this type of appliance, though some warranties are two years or longer.","With five burners that have a wide range of power, 6.7 cubic feet of space between the two ovens, and numerous settings and cooking features, the GE Profile PGS950SEFSS gives you a lot of cooking versatility. You can use this double oven range to bake and roast in traditional or convection mode."]},"id":"308b0af7-4ce5-459d-ac9e-0d5bcded14d2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67564","url":"/ge-profile-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-01-14T20:48:38Z","datePublished":"2016-01-14T20:48:38Z","name":"GE Profile PGS950SEFSS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
