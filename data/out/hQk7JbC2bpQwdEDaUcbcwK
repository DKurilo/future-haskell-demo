The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-life-insurance\">Life Insurance here</a>.</em>","In your search for the best <a href=\"/best-life-insurance\">life insurance</a> company you’re bound to stumble upon the names of bank conglomerates that offer a little bit of everything related to the financial world. Genworth is decidedly not a mega-corporation. Instead, Genworth is a financial organization that specializes in long-term care insurance, retirement plans, life insurance and legacy management.","Compared to other providers, Genworth Financial sticks to tried-and-true life insurance policies. Genworth’s life insurance policies can be divided into term and universal plans. Genworth term life insurance policies are available in 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year blocks. Term life insurance is ideal as a protection against unexpected death – premiums are low and family members are entitled to a predetermined payout upon the death of the policyholder. The major disadvantage to Genworth’s term life insurance is the simple fact that when your term of coverage expires, the policy has no cash value. Term life insurance is very inflexible on premiums as well – if you miss a payment or make a partial payment, you are not covered until you pay your outstanding balance.","Term life insurance is ideal as a defense against catastrophes. Universal insurance, however, is much more flexible in that it doubles as a life insurance program and a financial investment. There’s also the matter of flexibility – universal life insurance doesn’t lapse the moment you miss a payment. Genworth’s universal life insurance policy allows holders to withdraw or borrow against the policy’s cash value. Any money borrowed against the policy diminishes the death benefits family members can expect. The more money invested in a universal life insurance policy, the more cash value it has and the larger payout for beneficiaries will be. Keep in mind that premiums are substantially more costly for universal coverage than they are for term life insurance.","Genworth Financial doesn’t offer the same wide array of services some of the giant banks do. But given that quantity doesn’t always outshine quality, we’re impressed with what Genworth does offer: namely, the coupling of universal life insurance with coverage for long-term health care. Medical bills can effectively negate the payouts of a life insurance policy. Genworth’s long-term care insurance fortifies a typical universal life insurance policy, making it look that much more appealing.","Genworth offers effective phone support compared to some of the larger providers. When we contacted Genworth customer support, we never spent more than two or three minutes before talking to a representative. The staff had all of our information at their fingertips so we weren&#39;t transferred from department to department as is often the case with large organizations."]},"id":"bd362bea-c2c4-46ac-8f04-2c892fa8fe5b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3b7e2b5b-5f47-41ba-ba28-f448afd51db6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Genworth doesn&#39;t have as many estate management and small business options available as other insurance providers.
