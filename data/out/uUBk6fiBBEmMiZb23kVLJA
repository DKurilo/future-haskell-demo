We take great care to look at the accuracy of each report, and rather than looking at each service’s sample demos, we actually purchase reports of people we know personally and compare them to our subject’s biographical information to evaluate the accuracy of the information.","We also reviewed people search services keeping in mind that they are designed for personal use only, rather than professional use. Due to FCRA regulations, these reports can’t be used to make lending, renting or employment decisions. Those types of background checks are done by consumer reporting agencies, which are different services.","The services we reviewed all pull records from public databases and other public sources like social media accounts. Some variability is natural, so to account for that we ordered reports for multiple people so that we could assess discrepancies and include them in our ranking.","<strong>How we tested</strong>","To test these services, we purchased, people searches for three different people, including one of our reviewers. Our search targets had names that ranged from very common to fairly uncommon, which let us see how well the search element of these services worked.","For each report we purchased, we had the subjects verify the information to ensure it was as accurate as possible. We looked at email and phone numbers, addresses, assets, marriages, divorces, relatives and criminal history information in each report. We also checked to see if the information was current.","We found that most of these services did a good job with addresses, relatives and criminal history information. There was a greater variation in results when it came to finding email addresses and phone numbers, especially cell phone numbers. The information did vary depending on how much our subjects shared on their social media profile. In some cases the service couldn’t provide any information.","Many people search services are adopting a subscription model. These usually provide unlimited searches, though some operate on a credit model. We like services that give you the option to buy individual reports, since you may only be interested in information about a single person.","The pricing we included is the non-promotional price. Many services offer promotional pricing that discounts reports if you sign up for a trial during checkout.","The single reports are usually sparse, containing only address and contact information. An expanded report increase in cost but they contain all the information the people search company can provide.","<strong>How to conduct a name search with a people finder</strong>","When using a people search, we found that the more information you can provide about the person the easier it is to find them. If you’re conducting a name search for someone with a common name, it is best to provide as much additional information as possible to narrow down the search. This extra information can be as simple as adding middle names, cities, states or ages to the people finder to reduce the search time. Most services have filters that let you narrow your results.","<strong>What is a people search service? </strong>","People search services aren’t licensed as consumer reporting agencies. This means the reports can’t be used to make decisions about hiring, lending or renting. For this information you would need to conduct a <a href=\"/best-background-check-services\">background check</a> not a people search. That doesn’t mean people search services aren’t useful. We spoke to Shawn Siegal from BeenVerified to learn more about how these services are used.","According to Mr. Siegal, people search services are used is to reconnect with a lost friend, family member or professional acquaintance. They can also be useful for checking out blind dates or potential business partners.","Running a search on yourself is another way to use these services. This is a good opportunity to see what information someone else can see about you. Most services also offer a way to flag information as inaccurate, which helps the service tighten its data matching and provide anyone looking for you with the right information.","Of course, you can learn a lot about a person from their social media accounts. We asked Mr. Siegal how people search services differ from social media. He told us a people search report can give you a clearer view of someone, while social media accounts present a filtered version of a person. Additionally, many older people aren’t on social media, so using people search services is a good way to find them.","<strong>What to do after a successful people search</strong>","A <a href=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2010/05/26/reputation-management-and-social-media/\">Pew Research Center</a> survey found that about 46 percent of those who use people search services are trying to reconnect with old friends, estranged family members, lost business associates or former flames.

This shifts the search results from website text to images. In this search, it&#39;s easy to scan through hundreds of pictures to see if you recognize the person you’re searching for. If you find the person, you can follow the image to the website by clicking on the image.","<strong>Finding people using Facebook</strong>","Facebook is the largest social media platform in the world with 2.2 billion active monthly users. Nearly 1 in 3 people on the planet have a Facebook profile and actively use it, making the chances of finding someone very high. In fact, the chances are even higher in the U.S. where 62-percent of the men and 74-percent of the women are on Facebook, according to a <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/\">Pew Research fact sheet</a>.","The best place to start is with the “Find Friends” feature next to the home button. This provides a list of people you may already know. You can scan through the profiles to see if you recognize the person you’re looking for. The list of recommended friends is never ending. As long as you scroll on the page, new profiles appear.","If you’re not having any luck searching this way, you can search for the person using the search bar at the top of the interface. This provides a list of people with the same and similar names. To the right of the interface are tools for filtering the results by city, school, work and mutual friends.","However, if all this fails to produce the person you’re searching for, the final step is to try and find people who might know the person as well - other friends, co-workers, relatives. If you can find this other connection, they might have the information you need to find the person you’re looking for.","<strong>Finding people on LinkedIn</strong>","Since LinkedIn is aimed at professional networking, it is ideal for finding coworkers or business associates. That said, it is also an effective tool for reconnecting with old college or high school friends. In many ways, it is easier to find people on LinkedIn than Facebook and other social media platforms because LinkedIn profiles are meant to be outward facing – people who sign up want to be found for professional networking and job searching, so they’re less likely to be strict with their privacy settings. Still, only about 25 percent of the U.S. population has a LinkedIn profile, and less than 10 percent of people over 65 years old are on it.","Finding people for free on LinkedIn starts under the My Network tab. At first glance, the page lists profiles recommended for you based on the information in your profile –schools you’ve attended, industries you&#39;ve worked in, companies you’ve worked for, mutual connections and interests. As such, you’re more likely to find people if your profile is complete with as much information about your professional and academic life as possible.","Similar to Facebook and other social media sites, the page features an infinite scroll that continually updates with new profiles as you scroll. However, for a more efficient search, you can enter the person’s name into the search bar and use a dropdown filter tool to narrow the results according to location, industries, interests, companies, languages and schools.<br/><strong><br/>Finding an old High School friend</strong>","It&#39;s common for people to search for their high school friends, particularly as they get older. However, it can be difficult to find old classmates, especially as you drift further from your teenage years. Friends move away to college, start families, change names and get lost in careers. While a people search service is an excellent way to find your best buddy from high school, there is an even better tool – <a href=\"http://www.classmates.com\">Classmates.com</a>.","Owned by PeopleConnect, Inc., the same company that owns Intelius, Classmates is the largest database of school yearbooks online, and it is truly impressive. The yearbooks are scanned, page by page, into a searchable database. You can view the yearbooks as much as you want for free, and you can order hardcover versions for about $100 each. Some yearbooks date back to the early 1900s – I found my grandmother’s 1940 yearbook from a small farm town in Safford, Arizona. ","Classmates is also an excellent resource for finding out about reunions or for scheduling reunions yourself. You can invite all your classmates, so long as they’re registered and tagged in the graduating year. You can also leave messages and share memories and news about deceased classmates.   ","While you can register for free and view as many yearbook photos and classmates as you want, you must pay for a subscription to connect with classmates. That said, a Classmate&#39;s subscription costs between $1.50 and $2.50 per month, compared to $25 to $50 per month for a people search service subscription.","<strong>How do you search for someone using a picture?</strong>","You might be able to find the person you’re looking for without paying for a people search report using Google&#39;s reverse image search feature. To use this tool, you upload or drag and drop a digital photo into the search bar on <a href=\"https://images.google.com/\">images.google.com</a>. You have the best chance of finding the person if the picture is already online because Google searches for image tags and file descriptions matching the image you uploaded. However, if the image isn’t already online, it provides images similar to the one you’re searching for. You might find the person you’re looking for through a similar image, but it’s not easy.","To test this, I uploaded a bunch of photos of myself that I took with my phone, so the images weren’t already online with image tags and descriptions. An image of myself while hiking resulted in similar images of people hiking. It also resulted in websites for musicians and a Wikipedia page describing what a mountain is. I had the same issue when I uploaded an image of myself working out in a gym – images of people in gyms and links to weightlifting sites appeared. In other words, you might get lucky, but it’s best to treat reverse image search as a last resort.","<strong>Can I find family using a DNA testing service?</strong>","Whether you’re an adoptee interested in finding your biological parents or someone trying to reconnect with an estranged family member, DNA testing services are quickly becoming a very popular option for finding relatives. In 2017, the market for DNA testing services exploded with more than twice as many people having their DNA tested for genealogy purposes than all previous years combined, according to the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610233/2017-was-the-year-consumer-dna-testing-blew-up/\">MIT Technology Review</a>. In addition, the number of DNA testing companies has exploded from just a handful to over thirty.  ","With DNA databases continually growing, it’s becoming much easier to track down genetic relatives. That said, it does require a significant amount of luck, as there isn’t a single shared database. Rather, to find a relative through these services, your relative has to have had their DNA tested and must also have chosen the same service. And since AncestryDNA still has the largest database (over 10 million), they are your best bet for finding a match.","With <a href=\"https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/US-AncestryDNA-for-Adoptees-Search-Strategies\">AncestryDNA</a>, your DNA results are compared and matched to others in the service’s database. In your online profile, you can view these matches, including the relationship type, whether the match is a parent, sibling, first cousin, second cousin and so on. Through this portal, you can send messages to matches, though Ancestry urges you to take caution in how you reach out. Not everyone wants to be contacted, and there are even some potential legal implications with contacting an adopted child or parent. So before you reach out with a message, it’s important to be sensitive to the situation and carefully consider potential repercussions.","Read more: ","<a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">Best DNA testing kit</a>","<strong>Should I hire a private investigator to find someone?</strong>","If people search services don’t help you find the person you’re looking for, hiring a private investigator is the next option. According to Brian Willingham from the <a href=\"https://diligentiagroup.com/legal-investigation/can-a-private-investigator-find-someone/\">Diligentia Group</a>, private investigators can find just about anyone, as it’s among their core skills. However, the bigger question he urges you to ask is why you want to find them. Just because a PI can find almost anyone doesn’t mean they will agree to it.","In addition to being bound by state and federal laws about the kinds of information they can share, PI’s are likely to vet your intentions before agreeing to take on your account. They need to make sure they understand your motivations for finding the person to limit their liability. Willingham argues it’s one thing to wish to reconnect with an old friend or a biological parent, but it’s something else entirely to look for an old flame or ex-spouse. As such, Willingham says the best private investigators will contact the person they’ve been hired to find to ask if they are fine with having their client contact them – the PI only passes the information along once the person agrees. ","The next question to ask yourself before hiring a private investigator is how much you are willing to spend to find the person. While people search services can cost upward of $40 a month, a private investigator can cost many times that an hour. This is because you’re paying for their expertise and their access to information consumers don’t have. And the result is costly. For example, the Diligentia Group charges a $750 flat fee retainer. That said, private investigators typically have a high success rate and a fast turnaround time, so if you’re desperate to find the person you’re looking for, be prepared to pay for it.","<strong>Why is the fair credit &amp; reporting act important?</strong>","<a href=\"https://www.nclc.org/images/pdf/pr-reports/broken-records-report.pdf\">Broken Records</a>, a National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) report on using people search services to perform background checks, shares the story of Samuel M. Jackson, who was denied employment based on a misattributed felony conviction. The error listed the felony as occurring when Jackson was just four years old. In reality, the error occurred because Jackson shares a similar name to the actual felon.","Such egregious inaccuracies, according to the NCLC report, are widespread with people search services because there is an “industry-wide lack of accountability” and a very big incentive to “cut corners” in how information is collected and attributed. This makes using the reports these services sell problematic, and illegal, for employment screening purposes. ","As the NCLC research shows, since these services are subscription-based, anyone willing to pay the monthly fee can view an unlimited amount of background information on as many people as they want. While we don&#39;t expect you to use people search services to screen applicants, this subscription model combined with a lack of accountability makes it an extremely tempting and affordable background checking tool, especially for small businesses looking to save every penny.","Each service we reviewed has a version of the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/545a_fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf\">Fair Credit and Reporting Act</a> disclaimer on its website, but these disclaimers do little to stop you from using the reports to determine employment eligibility.

Of the reported identity theft cases in 2014, 86 percent were account takeovers and 4 percent were identity takeovers. The remaining percentage experienced multiple types of identity theft.","Account takeover is the most common form of identity theft and occurs when someone uses your financial information to make purchases or gains access to an account and locks you out.
