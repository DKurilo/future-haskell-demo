There is definitely enough overlap to make it worth investigating. The results were unsurprising, since it does make fruits and vegetables drinkable. This Nutri Ninja doesn’t make juice in the traditional sense but it makes a great smoothie. Which is a bonus because the <a href=\"/best-juicers\">traditional juicers</a> we compared it to can’t make a great smoothie.","We didn’t give it a good score on for juicing, as it’s bad at making juice. You have to strain it multiple times to get any amount of traditional juice. But we liked it for making smoothies. There are many nutrition experts that recommend drinking the pulp rather than just the juice.","There is an inherent ease-of-use with a unit like this. You blend in the same cup you drink from so you have just one dish to clean. Also, it is much more compact than a traditional juicer so you don’t sacrifice a ton of countertop real estate. There are also some less user-friendly aspects. This is not like the traditional juicers that can tackle whole fruits. With this machine you have to remove seeds and cut everything into very small pieces. Also it was very loud.","One extra claim with this unit is that its FreshVac tool makes the final smoothie even more nutrient-dense, as the nutrients remain longer. You add fruits and vegetables to the cup, seal them in with the blade, suck out air with the FreshVac and then blend as normal.","We can’t test the nutrients remaining in the FreshVac-ed smoothie verses the normal one but if this makes a smoothie more palatable and nutritious the next morning it’s worth the effort, especially since it doesn’t cost more. This personal blender is still less than $100, right in line with others we tested. With it, you could make your morning smoothie the night before and save time, since you have more confidence that the smoothie still tastes right and isn’t ruined by oxidation the next morning."]},"id":"f59cc82d-c29d-4994-ba23-632e46644eb5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70389","url":"/nutri-ninja-with-freshvac-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-21T22:22:48Z","datePublished":"2019-03-21T22:22:48Z","name":"Nutri Ninja with FreshVac","synopsis":"The Nutri Ninja with FreshVac is more of a blender than a juicer, but we were curious how it compares to traditional juicers.
