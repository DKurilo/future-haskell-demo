The hard metal casing, which houses the amplifier and the dual internal CPU, gives it one of the most durable builds among the cell phone boosters we reviewed. You can install this in your trunk, under a seat or in the glove compartment. It has the most powerful amplifier for a vehicle cell phone booster allowed by law, but it lacks 4G compatibility. If you need a device that does support 4G, try the <a href=\"/surecall-triflex2go-review\">SureCall TriFlex2Go</a>.","The best feature of the Flex2Go cell phone booster is the amount of control it gives you over the frequency bands and the gain. You can tune the two frequency bands, 800MHz and 1,900Mhz, to adjust specifically to the strongest signal available or to the frequency your phone uses. You can also manually adjust the gain. However, so much control can also be a problem if you&#39;re a novice. For this reason, it has an Auto Gain Control setting that adjusts the gain automatically according to the strength of outside signals, which is how most cell phone signal boosters operate.","The cell phone signal amplifier has a maximum gain of 50 dB, which is the highest allowed by law for a vehicle device. This gives it the necessary wireless range for sedans, trucks, vans and RVs.","The biggest downside to the Flex2Go is the lack of a 4G frequency band. The two frequency bands boost 3G and 2G frequencies. It also has an above-average noise figure of 5 dB, which means that there&#39;s more unwanted noise within the amplified signal than there is with most cell phone boosters. For example, the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-4g-m-review\">weBoost Drive 4G-M</a> has a noise figure of 3 dB.","The outside antenna is 12 inches. It&#39;s omnidirectional, which allows it to receive signals from all directions, and it has a high forward gain of 5 dBi. Most cell phone booster antennas have a forward gain of 2.62 dBi. This means that the Flex2Go&#39;s pickup range is much longer than average, which makes it ideal for rural areas where fewer obstacles block the signals."]},"id":"7a2e9af8-13fe-4ecf-a6b0-ff1717a81f9e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54f6e5e3-d543-4aa1-834a-f47f71dc8f52","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SureCall Flex2Go is one of the few cell phone boosters that gives you complete control over the frequency band tuning and gain, though you can just as easily set it to adjust automatically.
