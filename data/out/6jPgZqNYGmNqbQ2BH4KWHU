You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Bachmann Rail Chief <a href=\"/best-train-sets\">train set</a> comes with an EMD GP40 replica locomotive, a hopper, a gondola, box car and caboose. The EMD GP40 is a locomotive that was in mass production from 1965 to 1971. Even though they are no longer being manufactured, many are still in use today.","The set is an HO-scale model, which is smaller than both G- and O-scale models, but is considered the most popular train size by model train enthusiasts. The locomotive does not make noise or puff smoke like the <a href=\"/lionel-pennsylvania-flyer-freight-train-review\">Lionel Pennsylvania Flyer</a>, but it has a working headlight.","This model train set comes with 12 curved tracks, one straight track and one terminal piece that powers the track. When assembled, the track is 47 inches long and 38 inches wide. The E-Z snap-together track pieces fit well, and you can assemble them within a matter of minutes. However, you have to make sure you don&#39;t push the ends together too hard or else the metal rails become uneven and your train won&#39;t stay on the tracks. The E-Z snap tracks are the simplest tracks to assemble compared to the rest of the model train sets we reviewed.","We assessed all the model trains to look for any build or paint flaws. Unlike the other Bachmann trains we reviewed, none of the wheels fell off the train cars. The locomotive displayed some small paint chips on the front on the yellow paint strip, just below the window. There was also a small black paint smudge on the window of the locomotive that we could not wipe off. There were also some tiny paint chips below Western Fruit Express in which the black paint was coming through the yellow. Other than those small details, the locomotive looked good, but not to the paint quality of our best model trains.","What separates this train set from many others is the number of included accessories it comes with. This Bachmann train set comes with 48 figurines, 36 telephone poles, 48 road signs and a signal bridge. These accessories add to the scenery of your train set, allowing you to create a miniature world and adding to the fun for both adults and children."]},"id":"8b48cc82-8374-4625-91d4-5d1d7e7a952d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9ec4377d-40d8-4775-932f-441fac964866","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bachmann Rail Chief train set has easy-to-assemble tracks that you can expand later.
