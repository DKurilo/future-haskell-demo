You can go to Leawo&#39;s website and buy the program, but what you&#39;re actually downloading is Leawo Blu-ray copy. And while you get the additional Blu-ray copying functionality, this program omits some of the key features we looked for in the best <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software for Mac</a>.","The program itself is quite simple to use. All you have to do to start the copying process is load the original disc into the interface. Once that&#39;s completed, the program gives you three copy options: Full Movie, Main Movie and Custom Mode.","Full movie will copy the entire DVD onto a new disc. Main Movie strips away everything except the feature presentation, and Custom Mode lets you pick and choose what content you want to burn onto a blank DVD. Anyone with even basic computer skills should be able to figure out how to use these options with very few problems.","Once you&#39;ve selected the copy mode you want, click Copy to begin the process. In our tests, it took this Mac DVD copier 45 minutes to make an exact duplicate of our test DVD. This is among the fastest times we recorded during the testing phase. Only two other programs in our lineup beat this time.","This program also allows you to copy a DVD&#39;s raw files onto your hard drive. You can choose to save a disc&#39;s ISO image or Video_TS folder onto your computer. Either of these files are excellent archiving tools that allow you to burn new copies of your DVD without needing the original disc. It&#39;s also great for digitally archiving your movie library on an external hard drive.","Probably the biggest disappointment with the switch from Leawo DVD Copy to Blu-ray Copy is the loss of the ability to compress a commercial disc to fit onto a smaller-capacity blank DVD-5. This means that if you want to copy an entire DVD movie with menus, bonus features and all, you must use the more expensive DVD-9s."]},"id":"a256fb42-08ce-466e-b4c6-a9e1399c78d5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"398038c8-cac7-4b6b-996e-2c8147975b34","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite the confusion caused by its name change, Leawo Blu-ray Copy is a fine choice for Mac DVD copy software.
