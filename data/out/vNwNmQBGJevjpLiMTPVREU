They&#39;re typically used by enthusiasts looking for valuables hidden in soil or sand, but they can be used by professionals looking for specific objects. Typical metal detectors include the <a href=\"/teknetics-delta-4000-review\">Teknetics Delta 4000</a>, the <a href=\"/bounty-hunter-review\">Bounty Hunter Discovery 3300</a> and the <a href=\"/bounty-hunter-quick-silver-review\">1st Texas Titan 9000 Pro Plus</a>.","<strong>Professional Metal Detectors: What to Look For</strong>","Metal detectors work in one of three ways: very low frequency, pulse induction or beat frequency oscillation. Pulse induction tends to be very sensitive and can work in very wet environments, but it&#39;s not great at discriminating between metals. Beat frequency oscillation is the simplest and cheapest technology, but it&#39;s also the least effective. Very low frequency has a wide range of uses, and it can use phase discrimination to ignore small pieces of junk.","<strong>Weight and Size</strong><br/>Weight is a critical aspect of any metal detector, as the heavier it is, the harder it is to use over larger areas. The best metal detectors are made from lightweight materials that ensure user comfort hour after hour. Size is another important factor. Bigger metal detectors are better for adults; smaller detectors are better for children.","<strong>Sensitivity and Depth</strong><br/>The sensitivity or depth of an all-purpose metal detector determines how far away from which it can detect metal and the type of metal it can detect. The more sensitive the metal detector is, the better it can detect smaller quantities of metal and the further away it can detect them from. A metal detector always performs better when the object it&#39;s trying to pick up is above soil than when it is in the soil.","<strong>Discrimination</strong><br/>Discrimination refers to the ability of the metal detector to ignore certain types of object in favor of the objects you&#39;re searching for. This is particularly useful when you&#39;re prospecting for specific metals, as trash can often lead to you getting excited about a pull tab from a beer can. Naturally, the better the discrimination, the higher the price usually is, and specialized gold metal detectors tend to be the most costly.","<strong>Durability</strong><br/>Durability is key to any all-purpose metal detector, as it sees a lot of use outside. Rugged metal detectors are often slightly heavier, but they can typically withstand more drops and shocks than more lightweight models made with the same materials.","Metal detecting is a hobby that can lead to many exciting finds, but it pays to have the right tools for the job. Finding the right one at the right price increases your chances of finding what you&#39;re looking for."]},"id":"b463e52c-04c4-4e1b-a95b-5536f34106d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"59d7db51-4d94-4bec-a66b-b02cb2dc8b5c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.kellycodetectors.com/titan/titan-9000pro-plus-buy.php\">1st Texas Titan</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00845EME8/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61482[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Bounty Hunter Discovery</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W3T5QK/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61483[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Fisher</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00095ODBI/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61486[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Garrett Ace</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3JISW4/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61484[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Garrett ATX</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AAJK1FA/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61487[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Minelab X-Terra</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EN3UHQC/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61480[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Teknetics Delta</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CP1Z8O/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61489[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tesoro</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MCHBIS2/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61488[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">White&#39;s MXT</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HSM6TJ4/?tag=ttr_professional-metal-detectors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1290[art|NA[pid|61485[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">XP Deus</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"61150334-6e9c-4f0b-a9eb-cf633383e4b8","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1290","url":"/best-professional-metal-detectors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-26T21:49:57Z","datePublished":"2017-03-16T16:39:54Z","name":"Professional Metal Detectors Review","synopsis":"Metal detecting is a hobby that gets you outside and enjoying nature, and finding the right metal detector is a key part of it.
