It lacks most of the navigation features found in the other bike GPS units we tested. However, it offers ANT+ sensor compatibility, which allows it to be paired with a variety of sensors for optimal monitoring. It can also perform all of the essential GPS-enabled functions that a cycling computer should.","Its GPS receiver enables it to display your speed, distance traveled and altitude. It has three sections on the screen that you can customize to display the metric of your choice. In contrast to premium bike computers, which have color touchscreens, the Stealth Evo+ has a monochromatic screen that uses buttons to control the interface.","Its biggest weakness is its nearly complete lack of navigational features. This means you can’t expect live GPS tracking, map detail support or turn-by-turn navigation functionality while you’re riding. Most of the cycle computers we reviewed have most or all of these abilities.","The bike computer is water resistant to IPX7 standards, which means it can withstand submersion in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. Its battery life is rated for 10 hours, which is among the lowest battery life expectancies that we’ve seen in a bike GPS unit. If you’re a cyclist who regularly goes on short or half-day rides, this may not be an issue for you. However, if you enjoy all-day rides, you might want to consider a device with a better battery. Like all bike GPS units, the battery of the Stealth Evo+ is built in, so you can’t bring along a replacement battery.","The main benefit of this cycling computer is that it enables you to track your process as a cyclist. The easiest way to do that is to upload the ride data from the Stealth Evo+ to an online training program such as Strava. These programs superimpose your ride over a map so you can analyze your performance using metrics such as your average speed, distance traveled and altitude gained."]},"id":"eaf7949a-b1e5-4da6-9e8a-4bc52ad63776","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5d537749-4fc7-4d9c-9337-59065cea907c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though it lacks multiple navigation features and a decent battery life capacity, the CatEye Stealth Evo+ does cover all the essentials.
