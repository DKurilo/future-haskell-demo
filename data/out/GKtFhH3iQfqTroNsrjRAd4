Bolding and italicizing are available, but you can also choose stagger, tilt and wild to add a little fun to your text. The rudimentary Word Art editor is impressive, allowing you to manipulate many features in the preloaded design schemes. Nova Development designed the options in the editor to be very easy to understand, making the word art function a high point.","But be aware, a bug was discovered during testing. The program has a tendency to crash after cycling through multiple fonts consecutively. We’re sure this kink can be ironed out with updates in the future.","Print Explosion Deluxe keeps in mind that not everyone immediately understands the complexities of some projects. Therefore, for each project, the images you create are arranged on the paper for folding and flipping beforehand. They even wait for you to reinsert the printed product for double-sided projects, making the whole process much more easygoing and friendly to a novice user.","This software makes it extremely clear that the bulk of the price for this program is represented by the extensive clip art and project templates. The breadth of variety in the templates is impressive, as you will be able to quickly turn out dozens of impressive projects for almost any situation. From t-shirts and certificates, to business cards and fax letterheads, the templates look nice and are fun to use. The provided clip art also has a lot of variety. 54 categories and their sub-categories give you lots of great images to browse through to find the one that’s just right for your project."]},"id":"9ff264b3-890c-4040-b1af-477567cacb2d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Editing Tools"},"id":"f36ffeed-85f4-4e5a-b663-bb7ee8f98fd0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Print Explosion Deluxe isn’t the type of Mac greeting card software that really allows you to get down to the details of image manipulation.
