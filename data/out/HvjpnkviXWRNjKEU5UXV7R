The television talk-show host has been promoting this blender-style juicer for many years through infomercials.","This juicer is an excellent option if you want to multitask with your juicer. You can grind grains, dice onions, knead dough, make blender drinks, grate cheese and much more. You can also juice with it – sort of. We got low yields of juice with the Montel Williams juicer compared to others. That was after we ran the blended juice through a sieve, though. If you don&#39;t mind pulp, you get plenty of juice; it&#39;s just really thick. Most experts argue that leaving the pulp in is better for you anyway, though, and you get used to it the more you drink it.","This is one of only two machines that shut down in the course of our juicer reviews. We had to wait about 30 minutes for it to come back on. That happened when testing it on hard produce like beets and carrots, which makes it more difficult to recommend the HealthMaster as a juicer. Being able to power through hard or soft produce should be the minimum requirement for any juicer. This juice maker did eventually manage to break down the hard produce, but only with extra time. Some competing products did not even hesitate on the beets and carrots.","This juicer runs louder than all but one of the units we compared, which is something to consider if you like to make juice before your family wakes up. It&#39;s also a bit unstable on the countertop, tending to slip around a bit.","One of the wonders of this blender-style mixer is the speedy and simple assembly, even the first time out of the box. Once everything is unwrapped and washed, you can just put the pitcher in place and start juicing with the HealthMaster. You do have to cut up the fruit a little bit more than you would with the centrifugal units, though. We had to chop just about everything we juiced with the HealthMaster, because there is not enough room around the blade to place whole fruits and vegetables. All that cutting adds significant time to the preparation process."]},"id":"f1bafb88-f472-4b58-afff-dc3cc84fefe6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6ebdb82b-cdec-46e3-9bdc-d96858bc4773","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Living Well Montel HealthMaster offers a way to liquefy whole vegetables, leaving all of the nutritious pulp in the final juice.

You can use it for all sorts of food processing tasks, like making soups, ice cream and salad dressings."]},"id":"ae32ad7a-97c1-4d68-859d-a43a62670dbe","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62848","url":"/healthmaster-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-19T16:41:21Z","datePublished":"2015-02-19T16:41:21Z","name":"HealthMaster YD-2088E","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":58,"verdict":"If you like pulp in your juice, this is a good option, but it isn&#039;t that tough for a juicer.","pros":["Assembly takes seconds, not minutes."],"cons":["The HealthMaster struggled on the hardest produce, like beets and carrots.
