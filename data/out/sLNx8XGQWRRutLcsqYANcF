It effectively removes moisture in the air; however, it uses a significant amount of energy given its small capacity.","LG’s dehumidifier removes up to 65 pints of water from your home within a 24-hour period. While it is capable of removing a high amount of moisture from the air, it is intended for smaller rooms. The dehumidifier is designed for areas up to 600 square feet. Anything larger than that and it will have difficulty meeting your desired level of humidity. The unit’s collection reservoir holds 21 pints of water. The large bucket will lessen the number of times you have to empty it.","This dehumidifier lags behind others in features. It does not have continuous draining capabilities or a pump. The only way to remove water from your unit is by emptying the bucket. Since it is only intended for smaller rooms, the amount of water it collects should be less than other models. The unit has a full-bucket alert that notifies you when you need to remove water.","This particular unit works well in low temperatures and could be used as a basement dehumidifier. The unit works best in temperatures that are 42 degrees Fahrenheit and above. The digital display controls all of the features and the humidistat. You can set the dehumidifier to the desired level of humidity, and it will continuously keep your room at that level. The model also features several automatic capabilities. The dehumidifier will automatically restart, shut off and defrost depending on conditions. There&#39;s also a timer that will control how long the machine runs.","LG’s dehumidifier also includes a removable air filter that cleans the air while it removes humidity from your room, and you never have to replace it. You simply remove it, clean it and put it back in the unit. The dehumidifier has a two-speed fan. The low-speed fan dehumidifies the area at a slower rate, but it also is much quieter than the higher speed. The high-speed fan uses more energy and is much louder. However, if you need to remove excess moisture at a fast rate, it will do that.","Even though this dehumidifier is designed to operate in a small area, it uses a substantial amount of energy. The 65-pint dehumidifier uses 710 watts when in use. It lacks an Energy Star certification, which is a good indication that it will make an impact on your energy bills and the environment. The dehumidifier comes with a one-year warranty.","LG’s dehumidifier is a large model. It weighs almost 50 pounds and has wide dimensions. It doesn&#39;t offer continuous draining, but you can place it anywhere in your home; however, keep in mind that you have to carry a bucket of water to a drain. The dehumidifier does have four caster wheels, which improves its mobility substantially. The unit comes in a sleek black design that will blend into the room without notice."]},"id":"c311fc87-d6f6-413f-9bdb-fc9217d77b05","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"13541cd0-ba46-4b4d-a71f-2cc2c0a002f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG LD651EBL is an effective dehumidifier in removing excess moisture from small living areas.
