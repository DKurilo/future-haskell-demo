You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This unique teaching toy consists of several round containers that are connected by tubes to make a three-dimensional grouping of ant environments. The Wild Science Ant-O-Sphere includes eight plastic pods, which you can take apart and put together again. These small areas serve as home for the ants. Along with the pods, you get three bases and 18 supports.","This <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">ant farm</a> uses sand as the medium for the ants&#39; living environment, which means any child who gets this as a gift needs to make sure to periodically put small bits of food and droplets of water inside so the ants have the nourishment and fluids necessary to keep them alive. In this regard, the Ant-O-Sphere is a good choice since it engages children in caring for the ants. Nonetheless, the entire device differs so much from ants&#39; natural habitat that the educational value is quite limited.","Make no mistake: This toy is visually appealing and fun in its modernistic construction. However, children cannot really see how ants act in a habitat that is more like the ones they would encounter outdoors.","The pods come as clear or red in color, which is intended to replicate the above ground and underground atmosphere for the ants. The manufacturer says the red areas make it so the ants perceive that they are in the dark and cannot see you, but you can still see them. There also are magnifying lenses that look at each corner so you can look at the ants up close.","Live ants do not come with this device. Instead, you will need to buy ants from an online store to stock your futuristic ant environment. Some stores offer free replacement ants if your first order arrives with all the ants dead, but the policies vary from one online store to another so it is best to check carefully before buying anything.","It also is possible to collect ants outside and use those in the Wild Science Ant-O-Sphere. If you search carefully and are lucky, you can capture a queen ant and some males, which means the ants can reproduce and the colony can undergo a complete life cycle. A queen will lay the eggs while the males exist mainly to reproduce with the queen and then die. Meanwhile, worker ants that do not reproduce will attend to the eggs, dig tunnels and move waste of any kind – including dead ants – to a designated area.","Children will probably need some adult help assembling this unusually designed ant habitat. After that, you add the sand that is included with the kit into the small pods to make places for the ants to live. This comes with an instruction booklet. When the eight-pod device is fully assembled it is 16 inches high, 16 inches wide and four inches deep. It weighs 4.2 pounds."]},"id":"5d6cd827-7219-49f9-bb96-ca7e009a51da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8628ceb2-c94f-454b-bed2-1c8c03618920","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although this is a unique and visually appealing toy, it is lacking in educational value because, despite the manufacturer&#39;s claims to the contrary, its exceptional design means children will not get to see ants in an environment that mimics their natural habitat."]},"id":"d5ead21f-da78-4937-ba8a-62b2362e720c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55341","url":"/wild-science-ant-o-sphere-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-07T15:25:25Z","datePublished":"2012-11-07T15:25:25Z","name":"Wild Science Ant-O-Sphere","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":42,"verdict":"This unusual ant farm is certainly attractive and children might enjoy seeing it, but it does not replicate the type of environment that ants would inhabit in nature.
