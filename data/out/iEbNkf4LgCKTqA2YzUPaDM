It also shows tips on the screen that you can scroll through. The screen is badly designed and you can&#39;t read the text because of the busy background but it&#39;s a good idea. When I clicked the Aquire button, it told me that it had detected a TWAIN device. Most people probably don&#39;t even know what that means but regardless, I didn&#39;t have a scanner or digital camera attached at all. The next series of steps are very confusing and technical. Once you open an image successfully, the main screen is divided into 4 main steps: Select Area, Correct Image, Enhance Image, Insert Text. Again, the right idea but the organization of features under these tabs is horrible. It&#39;s hard to know where to find the tools you are looking for. Some of the most important tools like red-eye is buried under several layers of tools. The tools themselves are also hard to use. Red-eye for instance, brings up a separate dialog box. Then you need to complete several steps to accomplish the task. Overall, I found it non-intuitive and frustrating trying to accomplish my objectives."]},"id":"bb03fe44-78bf-4db9-be81-246c84b1cf50","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Editing Tools"},"id":"8a0a8e3c-3827-4128-8979-1514d27281cd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can import images from a scanner or digital camera.

There is a &#34;Photo Fix&#34; wizard that will step you through fixing common mistakes. But it only fixes a tiny thumbnail in a separate window until you apply the settings. The most useful feature I found was the Auto White Balance. This will fix the color caused by poor artificial lighting common in photos.","Layers in this program are simply built-in objects, text or multiple photos that you can click on and move around and edit independently of the other objects. You can change the opacity in 3 increments (25%, 50%, or 75%) of each object but you cannot put a gradient transparency to merge the two together.","Adding text is cumbersome. You can eventually accomplish your task through several steps and trial and error. The biggest drawbacks are that you cannot have different styles of text within the same &#34;object&#34;. You have to create a different text object for every style. There are also no text effects available.","There are three ways to make selections. You can use a set of shapes, make a selection by &#34;painting&#34; the area you want to select, or use a magic wand. The magic wand tool will select a section of an image with the same range of colors. This is useful when you have a simple background you want to cut out. The customization of the magic wand is horrible. I couldn&#39;t find a lasso selection tool anywhere.","You can use batches to enhance, rotate, or convert to different file formats. In this case, a batch is simply a preset action (e.g. rotate 90 degrees clockwise) that you can apply to multiple photos at the same time. You cannot record your own sequence of actions with Photo Explosion.","The Undos are limited in this program so be careful that you don&#39;t go too far before you can&#39;t turn back."]},"id":"1cf155a5-e387-41d0-8a69-48a6df2e7905","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"06ca04cd-7267-4650-abcd-56244536bfbc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It&#39;s drawbacks are that it lacks several features of more powerful photo editors like <a href=\"/photoshop-elements-review\">Adobe Photoshop Elements 3</a>.
