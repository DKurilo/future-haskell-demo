You can also make daily, weekly or monthly menus.","After you’ve decided on menus, this recipe software will automatically compile a grocery list and group the foods according to where you will find them in the grocery store, saving you from wandering down each aisle more than once. It will also help you save money since you can skip those aisles that encourage impulse buying. The grocery list generator can also provide an estimated cost for the groceries you plan to buy."]},"id":"654bd1d3-661e-413f-876c-5d7533e6cecf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"ab37b935-0a5a-48c6-acf9-3af269682a2e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you run into any issues with the program, you can check the website&#39;s FAQs page.
