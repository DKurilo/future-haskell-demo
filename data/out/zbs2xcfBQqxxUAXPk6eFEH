However, with advances in technology, there are now noise cancelling wireless stereo headphones that have a crystal-clear sound and a large range. You can use these devices to listen to music from an MP3 player, a computer or even watch movies while everyone else in your house sleeps.","While the range on even the best wireless headphones varies, they are most reliable up to about 30 feet away from the transmitter. The transmitter plugs into the device which you are using as an audio output source, and after you turn on the wireless headphones, the connection should be instant. You will be listening to all your favorite music and movies in no time.","While the feature sets of wireless headphones vary widely, for  products with a great sound and a comprehensive feature set, check out the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Pioneer SE-DIR800C</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Sony MDR-DS6000 RF</a> models. Also, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Sennheiser RS180</a> has great sound and very reliable customer support.","<strong>Wireless Headphones: What to Look For</strong>","One of the most important factors when selecting wireless headphones is sound quality. The products can achieve an outstanding sound through a variety of factors. However, in our reviews we also take a look at how well each model performs and how comfortable and durable the earphones are so you can compare the best wireless headphones using the most effective selling points.","<strong>Performance</strong><br/>In this section we rate and rank how well the different features perform for cordless headphones. We look at how far the actual range of the devices is, not just what is advertised. Also, we test the product and listen for background noises and static.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>In this section we review the different sound options offered by each product. Many of the wireless headphones offer a 5.1 channel Dolby surround sound. This is achieved by having several drivers in the ear-cups and using them for the rear, center, front and subwoofer channels. While they are no replacement for a quality, traditional system, the surround sound wireless headphones can enhance your listening experience.","<strong>Accessories</strong><br/>In this section we look at the different options and other products that are included with the wireless headphones. Many of the products include rechargeable batteries and some include carrying cases. We make sure the product includes everything you need to begin using the earphones immediately and without effort.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>In this section we review all the different customer service options offered by the manufacturer. We look for specific avenues of support, such as telephone support lines, email addresses and frequently asked questions. We also look at each warranty offered.","Each headphone varies slightly in shape, size and quality. We have tested and reviewed them to find the most comprehensive products that offer the most options and the best sound.
