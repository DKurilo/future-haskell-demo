Its simple black or white casing wraps the dome surveillance camera, which sits on a matching black or white mount, and offers simple customization for in-home use. The camera itself has a 3.6-mm lens, with night vision capability and two-way audio for listening to and speaking with your precious ones.","Using Wi-Fi, you can easily drop in via your mobile devices, which you can also use to pan and tilt the camera. The panning feature supports horizontal movement up to 340 degrees, and the tilting lets you move 90 degrees vertically. By fully utilizing the mobile options, you can set up alerts or alarms based upon motion detection.","Tenvis’ video surveillance system offers resolution up to 640 x 480 pixels, with a maximum frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps). The camera’s infrared night vision capabilities work up to 32 feet, which means you should be able to use it in most of the rooms in your house without losing objects to darkness. With motion detection capabilities as well, the image sensors can alert you and give you a great visual of what’s going on in your home or office at any time. Like some of the other in-home surveillance cameras that have been designed with the family in mind, the Tenvis model allows you to use two-way talk options. With this technology, you can monitor sounds and speak to someone on the other end.","Tenvis’ Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision video surveillance system does a good job of going beyond the camera and capitalizing on wireless technology. You don’t have to worry about the complicated wiring of many security cameras, and the Wi-Fi compatibility gives you real-time access to your video feeds from you cell phone, tablet or laptop. The system works with both Android and Apple operating systems. You still have to handle the power adapter cord, but Tenvis recently extended it to five feet, making it more flexible to your home setup.","Like most of the surveillance cameras that market themselves as great baby monitors, the Tenvis model is designed primarily for in-home use. As such, it’s not equipped with the durability or weatherproofing of outdoor models. You can always scope out the yard from a window, but it&#39;s best to keep a pane of glass between the camera and the outdoors. This model has a lower price point than many competing cameras, so if you’re looking at getting a basic camera on a budget, this one’s worth a look."]},"id":"d1531242-28f0-4e35-af4b-5c3d5b7938bd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60750","url":"/tenvis-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-08T19:29:08Z","datePublished":"2014-10-08T19:29:08Z","name":"Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision","synopsis":"The Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision security camera provides an easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing surveillance tool for your home surveillance system.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision security camera provides an easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing surveillance tool for your home surveillance system.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-08T19:29:08Z","id":"7hkfUeD2EYfcruSRTCJLkm","meta":{"title":"Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt may be just what you are looking for in a home surveillance camera."},"products":[{"slug":"tenvis-hot-sale-pan-tilt-ip-night-vision","url":"/product/tenvis-hot-sale-pan-tilt-ip-night-vision","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:57:21Z","name":"Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:57:21Z","id":"p5rgtUm6Lvs8YQ3x2ZpzPH","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:57:21Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/R4BgbU8xwcvCCABjJKfeYU.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:57:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"60722-tenvis-hot-sale-pan-tilt-ip-night-vision-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/60722-tenvis-hot-sale-pan-tilt-ip-night-vision-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:57:21Z","id":"R4BgbU8xwcvCCABjJKfeYU","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R4BgbU8xwcvCCABjJKfeYU.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt may be just what you are looking for in a home surveillance camera."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/R4BgbU8xwcvCCABjJKfeYU.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:57:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"60722-tenvis-hot-sale-pan-tilt-ip-night-vision-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/60722-tenvis-hot-sale-pan-tilt-ip-night-vision-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:57:21Z","id":"R4BgbU8xwcvCCABjJKfeYU","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R4BgbU8xwcvCCABjJKfeYU.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt IP Night Vision Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Tenvis Hot Sale Pan/Tilt may be just what you are looking for in a home surveillance camera."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/tenvis-review","label":"","tags":[]}
