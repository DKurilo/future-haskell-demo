The Michelin Defender LTX M/S is an excellent light-truck tire that combines long tread life with smooth performance. This tire is also covered with a six-year, 70,000-mile limited warranty. If you are looking to try out a similar tire, the <a href=\"/continental-crosscontact-lx20-ecoplus-review\">Continental CrossContact LX20</a> offers a 60-day trial period that allows you to return the tires if you don&#39;t like them.","Light-truck tires are designed for vehicles that primarily drive on paved surfaces such as freeways but require more traction and hauling capability than regular automobile tires have. The Defender LTX M/S can be used on light and midsized pickups and sport utility vehicles as well as on commercial vans, cabs and shuttles. The tire&#39;s internal structure includes twin steel belts that provide the strength and durability to handle the heavy loads you need to transport.","Michelin tires have a reputation of durability, and the Defender LTX M/S lives up to it. This truck tire&#39;s tread pattern is made from Michelin Evertread, which is a strong, advanced compound that holds up to tough conditions longer than most tire compounds. The four wide circumferential channels, multiple lateral grooves and open shoulder slots enhance the tire&#39;s traction and stopping performance on wet roads by smoothly expelling water from the sides. If you need a more rugged tire for snowy or rocky conditions, we recommend the <a href=\"/bfgoodrich-review\">BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A KM2</a>.","The Michelin LTX M/S combines a smooth, quiet ride with good traction in dry, wet and wintry conditions, even in light snow. This makes it an excellent year-round tire for light trucks, vans and SUVs."]},"id":"d4f25dc4-de18-487b-b0e8-3f1417f6696d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67970","url":"/michelin-defender-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-13T17:33:20Z","datePublished":"2016-06-13T17:33:20Z","name":"Michelin Defender LTX MS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":35,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-06-13T17:33:20Z","id":"bjBFoeML49SwvBMh5ip3PA","meta":{"title":"Michelin Defender LTX MS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Michelin Defender LTX M/S is designed for light trucks, SUVs and vans.
