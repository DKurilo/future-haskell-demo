You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Piper is a sleek and modern <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">DIY home security system</a> ideal for minimalists. The system differs from conventional DIY alarm systems with its all-in-one device. Most systems are composed of individual accessories and peripherals, but the Piper is a camera, motion detector, siren and environmental sensors combined in a single, compact package. Thus, the Piper is an excellent choice if you’re seeking value and a minimalist approach to DIY home security.","Piper works by connecting to your smartphone and home Wi-Fi network. You control the system using the Piper app, which is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. You can opt to receive notifications of security events by phone, email, text message or a combination of all three.","Users of this DIY security system seem most impressed with the multi-functionality of the Piper device. Its built-in camera has a 180-degree lens and 1080p recording capability. Its environmental sensors can detect motion and changes in temperature, humidity, light and sound. It also has a loud 105-decibel siren that will sound if the system is armed and triggered.","The video and recording function of this unit seems particularly useful. You can view live video streams on your phone, which is ideal if you have caretakers in your home when you are not there. If the system is triggered when you are away, Piper automatically records a 25-second video clip that is streamed to the app.","A single device may seem inadequate to secure an entire house but you can extend the security of this system by pairing multiple Piper devices for use in different rooms or designated zones in your home. The manufacturer even sells a house kit with multiple Piper devices. You can also augment your system with Z-Wave accessories, such as window and door sensors, range extenders and a smart switch that enables you to control lights and appliances remotely.","Piper provides excellent value in DIY home security, particularly for smaller homes and apartments. It offers a much more conservative and stark approach compared to a la carte security systems, but its multi-functionality and sleek design outshine much of the competition. "]},"id":"174af550-1d30-4834-89d8-f04d6bbbc1a1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58900","url":"/piper-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-24T17:14:21Z","datePublished":"2014-02-24T17:14:21Z","name":"Piper","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
