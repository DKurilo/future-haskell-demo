If you are new to eCommerce, understanding how an online shopping cart works is crucial, and can mean the difference between a profitable and struggling eCommerce business. Here we&#39;ll explain in layman&#39;s terms what full-featured shopping cart software entails, how it integrates with a payment processor and why it may be the only eCommerce solution you need to launch your website.","<strong>Basic vs. Full-Featured Shopping Carts</strong>","Similar to a physical shopping cart, a virtual one allows online shoppers to accumulate a list of items to purchase on an eCommerce website. Upon checkout, the software typically calculates a customer&#39;s total cost, including any applicable taxes and shipping fees. Shopping cart software is the online equivalent of a physical point-of-sale terminal   think a credit card machine   in a brick-and-mortar store. Basic eCommerce shopping carts typically only provide the rudimentary functions of product accumulation and cost calculation.","In contrast, full-featured shopping cart software constitutes an all-in-one eCommerce solution that provides most, if not all, of the components you need to build and run an online storefront. If you are starting your online business from scratch, you will need website design, inventory management controls, order tracking and marketing tools to get your site up and running. The best shopping cart software provides all these functions and more, giving you one centralized location from which you can manage every facet of your site. Most applications even offer integration with accounting software and social media networks so you can access this information directly in your site&#39;s back office.","<strong>Payment Gateway Integration vs. In-House Payment Processing</strong>","If you want to accept credit cards on your website, you will need a merchant account and a payment gateway, or a third-party payment processor. A merchant account is a type of bank account you hold as a merchant; funds from approved credit card transactions are deposited into this account. A payment gateway is a service that provides secure transmission and authorization of such transactions to your merchant account. Payment gateways and merchant accounts are often issued by the same company and set up simultaneously. Third-party payment processors, such as PayPal, allow you to accept credit card payments without opening a merchant account.","Shopping cart applications typically offer different configurations to accommodate your preferred method for payment processing. One such alternative is in-house payment processing services. This means that the shopping cart software provides you directly with a merchant account and payment gateway; you don&#39;t deal with any third-party providers when it comes to payment processing.","Another option is integration with existing payment gateway accounts and third-party payment processors. When you integrate your payment gateway or PayPal account with your shopping cart software, the two work in sync to provide your customers with an easy, seamless checkout and the ability to pay with credit cards. Most shopping carts provide a list of the payment gateways they offer integration with, so keep this in mind if you already have a preferred payment processor.","<strong>Which Shopping Cart is Right for Your Store?</strong>","Whether you are a new or seasoned online merchant will likely influence which shopping cart application you choose. For instance, if you already have a website and payment gateway but simply want a new shopping cart system, you may only need a basic shopping cart   one that integrates with your existing site&#39;s building blocks. If this is your first foray into eCommerce, you&#39;ll likely benefit from using a full-featured shopping cart that can handle all your eCommerce needs, from inventory control to payment processing.","One of the best things about shopping cart software is that most applications offer customizable packages. You can typically choose which add-ons or functions you want to pay for and implement on your site, and whether you want site design and payment processing. Given its rich and versatile functionality, you may find that shopping cart software is all you need to start selling online."]},"id":"8a8a7955-cb55-477c-a167-8038a8b7d4b2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7576","url":"/how-ecommerce-shopping-carts-work","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"katie-nielsen","url":"/author/katie-nielsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Katie Nielsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"YmLdvmc8SsWJaWuhhXXYSW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-09-21T20:05:44Z","datePublished":"2012-09-21T20:05:44Z","name":"How eCommerce Shopping Carts Work","synopsis":"The heart of any successful online storefront is shopping cart software.","review":{},"strapline":"The heart of any successful online storefront is shopping cart software.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-01T20:07:12Z","id":"TjKo4AJPtJYWnk8w4a3EcN","meta":{"title":"How eCommerce Shopping Carts Work","description":"Need all-in-one eCommerce software?
