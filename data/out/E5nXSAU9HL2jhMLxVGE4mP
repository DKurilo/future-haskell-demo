We&#39;ve included this guide to Medicare Part D plans since 2014 as a resource for your purchasing decision. However, it&#39;s important to understand that this is not a review of Medicare Part D plans. We did not review, rate or rank the plans. We have not recommended one plan over another, in part because the quality of the plans depends largely on your personal situation and what is available in your area.","Rather, you should view this as a simple guide to help you understand the types of Medicare Part D plans that are available and what you should know before you pick a plan.","<strong>How Much Does a Medicare Part D Plan Cost?</strong>","According to <a href=\"https://www.mymedicarematters.org/costs/part-d/\">MyMedicareMatters.org</a>, the national average monthly premium for a Part D plan is $33.19. However, the cost varies depending on the plan you choose and the area where you live. In addition, to really determine the best plan for you, you need to consider the cost of the drugs you take plus the deductible and premium. You shouldn’t necessarily choose a plan based on the lowest available premium without first determining how the plan affects your annual drug costs, as it’s important to remember that Part D plans usually don’t begin to cover prescription drug costs until you’ve paid the out-of-pocket deductible. So, if a low premium plan has a high deductible, it can potentially cost you more per year than a higher premium.","To find the most affordable plan, you need to start by making a list of the prescriptions you take and the monthly cost without insurance. Then calculate the annual cost of the drugs. This might require consulting with your pharmacy or past receipts. Once you know how much your drugs cost, you can choose a plan with a deductible and a monthly premium that costs you the least.","It’s also critical to consider the co-pay tier categorizations of the drugs you take. Medicare Part D plans will always emphasize or encourage you to take the tier 1 generic drugs, and most cover these at a much lower co-pay. But if you have some drugs that are only available on the tier 4 speciality designation, you could end up with a higher co-pay.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","While every plan is different, they all share the same cost considerations:","<u>Premium</u><br/>Similar to other commercial health insurance plans, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans vary with the monthly premiums, depending on the company and the coverage and the prescriptions you need covered. We&#39;ve seen monthly premiums as low as $12 and we&#39;ve seen some as high as $100 per month. It all depends on how comprehensive you want or need your plan to be. To help you know what your premium will be, you should collect your medications and list the names, brands and dosage. Most insurance providers will ask you to provide this information when getting a quote for a plan.","<u>Annual Deductible</u><br/>Some Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans offer a low monthly premium with a high deductible, while others do not have a deductible but charge a higher premium. When choosing a Medicare Part D Plan, pay close attention to the benefit of paying a higher monthly premium. In many cases, the difference in savings is not as much as the difference in premium. The coverage of a higher premium plan often provides more comprehensive coverage.","<u>Drug Tier</u><br/>Depending on your budget, current medications, and location, you can search among a vast list of plans offered by several commercial insurance companies. Most companies offering Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans cover medications based on a tier program, and not all medications may be covered. It&#39;s important to compile an accurate and complete list of your current medications before enrolling in a Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan to find out if they are included under the plan.","<u>Enrollment Period</u><br/>Similar to other health insurances, you have to pay attention to enrollment periods. With Medicare, you have an initial enrollment period, which is seven-months and includes the three months before you turned 65. After this period, if you haven&#39;t enrolled in a plan or if you want to change your plan, you have to wait until the Fall Enrollment period, October 15 to December 7, with effective coverage beginning on January 1st.","<strong><strong>Medicare Part D Resources to Consult</strong></strong>","<strong>For Free, Unbiased Advice: SHIPs</strong>","State Health Insurance Assistance Programs are federally funded, state-managed centers that provide free counseling about Medicare over the phone or in person. The staff and volunteer experts in the programs use the same Plan Finder as you would on your own, but they’ve undergone extensive training and have experience navigating through the challenges these choices present.","“We ask [consumers] questions to try to help them decide,” says Ray Walker, divisional director for the Medicare Assistance Program (a SHIP) at the Oklahoma Insurance Department. “What is the most important thing to you: Having a short drive to the pharmacy? Is mobility an issue for you? [Is the priority] the copay structure for this particular medication?”","Though SHIP counselors are not allowed to recommend one specific plan, by asking these questions and evaluating which plans’ formularies best suit a person’s needs, they’re able to narrow down the choices significantly. Walker estimates that consumers who follow his staff’s advice save an average of $2,100 a year. And since the services are free, you can call your state’s SHIP any time throughout the year, especially during every open enrollment period, when you need to decide whether to keep your current plan or switch to a new one.","“We always recommend SHIPs as a resource for people who want more-personalized help with sorting through their Medicare plan options,” Purvis says.","You can find your state’s <a href=\"https://www.shiptacenter.org/\">SHIP website in this drop-down menu</a>.","<strong>For Laser-Focused Advice: Licensed Insurance Agents</strong>","Brokers have a lot of training and expertise under their belt, and a good one will be able to spend quality time looking at your individual needs at no cost to you. Be aware, though, aware that most agents work on commission and are in business to sell plans for the companies that will be paying them. One way to make sure you’re dealing with someone who has your best interests in mind is to go to an agent who represents a number of insurance companies.","“Ask them: ‘Do you sell all the plans that are available, or do you only represent certain companies?’” Walker advises.","<strong>For Unbiased Hand-holding: Flat-Fee Medicare Consultants</strong>","“It makes sense to me,” is how Diane Omdahl describes her Medicare expertise and resultant understanding of the enrollment process. Omdahl, cofounder and president of <a href=\"https://www.65incorporated.com/personalized-medicare-enrollment-consultation/\">65 Incorporated</a>, is a registered nurse and directed a skilled nursing facility before getting into the Medicare advice business. Services such as 65 Incorporated, <a href=\"https://www.allsupinc.com/allsup-medicare-advisor\">Allsup Medicare Advisor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.healthcarenavigation.com/\">Health Care Navigation</a> and others you can find in your area charge a fee for one-on-one consulting. It’s not cheap; 65 Incorporated charges $399 to walk you through your initial enrollment. The advantage is that because these consultants do not work on commission, they have no ulterior motive to steer you to a particular company or a more expensive product.","Considering how much you might have to pay out of pocket for an uncovered medication if you choose the wrong plan, it may be worth your time – and possibly some of your money – to get a helping hand with the process."]},"id":"c9f4c446-a36a-44a6-84e7-d38545015d1e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"75bf4dac-4234-44e3-a4d7-7fe3d7232d58","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.aarpmedicareplans.com/health-plans/prescription-drug-plans.html\">AARP MedicareRx Preferred</a>","<a href=\"https://www.blueshieldca.com/sites/medicare/plans-with-drug-coverage/prescription-drug-plans.sp\">Blue Cross Blue Shield</a>","<a href=\"http://cahealthadvocates.org/\">California Health Advocates</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cigna.com/medicare/part-d/plans\">Cigna Medicare Rx</a>","<a href=\"https://www.humana.com/medicare/products/drug-plan/\">Humana Walmart Rx Plan</a>","<a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html\">Medicare</a>","<a href=\"http://www.medicareinteractive.org/page2.php?topic=counselor&page=script&script_id=1479\">Medicare Interactive</a>","<a href=\"http://www.silverscript.com/plan/compare-module.aspx#\">SilverScript Choice</a>","<a href=\"https://www.ohioinsureplan.com/united-american-medicare-supplement-insurance/\">United American Medicare</a>","<a href=\"https://www.wellcare.com/PDP\">WellCare Classic</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e222dd46-2bb6-46ce-ba41-11752795f445","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1354","url":"/best-medicare-part-d-plans","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sabrina-rojas-weiss","url":"/author/sabrina-rojas-weiss","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Sabrina Rojas Weiss","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"tVZv6ejiouijuHU3n7n49Y","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-07T14:53:50Z","datePublished":"2019-01-28T00:00:00Z","name":"Best Medicare Part D Plans","synopsis":"If your Medicare Part A or Part B plan doesn't cover all of your prescriptions, you'll need a Medicare Part D plan.
