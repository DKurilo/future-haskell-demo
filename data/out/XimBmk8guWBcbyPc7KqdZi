This means you can do fewer loads of laundry, since you can put considerably more items into it for each wash cycle and still have enough room for clothes to get thoroughly cleaned. It comes with excellent time-saving ideas such as a Super Speed wash cycle, which lets you wash a full load in 30 minutes, and an AddWash feature, a small door that permits you to quickly pop in that stray sock or pair of shorts while the wash is underway. It also comes with technology to deeply penetrate fabrics with foam, and a steam wash function so your clothing will be fresh and sanitary.","Samsung WF50K7500AV is, not surprisingly, less energy efficient than most of the units we compared. It is the second largest in our comparison, so it is allowed to be above average for yearly operation, power and water costs, in addition to annual water usage and water used per wash. When you are buying a machine this big you can&#39;t expect it to be too efficient. However, it is efficient enough to earn the EPA&#39;s Energy Star certification, so you know it is more efficient than previous generations of washing machines.","The WF50K7500AV is one of the most expensive units we compared. For a long-term investment like this it might be worth it based on the great features. This washer is equipped with 14 wash cycles, including a quick wash, cold water cleaning, a sanitizing mode, and ones specifically for bedding or other heavy items, whites, and permanent press fabrics. There is also a simple rinse and spin for items that just need to be run through water and then spun to remove much of the moisture. The self-cleaning cycle helps you maintain the drum, removing bacteria and dirt by soaking, pulsating and spinning, so you don&#39;t have to use chemicals to maintain the machine.","In addition, you get 14 extra options, such as steam cleaning, an extra rinse, an extra spin and My Cycle. The My Cycle mode remembers your customized cycles with the drying levels, water temperatures, washing times and other things you have previously programmed.","The Smart Care app lets you connect with your washer and dryer to troubleshoot any problems. You can also use the washer&#39;s Wi-Fi connectivity to get alerts on your smartphone when wash cycles are done, keep track of how much cycle time is left and set washing times, all remotely and conveniently at your fingertips.","Other helpful technologies are a mode to really penetrate fabrics with a special foam and a steam wash function, both of which are designed to deep-clean laundry and make it appealingly fresh. The PowerFoam setting uses a mix of detergent, water and air to penetrate deep into fabric.","The Samsung WF50K7500AV front loading washer’s spacious drum gives you plenty of room to do big loads of laundry and avoid that dreaded trip to the laundromat with your comforters and other bedding. It can be stacked with the matching dryer, <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-4134430-11034749?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sears.com%2Fsamsung-dv50k7500ev-7.5-cu-ft-capacity-electric-dryer%2Fp-02686885000P&amp;cjsku=02686885000\">Samsung DV50K7500</a>, to save some space. If you need something more compact for a smaller laundry room, though, consider the <a href=\"/lg-electronics-review\">LG WM1388HW</a>.","Samsung&#39;s warranty on this machine is respectable. The motor is covered for 10 years, the tub for three and the rest of the machine for one year.","This machine is large enough and features enough innovation to make the Samsung WF50K7500AV a true upgrade. The foam and steam options are poised to help with deep cleaning. If you forget a stray sock or find a stain on your child’s T-shirt after the washing cycle has begun, you can simply pop it into the Samsung’s small AddWash door. The price is prohibitive for a lot of households, though, so you have to weigh the value of the upgrades in the context of your own budget."]},"id":"b724c8fa-0b61-4537-b73f-f463b40a857d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69987","url":"/samsung-wf7500-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-30T12:19:06Z","datePublished":"2018-05-30T12:19:06Z","name":"Samsung WF50K7500AV","synopsis":"With an interior capacity of 5 cubic feet, the Samsung WF50K7500AV is a big front load washer.
