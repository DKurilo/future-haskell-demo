With this energy use, the estimated operating costs are $66 per year. A few features can save you energy. The LED light bulbs in the refrigerator consume, according to Samsung, 20 times less energy than your traditional refrigerator lights. That&#39;s pretty amazing. If your Samsung side by side is open for more than two minutes, an alarm will sound and will continue to repeat until the door is closed.
