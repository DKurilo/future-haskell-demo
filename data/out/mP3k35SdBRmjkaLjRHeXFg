This steel 3D printer has some cutting-edge 3D printing technology, such as an LCD navigation screen, various print modes and a heated platform.","For such a large machine, we would have liked to see a larger print capacity. A print volume of 5.9 x 6.3 x 9.8 inches is the largest you can print with the Replicator 2X. Different print modes and speeds are accessible for when you need a quick prototype or the perfect present.","Only one type of 3D printing material is supported by the Replicator 2X. ABS in 1.75 mm is the only plastic you can print with, as unfortunately, PLA isn&#39;t recommended. However, the Replicator 2X does have dual print heads so you can print with two different colors at the same time.","This steel printer is a little on the heavy side, weighing 28 pounds. The sturdy construction, however, helps keep your prints stable and improves accuracy. As the Replicator 2X is an ABS printer, the heated platform and housing enclosure are necessary design features to help you get even better prints. This printer is not, however, available in a 3D printer kit for those of you who like to DIY.","MakerBot staff members are easy to reach by phone or email. A community forum, support videos, FAQs and a manual are all available on the website. Support is plentiful and MakerBot offers a six month warranty on the Replicator 2X.","Printing your 3D designs is easy with any computer. It doesnâ€™t matter if you have a Windows, Mac or Linux system; the Replicator 2X is compatible with them all. From a USB connection or a SD card, print directly from the software or .stl file.","Getting started with 3D printing is much easier if you have all the accessories from the get-go. MakerBot supplies you with your printer, a power supply, USB cable and maintenance tools. However, a starter filament cartridge is missing from your box, so you&#39;ll need to purchase your own. MakerBot does sell filament for $48 per ABS cartridge. You can also use any universal ABS filament from another retailer, though."]},"id":"567a68fe-1703-4476-9a29-eca6f9a4da9e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b698a26f-9661-4c67-b96e-0d47400bf57d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A few of the best features are missing from the Replicator 2X, but other features take their place.
