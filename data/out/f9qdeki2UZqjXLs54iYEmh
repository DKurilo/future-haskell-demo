It has a sturdy aluminum surface, two USB ports and a fan speed control dial. Still, it doesn’t have the cooling power of the best laptop coolers. However, this drawback doesn&#39;t stop the Zalman from being a popular laptop cooling pad.","Even though it has two fans, it only reaches 11 CFM at its highest setting. For a higher-end laptop cooler, this performance is remarkably lacking and inefficient, especially when compared to similar cooler models. In practice, this means you don’t get the same airflow from the Zalman as you do from more powerful models, and your laptop isn’t cooled as effectively.","Like most laptop coolers, the Zalman is powered by an included USB cable that plugs into your laptop. Since this renders one of your laptop&#39;s ports unusable, the NC1000 has an additional USB port you can use to connect peripheral devices, such as thumb drives and smartphones, to your laptop.","Because of its tough, aluminum top panel and simple design, the Zalman is a durable laptop cooler. However, its design also limits its versatility. If you use the laptop cooler on a bed or other soft surface, such as your lap or a pillow, the fans can become obstructed, rendering them useless. Also, unlike other models we reviewed, the top panel cannot be adjusted to bring your screen up to eye level.","Zalman covers the NC1000 with a one-year warranty that protects against defects in workmanship or materials. If you should run into any quality issues with your cooler, you can simply send it back for a replacement. If you have questions about your cooler, you can contact a Zalman representative for support via email or phone."]},"id":"3598576f-5d97-496e-bb51-aef79abc4b2a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"357558de-5b66-4478-8f44-1946f6b12212","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Zalman NC1000 is a decent cooling pad, but it is missing features and isn’t as powerful as the best laptop coolers.
