Bore size relates specifically to the diameter of the tubing used to make your trumpet. The bore size varies greatly between different horns with cornets or piccolo trumpets generally having the smallest while tenor trumpets, tubas, and trombones generally have larger bores. Also, the bore size is often slightly tweaked to create small variances in pitch for differently keyed trumpets.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/5451/how-to-pick-the-1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5onUjyEkDoi2QAUnzqXcf9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"5onUjyEkDoi2QAUnzqXcf9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5onUjyEkDoi2QAUnzqXcf9.jpg","alt":"Trumpet Bore"},"id":"310bbfdb-1918-4a69-a4d7-8122739aeadb","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Typical bore sizes found in most standard trumpets range from the smaller .450 mm to the extra large .472 mm. The differences in sounds produced are pretty straight forward with the smaller the bore size creating a softer sound and larger bores producing louder, bolder sounds.

Well, if you are a second or third chair, playing soft jazz or the trumpet is not a lead instrument in your ensemble, a smaller bore size will produce a softer tone that is best for playing music designed for these roles.","Obviously then if a smaller bore size means a softer sound, a larger bore sizes will produce more powerful and fuller tones that are perfect for lead chairs in ensembles, solo performances and a number of more classically inspired music styles where the trumpet is typically a lead instrument."]},"id":"24e5380a-8064-4f9d-861f-2c1c214db2f2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ZzPrPFxx6AHnVFSqoCXW2G.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The bell is the part of the trumpet out of which the sound comes out of. The size of the bell, which is also known as the flare, has a direct correlation to the type of sound produced. However, unlike the bore size where bigger means louder, the opposite actually applies to bell size. For softer mellower sounds, a larger bell size will produce the desired tone. For a sharper, brighter sound a smaller bell size will do the job perfectly.
