It has more than 19 cubic feet of space for fresh foods, with an additional 7.77 cubic feet in the freezer. This makes the KRFF707ESS one of the biggest French door refrigerators we reviewed, though it is less energy efficient than many. If you are interested in something more efficient, check out the <a href=\"/frigidaire-review\">Frigidaire Gallery FGHD2368TF</a>.","Not only is the KitchenAid KRFF707ESS one of the pricier <a href=\"/best-french-door-refrigerators\">French door refrigerators</a> we reviewed, but it is also more expensive to operate than most – an estimated $93 per year, or $3.47 per cubic foot. In addition, it isn’t Energy Star certified, which is apparent in its annual costs and electricity usage.","This KitchenAid fridge has five shelves, some of which slide back or fold up to give you more room for tall items. These shelves also have a small lip to contain spills. In addition, there are three drawers: two crispers with temperature controls and a full-length drawer for large and wide items such as meats and party platters.","The doors have six additional storage bins, three of which are large enough to hold gallon-size containers. None of these bins is a designated dairy compartment, though there is plenty of room to store dairy elsewhere.","The freezer compartment has three tiers with spacious bins. One of the bins is called a “pizza pocket,” and it can hold frozen pizza boxes upright, freeing up the valuable space these bulky items take up.","The fridge’s water and ice dispenser is handy, and the ice bin can hold an impressive 3 pounds of ice. This is three times what French door fridges&#39; ice bins generally hold. You can choose to lock the dispenser so young children can’t play with it as well as set an alarm to go off if someone leaves the door open for longer than a minute.","KitchenAid includes two extended warranties on top of the standard one-year parts and labor warranty. The sealed system is covered for an additional five years, while the compressor is covered for 10 years after your initial purchase. KitchenAid has its user guides online, and you can contact a support representative via email, telephone or live chat.","Despite a few imperfections, particularly the amount of energy it uses, the KitchenAid KRFF707ESS is a well-made French door refrigerator. It features extras like undershelf lighting and several extended warranties. The shelves are adjustable, and the freezer has a pizza pocket to help you maximize the storage space. However, it is on the pricey side, especially since it doesn’t have as many extra features as other fridges we reviewed."]},"id":"21cb2654-9e42-4ac1-8020-13e2d5218d68","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51075","url":"/kitchenaid-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-12T15:26:26Z","datePublished":"2010-10-12T15:26:26Z","name":"KitchenAid KRFF707ESS","synopsis":"The KitchenAid KRFF707ESS French door refrigerator features undershelf lighting, so you can see the contents of your fridge better than if it had a single overhead light.
