This <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">kids digital camera</a> is bright blue with a bear-shaped lens and view finder that comes in different designs. It is made with thick, tough plastic that safely keeps all the important mechanics safe deep inside. This camera was made to handle drop after drop to the floor. It is nice and big, perfect for little hands.","This child&#39;s camera has a decent image resolution: 1.3 megapixels. It can store close to 80 images in its internal memory. It is compatible with SD memory cards, if you would like to purchase one and increase the memory of this camera.","The Gummy Bears Digital Camera doesn&#39;t have as many of the fun factors as other digital cameras for kids that we reviewed. It doesn&#39;t have photo editing or photo effects programmed into it. It doesn&#39;t have any games or interchangeable parts. It does have a camcorder for recording video and a video screen for easily reviewing what you have captured and for playing back video afterward.","This kids camera comes with a USB connection built into the body of the camera. When you are ready to upload the images to your PC, simply slide out the connection and plug into your computer. You will need to download editing software that is specific for this product. The instructions on how to download this program are included with the packaging materials. Make sure you download your pictures before the batteries die; otherwise, all of your images will be erased from the memory.","Sakar has a few customer support options for the Gummy Bears Digital Camera. In addition to a one-year warranty, you can find email and telephone support contact information on its website. This child&#39;s camera also comes with a user guide with instructions that are easy to understand and follow."]},"id":"ae5ab5a9-88f7-440c-b32b-98cfec2e200d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a2b2612-fe32-4895-bf8c-e721dda74951","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Gummy Bears Digital Camera is a bright, colorful kids camera made to give your child hours of fun.
