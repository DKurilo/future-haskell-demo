Human error causes most auto accidents in the United States. A large portion of that error is a direct result of blind spots, which prevent drivers from seeing what&#39;s behind or to the side of them. <a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">Rear view cameras</a> go a long way to alleviating that weakness inherent to driving along America&#39;s highways and byways.","The<strong> </strong>Clover Color Rear-View Camera System TFT7001 manufactured by Clover Electronics has the most features, largest display and one of the longest focal lengths of any rear view camera we reviewed. Additionally, it includes every accessory we looked for in this category.","Like all things, The Clover TFT7001 is not perfect. Installation is somewhat complicated, but that&#39;s expected whenever you alter an automobile. Clover includes a detailed installation kit that makes it as simple as possible to install this rear view camera on your vehicle."]},"id":"98357771-233d-4915-b0dc-c5d9d714da0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"52c7da86-4169-4c4f-9515-ba0f0cf7c228","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Xh4EQXCkKjvQ2fRV3fuwG6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The first thing we looked for when we evaluated rear view cameras is whether they come with a monitor.

Only one other product offers an included a monitor as large as the one you find on the Clover TFT7001. The size of this monitor rivals that of some tablet computers. You won&#39;t have any problems seeing what the camera is capturing.

The Clover TFT7001&#39;s monitor displays the images captured by its camera component at a resolution of 512 x 492 pixels. That&#39;s not high definition, but it effectively utilizes every pixel the 7-inch screen has to offer. Nothing will ever be as clear as human vision, but given the size of the screen and camera, the Clover TFT7001 provides the clearest picture possible.","Many cars rolling off the dealers&#39; lots today have integrated rear view cameras. Unfortunately, some of those cameras only capture images in black and white. That&#39;s a letdown because having a color picture provides a richer and more accurate image of what&#39;s behind your vehicle.","One more note on the clarity of the picture produced by the Clover TFT700. The signal-to-noise ratio produced by this rear view camera is a healthy 46dB. This means that static and other visual artifacts are at an absolute minimum, as you lose as close to zero signal as possible from the camera to the monitor.","The clarity and size of the images produced by the Clover TFT7001 are invaluable for several reasons. Chief among them is it allows you to see obstacles in your path when you&#39;re backing out of your driveway. Children and pets in particular are often invisible to rearview mirrors. Having this extra sight goes a long way to preventing a tragic accident at your home.","The Clover TFT7001 also is quite useful when it comes time to parallel park. The unit allows you to see exactly how far you are from the car behind you. Rear view mirrors have always been somewhat unreliable for this task. Having a camera mounted on your car allows you to get as close as possible without giving the car behind you a kiss with your bumper.","Although the Clover TFT7001 only comes with one camera in the box, the monitor is equipped to handle a multi-camera setup. This means that if you have an additional compatible camera, you have the ability to connect it to the monitor. You can then switch back and forth between the two cameras. Where you put the second camera is up to you. If your vehicle has a large blind spot, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to install an extra camera there for an added layer of safety."]},"id":"32f5c9a7-c955-42b4-915d-395e1a68e397","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"d72c5700-717d-4a4d-a505-6e93533f5704","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/k4RdvVDi3ZUycT398LfJQY.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The camera on the Clover TFT7001 is just more than one third of an inch in total mass.
