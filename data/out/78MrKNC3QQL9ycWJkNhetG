You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Crock-Pot 3735-WN is made by Rival, the company responsible for the introduction of the original, and still among the best, <a href=\"/best-slow-cookers\">slow cookers</a>. This cooker is designed with simplicity in mind, removing the focus from fancy features to instead ensure a thorough and even cooking of food for gradual breakdown and tenderness.","The Crock-Pot 3735-WN is not a large slow cooker, offering a modest 3 ½ quart, oval-shaped crock. This size of device is ideal for groups of up to two or three people when cooking stew, soup or other meals. The glass lid fits perfectly atop the removable crock, ensuring steam or heat doesn’t escape the cooker. With its wraparound heating elements on the sides and bottom, your food will receive equal heating from all sides possible. The wraparound coils are an important feature of any cooker, due largely to how it facilitates a no-stir, yet evenly-cooked meal.","The crock itself lifts from the heating element base and allows for rinse cleaning or use in the dishwasher. The stoneware pot features a lifetime stick-resistant coating to prevent any caking against the pot’s base for meals that might accidentally overcook. Provided extreme temperature changes are avoided, like putting a hot crock pot into a sink of cold water, the slow cooker is sure to perform for years without cracking or warping.","Modern technological advances often facilitate the inclusion of a digital display or programmable slow cooker. The Crock-Pot 3735-WN holds true to its heritage as a simple device and doesn’t offer any type of display timer or program settings. Instead, it offers a single dial with three settings: high, low and off. The absence of a warming setting may prove problematic for you, but it allows the device to focus more on the two key temperatures for cooking and breaking down food.","The Crock-Pot 3735-WN is a simple and straightforward crock-pot, ideal for simple at-home use and for smaller groups. This slow cooker doesn’t offer the many digital and temperature options other devices may, instead focusing on being among the best slow cookers for simply cooking food. If you trust the brand behind the original crock-pot, this device will not disappoint."]},"id":"3b8284c3-9457-48ed-b204-bad3ba395f9e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58864","url":"/rival-crock-pot-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-21T14:44:36Z","datePublished":"2014-02-21T14:44:36Z","name":"Rival Crock-Pot 3735-WN","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
