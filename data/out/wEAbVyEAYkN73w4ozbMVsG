It doesn&#39;t dominate your computer&#39;s CPU, letting you multitask without lag, and it&#39;s easy to use. Various customization options help you make the player yours and enhance your movie sessions.","Whether you prefer macOS or the later versions of Windows, you can use Leawo&#39;s video player. It is also compatible with a wide variety of digital file types as well as more traditional physical discs, including rewritable discs.","Overall, the video player works well and is easy to use. It has a fairly clean and simple interface. During testing, we were impressed with how little CPU it took to run, averaging about four percent. It starts playing digital files quickly and takes just 18 seconds to load a DVD or Blu-ray disc. The fastest load time we saw was five seconds with <a href=\"/aiseesoft-blu-ray-player-review\">Aiseesoft Blu-ray Player</a>.","It does lack the ability to upscale standard-definition movies – like those found on DVD – to HD resolution. This means that if you’re watching on an HD monitor, your picture may seem pixelated. Upscaling would minimize those effects.","You can conserve your laptop battery life while having a movie marathon, thanks to the power manager. With its Windows integration, you can also enjoy this movie player software via touchscreen interface if you have a compatible computer.","You can depend on Leawo&#39;s customer support to help you with any questions or issues you have with the software. Its representatives are available via email, in case you&#39;d like to talk to them directly. If you&#39;d rather research your questions or issues independently, you have a few other options, such as the FAQs page, tutorials and a community forum where you can interact with fellow users.","One of the biggest drawbacks of this software is how expensive it is. At the time of this writing, it costs almost $60. This is quite expensive for simply playing Blu-ray movies. There is a free version of the software, but it’s ad-supported, so expect to get offers for other Leawo products if you use the freeware.","Though it lacks upscaling and the option for you to customize the output for a certain environment, such as a home theater, the Leawo Blu-ray Player is decent software. It&#39;s versatile in video and audio playback options, and its operating system and media compatibility are impressive."]},"id":"57a757ad-46fa-48d9-99d9-5a626b7b9dc4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57705","url":"/leawo-blu-ray-player-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
