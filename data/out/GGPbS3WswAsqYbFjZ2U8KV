You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Broilmaster R3B is one of the best <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared grills</a> in our review. It produced a solid performance in our heat consistency and durability tests, which contributed to an excellent grilling experience. ","The R3B comes with two 20,000-Btu burners that each take up half of the grill. The right burner is a large ceramic sear burner, the ideal surface for searing steaks quickly. Once your steak has the perfect grill marks, you can move it to the left side of the grill to finish cooking. The left burner is a U-shaped blue flame burner that doesn&#39;t produce as much heat as the right, but it&#39;s versatile enough for delicate foods. The blue flame burner pairs with briquettes, similar to those of charcoal grills but made of a ceramic material.","The Broilmaster R3B scored 95 percent on our heat consistency tests. The <a href=\"/tec-cherokee-review\">TEC Cherokee</a> is the only grill that scored better on the heat consistency test. This means you can use the grill for a variety of grilling tasks, such as slow roasting and searing, without ruining your food. Part of the reason for this score is the Broilmaster R3B&#39;s extra space between its burners and its cooking grates, more than any other grill in our review, which allows the heat more room to diffuse before coming in contact with your food. This helps prevent overcooking. When you move a cut of meat from searing to cooking, the heat doesn&#39;t bleed over too much from one side to the other."]},"id":"90a69fd6-2a03-4947-bc22-bf6152b5d9ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Grilling Experience"},"id":"c68ca968-2568-450c-ad1f-94902b2c2644","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/awREH8MQc4kvBEgCcrZZc7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"To evaluate the Broilmaster R3B for hot and cold spots across the cooking area, we tested the burners separately by placing slices of bread on the grates.
