The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-wireless-routers\">Wireless Routers</a> here.</em>","The Belkin N450 DB Wi-Fi Dual-Band N+ Router is an excellent and budget-friendly wireless router that provides good performance and includes excellent features. The Belkin N450 is one of the top-rated wireless routers because it supports data streams on two frequency bands simultaneously, it is easy to set up and manage, it includes parental controls and it comes with a two-year warranty. When you go to compare wireless routers, have this Belkin router on your short list.","We especially recommend this Belkin router if you are on a tight budget because it supports one of the most recent IEEE wireless standards: 802.11n. The new emerging standard is 802.11ac. However, you would need to spend three or four times the cost of this Belkin to buy an 802.11ac Wi-Fi router, and even then, most of your existing devices would not be able to take advantage of the 802.11ac&#39;s extra speed. Unless you want to buy a new laptop, tablet and smartphone, there is no point in moving up to 802.11ac just yet. Two years from now, 802.11ac will make more sense for those on a budget. In the meantime, the Belkin N450 DB Wi-Fi Dual-Band N+ Router will tide you over.","This is one of the best dual-band wireless routers even though it is not expensive. The dual bands operate simultaneously on 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Devices that connect on the 2.4GHz band have a theoretical transmission rate of 150Mbps. The 5GHz band enabled by the router&#39;s adherence to the IEEE 802.11n standard supports a theoretical transmission rate of 300Mbps. This Belkin router has four (10/100Mbps) Ethernet interfaces.","Belkin&#39;s N450 DB Wi-Fi Dual-Band N+ Router is among the best wireless routers; in that it provides convenient security features. Of course, it has the security basics necessary to be included in our router reviews: WEP encryption, Wi-Fi Protected Access and two firewalls (SPI and NAT). However, it goes beyond basic security. The Belkin has parental controls that let you automatically stop the transmission of content. The wireless router also has a guest network feature so that you can give unsecured internet access to guests of your home on a separate network.","&#34;Easy to use&#34; is easy to say, but this Belkin wireless router really is exceptionally easy to use. You don&#39;t need to use an installation CD. You can install and configure it using a browser-based window on your computer, tablet or smartphone. To install it without a CD, you take the default network name (SSID) and password from the bottom of the router and enter them on the set-up page, which appears after you connect the router to your computer. The computer should be online when you connect the router. Don&#39;t forget to change the default password after you have configured the router.","When it comes to help and support, Belkin goes above and beyond what&#39;s normal: You can chat with an agent 24 hours per day, seven days a week. The Belkin support webpages anticipate commonly asked questions with useful articles and instructions. Belkin also hosts an online community forum where users can ask questions, share ideas and report problems. Belkin is active on Facebook and Twitter too. You can also get premium support for a fee if you need special help to solve issues related to installation, upgrades or security.","If you are on a budget and looking for a powerful wireless router to use in your residence, Belkin&#39;s N450 DB Wi-Fi Dual-Band N+ Router is among the best. It supports data transmission on a 2.4GHz and a 5GHz band simultaneously, and it has four Ethernet interfaces. It also has parental controls and a guest network feature. Installation and management are not complicated. The manufacturer includes a two-year warranty. Help and support are superb."]},"id":"7484309c-455c-4cff-9f0c-fed72684dcdc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49918","url":"/belkin-n-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-30T21:19:15Z","datePublished":"2010-06-30T21:19:15Z","name":"Belkin N450","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":45,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-06-30T21:19:15Z","id":"e3MSuh46QmN8eW38un5ioN","meta":{"title":"Belkin N450 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Belkin N450 is well-equipped and a great bargain when it comes to residential wireless n routers."},"products":[{"slug":"belkin-n450","url":"/product/belkin-n450","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","name":"Belkin N450","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","id":"pt7q3NqoiekRYeaVoDSwm4","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/2T3hUdUSQBYj7bjYkn76FR.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","mimeType":"","name":"49890-belkin-surf-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/49890-belkin-surf-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","id":"2T3hUdUSQBYj7bjYkn76FR","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2T3hUdUSQBYj7bjYkn76FR.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Belkin N450 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Belkin N450 is well-equipped and a great bargain when it comes to residential wireless n routers."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/2T3hUdUSQBYj7bjYkn76FR.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","mimeType":"","name":"49890-belkin-surf-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/49890-belkin-surf-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","id":"2T3hUdUSQBYj7bjYkn76FR","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2T3hUdUSQBYj7bjYkn76FR.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Belkin N450 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Belkin N450 is well-equipped and a great bargain when it comes to residential wireless n routers."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/belkin-n-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"home-networking","url":"/electronics/home-networking","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","name":"Home Networking","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:29:20Z","id":"cFxfUv9HyySUrpfbUtRtDM","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
