The outside doorbell unit is built for durability and is lightly weatherproof. With this model you can control visual and audio settings on the panel or unlock your door remotely for guests with the press of a button. You can even choose a customized doorbell ringtone.","You can capture quality images of your visitors thanks to the device’s ¼-inch CMOS image sensor. There are two 7-inch color LCD monitors, which can either be mounted on a wall or placed on a convenient surface. You can also view visitors easily at night or in low-light environments with the device’s infrared camera, which boosts the quality and visibility of the image.","This <a href=\"/best-video-doorbells\">video intercom doorbell</a> has an aluminum alloy build, for durability, but it is also slim with a modern design so it will fit in with your business or house’s external décor. It has a small rain shield for light protection against the elements and is oxidation-proof. This level of protection is fine for mild climates, but it may have a harder time somewhere with more severe seasons.","This camera doorbell comes with everything needed to install it yourself, including cables and adapters. If you have electric locks on your front door, you can use the unlock button on the monitor to unlock your door for guests from wherever in your house or business that your monitor is.","You can easily adjust the talking and doorbell volumes directly on the monitor. Additionally, the video intercom system lets you choose a doorbell tone from 16 polyphonic choices, so you can find the right sound for your home or business.","The Andoer 7-inch video doorbell can capture both video and still photos, and it allows you to communicate with visitors via the built-in intercom system. You can view footage on the large monitors, which also let you manage audio and visual settings. Additionally, you can unlock your door for guests just by pressing a button on the monitor.  The Andoer 7-inch lets you have control over the security of your home or business, while letting you customize sound features so you get just the effect you want."]},"id":"97364cbd-d57f-4c86-8e32-5d6d83e0ea9e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64453","url":"/andoer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-27T21:25:13Z","datePublished":"2015-04-27T21:25:13Z","name":"Andoer 7\"","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-27T21:25:13Z","id":"axziC3rbJvFdKckSfS3iy7","meta":{"title":"Andoer 7\" Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Andoer 7-inch video doorbell lets you view video and photo on two monitors.
