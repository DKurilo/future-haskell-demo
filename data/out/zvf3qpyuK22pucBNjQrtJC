At 100dB, the sound produced by this AV receiver is crisp and clear. There is no audio distortion or static produced by the Denon AVR-1912.

This is another indicator of the clarity of sound produced by this AV receiver. Any number below 0.5 percent is purely an academic statistic because hardly anyone can detect harmonic distortion that low.","When you connect the Denon AVR-1912 to a speaker system, each channel of sound draws a maximum of 110 watts. Of all the AV receivers on our side-by-side comparison chart, only three products put out less power per channel. In addition, the total power consumption of the AV receiver itself is 460 watts.

This port enables you to connect a wide variety of digital devices. Not the least of these are iOS devices; the Denon AVR-1912 is specifically designed to take full advantage of your iPhone, iPod or iPad, but more on that later. This port combined with the HDMI ports on the rear of the machine make this AV receiver compatible with nearly every digital device available on the market today.","Next to the front-panel USB port is a set of composite AV inputs. While you find more analog connectivity on the back panel, these ports will be your primary analog connection method. Since component is the most popular analog connection method, putting this connection in the front makes sense.","Even though digital connection methods are fast outpacing traditional analog connections, old-fashioned connections still have a place in our lives.
