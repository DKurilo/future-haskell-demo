It supports deep color and 24p playback, which is typical for Blu-ray players, and it also runs audio playback standards like Dolby TrueHD. In our 3D testing with the film “Gravity,” there were no image quality issues. The <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray player</a> doesn’t support 4K playback, but this is a feature rarely found on basic HDTV setups.","The H5900 relies on the same Opera-based operating system used on other Samsung Blu-ray players, which benefits it in several ways. For example, during our boot test, in which we timed how long it took for the Blu-ray player to start up on stock settings, the player had a decent mark of only 5.6 seconds.","It also possesses a strong suite of preinstalled applications. Along with standard streaming options like Netflix, the player&#39;s app library can be supplemented with downloads from Opera&#39;s application store. If you already have other Samsung devices, the player can mirror your smartphone or tablet on your home TV.","The player has a standard set of connectivity options. It can output audio through a single coaxial jack, which most home audio receivers have by default. Elsewhere, USB, Ethernet and Wi-Fi support cover the expected bases for home users.","With dimensions of 14.2 x 7.7 x 1.6 inches and a weight of 1.1 pounds, the player&#39;s compact build makes it easy to slide into an entertainment center. Its design also falls in line with comparable 3D Blu-ray players, and its rounded edge and reflective black exterior give it a slick appearance.","Samsung bundles a base one-year warranty with the H5900. For troubleshooting advice, you can turn to Samsung&#39;s phone, email and live chat agents, along with the manufacturer&#39;s support area on its website."]},"id":"676d3cef-7cca-403f-95a5-f9140ac40f32","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e8b2984b-b708-4888-9bdc-fd1ce42eb4eb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like most entry-level 3D Blu-ray players, the Samsung BD-H5900&#39;s hardware limitations keep it a distance from the best 3D Blu-ray players.
