If you choose to load your card with cash through direct deposit and you meet the monthly minimum, Bancorp Bank, the card&#39;s issuer, can waive the fee.","There is also an initial purchase fee when you get this card, but there are no point-of-sale purchase fees, so you can use the Exact MasterCard as a debit card or credit card – PIN entry or signature – at no extra cost to you. Setting up bill pay, though, does come with a charge. Also, if you need to place a stop payment on a bill, you&#39;ll likely pay a hefty fee.","While this card&#39;s monthly service fee is lower than other cards on the market, just a few ATM cash withdrawals a month can offset that savings in a hurry. For this reason, it&#39;s important to compare your own card-usage patterns with a specific card&#39;s fees to make the best, low-cost selection.","This prepaid credit card tacks on a couple of more fees that add up over the course of a month. You can reload your card with cash at select retail locations, but you&#39;re likely to pay that retailer a fee to do so. If a card is lost or stolen, you&#39;re charged for the replacement card, but the fee for replacing it is lower than most other prepaid credit cards. You can check your account status online without incurring a charge, though.","Exact MasterCard limits the amount of money you can load to your card and how much you can withdraw daily, like most prepaid cards. Daily cash withdrawals from an ATM are limited to the hundreds. Account management is available 24/7, and you can choose to receive email and text messages to alert you of transactions. Exact MasterCard also offers mobile apps for iOS and Android devices, and you can use Apple Pay.","Telephone customer support from a live representative is available during business hours during  weekdays, but you may have to pay a fee.","The Exact MasterCard prepaid credit card charges for relatively the same services as other prepaid cards, but you don&#39;t have to pay for point-of-sale purchases, regardless of whether you use your PIN or a signature for the transaction. Cash withdrawal fees are generally higher than other cards though."]},"id":"3585651e-62ba-4ccf-8191-e2b9e95ebd64","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3379","url":"/exact-mastercard-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-07-16T18:50:01Z","datePublished":"2009-07-16T18:50:01Z","name":"EXACT MasterCard","synopsis":"The Exact MasterCard prepaid credit card includes a monthly service fee, ATM withdrawal fees and balance-inquiry fees, but there are ways to reduce the cost of this card to you.","review":{"rating":74,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Exact MasterCard prepaid credit card includes a monthly service fee, ATM withdrawal fees and balance-inquiry fees, but there are ways to reduce the cost of this card to you.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-07-16T18:50:01Z","id":"G6JqnWyLXf2JjKj97mBeCJ","meta":{"title":"EXACT MasterCard Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Exact MasterCard&#039;s prepaid credit card offers the services you expect with a prepaid card, but it doesn&#039;t charge for basic purchases.
