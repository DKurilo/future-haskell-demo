Radio signals have a low signal-to-noise ratio – there&#39;s a lot of static in the signal. This was clearly evident in the signal clarity test, where the Nulaxy received a D+ grade. When the volume is relatively high, you can trick your ears into ignoring the noise in the signal. With the KM18, the static isn&#39;t noticeable unless the songs get quiet or in the lull between songs. In other words, it&#39;s tolerable for an FM transmitter. While it&#39;s nowhere near the quality of an AUX-in Bluetooth adapter, the quality is a lot better than the <a href=\"/mpow-bluetooth-fm-transmitter-review\">Mpow</a> and <a href=\"/gogroove-review\">GOgroove FlexSMART X5</a> FM transmitters. Both of those devices received D- grades and were nearly intolerable.","The signal strength of the KM18 received an A grade. This is a direct correlation to the signal clarity, because a stronger transmission results in better reception.","The KM18 has a AUX-in port. There are several ways you can make use of this port. First, you use a 3.5 mm audio cord and plug it into your car stereo&#39;s AUX port to forgo the FM transmission. However, I don&#39;t recommend this option. If your car stereo has an AUX port, I recommend opting for an unobtrusive AUX-in Bluetooth adapter. Second, you can connect other non-Bluetooth audio devices, such as an iPod, to the KM18&#39;s AUX port and transmit audio via the FM transmitter."]},"id":"be1a665e-3c78-423e-8637-e9ecfd4aa0b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/YkfUXawVAfFv3oJyhrQShN.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69047-nulaxy4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YkfUXawVAfFv3oJyhrQShN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"YkfUXawVAfFv3oJyhrQShN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YkfUXawVAfFv3oJyhrQShN.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c8ffd990-52b3-4d16-9747-80b7aafeac6b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The call quality isn’t good, receiving a D+ grade.
