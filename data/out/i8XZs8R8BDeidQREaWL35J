However, it can cost thousands of dollars in home repairs if termites or carpenter ant colonies go unnoticed. You may not know the signs of carpenter ants or how to properly inspect for termites. Termite control companies know exactly what to look for, and the cost of their service is mere pennies compared to repairing prolonged termite damage.","<strong>Hazard</strong>","Pest control technicians are trained to know how their products work and where to put them inside and outside of a home. Many companies are going green and using products that are safe for the home and the environment. When technicians need to use products that can be hazardous, they have the expertise to ensure the safety of your family. There are handfuls of chemical sprays available to consumers, but just remember that, in real life, exposure to hazardous chemicals doesn&#39;t give you super powers.","<strong>Time and Flexibility</strong>","No one wants to take time off to wait for the &#34;bug guy&#34; and pest control companies know this and are willing to work around your schedule. If you request a free inspection and a price quote for service, you&#39;ll find that almost all exterminators work past sunset and on weekends.","Controlling pest infestations takes time, and using pest control products in a timely matter is key to successfully protecting your home. If you are looking to do it on your own, you can easily forget when to retreat your home. Pest control companies monitor and report every time they spray and know when to retreat before the product stops working. The best part is; if you need help with a new onslaught of bugs, many companies will come back and retreat for free.","<strong>Risks</strong>","Have you ever heard that killing a killer bee will attract the hive and swarm you? Using a wrong elimination method will have the same consequences with many pests. Bees will swarm and mice can scatter, carrying diseases like the deadly Hantavirus, when their nest is disturbed. Using an exterminator means having someone who knows how to deal with potential nests and the risks inherent with treating them.","You can buy hazardous sprays and try to rid yourself of disease-carrying pests, but using a top-tier pest control service ensures full extermination all year-round. Plus, you can rest assured your family will be safe from harmful chemicals. So save yourself some time and money by using a professional, guaranteed service and ridding your home of pesky invaders."]},"id":"b265b61a-ad3e-4921-ba1e-00a12cf7cfe0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7353","url":"/5-reasons-to-consider-pest-control-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alex-jenkins","url":"/author/alex-jenkins","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alex Jenkins","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"xiCNkEAAAxHKwXLBdF8fdF","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-31T20:09:29Z","datePublished":"2012-05-31T20:09:29Z","name":"5 Reasons to Consider Pest Control Services","synopsis":"Hiring a professional pest control service can have several benefits when comparing it to controlling pests such as rodents, spiders or termites on your own.","review":{},"strapline":"Hiring a professional pest control service can have several benefits when comparing it to controlling pests such as rodents, spiders or termites on your own.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-19T20:52:33Z","id":"i8XZs8R8BDeidQREaWL35J","meta":{"title":"5 Reasons to Consider Pest Control Services","description":"Are you considering treating your own home for pests?
