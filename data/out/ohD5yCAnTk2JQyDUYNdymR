This desktop computer gives you a winning combination of storage, <a href=\"http://www.tomsitpro.com/tags/processors/\">processor speed and connectivity</a>. With storage space of nearly 1.5TB and a processing speed of 2.5 GHz, you will be covered whether you want to surf the web at breakneck speeds or organize thousands of family photos. There are plenty of reasons this computer trounces the competition, but the most important could be that you won&#39;t outgrow this machine anytime soon.","Dell is a trusted name when it comes to computers, and for good reason. They offer a wide variety of customization options so you can get the exact computer you need for the price you&#39;re willing to spend. The Dell Studio XPS 7100 is also exceptionally customizable. With a Dell, you know you&#39;ll get a quality product for your money.

The 8GB of RAM in the Dell Studio XPS 7100 is high compared to other home computers. RAM acts as the middle-man between the application and the hard drive. It&#39;s a temporary storage location that&#39;s in use when you run any software application while the CPU is processing. If you don&#39;t have enough space in your RAM the computer becomes sluggish and can even freeze. Video games and multimedia applications take up a lot of memory, so it is important to have several gigabytes available.","One of the specs we were most impressed with is the hard drive. This is where all of your files are stored. The more storage you have, the more you can keep on your computer without relying on an external hard drive. The Dell Studio XPS 7100 has a storage capacity of 1500GB (1.46TB). You won&#39;t be running out of storage anytime soon even with hundreds of vacation photos and videos.","When it comes to a processor, it can be really hard to determine if what is installed is actually good. The processor has its own storage and speed. And the AMD Phenom II X6 1055T comes with a speed of 2.8 GHz and a cache of up to 6MB. This isn&#39;t the best one we&#39;ve seen, but for normal everyday use this should be plenty. The video card included with the Dell Studio XPS 7100 is the AMD Radeon HD 6670. This is once again good enough for day to day use and gives you plenty of speed for viewing high-res photos and playing most online games."]},"id":"c1a9ecfb-1226-4792-9a7d-193ec986362f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"c85c17b2-0933-483e-bf3d-cd8a3c999911","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/RJL7rtnXCreWasFA9333pZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Once you know that the Dell Studio 7100 has the power you need, then you see what other features are available.
