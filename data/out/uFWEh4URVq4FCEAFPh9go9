For instance, if you are grilling a whole chicken, you could put one probe in the breast and another in the leg. If you are juggling multiple probes, you can set individual alarms to go off at specific temperatures or set temperatures that you don&#39;t want the thermometer to exceed. This is perfect if your family members like different levels of doneness for their meats.","The iGrill2 is quite accurate, even though it isn&#39;t an instant-read digital meat thermometer, meaning you&#39;re supposed to leave the probes in the meat while it cooks. Weber, the manufacturer of the iGrill thermometers, claims this thermometer is accurate within 1-degree Fahrenheit, which we found to be true in our grilling tests with steak.","Using the presets, we had no trouble grilling a steak to perfection. We grilled four steaks, each to a different level: rare, medium rare, medium and medium well. The thermometer took an average of 16.25 seconds to fully register, which is shorter than most in our lineup take. It&#39;s also capable of measuring a wider range of temperatures than most grill thermometers can – -22 to 572 degrees Fahrenheit.","The base station for this thermometer is slightly larger than a hockey puck. It has a large and bright display that&#39;s easy to read. The display shows temperature in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius, depending on your preference. It is powered by two AA batteries, and Weber claims the iGrill2 has 200 hours of battery life.","The thermometer has an auto shut-off feature so that it doesn&#39;t stay on when you&#39;re not using it. But if you happen to be cooking something for a long time and need the thermometer to stay on, don&#39;t fret, because as long as the iGrill2 is paired with a smartphone or tablet, it remains on. The base and the probe are water-resistant, so they&#39;re fine if they get wet from the rain or if juices from foods get on them. The thermometer and probes are not waterproof, though, so you can&#39;t put them in the dishwasher.","This digital grill thermometer comes with a one-year warranty, which is the standard for the thermometers we tested. Weber has an array of support options available. You can reach the company by telephone and email, and there are FAQs and a downloadable manual on the Weber website. The thermometer also supports firmware updates, which you can find online."]},"id":"4481e90a-46e6-4cb9-86a1-19557f7953ce","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69802","url":"/weber-igrill2-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-03-22T13:18:46Z","datePublished":"2018-03-22T13:18:46Z","name":"Weber iGrill2","synopsis":"The iGrill2 does much more than most digital grill thermometers.","review":{"rating":98,"verdict":"This Bluetooth thermometer&#039;s app, response time, accuracy and multiple-probe support make it the best digital grill thermometer available.","pros":["When your food reaches the right temperature, you get a notification on your iOS or Android device."],"cons":["The iGrill2 has a wireless range of 150 feet, while other thermometers&#039; ranges can go as far as 300 feet."]},"strapline":"The iGrill2 does much more than most digital grill thermometers.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-30T00:00:00Z","id":"uFWEh4URVq4FCEAFPh9go9","meta":{"title":"Weber iGrill2 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"This Bluetooth thermometer&#039;s app, response time, accuracy and multiple-probe support make it the best digital grill thermometer available."},"products":[{"slug":"weber-igrill2","url":"/product/weber-igrill2","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","name":"Weber iGrill2","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","id":"2yrU58H328TuUsruZWEmfB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:07:53Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/YzVoq5A7pqjtqJNqbVBjmC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"d1f7d18778e2d8a7f881fa67f2b45bb2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/d1f7d18778e2d8a7f881fa67f2b45bb2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","id":"YzVoq5A7pqjtqJNqbVBjmC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YzVoq5A7pqjtqJNqbVBjmC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Weber iGrill2 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"This Bluetooth thermometer&#039;s app, response time, accuracy and multiple-probe support make it the best digital grill thermometer available."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/YzVoq5A7pqjtqJNqbVBjmC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","mimeType":"","name":"d1f7d18778e2d8a7f881fa67f2b45bb2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/d1f7d18778e2d8a7f881fa67f2b45bb2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","id":"YzVoq5A7pqjtqJNqbVBjmC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YzVoq5A7pqjtqJNqbVBjmC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Weber iGrill2 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"This Bluetooth thermometer&#039;s app, response time, accuracy and multiple-probe support make it the best digital grill thermometer available."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/weber-igrill2-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gadgets","url":"/kitchen/gadgets","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","name":"Gadgets","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:07:52Z","id":"hw664pAQ3ic5obm4EFCZjh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
