You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Cuisinart bucked the norm when it developed the PSC line of <a href=\"/best-slow-cookers\">slow cookers</a>. The stoneware inserts sit inside a rectangular housing that adds more weight and inches to the overall size of these units, but those changes offer benefits you don&#39;t get with other slow cookers.","Cuisinart PSC cookers reach a higher temperature than similar slow cookers. It&#39;s something to keep in mind because you may need to reduce cooking time for your recipes with these slow cookers. However, they regulate heat well when set at low for eight hours. If you cook meat a great deal and want to focus on internal meat temperatures, take a look at the <a href=\"/hamilton-beach-set-forget-review\">Hamilton Beach Set’n Forget 33969A</a> that offers a temperature probe.","The external temperature of these slow cookers on the front and sides is lower than many other slow cookers, which means this a much a safer choice especially if you have children. Cuisinart&#39;s slow cookers lose a bit of moisture while cooking, but at 9 percent, it isn&#39;t nearly as much as some. PSCs also have a programmable timer that allows you to choose the time along with a heat setting.","Along with its programmable timer, the Cuisinart PSC line sports a digital display, so it&#39;s easy to see what time and heat setting you&#39;re choosing. Also, these slow cookers automatically switch over to warm when the timer reaches the end. One of the best features is a retractable cord, so when you&#39;re done cooking, you just give it a slight tug and it coils back up inside the base, which makes it so much easier to stow.","Many slow cookers come with recipes so you have some inspiration to start cooking, but Cuisinart took it a step further: The appliance maker includes a hefty spiral-bound recipe book with dozens of recipes, including appetizers, soups and stocks, stews, entrées and desserts. Some of those recipes require you to use the rack that&#39;s included so you can cook breads and cakes that benefit from a water bath.","Cuisinart&#39;s limited warranty only covers defective parts and workmanship, but it lasts three years. You can read all about the warranty and instructions online. You can even find the recipes in the included book online.","Customer support is also available from the manufacturer&#39;s website. You can contact support through an online form or by phone.","Cuisinart&#39;s PSC slow cookers include innovative features and extras that make it a solid choice for anyone needing a slow cooker."]},"id":"202732d8-99ff-4c7f-b6b8-d99943ee9d47","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58861","url":"/cuisinart-programmable-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-21T14:44:05Z","datePublished":"2014-02-21T14:44:05Z","name":"Cuisinart Programmable","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":73,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-02-21T14:44:05Z","id":"toLmR3Ypd6iruAqqSeBL7i","meta":{"title":"Cuisinart Programmable Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Cuisinart Programmable PSC slow cookers are programmable and have an unusual design.
