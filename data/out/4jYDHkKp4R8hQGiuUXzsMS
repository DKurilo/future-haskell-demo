It isn’t the biggest mini fridge we researched, but it can hold a 2-liter bottle as well as a variety of other food and drink containers. In addition, this Black &amp; Decker model is Energy Star certified and costs only about $25 per year in electricity to operate.","This compact fridge measures 17.5 x 18.5 x 26.6 inches, so it can fit under a desk or countertop or in a corner – you just need to leave enough room around it for air to freely circulate. Also, at 46.3 pounds, this is one of the lighter mini fridges we reviewed, so it’s easy to move. In addition, it is quiet, so it won’t distract you while you work or sleep. If you need a bigger fridge, take a look at the <a href=\"/magic-chef-review\">Magic Chef MCBR440S2</a>.","One of the BCRK25W’s best features is its reversible door – you can attach the door to either the left side or the right side. As such, you can choose for the door to swing open either to the left or the right, depending on which works best for the place you want to put it.","This fridge includes two slide-out glass shelves you can set in three positions to accommodate different size foods. The refrigerator door has a small top shelf, and below that sits a can dispenser that fits five soda cans as well as a space for a 2-liter bottle. The BCRK25W comes with an ice cube tray, and its freezer is reasonably roomy, extending the full width of the top of the fridge. You adjust the fridge’s temperature using a knob next to the freezer.","The inside of the fridge and its removable glass shelves are easy to clean. However, you must defrost the BCRK25W manually.","This fridge comes in three finishes: white, black and brushed metal. Black &amp; Decker includes a one-year warranty on parts and labor and a two-year warranty on the compressor parts."]},"id":"da6d89c9-404a-44bc-9ece-611a4f57f686","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70056","url":"/black-and-decker-bcrk25w-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-27T15:00:07Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T15:00:07Z","name":"Black & Decker BCRK25W","synopsis":"The affordable Black & Decker BCRK25W mini fridge holds a reasonable amount of food and drink in its 2.5-cubic-foot interior.","review":{"rating":86,"verdict":"The Black &amp; Decker BCRK25W mini fridge is the best value of the models we reviewed.
