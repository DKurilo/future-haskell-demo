Rather than having a handle with rotating or oscillating brush heads, it cleans your skin with sonic vibration. The top half of the brush is applied to your face and is textured with small, rounded silicone bristles. The bottom half is held in your hand and contains the unit’s control buttons and power port.","With an MSRP of $139, this device is one of the most expensive <a href=\"/best-facial-cleansing-brushes\">facial cleansing brushes</a> we tested. However, you won’t incur the additional, recurring expense of having to purchase replacement brush heads. This can save you money over time because most brush heads should be replaced every two to three months, and some cost $27 apiece.","The Luna Mini 2 is gentle on sensitive skin, and it also provides exfoliation. Foreo says the brush can be used twice daily without causing skin irritation. It removes makeup residue, dirt, oil and dead skin cells from your face and helps unclog your pores. The surface on the front of the brush has a finer texture than the surface on the back to give you customization options for your skin type and cleansing needs. The device also has eight intensity settings, but our testers didn’t notice much difference between them. If you’re looking for a brush with unmistakable variance between settings, try the <a href=\"/mary-kay-review\">Mary Kay Skinvigorate Cleansing Brush</a>.","The Luna Mini 2 receives excellent consumer reviews, but its unique design wasn’t a favorite of our in-house product testers, earning a B in our tests.","“It fits in my palm ok with the finer side,” said one member of our panel, “but the coarser side didn’t fit as well. I like oscillating brushes much better.”","Benefits of this product include it being waterproof and having a rechargeable battery that can last up to six months between charges. You’ll want to take note that it comes with a USB cord, but a power adapter isn’t included.","Among our ten favorite facial cleansing brushes, only the <a href=\"/vanity-planet-review\">Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa</a> comes with a protective travel/storage case. However, the clear plastic packaging of the Luna Mini 2 is reusable for storage, as is the box of <a href=\"/essential-skin-solutions-review\">Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin</a>, which is our best overall pick.","The Foreo Luna Mini 2 is backed by a two-year manufacturer’s warranty, which is above average. Many facial cleansing brushes have just one year of consumer protection or even no warranty at all. Customer service in North America is available by email. Both email and phone support are available on other continents."]},"id":"85197e4c-6007-4ec0-bf0d-fe485a04b34b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70245","url":"/foreo-luna-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-20T15:47:51Z","datePublished":"2018-09-20T15:47:51Z","name":"Foreo Luna Mini 2","synopsis":"The Foreo Luna Mini 2 is a palm-held facial cleansing brush made of silicone.
