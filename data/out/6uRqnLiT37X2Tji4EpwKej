You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This Northern Light therapy lamp gives off 10,000 lux of light and has an adjustable body, making it an effective choice for most light therapy treatments. It isn’t very portable, but it fits anywhere you would put a regular table lamp in your home or office. Since it’s often recommended that you use Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) light therapy lamps in the morning, you could even put it on the kitchen table and use it while you eat breakfast.","A lamp’s lux rating is important, but the distance you sit from the light source also impacts performance – for therapy to be effective, you need to remain within a few feet of the lamp. This <a href=\"/best-light-therapy-lamps\">light therapy lamp</a> produces 10,000 lux of light at a distance of 20 inches. You can also adjust it forward and backward with the support arms as well as tilt the head, and doing so allows you to position the lamp so the light hits your face. It uses two fluorescent tube lightbulbs, which don’t emit harmful UV rays that can damage your skin.","Even though it’s powerful, this light therapy lamp only requires 80 watts to function. This low wattage keeps the sun lamp cool, which makes it comfortable to use for long sessions. This Northern Light model plugs into a wall outlet for power. This, coupled with its size, means it isn’t portable enough to travel with. If you&#39;d prefer a more portable light, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/golite-blu-review\">goLITE BLU</a>.","Northern Light’s head has two reflectors that even out the light display without creating glare, and the lamp’s sturdy base limits humming. In addition, the lamp does not flicker. These features make for a pleasant, distraction-free therapy experience. This lamp comes with a seven-year warranty and is also covered with a 60-day money-back guarantee.","The powerful Northern Light SADelite Desk Lamp has an adjustable body and emits 10,000 lux of light at a distance of 20 inches. It looks like a standard office lamp, and you can use it anywhere you have desk or table space and access to a power outlet. It is glare-free, hum-free and flicker-free, so your light therapy sessions won&#39;t annoy you or irritate your eyes."]},"id":"6ad4c30e-3b5e-4f20-a2b3-07f1f70f1f49","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64161","url":"/sadelite-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-14T21:05:32Z","datePublished":"2015-04-14T21:05:32Z","name":"Northern Light Desk Lamp","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":51,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-11T00:00:00Z","id":"6uRqnLiT37X2Tji4EpwKej","meta":{"title":"Northern Light Sadelite Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Northern Light Desk Lamp is a powerful therapy light.
