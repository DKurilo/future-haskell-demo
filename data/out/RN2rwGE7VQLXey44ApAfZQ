The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-video-converter-software\"><em>Video Converter Software here</em></a><em>.</em>","Prism Video Format Converter is hardworking video converter software that can handle just about any file type you want to convert. It can even pull files directly from a DVD and can work with HD video. We also found that it works quiet well with video captured by a digital video camera.","Though it is not attractive or flashy, Prism has an interface that is easy to use and well organized. It can handle batch conversions, so you can put it to work and come back to fully converted video files that are automatically saved where you tell it to save to, whether it is your hard drive or an external drive.","Prism Video Format Converter can basically convert any file type that can play in the Windows Media player, or in other words, anything using a DirectShow-based codec. While testing this software, we imported AVI and MOV video files with no difficulty. They played well and converted easily.","Prism can decompress from these files types: AVI, WMV, ASF, MPG, MPEG, MPE VOB MOV 3GP, MP4, M4V, FLV, MKV, MOD, OGM, DV and DIVX.","In addition, it can decompress these compressed file types: MPEG-4, DIVX, XVID, Windows Media, h264, MPEG-2 Program Stream (VOB) (common with DVDs), MPEG-2 Transport Stream (Blu-ray and Digital TV sources), MPEG-1 (VCD), Motion JPEG, DV (DV-tape camcorders and cameras), H.263 (videoconferencing and flash video), VC1 ( HD DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, and Windows Media Video 9), Indeo 3 (television-quality video), Huffyuv, and Smacker (games).","This video conversion software does not support quite as many output methods as input methods, but those it does work with are well supported in various players, including cell phones, game systems and Windows Media Player.","Prism can also support many coding options for these file types. For example, in terms of MP4 files, it can support versions that are compatible with the iPod, PSP, iPhone, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In addition, there are 14 AVI encoding options, including Microsoft and Intel Indeo compatible file types.","The most useful feature that Prism Video Format Converter offers is batch conversion. For example, we put four videos in a queue and set them all to convert while we were away from the computer. Be aware that the software cannot covert to multiple file types in batch mode. For example, we converted four MOV files to WMV files, but we could not tell the application to convert one file to WMV and another to AVI and so on.","Another practical feature of Prism Video Format Converter is the ability to change the width and height of the video to any desired proportion or to the standard 4:3 and 16:9. You can also have the video cropped to a specific size, and you can select the frame rate for the video output.","This software does lack some tools that are more common in higher-ranked video editing software, such as the ability to merge files, the capability to extract audio from a video file and the ability to add effects. For these types of features, you may want to consider video editing software rather than video conversion software. Video conversion software is more about converting file types to play on game players, cell phones and so on, rather than for editing or adding effects to videos.","We found Prism Video Format Converter fairly easy to use once we explored it for a bit. To test the software, we viewed and converted a full movie and loaded short video clips from a digital video memory card and converted them from MOV to WMV files. The movie played well on the included player and converted well, although it did take quite some time to convert on our system. Be aware that the conversion time may differ depending on the type of system you use. The video files from a digital video camera converted quickly and looked good in the new format.","NCH Software, the provider of Prism Video Format Converter, offers good documented support such as user guides and FAQs. However, it only provides personal support to those who purchase a license; free users do not get one-on-one support. Paid users can receive support, and you can also purchase a technical support plan."]},"id":"f3d578ed-5111-4a97-9880-5a0b950c060b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9a3d674d-ea7e-44cc-9850-7a173d9fa4f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We like that Prism Video Format Converter can input and decompress any file type that can be viewed using Windows Media Player.
