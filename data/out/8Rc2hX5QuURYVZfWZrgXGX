You can read the original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product&#39;s information.</em>","If you have a large room that needs to be cooled, the Frigidaire FRA256SV2 is a good choice. Unlike most <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioner</a> units that are adequate for small to medium size spaces, with a capacity of 25,000 BTUs, this AC window unit can handle up to 1,672 square feet of space. With this much power, it&#39;s important to remember that using this ac unit in a smaller space would waste energy.","This window air conditioner boasts some high-end tech features. It includes a remote control that not only lets you change the temperature automatically, it acts like a thermostat and can actually read the temperature of the room and adjust the main unit, so your room always feels perfect without the touch of a button.","You can also change the temperature directly from the digital controls. The air conditioner comes with three fan options, so you always have the right amount of cool air for the room. It features a Sleep mode that reduces noise levels and gradually increases the temperature, so you don&#39;t get too cold at night.","If you&#39;re faced with a heat wave, the Quickly Cool option lets you cool the room fast on an exceptionally hot day. You can direct the airflow in the room, so no matter where your unit is located, the air is always facing the direction you want. If you want to reset your unit, there&#39;s a  restart option that automatically resumes to your previous settings."]},"id":"146774d9-bdf5-4b5c-847c-80beb25eac98","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/5ufMGmbiehw2dLCQ8DBG4B.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57201-frigidaire-fra256sv22.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ufMGmbiehw2dLCQ8DBG4B.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"5ufMGmbiehw2dLCQ8DBG4B","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ufMGmbiehw2dLCQ8DBG4B.jpg","alt":""},"id":"3b3a6ed9-0005-4b0b-bbb9-199dbebf023d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Among its innovative features is an antibacterial filter that reduces bacteria and room odors for a cleaner environment.

In fact, it has a good Energy Star rating of 9.4, which means your wallet will feel as comfortable as you when the air conditioner is running. The 24-hour timer allows you to keep the room cool on your terms, so you reduce energy usage.","This air conditioner comes with an installation kit that has everything you&#39;ll need to safely install the unit including, adjustable side panels that extend so you can adjust the AC unit to fit your window.","The Frigidaire FRA256SV2 is a good option if you have a larger room to cool.
