For on-the-go dating, we also used their apps and evaluated them based on how user-friendly they are.","At Top Ten Reviews, we’ve been reviewing online dating services for the past fifteen years, watching them evolve and change with the times.

Setting up a profile is always free, but most of the websites we tested offered only some of their matching services free of charge. Many dating websites make you pay to view user photos and send messages. Dating apps, on the other hand, are predominantly free.

Premium options cost about $10 each month for basic service, or if you want more effective pairing with people you’re more likely to get along with for an average of $40 per month. You could also pay less if you purchase a membership for several months at a time.","What The Experts Say About Dating Sites","Julie Spira, a Los Angeles-based author, online dating expert and CEO of Cyber Dating Experts, said honesty is the key to online dating success.

It links to your Facebook. Plenty of Fish requires more effort and if you’re going through that much effort it’s because you’re desperate.”","But according to a fact sheet provided by the public relations team at Match.com, the internet was the No. 1 place where singles met their last first date in 2017, bucking any assumption that most people are just looking for hookups online. Only 14 percent of singles met their mate through friends, and 6 percent met them at a bar."]},"id":"2c3dbfb9-f678-4d5e-b8ee-ce948e2e58dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/V2J53f5XVyv2b7F6mAQpiZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/online-dating-testing/w/195/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9JL1kvODA5Mzg2L29yaWdpbmFsL09ubGluZS1EYXRpbmctVGVzdGluZy0wMDYuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2J53f5XVyv2b7F6mAQpiZ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"V2J53f5XVyv2b7F6mAQpiZ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2J53f5XVyv2b7F6mAQpiZ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"15d4806c-e07f-4e43-970b-dea933224568","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sharon Kroll and fiancé Lee Wallender are the Seattle-based writers and dating experts behind The Dating Gurus.

A study of 80 online daters found two thirds of users lied about their weight by 5 pounds or more with no correlation to whether the user was male or female. Having this knowledge in your back pocket can be useful while scrolling through Tinder or eharmony and result in more matches and long term connections.","Also, according to the Pew Research Center, public perception of online dating has become more and more positive. That being said, research is showing a lot of people use online dating as a form of entertainment and never actually intend to go on a date. The same Pew Research study found one-third of people who have used online dating services have never actually gone on a date. In short, don&#39;t be too disappointed if you find yourself striking out. It might be that there aren&#39;t a lot of people in your area looking for a meaningful connection.","If the thought of signing up for an online dating service without any help is scary, you can hire a ghostwriter to help you out. You might have even encountered some of these ghostwriters yourself and not have known it. Essentially, writers are paid to build your profile in a way that’s pleasing and more likely to get you dates. <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/sex-dating/nation/inside-the-world-of-a-dating-profile-ghostwriter\">Thrillist</a> even profiled an online dating ghostwriter who took details submitted by would-be daters and turned them into dating bios and even conversation starters. If this sounds like something you would benefit from, there are numerous services you can sign up for. ","<a href=\"https://www.vidaselect.com/\">VIDA Select</a> offers their services to men and women who feel comfortable in person but don’t usually communicate well in writing. There&#39;s also <a href=\"https://spoonmeetspoon.com/\">SpoonMeetsSpoon,</a> run by Meredith Golden. Signing up for the least expensive $200 package will give you a perfectly curated dating profile but you can pay more if you want more comprehensive help. <a href=\"https://www.profilepimpers.com/\">Pimp My Profile</a> sells a messaging package, along with profile editing that includes text and photo selection. If you find yourself at a loss for words while chatting with potential dates the service will give you three opening messages you can use to get the conversation started with the match of your choice.These companies aim to enhance the personality you already have, not totally change it. While these services can be helpful, it’s important to be honest with anyone you want to date. ","<strong>Dating Site Profile Picture Tips</strong>","One of the most nerve wracking parts of online dating (aside from literally the entire experience) is selecting which photos you&#39;ll use on your profile. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so it&#39;s a pretty important part of making a good first impression. Do you go with something that shows your adventurous side? Should you include a snapshot of your dog? Which photo will show the world you&#39;re a fun, interesting person?","Zoosk recommends showing your natural smile, citing a <a href=\"https://ebm.bmj.com/content/ebmed/early/2015/02/09/ebmed-2014-110101.full.pdf\">2015 study</a> that found people are drawn to a genuine show of pearly whites. That same study found people prefer a photo if the subject is tilting their head slightly, and if you&#39;re a woman seeking a man, make sure to incorporate the color red somewhere in your photo. If you really can&#39;t decide which photo to choose, don&#39;t be afraid to ask for a little outside help. A <a href=\"https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-017-0058-3\">2017 study</a> found people tend to pick out less favorable photos of themselves when compared to letting others choose, so go ahead and ask your friends to help you!"]},"id":"7a3be43a-5d2a-4b6a-9815-cc0dc83ba20e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/h24widiPyaR8SDnfTveSoX.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/online-dating-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9KLzAvODA5Mzg4L29yaWdpbmFsL09ubGluZS1EYXRpbmctVGVzdGluZy0wMDkuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h24widiPyaR8SDnfTveSoX.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"h24widiPyaR8SDnfTveSoX","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h24widiPyaR8SDnfTveSoX.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5e6b0ae6-4808-4239-9dd1-228f7a4f1c6d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Hinge Dating App</strong>","Since our last round of testing, the dating app <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hinge-dating-relationships/id595287172?mt=8\">Hinge</a> has gained lots of popularity. Founded in 2012, it&#39;s similar to Tinder but emphasizes matching you with people you share Facebook friends with. Once you’re out of Facebook connections, you start seeing potential matches you have fewer friends in common with. You&#39;re able to see each user&#39;s job, educational background, physical traits and a short biography. Scroll through users and select the ones you&#39;d like to get to know better. If that user likes you back, you&#39;re connected via the app&#39;s messaging platform.","Matches are location-based so you only see people near the city you set in your profile. If you travel and want to see if there are any matches in your area, you need to change where you are in your profile. The app also has a &#34;We Met&#34; section where you can leave feedback after any Hinge date. It&#39;s almost like leaving a Yelp review for a person. Users can also specify whether they have kids, want kids, have any strong religious beliefs or vices. This gives you a little more of an in-depth look at a potential mate than some dating apps. Hinge is only available as an app and it&#39;s free, but you can pay for a membership if you want extra perks like being able to use additional filters, see likes you&#39;ve received and access Hinge experts to help you along the way.<br/>","<strong>What You’re Looking For</strong>","It’s important to be upfront about what you’re looking for online. If you’re interested in something casual, free sites that require less information to sign up could work perfectly. It’s probably not worth paying for a membership if you’re not looking for anything long term and are willing to risk going on a couple of potentially bad dates. If marriage is what you’re after, then you might have better luck on paid sites that pair you with people who have the same priorities."]},"id":"b0e86a59-a52e-45f5-be55-c6ecb10c6295","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/NkRjRhWgMJ4dEwrQuNWRZN.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"A lot of dating websites and apps advertise the fact that they’re free, but be careful what you’re signing up for.

This leaves users vulnerable to chat bots, or computer programs made to trick real users into thinking they’re interacting with a real person. These programs often attempt to steal credit card or other personal information from real people.","One sign you may be chatting with a bot is that they continually urge you to buy goods and services. Bots are computer programs, which means you should also keep an eye out for odd responses or unnatural wording. While people slip up with the occasional typo, bots often phrase things strangely. Regardless of whether you think the person you’re talking to is real, never give out your credit card information; it’s not worth having your identity or money stolen.","If you’re not sure whether you&#39;re chatting with a bot, try being sarcastic; bots don’t pick up on that kind of humor. Finally, if you think you may be chatting with a bot, ask to meet in person. If they continually cite reasons why they can’t meet you, there’s a good chance that you&#39;re not talking to a real person.","<strong>Specialized Websites</strong>","We tested online dating websites and apps aimed at broad audiences, but there are many options for tailored dating experiences. If you’re looking for something specific in a mate, odds are there&#39;s a dating website or app just for that. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.colordatingapp.com/\">Color Dating</a> app allows users to focus on a specific ethnicity. <a href=\"https://www.christianmingle.com\">Christian Mingle</a> caters to singles of the Christian faith. <a href=\"https://dating.silversingles.com/\">Silver Singles</a> is a paid service for people entering their golden years who are looking for a relationship. There are also websites for people with certain medical needs. <a href=\"http://www.spectrumsingles.com/\">SpectrumSingles.com</a> is geared toward people on the autism spectrum, while <a href=\"https://www.dating4disabled.com/\">Dating4Disabled</a> is an option for people with disabilities. There are also options for people living alcohol-free lives, like <a href=\"https://singleandsober.com/\">Single and Sober.</a> It&#39;s similar to OKCupid, but its users don&#39;t drink. In short, there are plenty of online dating options, no matter what you’re looking for in life.","The League<br/>If you&#39;re willing to pay for it, <a href=\"https://www.theleague.com/\">The League</a> is a dating app that does all the work for you. You’ll need active Facebook and LinkedIn accounts to log in, and you&#39;ll be assessed based on the information you&#39;ve provided on these profiles, like your education and professional career. On top of that, you have to fill out an application and then are placed on a waiting list for an undetermined period of time that varies by the city you live in. Once you’re a member, you’ll have access to a personal concierge who does a lot of the work for you and helps curate your profile.","Part of what draws some people to The League is the ability be extremely picky about the kind of people you want to match with. You can filter not only by age and location, but also by race or even education. Then every day at 5 p.m. you&#39;ll get to see five matches and decide whether to like them or not. Each user profile displays photos, location, height, age, education, career and hobbies. If both users like each other, you can strike up a conversation on the app&#39;s messaging feature. If you want more than your allotted five matches, you&#39;ll need to upgrade your membership, which costs more. The League also hosts events and group hangouts for users who feel more comfortable meeting people that way.","The downside to this app is it&#39;s built-in elitism. It&#39;s meant to feel exclusive, and the language used in the marketing materials isn&#39;t exactly warm and fuzzy. For example, one of the website&#39;s taglines is, &#34;We do the scouting and the vetting, you do the matching and the petting.&#34; Still, if an exclusive and upscale dating app experience is what you’re looking for, The League could be for you.","Raya<br/>There&#39;s even a specialized app for creative people looking to meet other artists and creators. <a href=\"https://rayatheapp.com/\">Raya</a> is free to download but then becomes membership-based. First, you fill out an application, which is then reviewed by a committee of people and an algorithm. You may be put on a waitlist for a short time while your application is reviewed. Once you&#39;re accepted, you need to sign up for a one-, three- or six-month auto-renewing membership plan. As a member, you also have to agree to a code of conduct in an effort to keep interactions respectful and cordial. As the website puts it, it believes using technology to meet someone should feel safe and exciting. Because of its exclusivity, the app has become well-known for its famous users. We weren&#39;t able to get a membership, but several blogs and reviews circulating online claim the app has been used by the likes of Cara Delevingne, Ruby Rose and Demi Lovato.","Once you’re a member, you can look through other user photos and see a person&#39;s name, age, location and Instagram handle. User photos are set to a song of their choice, which shows a little more personality than most other dating apps. You can also browse the app&#39;s map and see which users are closest to you. It has a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars in the Apple Store and is relatively easy to use if you can get your foot in the door.","LGBTQ+<br/>One new dating scene app caters specifically to queer women. <a href=\"https://weareher.com/\">HER,</a> available for free in both the Apple App Store and Google Play, serves as a place where female-identified and non-binary people can connect to find both friends and dates. You can sign up using your Facebook or Instagram account and swipe through profiles to find people in your area. The app is also a place to coordinate and find queer events like parties and meetups. User profiles show you photos, names, a person&#39;s sexual preference and physical attributes. Much like Tinder, once you match with a person, you can chat in the app&#39;s messaging component.","There&#39;s also a user feed feature in the app that&#39;s similar to Facebook. Along with a dating profile, users post information about their day-to-day lives, likes and dislikes. One of the app&#39;s most unique features is its &#34;relationship mode,&#34; which you can turn on to let other users know you&#39;re only looking for friendship, not a date. Take note, though: The app&#39;s 3.9 out of 5 star App Store rating (as of December 2018) is far from perfect. As such, the app might not be for everyone. It also has a 2.5 star rating in Google Play, with users noting glitches in the interface. In addition, you have to pay for some features, and some people didn&#39;t like that they only found that out after downloading the app. That aside, HER is a safe online community for queer woman to connect.","Now<br/>If you’re tired of the back and forth of trying to schedule a date that works with your busy schedule, check out <a href=\"https://www.nowdating.io/\">Now</a>, an app built specifically to make that easier. Available in the Apple App Store and Google Play, it matches you with people based on your schedules. This probably isn&#39;t the best app for finding a meaningful connection, as it&#39;s based solely on you having free time simultaneously with another user, but it&#39;s a good way to schedule a lot of dates and have a lot of fun. ","The app is free and works based on your location, so you can use it to find dates while you&#39;re traveling. You need a Facebook profile to link to your dating profile, and the apps asks you to outline your intentions and hobbies in its dashboard. That’s also where you select an activity and a time frame and see if any other users are interested in meeting up with you for the date.","Now has a messaging feature, but chats are only visible for two hours if you and another user stop talking. You get four free access keys when you sign up, which increase your chances of meeting new people. If you want more, they&#39;re available for purchase. When you buy a Gold Key, you get unlimited access to all of the app&#39;s premium features for 60 hours.","Happn<br/>Have you ever crossed paths with a stranger and felt an immediate connection? Have you always regretted not introducing yourself to that cute guy in the elevator or that really funny waitress? <a href=\"https://www.happn.com/en/\">Happn</a> is a dating app that gives you a second chance with missed connections. Every time you cross paths with another person who has the app on their phone, you&#39;ll be able to view their dating profile. You can also see how many times you&#39;ve crossed paths with a person and if you don&#39;t want to match with them, you can simply remove that profile from your timeline. If you&#39;ve found someone you&#39;d like to get to know more you can like them with the app&#39;s heart button, and if the feeling is mutual, you&#39;ll be able to message back and forth.","The app is free and there is no desktop version. You can purchase credits separately in the app or pay monthly for the premium version, which lacks any ads and lets you see who has liked you, among other features. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars in the Apple app store, and some user reviews note the app can be very confusing in busy urban areas, like New York City. We&#39;re guessing it&#39;s also not very effective in less populated rural areas, as it relies on a lot of people having the app on their phone. You can also play the app&#39;s built-in game CrushTime, which lets you guess who has liked you from four profiles you&#39;ve recently crossed paths with.","Be a Wingman<br/>The dating app <a href=\"http://www.wingmanapp.com/\">Wingman</a> takes matchmaking into the 21st century. With this app, you can create a dating profile for your friend and tell the world how amazing they are. Along with selecting the most flattering photos of your friend, you get to write their bio. It can be hard to self-promote and this app eliminates that problem. Once you set up a profile, the app is pretty similar to Tinder; you simply swipe through user profiles to find folks you think might be compatible with your friend. Like the profile you created, those you flip through are monitored and used by the friends of the person actually going on the date. If they think it’s a match that might work, you can facilitate a conversation or a meet-up.","With Wingman, there’s no need for any more embarrassing blind dates. This also means if things don’t go well at first, your friend never has to know about their online dating fail and can simply look for more fish in the sea. The app is free to download, and you need to verify yourself as a wingman to get your friend set up. It went live in 2017 and is currently available for both Android and iOS. However, there isn&#39;t a desktop version.","Badoo<br/>Owned by the same company as Bumble, you’re likely to find a date among <a href=\"https://badoo.com/\">Badoo’s</a> more than 400 million users. It is a little different than the dating apps we reviewed. Instead of uploading your own information, you select a photo of a celebrity or famous person. The app then shows you other users who look similar. Your pool of potential dates will probably be smaller because of this, but you&#39;ll definitely find them attractive. You then scroll through those user profiles and decide whether to &#34;like&#34; them or pass. You can see each user&#39;s age, interests and several photos. If a user you&#39;ve liked likes you back, you can then message each other and decide whether you want to meet up. More than 350 million messages are sent via the app every day, and there are 300,000 new daily signups, making it incredibly popular.","If you&#39;re looking for a deeper connection, this app probably isn&#39;t for you, as it&#39;s based purely on physical traits. This means you might not really connect with a person despite liking how they look. On the other hand, it could be a lot of fun going out for dinner with someone who looks like the celebrity you&#39;ve always had a crush on.","Clover<br/><a href=\"https://clover.co/\">Clover</a> is a little bit like Tinder and a little bit like OKCupid. You can login with your Facebook and then add more information about your appearance and reason for using the app. For example, you can choose from several “intentions” including “looking for dating” or “looking for people to chat with.” Clover uses your location to find you dates in the area, so like most location-based dating apps, it won’t work well if you live in a rural area with a small population. Once you’ve logged in you’re prompted to start a free 7-day trial or sign up for either 3 months or 1 year of service. With a paid membership you can see read receipts on your messages, share photos and videos and get access to advanced filters for your potential matches like income and ethnicity. You can also opt out and just use the free membership if you’d prefer.","This app lets you scroll through potential matches for as long as you’d like. It displays a person&#39;s photo, age, name, physical attributes and intention right up front, but lacks any kind of personalization or biography. You’ve got to show your personality through photos alone. There are also mixers within the app that divide users up by their interests and intentions, like healthy lifestyles, serious relationships only or even “cute pets.” Once you join a mixer you can scroll through message boards and see what other users are talking about or trade information to keep chatting.","The layout of the site is fun and colorful with a focus on photos. Overall it’s a bit complicated to use, but generally not bad once you get the hang of it. It allows you to find a match based on common interests and doesn’t limit the number of swipes you get, making it a great free dating app.","Sugar Babies<br/>We couldn’t give you an extensive guide to online dating without mentioning sugar babies. This term is slang – usually for younger women who use online dating services to match with older, wealthier men who provide them with financial support in some way. This has become an increasingly popular way for young people to help ease the burden of student loan debt.","For instance, the date for pay website <a href=\"https://www.seeking.com/\">SeekingArrangement</a> released <a href=\"https://www.seeking.com/sugar-baby-university/usa\">a report</a> in March 2019 that found that there are more than 2.7 million students in the United States who have used the website to help pay for college. Broken down by college, Georgia State University is the fastest growing sugar baby school. With websites like SeekingArrangement, users are on the same page in terms of what each party is seeking: one is there for companionship and the ability to help take care of someone while the other is there for companionship as well as financial stability.","SeekingArrangement is skewed toward young women seeking older men, though there are other websites and apps available as well. While the name of <a href=\"https://www.whatsyourprice.com/\">WhatsYourPrice</a> might seem a little too on the nose, it has options available for both men and women to bid on potential dates. <a href=\"https://www.happymatches.com/register\">Happy Matches</a> has a plethora of options for women seeking to financially support someone, as does <a href=\"https://www.sugarelite.com/\">Sugar Elite.</a> However, it does cost money to use many of these services.","Refrigerdating<br/>No, we’re not kidding. You know those fancy new fridges that pair with a smartphone app to show you the contents of your fridge while you’re away from home? Now there’s a dating app that goes along with that, allowing you to find a mate based upon the contents of their fridge. Samsung&#39;s $3,000 Family Hub refrigerator now has a dating app, <a href=\"https://www.refrigerdating.com/about\">Refrigerdating,</a> where you can browse user profiles with information not only about their personalities, but their fridges. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/well/family/can-your-refrigerator-improve-your-dating-life.html?action=click&amp;module=Discovery&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a> reported that&#39;s how creator John Stonehill met his wife of nine years; he perused the contents of her fridge the first chance he got. He helped develop the app for Samsung, which launched in early 2019.","While this is the only app of its kind we know if right now, we can only assume other high tech fridges will be coming out with their own versions soon. Samsung&#39;s website details the many ways in which the kinds of food you have speak volumes about your personality. A fridge full of protein shakes and fruits, for example, speaks to a healthy lifestyle. Someone with a lot of dairy products and containers full of sweets might really enjoy baking. These are aspects of a person’s life important when it comes to finding a long term partner, but we have to admit, it might be a little weird looking through fridges. Let us know how it goes.","<strong>Religion in Dating</strong>","There are a lot of dating websites and apps out there that offer services to members of a specific religion. Whether you consider yourself a devout follower of a certain church or just feel spiritual, there’s a dating app out there where you can find like-minded people.","<a href=\"https://www.mutual.app/\">Mutual</a> is a free dating app for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You set up a profile, and then the app works similarly to Tinder. If two people express an interest in each other while swiping through user profiles, they&#39;re matched and able to start chatting. There&#39;s even a &#34;double take&#34; feature where you can get a second chance to swipe right on a profile if you accidentally skip it while scrolling. Facebook is required in order for you to use the app. This is to help eliminate the presence of fake profiles or bots.","<a href=\"https://www.firstmet.com/dating/baptist\">FirstMet,</a> formerly known as AYI, is a place for Baptist singles to meet and mingle. You can use filters to find the kind of person you&#39;re interested in through the website or free app. The website claims it has connected over 25 million singles.","<a href=\"https://jswipeapp.com/\">JSwipe</a> is a Jewish dating app. You upload photos of yourself and scroll through other user profiles in the hopes of matching. This app is unique in that your matches expire in 18 days, so you&#39;ve got to start chatting and schedule a date quickly. Everything is free to use but you can pay extra for &#34;super swipes&#34; to show a person you&#39;re extremely interested in them. This is a location-based app, so it&#39;s likely to work best in large cities.","There is also <a href=\"https://www.jwmatch.com/s/\">JWMatch</a> for Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, <a href=\"https://www.catholicsingles.com/catholic-dating-app/\">Catholic Singles</a> for Catholics and <a href=\"https://www.helahel.com/\">Helahel,</a> a Muslim dating website for those looking for marriage.","<strong>Online Dating Research</strong><br/><br/>Even though it might feel like online dating is mostly about luck, academics have been studying it for some time now. In fact, the longer online dating continues to evolve the more information there is to study. Of the romantic partnerships formed in the United States between 2007 and 2009, 21 percent of heterosexual couples and 61 percent of same-sex couples met online, according to a study by Stanford sociology professor Michael J. Rosenfeld and reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/fashion/online-dating-as-scientific-research.html\">New York Times.</a> While this might make you feel like your online dating habits are on display, the fact that they’re being studied can actually be really helpful. For example, one <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2176200-hey-short-messages-are-the-best-dating-site-strategy-study-says/\">2018 study</a> from the University of Michigan found the best way to start a  successful conversation is to simply say &#34;hey.&#34; That same study found both men and women tend to aim high in online dating, messaging matches who were on average 25 percent more attractive than they were. If you feel like most of the people you match with don&#39;t end of looking like they do in their profile, there&#39;s science to back that up. <a href=\"http://collablab.northwestern.edu/CollabolabDistro/nucmc/p449-hancock.pdf\">A study</a> of 80 online daters found two thirds of users lied about their weight by 5 pounds or more with no correlation to whether the user was male or female. Having this knowledge in your back pocket can be useful while scrolling through Tinder or eharmony and result in more matches and long term connections."]},"id":"232440fc-85b5-418b-95db-7f8b56357463","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_263","url":"/best-online-dating-sites","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-04T23:59:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-04T23:59:00Z","name":"Best Online Dating Sites and Apps of 2019","synopsis":"Through an online dating service, you can quickly find singles with your same interests.
