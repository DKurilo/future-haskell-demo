You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Toshiba Symbio BDX6400 is a 3D <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a> and media box that allows you to surf the web and gives you access to a handful of different video streaming apps. The small player has a clean, simple design with rounded edges and play, stop, eject and power buttons on the front panel.","However, the simplicity should not be correlated with a total lack of features. In fact, this Blu-ray player offers video streaming apps such as Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, CinemaNow, Hulu Plus and Picasa, just to name a few. All of these media streaming apps can be accessed through the ePortal, as long as you are connected to the internet.","Like many of the top rated Blu-ray players that we have reviewed, the BDX6400 is DLNA certified. With DLNA certification, you will be able to share digital content between your Blu-ray player and your smartphone, tablet or PC as long as those devices have DLNA technology as well.","With the built-in WiFi that this player boasts, you will be able to use Miracast screen-mirroring technology to display what is on your smartphone right onto your TV screen. You can also download mobile apps that will let you control your Blu-ray with your mobile device. The mobile remote control app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices.","Even though this player supports full 1080p high-definition video and a plethora of streaming apps, it does miss on some features that you will find in our best Blu-ray players. The BDX6400 is unable to convert 2D movies to 3D quality, and this player does not play DivX formatted videos."]},"id":"66fc44b5-3152-48f0-8043-899f0422a4e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9866af15-f15e-4c1d-a5e3-3d3946658c89","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This truly is a solid 3D Blu-ray player with lots of different streaming apps at the helm for your convenience.
