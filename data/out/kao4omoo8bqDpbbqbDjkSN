The CleanView Pet Vacuum from Bissell has offers useful cleaning tools that can take care of pet messes at an affordable price.","This budget vacuum cleaner features a Helix cleaning system that uses powerful airflow to separate fine dust from larger particles and force them to the bottom of the collection canister. This system keeps damaging grit out of the motor and reduces clogged filters, which in turn can prolong the life of your machine.","The CleanView Pet has multi-stage filtration that will help keep dust from being re-distributed in your home after you vacuum. The filter chamber in the dirt collection cup and the pre-motor filter keep the motor free of fine dust. Exhaust air passes through a third filter before leaving the vacuum.","This model comes with a crevice tool, a combination dusting brush and upholstery tool, an extension wand for increased reach and Bissell&#39;s Pet TurboEraser tool. This narrow rotating brush attachment is made of hair-attracting rubber and attaches to the vacuum to remove pet hair and dirt from carpets and furniture. It&#39;s especially convenient for stairs and above-floor surfaces.","The floor nozzle on the CleanView Pet vacuum is a generous 15 inches wide, with dual edge cleaning so you can clean close to walls and furniture. The soft bumper on the base keeps your walls and furniture safe from accidental impact. It has five height adjustment settings, so it will work well on a variety of carpeted and hard surfaces. Although you can&#39;t turn off the brush roll on this model, one of the height settings is for bare floors.","There is an auto-rewind feature for the power cord. When you&#39;re finished vacuuming, just press the button on the top of the reel and the cord stores itself quickly out of the way. This vacuum also has a headlight to help you see any large or hard debris that might damage the belt. This is a nice bonus, as many budget vacuums don&#39;t include a headlight.","Maintenance on this vacuum is standard for a bagless machine. You will need to clean the dirt cup after each use. The filters are rinsable and will need to cleaned about every three months. Occasionally you will also need to change the belt. Bissell backs the CleanView Pet with a three year warranty.","The Bissell Rewind CleanView Pet Vacuum has a generously wide cleaning path and on-board tools designed to clean up after pets. With the headlight and automatic cord rewind, it  offers features that most other budget vacuums don&#39;t.  For the money, this is a great value and offers  powerful cleaning at a low price."]},"id":"f0d8b272-29d4-4f40-b337-a243e1fbda85","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59989","url":"/bissell-rewind-cleanview-pet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-15T16:14:38Z","datePublished":"2014-07-15T16:14:38Z","name":"Bissell Rewind CleanView Pet","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
