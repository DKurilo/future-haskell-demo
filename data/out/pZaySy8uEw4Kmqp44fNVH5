It lacked a little in terms of suction, though. We spread kitty litter, flour and sawdust onto two different types of carpeting and a strip of hardwood flooring to see how the vacuum cleaners handled different cleaning scenarios. The Simplicity Wonder removed all of the messes but took a few more passes than competitors in some cases. It struggled on sawdust more than most, so that might make it less helpful for clearing lightweight messes like lint, cereal and pet hair. It cleaned up the kitty litter in just a few passes, though, on all of the surfaces. For a unit with even more suction, check out the <a href=\"/dyson-review\">Dyson Cinetic</a>. ","This was one of the best canister vacuum cleaners for maneuverability, though. It was easy to get it around corners and over obstacles to access different areas of our test lab. It tied for having the longest cord, too, so there is no need to constantly plug into a new outlet as you work your way around your home&#39;s floor.","This is one of the bagged models, and they are generally more helpful to allergy sufferers than the bagless style because they are designed to trap allergens. The bag on this unit is specifically made to trap pollens and dust – it is made of HEPA media and is self-sealing. It was also pretty easy to detach this bag without creating a big dust cloud. The drawback with this and any bagged model is you have to keep buying bags for the life of the machine. It can be worth it if you are sensitive to allergens, though.","This Simplicity canister vacuum comes with a three-year warranty – about average when compared to the others. Customer support also is about average. Service representatives responded to our inquiries, although not all that quickly."]},"id":"982b0edf-e7e8-4ded-9aad-61765387fef4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f326babc-f9fb-4801-ba65-78775b25fac9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Simplicity Wonder was able to clean all of our test messes on all different surfaces, though it did need a few more passes in most tests than the best canister vacuum cleaners.
