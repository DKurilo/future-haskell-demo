You want a unit that can heat oil to the proper temperature for frying and then maintain that heat. Of course, once you submerge cold or raw food into a vat of hot oil, the temperature drops slightly, so it&#39;s important that it quickly returns to the original temperature.","The Waring Professional deep fryer worked so well for us that after we tested all of the fryers, we pulled this one out to finish cooking the leftover food. The initial wait time to allow the fryer to heat the oil was about 15 minutes, which can seem like an eternity when you’re craving French fries, but there are other fryers that take even longer to preheat. Besides, this is a large capacity electric deep fryer, so you have to expect a longer wait time while it heats a gallon of oil.","We dipped 6 ounces of breaded chicken strips into the hot oil and waited. After draining the chicken in the basket and transferring to paper towels, we pulled the strips apart and dug in. The breading was crisp all around and crunchy in some spots. The meat was tender, moist, fully cooked and full of flavor.","We cut up a potato, soaked the fries in cold water and then patted the strips dry. A long bath in the hot oil crisped up the fries and cooked them through. When we pulled the baskets out, we found that the French fries were golden brown and perfect. Onto a paper towel-lined baking sheet they went and were sprinkled with salt. The fries were just as you&#39;d want them: crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.","It did take quite a while for the oil to return to the proper temperature after adding food to the fryer, but the temperature didn’t dip low enough to create an issue in the cooking process. You can adjust the thermostat by simply pressing a button, and the deep fryer beeps to let you know when the oil has come to temperature. The Waring Professional deep fryer uses 1,800 watts of power, so it can heat up the large vat of oil as quickly as possible."]},"id":"2cd05852-bce6-400d-88a3-9e39f52e671c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"701d95b2-9e47-4cab-b3f4-b17f6b804e51","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/VMPk2tMgh3WRjgYNuSjUJ7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58986-waring-df55-professional5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VMPk2tMgh3WRjgYNuSjUJ7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"VMPk2tMgh3WRjgYNuSjUJ7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VMPk2tMgh3WRjgYNuSjUJ7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"adccc9b3-9fa2-4cf6-894b-849db8db4a4b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We had no problem going from unboxing to frying with the Waring Professional deep fryer. It is an intuitive appliance that is even easier to use than others in our lineup because of the digital display, built-in timer and more.","Cleaning the unit is easy enough, but it&#39;s more time-consuming than other fryers because it doesn’t include a mess-free way to drain the oil. Once the oil has cooled, you have to pour it into a separate container and try to avoid dripping as you move the oily deep fryer vat to the sink or dishwasher.","We liked that Waring included three baskets for deep frying food with this unit. There are two small baskets that you can seat side by side in the fryer, so you can fry, say, sweet potato fries in one basket and regular fries in the other. A single large basket is included to give you more space for frying one type of food, like chicken or fish.","The power light and ready light were helpful, in addition to the beeping, to let us know when the deep fat fryer was ready to go. The timer also made deep frying a cinch, although we never abandoned the fryer while we were cooking; it took the guesswork out of knowing when the food was ready – and we didn’t have to watch a clock, check our phone or set a separate timer. The viewing window can be helpful for you to check the level of browning on your food without lifting the lid, except we found it fogged up most of the time.","The lack of an oil drain and storage container kept the Waring Professional from a near-perfect score, but it earned high marks in spite of those missing pieces."]},"id":"03841c07-438f-4d0a-b9ce-37862ef7b9ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience &amp; Safety"},"id":"05522386-5e47-40ca-b883-1bcaa23535c7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/4F7StCop8M5i4bwKEuQqEQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58986-waring-df55-professional2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4F7StCop8M5i4bwKEuQqEQ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4F7StCop8M5i4bwKEuQqEQ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4F7StCop8M5i4bwKEuQqEQ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1c6a8c9b-e386-4544-b0af-e194219d6494","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It&#39;s vital to remember that safety comes first when frying.

The lid that sits atop the fryer is vented, so it allows steam to escape, but it keeps the oil inside.
