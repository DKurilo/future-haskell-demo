In our most recent testing, we spent more than 35 hours comparing either programs to see how the best options stack up. Our testers have artistic backgrounds, so they could note the features that made programs easier to use. Testers also determined whether a program was better-suited for beginners or advanced users, or both. We sought, whenever possible, to compare the same features against each other to see which performed the best. It was important to us to find programs that were easy to use and provided the most creative freedom. We also wanted to find software that worked well for beginning artists.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We initially chose nine programs that had positive user reviews. We then downloaded and tested these programs to compare them against each other. Our testers used each program to create short comics, which let them gauge the capabilities of each product. After testing, we realized that one of the contenders didn’t fit with the others so we narrowed down our list to eight programs. We made lists of the features and tools, and we found that software that has more illustration or character tools, text options and design features typically gave us more creative freedom and therefore scored better. We also paid attention to the cost of these comic book programs and gave more points to more affordable options.","<br/>There are two types of comic book software on the market. One type expects you to draw every aspect of your comics and is designed for aspiring or talented artists. The other kind requires little to no drawing skills and simply has you dragging, dropping and placing premade characters in premade scenes. Both can be fun and can provide hours of entertainment. We covered both types of programs in our testing.","We gave higher scores to programs that also provided graphic libraries for characters, backgrounds and page layouts. Programs that not only provided more options, but also had varied and aesthetically pleasing styles scored higher. Since a graphics tablet and pen make it easier to create characters and paint backgrounds, drawing programs that weren&#39;t only graphics tablet compatible but also made drawing and painting natural-looking scored better in our rating system.","Since the types of files you can work with greatly affects your finished project, we scored programs higher if they were compatible with the most common image file types including JPEG, PSD, TIFF, PDF and PNG. We also tested the sharing capabilities offered by each program by emailing comics or posting them through Facebook. Programs that successfully shared our creations without a hitch scored higher.","<strong>How Much Does Comic Book Software Cost?</strong>","Comic book software prices vary depending on the number and type of tools and features you want. Skill level is an appropriate measurement, as is how far you want to go as a comic book artist. We found there are plenty of introductory and beginning programs and apps that cost anywhere from less than $10 all the way up to $50, while professional programs can cost up to $400. If you are shopping for comic book software for a child, we recommend starting with a cheaper program, so they can try out comic book creation before you dig deep into your wallet. If you want professional software to grow into, we recommend Clip Studio Paint. It comes in two versions, with Pro costing around $50 and EX costing from $90 to $150 – depending on the deal you can find. ","<strong>Things to Consider with Comic Book Software</strong>","There are many factors to consider when looking for comic book software and ways to publish your work. Whether you are an experienced artist or someone who just loves creating comics, here are some tips for you:<br/><br/>Submitting Your Work<br/>Keep in mind that most comic giants, like Marvel Comics and DC Entertainment, tend to employ their own artists and storytellers and do not accept submissions. You can, however, submit your work to a number of publishing companies, like <a href=\"https://www.darkhorse.com/Company/Submissions\">Dark Horse Comics</a>. When sending your work to a publisher, make sure to follow the company&#39;s submission guidelines if you want your creations to be taken seriously. These companies receive so many submissions that anything that deviates from their instructions can give them the reason they need to throw your work out.","If you get turned down a few times, don&#39;t despair. Many successful authors and artists were rejected multiple times before getting their work published – Jim Lee, Brandon Sanderson, J.K. Rowling, Stephen King, and Walt Disney to name a few. So don&#39;t give up!","Self-Publication<br/>If you&#39;re just wanting to create your own web comics or self-publish your own comic books, this is the age to do it in! Publishing your work gives you the freedom to truly create what you envision instead of following a company&#39;s rules. It can take a lot of work to actually get noticed, so you&#39;ll need to practice your networking skills. Many artists do this by attending comic conventions and pitching their stories to attending publishers and authors, posting about their work on social media and selling their work in local comic and book stores. Keep in mind that networking and pitching are time-consuming, exhausting and difficult, but it can really pay off.","There are also plenty of online indie publishing options for you to use, including Amazon&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.comixology.com/\">ComiXology</a>, <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/\">Gumroad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/103\">Diamond Comic Distributors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/?ref=nav\">Kickstarter</a>. So get out there and make this happen!","Comic Book &amp; Manga Tools<br/>The most important illustration tools are the brushes that come with a program. This includes mediums like markers, pens, and pencils. The best programs also allow you to create your own brushes so you can achieve your desired effects. The best comic book software allows you to import outside sources so you can use sketches, characters, and backgrounds that you have created in other programs or scanned. If you aren’t much of an artist or you want to save some time, look for software that comes with vast character libraries, making it easier for you to jump into creating comics.","Most programs allow you to add text to your comics. A few of them provide additional tools like font choices or word balloons to enhance your scenes. If you’ve already written your dialogue in another document, it is nice having a program that can import text. Spelling errors and poor word choice can seriously detract from your narrative, which is why it is best to choose a program that comes with a spell checker and a dictionary. Unfortunately, only a few programs offer this last feature. We recommend using a word processor program to write and spell check your dialogue, then copy and paste the text into your comic.","Digital Painting Tools<br/>Creating comics digitally is more convenient than traditional methods, especially when you factor in the ability to work in layers and compatibility with graphics tablets. Layers allow you to view, select and enhance specific parts of your art so it is easier to edit. If you are planning to create your own characters from scratch, choose programs that work with graphics tablets – they make it easier to create backgrounds and characters. Premade page templates and special effects can inspire story ideas, as well as help you frame your scenes quickly.","The best programs allow you to work with many file types, as well as export your creations to a variety of image file types. The more options you have, the more you can do with your artwork. The most common image file types include JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, TGA, PICT and PDF.","Tutorials &amp; Support<br/>If you aren’t sure about a program, check to see if it offers a trial version. Most of the programs we tested do, and it is a great way to see if you like using a program before you spend your hard-earned money on it. Since computer programs tend to offer so many features and tools, it is best to choose a program that offers strong customer support. The most important tools when you start using new software are an active user community or forum and plenty of written and video tutorials, whether they were created by the company or devoted users. Sometimes, devoted users know more about the software&#39;s uses than the company’s support staff does.","<strong>Ways to Get Over a Creative Block</strong>","Here are a few tips to help you feel motivated and inspired when you’re having a creative block:"]},"id":"df0c8fc2-a0d1-4aff-9831-6c27d6c3a06e","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Get out and experience something new.
