You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Knocking on the door of our award winners for best <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray players</a> is the Panasonic DMP-BDT310. This device is sleek, affordable and chock-full of the features we look for in the best 3D Blu-ray players.","The 3D playback on this player is excellent. If you connect this device to a 3D-capable TV or monitor, you will have no problem viewing 3D content – that is, if you have the proper 3D glasses. This player does not come with glasses, but none of the players we reviewed do. However, many of the 3D-capable monitors come with one or two sets of glasses.","The Panasonic DMP-BDDT310 is a plug-and-play device, and you can pretty much plug it into any digital display device designed in the last five years. This is because its connectivity array has most of the digital terminals found on mainstream media devices. Terminals featured on this 3D Blu-ray player include HDMI, USB, SD card slots and Ethernet.","Furthermore, you can connect this unit to a Panasonic AV receiver if you wish to use legacy analog audio equipment. We would have preferred that analog terminals be included on the device itself. If you have a state-of-the-art audio system that connects digitally, this unit is fine. However, if you have a home theater system with audio connectivity that&#39;s more than five or six years old, you must purchase an AV receiver or other such device to connect older equipment to this 3D Blu-ray player.","A few years ago, Panasonic introduced new technology in its HD television sets called Vierra connect. This feature is Panasonic&#39;s vehicle for connecting its home electronic components to the internet for the purpose of accessing the web&#39;s most popular services. This Panasonic 3D Blu-ray player includes Vierra Connect, and you don&#39;t have to have a Panasonic HD television to use it. This player gives you access to popular services such as Hulu Plus, YouTube, Amazon Instant Video, Netflix and more. While none of these apps have the capability of utilizing 3D technology, it&#39;s quite convenient to stream content without purchasing a physical disc or even the content itself. While some of these services charge a fee, there are also worlds of content available on the internet that you don&#39;t have to pay one penny for."]},"id":"683e47c9-d47b-408b-b2c9-353f73083e8d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ec22cb79-229d-47a2-8d6c-f2ab7ae5dc9a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a great 3D Blu-ray Player.
