We specifically looked at companies that had Amazon ratings of 4 starts or higher to determine which products to focus on. User comments were another source of information, as they included pros and cons for each product with tips from a parent&#39;s perspective.","Safety was one of our biggest concerns when comparing baby wraps. Most companies provide written or video instructions to teach you how to keep your baby safe when wrapped up. They also demonstrate which positions to avoid and teach you warning signals to look for that might indicate your child is too warm or smothered. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","Since safety was such an important part of our evaluation, we scored baby wraps higher if the companies provided comprehensive safety instructions. The best companies provide video instructions to teach you the proper way to use your wrap as well as warning signals to look for that could indicate that your child is being smothered.","Another big concern was a wrap&#39;s versatility. We looked for slings that allow you to carry your baby in various positions, since this is more likely to keep you and your baby happy. We also chose companies that provided a wider range of colors and designs, since they were more likely to fit individual tastes.","The number of fabrics a company provides is also important, since specific fabric types are better at keeping the baby comfortable at different times of the year. Being machine washable was by far the most important convenience feature. Many need to be air-dried; products that could be machine dried and ironed scored higher. Baby wraps with a higher weight limit allow you to use them longer as your child grows, so this was also a feature we scored. Additionally, we scored products higher if the company demonstrated various carrying styles that work best for different age groups.","A 1986 Canadian pediatric study found that babies carried in baby wraps for at least three hours a day cried 43 percent to 54 percent less during evening hours. These wraps can also be helpful for babies with colic, as it keeps them upright so milk and stomach acid stay in the stomach and gas can be released. The positioning of the baby within the sling can promote proper hip and leg development and lessens pressure on the back of the baby&#39;s head. Additionally, parents can burn up to 300 calories by wearing their baby for a few hours each day.","The most common securing methods are sewn loops, buckle rings, and wrap-around tie-offs. If you are constantly on the go, you want to find a wrap you and your baby can get into quickly. This depends on which securing method you find easiest to use.","In addition, some wraps are more versatile than others, so consider which carrying positions you want to use before purchasing a wrap. The positions you can carry your baby in typically depend on your baby&#39;s age. Companies provide wrapping instructions and videos as well as safety tips to keep baby happy.","Baby wraps are meant to be convenient. Look for wraps that are machine washable and easy to wear. Many baby wraps need to be air-dried, so it can be nice to have two on hand when one gets dirty. The size of your baby wrap typically corresponds with your pre-pregnancy weight, not the weight of the baby. Look for a baby wrap that can hold its position while giving a decent amount of stretch, as this helps keep baby secure and cozy.","id:1200"]},"id":"ddebe59a-995d-491d-aefe-c9456398f520","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_79","url":"/best-baby-wraps","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-01-12T21:35:02Z","datePublished":"2018-01-12T21:35:02Z","name":"Best Baby Wraps of 2018","synopsis":"Many medical professionals believe baby wearing provides numerous benefits not only for the parent but also for the baby.","review":{},"strapline":"Many medical professionals believe baby wearing provides numerous benefits not only for the parent but also for the baby.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-26T00:16:09Z","id":"mDreBHYBkeRTBG3EyoNzsW","meta":{"title":"Best Baby Wraps of 2018 - Newborn ‘Sling’ Carrier Reviews","description":"Many medical professionals believe baby wearing provides numerous benefits not only for the parent but also for the baby."},"products":[{"slug":"baby-ktan-breeze","url":"/product/baby-ktan-breeze","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","name":"Baby K'Tan BREEZE","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","id":"i7guhYJjEc2vQd6CWtLXWo","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"moby-wrap-classic","url":"/product/moby-wrap-classic","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","name":"Moby Wrap Classic","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","id":"PM4AY9Z5gEfh45hHTuLdac","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"zolowear-pleated-cotton","url":"/product/zolowear-pleated-cotton","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","name":"Zolowear Pleated Cotton","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","id":"buPpN8GS9UtFP7Uj8whdug","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/AQm3pBxNiHpZ4jup8L63vF.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Baby-Wraps.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/9/740493/original/Hero-Baby-Wraps.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","id":"AQm3pBxNiHpZ4jup8L63vF","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQm3pBxNiHpZ4jup8L63vF.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Baby Wraps of 2018","description":"Many medical professionals believe baby wearing provides numerous benefits not only for the parent but also for the baby."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/AQm3pBxNiHpZ4jup8L63vF.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Baby-Wraps.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/9/740493/original/Hero-Baby-Wraps.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","id":"AQm3pBxNiHpZ4jup8L63vF","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQm3pBxNiHpZ4jup8L63vF.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Baby Wraps of 2018","description":"Many medical professionals believe baby wearing provides numerous benefits not only for the parent but also for the baby."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"kids","url":"/home-and-garden/kids","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","name":"Kids","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:58Z","id":"xYhTaiXmFXabjKdL2UuTXL","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
