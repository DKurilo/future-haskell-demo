Definitive Technology ProMonitor 800 <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1274-best-bookshelf-speakers.html\">bookshelf speaker</a> offers a variety of different options for speaker placement within your home. It has a built-in wall mount on the back of the speaker, and you can purchase separate floor stands for the speakers to sit on or simply place them on a flat surface such as a bookshelf. The small size of these bookcase speakers is also intriguing. Each speaker is only 8.4 inches tall and weighs just 3 pounds. The small size gives you the option to fit these speakers in tight spaces better than others within our lineup.","These small bookshelf speakers carry an 8-ohm load and have a sensitivity rating of 89dB. The best bookshelf speakers we reviewed have sensitivity levels of 90dB or above, but the ProMonitor 800 still doesn&#39;t need a powerful amplifier to work properly.","Due to this speaker’s small size, the low-end response isn’t as impressive as speakers with a larger woofer. The frequency response range is 57Hz to 50kHz, showing high promise within high frequency ranges. This speaker displays good mids and high frequency response that’s detailed and clear. By design, these are satellite speakers, also known as surrounds. Other bookshelf speakers we have reviewed have enough power and punch to serve as mains as well as surrounds. If you plan to use these as your main speakers, we recommend coupling them with a dedicated subwoofer.","A single 4.5-inch BDSS midrange driver and a pure aluminum dome tweeter drive all the sound. As a result, the speaker simply does not have the driver size to push prominent bass, but its smaller driver allows the device to remain compact.","On the back of the speaker you will find the two-way binding posts. Some of the other speakers we reviewed give you more connectivity options with five-way binding posts, but this is only a minor disadvantage. The ProMonitor 800 is available in both black and white finishes."]},"id":"b4fabf9b-65b6-4951-9c84-c04f581b6184","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d431bde1-d908-4259-b574-4a8ee45543c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Definitive Technology ProMonitor 800 is a solid satellite speaker that can complement your floor standing speakers.
