You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Aventage Series is a premium line of <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a> from Yamaha. Representing this series in our review is the Yamaha Aventage RX-A720. This receiver offers exceptional performance, a plethora of ports and a nice balance of features. The technical support is responsive and helpful when problems arise.","This receiver has dynamic performance thanks to its smooth sound quality, the high signal-to-noise-ratio of 100 dB, a broad frequency response of 10Hz–100kHz and a Burr-Brown digital-to-analog converter. The receiver supports seven-channel surround sound and two subwoofers. A total harmonic distortion of 0.09 percent reduces audible distortion when the volume is up. The Aventage RX-A720 also has peak power output and continuous power output both reaching 90 watts, giving the system enough power to drive your home theater speakers.","There is no shortage of I/O ports on this digital receiver. The unit comes with six HDMI inputs and one HDMI output with audio return channel capability, which sends sound from your compatible TV back to the receiver using the same cable. Yamaha offers a USB add-on to give the Aventage RX-A720 Wi-Fi functionality, but it also has an Ethernet port for wired connections. A front USB port lets you connect compatible flash drives and MP3 players to access digital music files.","The Yamaha Aventage RX-A720 also has many legacy connections such as component, composite, optical and coaxial ports. The receiver has a front headphone jack for your private music sessions. There are also ports for AM/FM radio antennas.","A full feature set makes this one of the best receivers on the market today. There is compatibility for all of your video devices, from 1080p video scaling to 3D and the next-generation 4K Ultra HD video resolution. A network media server gives you access to the music libraries of the computers connected to your home network as well as internet radio services. There are Android and iOS remote control apps for a great user experience. The receiver offers full support for Apple AirPlay as well as a physical connection for your iPod or iPad. Other features include an optional Bluetooth add-on and automatic speaker calibration. The Aventage RX-A720 also supports dynamic volume, which gives you the right balance of sound, even with low volume, and the full range of audio decoders from Dolby and DTS.","The technical support from Yamaha includes phone and email support, a user guide and product FAQs. The real highlight of the support is the three-year warranty of the Aventage series. This is the only series by Yamaha to carry a three-year warranty instead of their standard two-year warranty for other receivers. The support staff responded quickly to our request concerning the unit."]},"id":"1430d14a-acb5-40a0-9dfb-112256de2785","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ef25f866-f6bb-43e9-8ad8-da856fc0732f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The entry-level model for the Yamaha Aventage series has beautiful sound and great performance specifications.
