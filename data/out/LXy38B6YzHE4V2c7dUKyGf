The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA Testing Kits</a> here.</em>","The TestCountry DNA Paternity Test provides 99.999 percent accuracy in paternal identification. Whether you’re living in the United States or abroad, TestCountry will accept your samples as long as you follow the procedures outlined in the paternity test kit. Results are provided in the most discreet way, through a notarized report. In fact, the packaging itself is confidential for both the test kit and the results. In other words, you won’t be raising any red flags when TestCountry sends you something in the mail.","Paternity DNA tests are conducted through the analysis of your buccal swabs, which can be collected through a cheek swab of both the alleged father and the child. TestCountry can also analyze blood, if you’d prefer. Once you’ve collected the samples (the process is pretty straightforward and simple), you send the pre-addressed envelope back to the lab with the samples. The lab specialists identify 16 different genetic markers for comparison in order to provide a nearly perfect accuracy rating in their analysis.","The TestCountry laboratory is accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), meaning that it has passed the association’s rigorous standards for proper handling of patient data and samples. The College of American Pathologists Proficiency Testing also reviewed and accredited the lab, which provides another endorsement of TestCountry’s legitimacy and reliability.","If you’re ordering from out of the United States, you can visit the company’s website at testcountry.com and submit your request. The DNA Paternity Test has been mailed to customers all over the globe, including Germany, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and Brazil. The one hitch you might encounter is that the samples must make it from your doorstep back to the laboratory within a maximum of two days, otherwise the samples might not be qualified for testing.","TestCountry’s paternity tests are available for the primary purpose of determining whether the alleged father is correct. The genetic testing process doesn’t give you an in-depth analysis of your heritage the same way an ancestry DNA test might.","The TestCountry DNA Paternity Test is on the upper echelon of the paternity test pricing scale, but the international capability might make it worth it for you. It was the only test that explicitly marketed its ability to analyze samples outside North America, so if you’re in a bind and out of the country, you might decide that it’s worth it to go through an organization with American accreditation and the ability to process your sample from abroad."]},"id":"745064cb-6aff-49df-89e0-3c00c0ca40fe","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61528","url":"/testcountry-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-12T03:39:20Z","datePublished":"2014-12-12T03:39:20Z","name":"TestCountry DNA Paternity Test","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-12T03:39:20Z","id":"LXy38B6YzHE4V2c7dUKyGf","meta":{"title":"TestCountry DNA Paternity Test Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"TestCountry provides paternity DNA test result to people all over the world.
