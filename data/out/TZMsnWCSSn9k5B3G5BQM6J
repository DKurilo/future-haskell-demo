They’re also great for people with small lawns who don’t want or need a high-powered lawnmower.","The best push mowers are easy to assemble, store and clean. You’ll not only spend less money than you would with a gas mower, but you’re also not going to inhale any exhaust fumes.

Meeting some resistance is not uncommon, but if you encounter resistance that’s too difficult to overcome with your strength alone, the height of the cut may need to be adjusted.

Other mowers have no such warnings and are light and easily pushed; these can be used by youngsters without any safety concerns.","<strong>Cutting Length</strong><br/>All of the mowers have either four or five blades, but the number of cutting levels varies quite a bit. Most of the mowers we tested have a cutting-length range of about an inch. Some can cut grass as short as half an inch; others can leave grass as long as 4 inches. The best reel lawnmowers have a cutting range of about 3 inches and are easy to adjust using a lever or knob found on the mowing unit of the machine.","All the mowers we reviewed did not cut grass that had grown over 6 inches. It’s worth noting, too, that push mowers don’t work effectively on unkempt or overgrown lawns. Additionally, grass should be free of lawn debris, such as sticks and rocks, because those items can make a reel mower stop dead in its tracks.","<strong>Storage</strong><br/>All the mowers we reviewed have a special storage position incorporated into the design, which usually involves simply pushing the handle straight upwards. Some lighter mowers can be hung on a pegboard, but larger, heavier mowers should remain on the floor. Also, you should always store your mower in a covered place where it is protected from rain and other elements to prevent rusting and to prolong the life of the machine.","The push reel lawnmower you choose should be one that meets your individual needs. Some are better for smaller lawns, while others excel at mowing larger yards. It should also be a mower that can effectively cut the type of grass growing at your home. Whether you want to keep your grass long or nice and trim, you can find the push mower that’s right for you.","<em>Contributing Reviewer</em>: Noel Case"]},"id":"d893fe2c-3ab1-4511-a521-bf0d9e92094c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"d7b1bf12-7e00-40e3-83c3-eff38c31bc86","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7K4BNX/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64490[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Fiskars</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RA3E/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64491[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Scotts</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JNP4AU4/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64492[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Earthwise</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZVOLZ2/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64493[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Greenworks</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072CTQVS/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64494[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sun Joe</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VED4JC/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64495[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">GARDENA</a>","<a href=\"https://www.craftsman.com/products/craftsman-16-reel-mower\">Craftsman</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002N691/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64497[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Great States</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C1WP5KK/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64498[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">LawnMaster</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RA3F/?&tag=ttr_push-lawnmower-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1087[art|NA[pid|64499[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">American</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"204e358b-ac20-4368-b843-0aa908e9053f","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1087","url":"/best-push-lawn-mowers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
