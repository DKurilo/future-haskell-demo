Doctors Photo Recovery received excellent grades for the ease of its installation, scan and recovery stages, and it’s one of the fastest-scanning <a href=\"/best-photo-recovery-software\">photo recovery software</a> applications in our comparison. When you combine this with its excellent recovery rates, you have a great chance at rescuing your lost photos. Additionally, there’s little learning curve, even for novice users.","When it comes to image recovery software, you should look at how well the product recovers JPG images, as that is the most common format out there. If you’ve lost photos, they were probably JPGs. Disk Doctors was flawless in recovering JPG photos during our lost file test. In addition, this software recovered the other raster images (GIF, PNG, TIG and BMP) with a 99 percent success rate. This is impressive; the average image recovery rate for the other raster images in this test was only 70 percent.","In the lost file test, Disk Doctors Photo Recovery restored 63 percent of production files. These are a collection of layered image files used in Adobe and Corel creative suites of photo editing software. Disk Doctors has the second-best recovery rate for production files, which makes it good for graphic artists. In addition, it recouped 62 percent of the camera raw images, which was also the second-highest rate for these proprietary formats, making it a great option for serious photographers.","The one downside to the software is its vector image recovery rate, which was zero. It didn’t recover a single vector image. This is a relatively minor flaw. Vector images are typically logos, fonts and PDFs. You don’t usually need to recover vector images unless you’re a logo designer or own a small business. If you do need to recover lost or reformatted vector images, consider <a href=\"/remo-photo-recovery-review\">Remo Recover</a>.","The results for the reformatted drive tests weren’t much different from the results of the lost file test. On drives of different types, we simulated data loss from reformatting a hard drive. Again, Disk Doctors excelled with a 100 percent recovery rate for the JPGs. The recovery rate for the other raster images dipped to 97 percent; this is still an exceptionally high rate when you consider that the average in our tests was 57 percent. The dip isn’t surprising, as most software in our comparison struggled somewhat with recovering photos from a reformatted drive.","The recovery rate for the production files didn&#39;t dip, though, remaining at 63 percent. Only one other product recovered more production files than Disk Doctors. Its recovery rate for the camera raw images was 61 percent, the highest for camera raw images in the reformatted drive test. Again, it failed to recover any of the vector images, which is a minor setback to an otherwise excellent performance.","You&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find picture recovery software that&#39;s easier to use than this. The installation process received an A. Our tester had it installed, registered and ready to scan in a minute. It doesn&#39;t get much easier than that. The scan grade was also an A. The software has very few steps to the process of picking a drive and initiating a scan, which means there&#39;s little chance for error. The recover stage received a B+. There were only a few minor hiccups – there wasn&#39;t a clearly labeled recover button and the estimated time was inconsistent, but otherwise the process was straightforward.","At 293GB per hour on average, the scan speed was the fastest in our review. For reference, the average scan speed was 87.9GB per hour. If the average picture recovery software takes just over 11 hours to scan a 1TB hard drive, Disk Doctors Photo Recovery takes less than three-and-a-half hours to scan the same drive. However, the recover speed was just 48GB per hour, which is 23GB per hour slower than average. This almost nullifies the speed of the scan. For comparison, it would take just over 24 hours to scan and recover images from a 1TB hard drive; the average software would take 25.4 hours.","In every test we performed, we had a data set of camera raw images, which are proprietary images used by digital camera brands. Since these camera raw formats are unique to the camera, they are the most complicated and difficult image formats to recognize, much less recover. Not only did Disk Doctors record the highest recovery rates, it also recognized all of the camera raw formats, save Epson&#39;s ERF and Samsung&#39;s SRW. The highest recovery rates were of formats from Nikon and Canon, which are the most popular DSLR camera brands available.","Disk Doctors provides exceptional support for its photo recovery software. It&#39;s one of the few products in our review with a PDF version of the manual available online. This is important because a PDF manual is easily accessible, searchable and viewable offline. HTML manuals can be difficult to follow and are only available if you have a reliable internet connection. You can contact support through phone, email and live chat. In addition, the site provides articles and tutorials that can minimize any learning curve or problems you encounter.","Disk Doctors Photo Recovery is one of the best photo recovery software apps in our review because it balances high performance with ease of use. It performs where it matters most, having recovered all of the JPGs in every test we ran. It also recorded impressive recovery rates for the raster, production and camera raw formats. The only image format that it failed to recover was vector images. The scan is exceptionally fast, although the below-average recover speed nearly negates it."]},"id":"74a188bf-5366-414f-9e51-ac930db975f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Lost File &amp; Reformatted Drive Recovery"},"id":"48ec094b-4be6-4458-b44d-44eb6ec3d42b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/d7g7CXxyFE9X7Dje3PtdEV.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"When it comes to picture recovery software, you want to look at how well the product recovers JPG images, because this is the most common image format by far.
