You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With their new PIIQ series of <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">stereo headphones</a>, Sony seems to be going after Skullcandy’s younger, extreme sports enthusiast crowd by offering colorful, stylized headphones in a variety of different designs. According to Sony, “PIIQ headphones draw from the collective experience of artists, skaters, street culture and all-around limit-pushers to create high-concept headphones with sound ready for the ride.” When it comes to the Sony PIIQ Marqii full-size stereo headphones reviewed here, “high-concept” seems to mean trimming everything in bright, neon pink. Not everything is pink – just the grill cloth inside the ear cups, the trim around the ear cups, the inner headband cushion and the cord. The predominant color is a conservative black, which only makes the pink stand out that much more.","The Marqii stereo headphones are top-of-the-line in the PIIQ series.  The large, rectangular ear cups hold large drivers that deliver a punchy bass that should appeal to the target audience. However, the mid-range frequencies seemed to be lacking. In many of the tracks we tried, the vocals in particular were subdued or muted in relation to the rest of the mix. Sony has done a fine job with the treble in these audio headphones and has avoided the harsh and tinny high frequencies that you often encounter with budget stereo headphones.","While the Marqiis are full-size, over-the-ear headphones, they clearly were designed for portable use. The stereo headphones are easily driven by portable devices and sound roughly the same no matter what type of sound source you use. The 3.9-foot cord is just about the right length for plugging into the MP3 player clipped to your hip without getting in your way as you ski, skate, bike or whatever strikes your fancy. The cord is also flat and tangle resistant, and very, very pink. The package does not include an extension cord or a quarter-inch adapter for use with home stereo equipment. In fact, the package doesn’t come with anything other than the Marqii headphones.","These stereo headphones are lightweight at only nine ounces and built to last. Sony says that the headband design was inspired by snowboard boot binders. Two Velcro-lined heavy-duty plastic tabs fit snuggly against each side of the headband to hold the ear cups in place. To adjust the fit to your head, pull the plastic tabs from the headband and adjust to your liking.","The Marqii stereo headphones are also quite comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The rectangular ear pads include a generous portion of foam covered by plush leather for added comfort. The back of the ear cups have more padding behind the ear than in front of the ear. This feels a little odd when we first placed them on our head, but we soon got used to the sensation and didn’t notice it after that. The only explanation we have for this extra padding at the back of the ear cup is that unlike other headphones we’ve tested, the drivers inside the ear cups are angled at the back of the ear. Perhaps more padding is needed at the back of the headphones because of the way the drivers are angled.","These audio headphones do not collapse or fold for easy transport. They also do not come with any kind of carrying case or any other accessory. If you are out and about with the Marqii headphones, you will just have to wear them or find some other way to carry them."]},"id":"26c64191-7f92-45fc-8862-e8877901c39b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"efe4b40a-f6b0-4024-b059-275732f5baab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you do not mind being seen in public with the incredibly pink trim, the Sony PIIQ Marqii stereo headphones are a really good value in terms of performance, sound quality and price.
