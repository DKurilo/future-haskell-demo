Taste Egg Cooker is simple to use and gives you eggs with very good taste, but our testing showed that even when we followed the included directions properly, we could not get hard-cooked eggs that were cooked completely through. This electric <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a> holds seven eggs at one time for cooking eggs in the shell, whether it be at a hard-, medium- or soft-boiled level.","The unit has a piercing tool so you can put a tiny hole in the eggs to keep them from cracking. However, it is rather dull and it broke several eggs before we learned to ease the piercing needle into the shell very gently.","During testing, we measured and poured the recommended amount of water into the reservoir, arranged the eggs in the cooking rack and pushed the power button. This device offers both an indicator light and a power button, which is great since you don&#39;t have to plug and unplug the electrical cord to start and stop cooking. An alert sounds when the cooking is done.","Our testing showed hard-boiled eggs turned out with very soft and runny central parts of the yolks, ranging between medium-soft and soft-boiled, while the whites were firm. We also ended up with five eggs whose shells had cracked. The eggs tasted fine but did not have the texture or mouth feel of hard-boiled eggs. For a relatively similar budget-minded price, you can find a greater degree of cooking thoroughness with the <a href=\"/dash-go-review\">Dash Rapid Egg Cooker</a>.","If you equip your kitchen with a Simple Taste egg cooker, you might need to try different times and water levels if you&#39;re in the mood for hard-cooked eggs.","This electric egg cooker also lets you make poached eggs in a BPA-free plastic poaching bowl. The plastic parts and exterior of this egg cooker must be hand-washed, and the manufacturer recommends putting it back into its original packaging to store it. At 7.3 inches wide and 6.5 inches high, this is a small kitchen appliance that is easy to store anywhere in a kitchen cupboard or on a shelf."]},"id":"0e93f92e-8b8d-46cb-aa9f-778ae2449120","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69760","url":"/simple-taste-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-03-02T13:58:56Z","datePublished":"2018-03-02T13:58:56Z","name":"Simple Taste Egg Cooker","synopsis":"The Simple Taste Egg Cooker is simple to use and gives you eggs with very good taste, but our testing showed that even when we followed the included directions properly, we could not get hard-cooked eggs that were cooked completely through.","review":{"rating":65,"verdict":"The Simple Taste Egg Cooker gives you tasty eggs, but it will take trial and error to get hard-cooked eggs that suit you.","pros":["The cooking process is shorter than many popular egg cookers."],"cons":["Our hard-cooked eggs all ended up with yolks that had very soft, runny centers."]},"strapline":"The Simple Taste Egg Cooker is simple to use and gives you eggs with very good taste, but our testing showed that even when we followed the included directions properly, we could not get hard-cooked eggs that were cooked completely through.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","id":"mCVcFcFJffV99E8voomghP","meta":{"title":"Simple Taste Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Simple Taste Egg Cooker makes soft-, medium- and hard-boiled eggs and lets you poach eggs in a BPA-free plastic bowl.
