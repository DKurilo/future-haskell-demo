The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">Home Subwoofers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","This home subwoofer is different from others in our lineup. The Pure Acoustics SW65 is the smallest sub we reviewed. It&#39;s also the only white subwoofer in our lineup. Unlike the other speakers we reviewed, which are ported, this one has a sealed enclosure. With these differences, the sub fits in small spaces and pairs well with low-powered speakers.","The first thing we noticed is that the SW65 is much smaller than many of the active subwoofers in our review. It measures 10 x 10 x 10 inches (H x W x D) whereas the typical subwoofer in our comparison measures 16 x 14 x 16 inches. It also only weighs 13 pounds. That’s 40 pounds less than the heaviest subwoofer we reviewed. You could easily tuck the SW65 under a desk, table or in the smallest corner of the room with ease. The small size also makes it convenient to move around as you find the best place in your entertainment room for the subwoofer.","The subwoofer enclosure features three 6.5-inch woofers – one in the front and one on each side. This is a unique design among our reviews as all other subs in our lineup have just one driver. Even though it has three woofers, the small 6.5-inch speakers couldn&#39;t produce as much volume as some of the top-rated subwoofers we reviewed.","Our listening panel felt the performance from the SW65 was weak and underwhelming. It simply couldn&#39;t produce enough volume to have a major presence in the audio soundscape. Many of our panelists couldn&#39;t feel the bass rumbling through the floor – a feat that many subwoofers were able to achieve. Beyond the small woofer size, the active subwoofer only operates on 100 watts of power, making it one of the most underpowered speakers as well, contributing to the weak performance.","On the back of the subwoofer you&#39;ll find three knobs – volume control, adjustable crossover and an adjustable phase control. All of the knobs help you appropriately dial in your subwoofer until it&#39;s at optimal performance. There is also a power switch to turn the speaker on and off. It doesn&#39;t have a standby feature, so you&#39;ll have to manually turn the subwoofer on and off. The subwoofer has a dedicated subwoofer input as well as speaker-level inputs. It also has RCA inputs so you can connect the subwoofer to an older two-channel receiver."]},"id":"3dd7b0c6-d76a-4280-a5bc-490263b3cd76","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c008f3af-047f-4ef7-9b17-e68aa76c3d91","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pure Acoustics SW65 isn&#39;t powerful enough rattle the floor with bass, which may be an advantage for apartment living, but it isn&#39;t optimal for larger home entertainment rooms.
