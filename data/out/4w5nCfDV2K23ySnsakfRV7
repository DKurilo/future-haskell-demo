This <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaner</a> does not operate going in reverse so it takes some getting used to when you use it. Be aware that it only sprays water and applies suction in reverse.","Three separate motors instead of one power this lightweight carpet-cleaning machine. The scrubbing brush assembly operates on its own motor. This gives the steam cleaner more power, and ensures against damaging the other motors if it overheats from tangles or blockage caused by a shoelace or child&#39;s toy.","To use the cleaner, you roll it forward on its large wheels. You spray a mix of water and cleaning solution by pressing a button and pulling the cleaner backwards. To suck the water up, the extraction nozzle lifts up water and debris from the floor and sends it to the recovery tank for disposal.","Because of this cleaners ability to tilt forward, the suction nozzle burrows deep into your carpet instead of resting on top. This feature gives this rug cleaner the ability to lift stains better than other cleaners do. The Oreck&#39;s ability to remove dirt, stains and soap residue leaves your carpets clean and soft.","This carpet shampooer has a 2.3-gallon water capacity, which is large. This means you do not have to stop to fill and empty tanks as often as other carpet cleaners that are equipped with 1-gallon tanks.","This cleaner weighs a light 17 pounds. With its ability to tilt backwards and to pivot around corners; it is easy to maneuver through a house with furniture. To move the cleaner forward, you just tilt the front end up off the ground and wheel it ahead.","The power cord is 25 inches long, which is longer than most. It also has a 12-foot cleaning hose so you will get a nice long reach for above ground cleaning. If you have long stairs, you may want to consider this machine.","You do not get many cleaning tools with your purchase. The Oreck XL Shield Power Scrubber comes with an upholstery tool and one bottle of carpet cleaning solution.","Oreck backs this cleaner with a two-year warranty. They have service centers in most major cities. The Oreck website has an email address and toll-free number if you want to speak with a live agent. A FAQs page is also available to answer commonly asked questions."]},"id":"deafa0c3-5317-4ca2-981a-29ca8335fd09","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a50a1d17-a590-43e5-bc89-094a4c173a8a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This carpet cleaner has a long cord and hose for cleaning hard to reach places.
