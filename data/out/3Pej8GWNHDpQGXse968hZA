You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Grand Videoke Symphony karaoke machine offers over 5,150 built-in songs to enjoy, ranging from popular 80s hits to current party favorites, as well as crowd-pleasing songs in English, Tagalog and Korean. The built-in song list has varied popular music, including Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Diana Ross and The Beatles, making it fun and relevant for all ages. Its multimedia player lets you enjoy your favorite songs, videos and photos from a USB drive or SD card. Pre-loaded songs can be searched for or typed in on the microphone keypad.","The compact size of the machine and included microphones makes it easy to store at home, and it&#39;s also highly portable like the <a href=\"/electrohome-review\">Electrohome EAKAR300</a> and the <a href=\"/magic-sing-review\">Magic Sing ET23KH</a>. The entire karaoke player, weighing in at just over 5 pounds, is a sleek modern black, and the system base has a fun LED graphics equalizer to enhance the performance environment.","The base discreetly hides all ports along the sides and back so as not to ruin the aesthetics of the machine or any room it will be stored in. This piece of <a href=\"/best-karaoke-machines\">karaoke equipment</a> includes HDMI and RCA outputs, a video input jack, an SD card slot, a Song Transfer Pack slot, a USB port and a headphone jack.","The wireless professional-grade microphones are equally attractive, but while they don’t have the fuss of cords, they do require batteries. Each microphone has full system controls through the menu button. They both also feature quick-access buttons such as volume and record song.","Either an HDMI or an RCA cable connected to a monitor allows you to enjoy the built-in HD backgrounds, as well as any photos you have uploaded during performances. All built-in songs also have an optional musical note display. This karaoke player has useful audio features like stereo reverb, equalizers and the ability to plug the machine into a TV, sound bar or home theater system. Any song can have that live performance feel, with backup vocals and audience applause, at the press of a button.","The Grand Videoke features 16GB of internal memory for media storage. It has space for up to 500 minutes of recording time, and you can save and export these files through either an SD card or USB. It also includes a 16MB sound bank, and it allows you to import and store your own favorite karaoke tunes so your song library is always up to date.","The included dust covers keep the microphones clean and performance ready, and the travel bag case keeps the system protected if you ever want to take your talent out on the road. While the Grand Videoke Symphony unit is a bit costlier than other units out there, it has every feature an amateur singer or karaoke enthusiast will need."]},"id":"aa5445fe-7514-4eae-aefe-0cdd59f8e19e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62804","url":"/grand-videoke-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T18:27:56Z","datePublished":"2015-02-18T18:27:56Z","name":"Grand Videoke Symphony","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-18T18:27:56Z","id":"3Pej8GWNHDpQGXse968hZA","meta":{"title":"Grand Videoke Symphony Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Grand Videoke.
