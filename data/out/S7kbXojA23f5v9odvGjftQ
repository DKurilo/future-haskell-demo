However, its interface, while easy to use, has some annoying features and omissions. The <a href=\"/best-driver-update-software\">driver update software</a> identified 66 of the 149 outdated drivers we installed on our test computer. While this 44-percent success rate is disappointing, it wasn’t the worst. By comparison, <a href=\"/best-driver-update-softwaredriver-booster-review/\">Driver Booster</a> found the most drivers, identifying 91 for a success rate of 61 percent. However, neither of those success rates are much better than the 32-percent one <a href=\"/advanced-driver-updater-review\">Advanced Driver Updater</a> put up.","WinZip Driver Updater is one of the easiest and most intuitive driver update programs we tested. After a scan, the software displays a one-click fix button, which automatically downloads and installs your driver updates. This feature is ideal for novices and those who just don’t want to deal with the hassle of doing it on their own. We didn’t see a guarantee that the software uses original equipment manufacturer (OEM) updates though, which means it may download drivers that are incompatible with your system.","The software also lets you backup and restore drivers. This is handy if you are worried about a faulty driver update, and a backup is also just nice to have in case you need to restore your computer to a previous state after a major problem. WinZip Driver Updater also lets you schedule periodic system scans, so you don’t have to remember to do so manually. Its exclusion feature lets you choose which drivers to update and which to leave for a future update, though the software doesn’t seem to have a tool to uninstall old drivers you don’t need. Unfortunately, the software has nag and pop-up ads for other WinZip products, which is annoying.","WinZip has a few technical support options, though not quite as many as some other manufacturers make available. The only way to contact the company directly is via email, which means you may have to wait a bit for a reply. However, its website has a decent knowledgebase, which counters the lack of direct support a bit. The software is compatible with Windows 10, 8, 7 and Vista."]},"id":"d9100808-ce1e-42eb-8d0f-f59105f43e52","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52941","url":"/winzip-driver-updater-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-31T19:33:07Z","datePublished":"2011-05-31T19:33:07Z","name":"WinZip Driver Updater 5.7.1.16","synopsis":"WinZip Driver Updater can identify and automatically update many of your system’s drivers – it even lets you schedule scans and back up your drivers.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"WinZip is efficient and fairly effective driver update software, but it&#8217;s missing some basic and critical features.","pros":["It quickly scans and identifies outdated drivers."],"cons":["The software has a few unavoidable pop-up and nag ads, which are annoying."]},"strapline":"WinZip Driver Updater can identify and automatically update many of your system’s drivers – it even lets you schedule scans and back up your drivers.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","id":"S7kbXojA23f5v9odvGjftQ","meta":{"title":"WinZip Driver Updater 5.7.1.16 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"WinZip Driver Updater software updates your drivers automatically.
