Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are looking for a compact <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> that offers high quality performance and an assortment of features, the Dell 1250c may be worth your consideration. This is a color laser printer that uses LED technology to ensure your color stands out and your images are sharp and vivid. The Dell 1250c offers several printing features such as a high printing speed and monthly duty cycle. Yet, it still has some room for improvement before it can be a top competitor in the printer market.","The standout feature available on the Dell 1250c is the Dell Clear View LED technology. This technology is designed to ensure your color images are bright and vivid and that your images print correctly. This helps eliminate any blurry or soft images that you may see printed from several similar devices. This laser printer offers a maximum printing resolution of 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch) for black and white and color prints.","The Dell 1250c offers a monthly duty cycle of 30,000. This allows you to print up to 30,000 pages in one month without causing your printer to overheat or causing any serious technical damage. It also features print speeds of 23 pages per minute for black and white prints and 10 pages per minute for color prints.","You can print on an assortment of paper material with this printer. This printer is compatible with plain paper, covers, coated paper, labels and envelopes. In addition, this laser printer will print on all sizes of paper up to 8.5 x 14 inches. The paper tray available on the device holds up to 150 sheets of paper, which is not a large amount of paper; but for such a compact device, we wouldn’t expect a tray that could hold much more.","The Dell 1250c offers a one-year warranty to users. It also includes 64MB of installed memory. Another benefit of using this laser printer is it’s an ENERGY STAR qualified device. It uses only 265 watts of power and it has met all the specifications, proving it offers energy-saving features.","As we have mentioned previously, the Dell 1250c is a small and compact laser printer. It is only 15.5 inches wide, 8.85 inches tall and 11.8 inches deep. With its small dimensions, this printer can easily fit on any desk without taking up a considerable amount of space. This laser printer features just a handful of buttons on the top of the device for controlling the printer’s features. And with such a small control pad, the device is so simple that it is hard to become confused when you are operating the device."]},"id":"85a323d7-8d99-4792-9861-66471d9c4f2c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7a133447-bf44-4048-9eb8-c383b95fd500","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dell 1250c is a compact printer with excellent print quality.
