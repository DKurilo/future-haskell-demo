In our testing, the images were crisp and the colors, while a little faded, were better than what was displayed on some other <a href=\"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital photo frames</a>. The remote and the interface are simple, which made it easy for our testers to use. They especially liked that the remote wasn&#39;t overly complicated like the <a href=\"/tenker-review\">TENKER</a> and <a href=\"/aluratek-review\">Aluratek</a>&#39;s remotes.","When we first pulled this frame out of the box, its slim and stylish design immediately caught our eye but it does have some limitations. The controls are on the back of the unit and double as the stand. You cannot set this frame up in a portrait position and it isn&#39;t designed to be mounted to a wall. We initially uploaded 300 pictures, 3 MP3 files and an MP4 video file to test the device&#39;s abilities. It was able to play everything perfectly fine for the first two days but on the third day of testing, the device suddenly wouldn&#39;t play the video.","After leaving it running over the weekend, we came back on a Monday to discover that the device would no longer cycle through pictures, no matter what the settings were set to. Whether this is a faulty device or a regular occurrence with this model, we don&#39;t know. We&#39;ve sent away for another for additional testing and will update this review at a later date.","The screen can display both portrait and landscape images, but since the frame is permanently at a landscape orientation, the portrait images have black bars on either side of them. This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, we found that portrait images were displayed rather nicely on this screen, just smaller. Since there is no way to connect it to Wi-Fi, the Micca cannot access Facebook, YouTube or any other online site. It doesn&#39;t have any internal storage but it does come with a small 8GB USB so you can use it immediately instead of having to buy one in addition to the device. It also has an SD card slot if you&#39;d prefer to use that format instead.","Although the main menu&#39;s design takes after the look of Windows 8, this frame does not have a touchscreen. You will need to use the remote or the buttons on the backside of the frame to change settings and select your desired media. Images can be displayed for as long as an hour at a time before moving on to the next one. You can change the display interval settings as well as choose between five different photo transitions in the menu. Micca covers this frame with a one-year warranty - nothing special, but still respectable.","The Micca Neo M973A is a large digital photo frame that only offers basic features. It cannot connect to Wi-Fi or download images from websites but it does allow you to play music, view your photos and watch videos. You will need to manually upload images onto a USB or SD card and then insert it into the device as there is no internal storage."]},"id":"8e617d7f-4f57-4814-9bc7-71cf6aa8874c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66169","url":"/micca-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-13T17:41:55Z","datePublished":"2015-07-13T17:41:55Z","name":"Micca NEO M973A","synopsis":"The picture quality on the Micca is fairly good.
