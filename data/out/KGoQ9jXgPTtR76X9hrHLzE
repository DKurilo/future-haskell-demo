You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With four sensors to measure your calorie burn, the BodyMedia Fit Core is all about tracking your activity accurately. A galvanic skin sensor measures the electrical conductivity of your skin to determine the intensity of your activity. Another sensor measures your skin temperature, while yet another sensor measures the rate at which heat leaves your body. Finally, like other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">activity trackers</a>, it comes equipped with a three-axis accelerometer to measure motions like steps, stairs and distance.","You can wear fitness tracker this with the confidence that you&#39;re getting more accurate data than other activity monitors because your own body chemistry factors into the data. Other activity trackers base their calorie burn algorithms on generalized body types. However, unlike other trackers, the BodyMedia Fit Core doesn&#39;t include a heart rate monitor.","What you gain in accuracy, you lose in design. The BodyMedia Fit Core&#39;s armband is not designed to be discreet. It comes in a cream-colored armband worn on the bicep. While you can hide it under a sleeve, you&#39;ll struggle to hide the bulkiness.","Not only does the look lack any discreetness, you will be aware that you&#39;re wearing it. Unlike wristband or watch designs worn on parts of the body that are common for accessories like bracelets and watches, the armband feels foreign on the bicep. It can be especially uncomfortable if you&#39;re the type of sleeper who lies on your side with your arm under your head.","The BodyMedia Fit Core uses an online Activity Manager that records your activity and places it into bar graphs to show all your important activity in great detail. You can also add the details of your daily diet so that you can see how many calories you&#39;re consuming versus the calories burned to create a calorie deficit graph. This shows actual progress in losing weight.","A big flaw of the BodyMedia Fit Core is the Activity Manager requires a monthly subscription. This wouldn&#39;t be such an issue if the Activity Manager had more to offer than the apps used by other activity trackers. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t. It lacks many of the motivating characteristics like challenges and trophies that are common in free apps. However, if detailed accuracy is your main concern, then the monthly fee  will be worth it.<br/> "]},"id":"4c421b14-ae08-4917-88ee-605c8e591ac1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2c335695-3f82-4259-8f85-8d7c5e737af2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BodyMedia Fit Core is an armband activity tracker worn around the bicep that uses your body&#39;s actual skin temperature, sweat measurements and active movement for an accurate measurement of calories burned and quality sleep.
