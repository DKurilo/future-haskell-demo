You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","LG has made <a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">top-load washing machines</a> since it was established in 1958, but it is better-known for its other electronic gadgets such as mobile phones and televisions. It has definitely kept up with the times. Its latest line of high-efficiency top-loader washing machines are among the most sophisticated out there.","The LG Wave series has a lot going for it. Its 4.5 cubic feet of capacity will handle the largest of loads, which saves money and energy. LG&#39;s 1,100 rpm motor will wring clothes out like no old-school agitator-style machine ever could. And its see-through, slam-proof lid with easy-to-reach front controls makes it look like a machine of the future instead of the washer of the past. (Those front controls are all buttons, so you&#39;ll have to kiss mechanical dials goodbye.)","In addition to its wash cycles, the washer offers an extra rinse cycle. Rinsing is done by jet spray, which penetrates more deeply than a simple fill-and-spin process. And this unit, like many of the most modern top-load washers now on the market, can do a cool-water wash that can take the place of many warm-water cycles while still getting your clothing  just as clean.","The strangest thing about this washing machine isn&#39;t what it has, but what it doesn&#39;t have: a casual/permanent-press wash cycle. This cycle is best for no-iron colored clothes such as socks, many pants and most shirts. It usually washes with warm water and rinses with cool water. Since the other cycle settings are somewhat adjustable, this isn&#39;t a deal-breaker if you don&#39;t mind manually entering your preferences every time you want to do a casual load. But it&#39;s a little surprising on a machine of otherwise competitive caliber.","On the bright side, LG has one of the most helpful customer support policies of any washing machine manufacturer. You can get help via phone, email or live chat. Coolest of all, this machine is capable of sending remote diagnostics either to a technician or to an app on your smartphone. And LG offers a 10-year warranty on its direct-drive motor."]},"id":"e05e7bb0-cc8e-4583-88a9-dda8b1b1a536","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a90159b2-8a15-4200-9350-50e0d37ba2f8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While we are puzzled at why LG would leave out such a staple as the permanent press cycle, this unit is a solid product with a modern feel, and it belongs on our top-10 list."]},"id":"50e80046-da05-40f4-984a-35fc9a2f9156","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56278","url":"/lg-wave-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-04-27T01:20:24Z","datePublished":"2013-04-27T01:20:24Z","name":"LG Wave WT1201CV","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.
