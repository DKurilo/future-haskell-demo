You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The versatile DVD Copy Pro<strong> </strong>for Mac is a great choice for your <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copy software</a> application needs. Wrapping this application up in an attractive interface and charming progress animations makes it a joy to back up your DVDs both on your hard drive and on blank DVDs. With an aesthetic interface, fast copy time and versatile output options, DVD Copy Pro for Mac is a good Mac DVD copy software application.","While testing this Mac DVD copy software application, it was difficult to focus on the features because the application presented such a sharp-looking interface. Your software isn’t going to run better because it looks nice but don’t be embarrassed about enjoying the design. The developers took time to make their application visually stand out from its competition. But aside from the looks, the application screens won’t clutter up your screen.","Using a Mac means you can run a lot of applications simultaneously, meaning your desktop can get quite cluttered easily. This copier doesn’t waste a lot of space and all the utilities are compacted down to small and easy-to-navigate screens. Once you finally start the burn, you can hide the Mac DVD copy software application and monitor its progress through the icon in your icon dock.","Generally with Mac DVD copy software applications, most products simply allow you to create an ISO folder on your hard drive or burn directly to a blank disc. Most copiers aren’t meant to create digital backups ready to watch on your Mac. This application allows all the usual options: DVD5 and DVD 9, creating and burning from an ISO folder; but it also allows you to create a DVDmedia file. This is a great feature if you plan on watching your DVDs on your computer. If you want to export the movies to other devices you’ll need another application.","For what it is, you have plenty of options for watching your DVDs after you copy them. The quality of the test copy (while using the trial version of the software) wasn’t superb, but after purchasing the software, the copy-quality can easily be improved. Compression with this application is a snap. It can handle the double-layer discs with ease, singles too. It will also make sure that you can squeeze a DVD-9 down to fit onto a DVD-5 disc.","Thankfully, a great application supports the shiny exterior. The copy time is snappy; making sure you’ll have your DVDs safe and sound, back in their homes quickly. If the copy process isn’t fast enough, you can also pause before you start the burn process, saving if for later. Not all applications allow this, but iSkysoft lets you make copies on your terms, not what’s dictated by the tools you use.","The help features are all accessed via the iSkysoft website. There they have a user’s guide, step-by-step tutorial with pictures and a list of frequently asked questions. They also supply an online form for addressing your questions directly to the developers and support staff. Considering this great application, hopefully you won’t have to go that far."]},"id":"db5ad731-ba71-4258-a78c-1b80059ffd41","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"585743df-9ade-49cb-bb97-f6d95a34aee1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Mac DVD copy software applications come in many sizes and shapes.
