The 180 has a single jet so it’s best suited for small pools. As it’s the first Polaris pressure cleaner, it has all the basic design features and functionality of most automatic pool vacuums. It operates on a separate booster pump and cleans most pools in three hours or less. The single jet pushes dirt and debris up into its large filter bag, helping to reduce wear and tear on your pool’s skimmer and filtration system. It is lightweight and should be able to handle climbing most pool walls and stairs while it makes its way through your pool.","A separately purchased backup valve attaches to the lead hose and fires water periodically, pushing the 180 backwards. This helps it vacuum the surface evenly. A rear tail releases debris from corners of the pool that the vacuum can’t reach. This rear sweep tail must also be purchased separately. The cleaner is suitable for all surfaces including concrete, vinyl and fiberglass. Polaris recommends that you observe the first cleaning cycle to monitor the hose length. Lightweight cleaners can get tangled up in the hose if it’s too long. Also, if the Vac-Sweep is not used in conjunction with the backup valve, you may have to manually move the vacuum to other areas of the pool during its cleaning cycle.","The 180 only has only a single cleaning jet which can make it inadequate for all but small pools. That’s disappointing  considering the rather high price of this product. This pressure pool cleaner is now being replaced by later models from the company that offer more features for about the same price. Consequently, it’s worth considering the newer models. The <a href=\"/polaris-review\">Polaris Vac-Sweep 360</a> is a nice mid-priced option that doesn’t require an external booster pump.","While the 180 was the original pool pressure cleaner from Polaris, it has single been upgraded to much newer models. The cleaner does require a few extra purchases, including a backup valve and a rear sweep tail. For similar price points, there are pressure cleaners that will outperform this one."]},"id":"910eaacd-6001-43a3-8e33-4491e17e8586","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66572","url":"/polaris-vac-sweep-180-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T18:31:19Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T18:31:19Z","name":"Polaris Vac-Sweep 180","synopsis":"The Vac-Sweep 180 pressure pool cleaner is the original single-jet pool vacuum from Polaris.
