With 12 tools in an 8 oz multi-tool, each component is readily accessible and easy to open, even for gloved hands. The textured G-10 grip means extra traction and better control. The included Gerber multi-tool sheath keeps your tool at the ready and can be positioned vertically or horizontally.","Gerber advertises sentiment for its multi-tool&#39;s spring-loaded pliers, and Active Junky testers agree with the sentiment, noting the butterfly-handled and comfortable design. Both the fine-edge blade and the serrated blade are made from durable 420HC stainless steel. The MP1 includes a specific pry-bar tool, which means you won&#39;t have to sacrifice your blades when you have tasks that require some prying.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Performance","<strong>Best For:</strong> A wide array of uses and to have by your side at home, in your vehicle, while traveling or on backcountry explorations.","<strong>Tester Comments:</strong> &#34;More beaver than barbarian, MP1 has a tactical appearance that’s slightly out of sync with the jaw-dropping sliding mechanism’s real strengths. Learning to handle the tool, grip- and control-wise, takes effort but rewards the owner with superior cuts, sawing maneuvers and screw penetration with little slipping. Performance on wood, rope and plastics easily justifies the price.”","<strong>Trial Results</strong>"]},"id":"a29f18c0-732f-4d87-a18f-ffe28cec1c8f","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Point Break: </strong>While there is a moderate chance for pinches, tasks are completed quickly with a single, two-handed snip.","<strong>Around the Bend:</strong> The multi-tool failed this test, with jaw deflecting immediately when under pressure.","<strong>Rope &#39;Em In: </strong>MP1 yielded stellar results in this trial, leaving the nylon rope in near-perfect condition after a clean slice. The blade position provides balance and power for excellent and smooth cuts.","<strong>No Turning Back:</strong> Outperforming even the exceptional torque potential of Gerber Multi-Plier 600, the Gerber MP1 took the top position for this trial. But due to its narrower design, completing tasks requires slightly more concentration to avoid slippage.","<strong>Eyes on the Pries:</strong> Besides the obvious pry bar, the flat-head driver and the chisel tool also demonstrated above-average prying, with controlled and steady work.","<strong>Lumberjack Olympics:</strong> The full-length blade carved to medium depths with high pressure, and the serrated blade outperformed all others when in the hands of someone with skill and technique."],"type":"ul"},"id":"e5e3db44-b3dc-46cd-978b-38c4551a6602","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67963","url":"/gerber-mp1-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-10T18:31:00Z","datePublished":"2016-06-10T18:31:00Z","name":"Gerber MP1","synopsis":"While the other Gerber multi-tool Active Junky tested was a master with metal, the Gerber MP1 is a jack-of-all-trades, performing well across many different trials.
