The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-beat-making-software\">Beat Making Software</a> here</em><em>.</em>","If you are looking to create fluid beats and want access to thousands of sounds, Sonic Producer is a solid beat making program. This program is especially apt if you are looking to create music in a small business setting – such as a presentation – or for small music groups. You can easily create loops of instruments or a collection of sounds. This program is one of the cheapest we found, and it shows in the interface. The interface looks old and outdated and this program isn&#39;t localized software, but an online application. If you are new to the world of beat making, though, this may be the right program to start with.","Sonic Producer&#39;s interface is simple and requires almost no learning curve, which is great, especially if you have never tried to make your own beats. The program has an embedded 16-track mixer that allows you to add, mix and sequence up to 16 different sounds. The program doesn&#39;t allow you to add images, video or text to tracks, and it lacks a master bus track to combine the outputs of all the audio tracks and finalize volume levels or add other simple effects. This makes it so that you have to edit every sound individually before you export your music as a single audio file.","Along with a 16-track sequencer, each track has its own volume control so that you can adjust the levels. What we do like about the interface is that you can add measures on the fly, so you don&#39;t have to open a new file and start over again. Plus, the software&#39;s full four-octave piano allows you to turn your computer&#39;s keyboard into a virtual piano.","Sonic Producer has more than 3,000 sounds to choose from, with updated sounds coming out monthly. You can add guitar amp simulators, percussion, organs and other virtual synthesizers. You can also record your own audio. The built-in metronome keeps your music organized and on beat.","You can share your custom beats directly from this program to your Facebook account by just clicking the share button. Your only other option for exporting your beats is as a WAV or MP3 file. You can burn the music to CDs as well. If you have questions regarding the program, you can call or email the company or head to YouTube and watch some of the video tutorials."]},"id":"a4b5f8b7-1a0b-48aa-a837-1c6d2ec51b5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4dfb1eac-daa7-4fd5-868c-0ae258bf567e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sonic Producer beat making program has an assortment of sounds and effects that make it easy to produce your own custom beats.
