You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Arctic is a tough competitor when it comes to its line of remote control vehicles. In addition to boats, they manufacture cars, tanks and fire trucks, and their <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">remote control boats</a> are just as well made and interesting. Its design oozes adventure, like something out of a Melville novel in miniature. It is a detailed, durable remote control tugboat  that caters mostly to hobbyist who want a unique and classy boat in their collection. But parents would have a blast with their children watching this chug around the local pond.","The Aqua Rider requires some assembly before it is able to run, which for hobbyist would be a bonus, but it is missing a few features that our top-rated products offer such as a transmitter and safety options. Overall, this RC boat is an excellent addition to any remote control enthusiast&#39;s collection.","The first thing you’ll notice with this prince among RC tug boats is its exquisite detail. This boat is a 1:36 scale replica of the Wyeforce, a tugboat in Southampton. It is 23 inches long, 9 inches wide and 13 inches tall, making it an ideal size for displaying on a shelf and taking out in the water. From rubber tires hanging off the side of the boat to window wipers, no detail is left out. However, because this boat is so elaborate, it does require much more time to put together. Do not expect to pull this boat out of the box and get it on the water immediately.","This RC electric boat runs for approximately 20 minutes, which is the average amount of time for a remote control boat battery. However, the battery takes roughly five hours to charge, which is significantly longer than the average for RC boat batteries.","Perhaps the biggest drawback to this remote control boat is the lack of a transmitter. You must purchase a transmitter separately if you want to run this boat on water. It also does not come with any extra propellers.","We are also impressed this boat has an operating range of 400 feet. This will give this electric boat the freedom to adequately explore the hidden alcoves in the local pond in a way that would make Melville proud. Because this RC tugboat is a replica of the Wyeforce, there are no other color options available. It doesn&#39;t have any type of safety feature to ensure that its motor can&#39;t run when it&#39;s out of the water.","The Aqua Rider comes with an outstanding two-year warranty. This is one of the longest warranties for a remote control boat, and we are pleased this boat offers it because of its small and intricate details. If you have any questions or are worried about putting this boat together, a user manual comes with the boat to aid you throughout the process."," "]},"id":"445f16c9-953c-46c2-aeb7-93f2718efea6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3d5f3b0c-c9ef-414c-83d7-5e308bbb01a7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Aqua Rider is the perfect addition to any RC boat collection.
