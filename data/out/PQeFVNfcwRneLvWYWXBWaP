The only significant difference is the name and the shape of the holding arms, which are bigger and sturdier. Unlike most <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-boosters\">cell phone signal boosters</a>, which boost the signals into a wireless coverage area that covers a car&#39;s interior, the coverage area is limited to the cradle. You can&#39;t freely use your phone as you normally do, which means you have to take calls using the speakerphone or a Bluetooth connection. However, the advantage of this design is the lower cost. Cradle signal boosters are much more affordable than wireless cell phone boosters like the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-4g-m-review\">weBoost Drive 4G-M</a>.","The Drive 3G-S has the signal amplifier built into the cradle. It has a 26 dB maximum gain, which makes it one of the weakest cell phone signal boosters available. However, since the coverage area is limited to the cradle, you&#39;ll still receive five-bar reception in areas where you only get one bar without it.","One of the best features is the amplifier&#39;s low noise figure. Whenever you amplify a frequency, unwanted noise created by the antenna, unwanted frequencies and powered components increase. This can present itself as static within your phone calls. With a noise figure of 3 dB, your call quality is comparable to that of the best cell phone boosters available.","The downside to the Drive 3G-S is the lack of 4G compatibility. 4G offers better voice quality and faster data downloads. However, 4G coverage isn&#39;t as comprehensive as 3G and 2G yet, because it hasn&#39;t been around as long. This means that you&#39;re less likely to find 4G in rural areas, which is where you&#39;d need a cell phone booster the most. If 4G compatibility is important to you, however, the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-4g-s-review\">weBoost Drive 4G-S</a> is a great option.","The 4-inch antenna uses a magnet 3.5 inches in diameter and vertical polarization, which means that it requires a vertical installation for the best results. It uses a magnetic mount and a 10-foot coax cable, which runs into the car and connects with the cradle. Since the cradle acts as the inside antenna, you don&#39;t have to install a second antenna next to the driver&#39;s seat. However, you do have to find a place on your dashboard for the cradle, which uses an adhesive."]},"id":"fa2b5b58-0e8f-421e-b66d-5d035f0b09ef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5b09d922-d585-4bc8-a1ac-ae6898ae352a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The weBoost Drive 3G-S is an effective cradle signal booster, which makes it more affordable than other boosters but requires sacrifices in how you normally use your phone.
