Based on my research, this MyTrex device makes up about 60 percent of the medical alert system hardware on the market, as it&#39;s the most common landline or cellular in-home system.","Rescue Alert&#39;s prices for each package are a little more expensive than the average market price. The mobile package starts at about $45 per month, and $54 per month if you add fall detection. Each is about $5 more expensive than average. The in-home cellular package costs about $43 per month and the in-home landline package costs about $33 per month. By comparison, <a href=\"/greatcall-review\">GreatCall</a> costs $25 per month. And it&#39;s a mobile medical alert device.","In the emergency response tests, Rescue Touch received a C+ for its average call response time. It certainly wasn’t the slowest service to answer, as three service had slower times, but it was still about six times slower than GreatCall.","Rescue Alert&#39;s overall call quality received a C- grade. Rather than asking if I was okay, the responders always answered the call by saying &#34;What is the address of your emergency?&#34; While there is a certain logic and value of getting to the point quickly, this response stood out from other services, who typically start by asking if I was okay or if I needed help. Since most calls are false alerts, starting off with such a presumptuous question didn&#39;t help ease the anxiety of calling for help. The emergency responders never asked to confirm my name and only occasionally asked to verify my address.","The best part of Rescue Alert was the MyTrex in-home system. It&#39;s one of the few medical alert systems compatible with VoIP, cable and cellular adapters. It received a B+ for overall quality and an A for volume. The clarity of the speaker makes for excellent communication and the volume ensures you can hear it from fair distance. It&#39;s not as good as having a mobile system, but it&#39;s one of the best in-home systems available.","The fall detection pendant, called myActive Alert, received a failing grade in my tests. As with every fall detection sensor, it comes with disclaimer to warn you it doesn&#39;t detect falls with precision. Unfortunately, it failed to detect any of the falls. In fact, I started to think it was defective, because I couldn&#39;t get it to activate no matter what I did. I only got it to activate after literally throwing it into the ground.","<strong>Summary</strong>","Rescue Alert should get a lot of credit for making one of the best and most common in-home medical alert systems, but the overall speed and quality of the emergency response was disappointing. In addition, the overall pricing structure is not persuasive compared to much more affordable options."]},"id":"15b3e5cb-7ef0-438e-bdc3-44d5fd1b8a21","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"76dd1437-dfdb-437e-876f-eea9c431e35b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Since 1981, Rescue Alert has provided a great medical monitoring system with well-trained personnel.
