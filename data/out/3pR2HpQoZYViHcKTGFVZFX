You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Even  the most economical of the <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-load washers</a> represents a significant investment for most people. We liked the products that have awesome guarantees behind them so we know the money will be well spent. The LG WM2050CW has great customer service and a stunning 10-year warranty on the motor as well as. Usually when a company is willing to make that sort of claim, it means the product is so well built you probably won’t need the guarantee. We think that is what you will find in this case.","There is no sanitize cycle on this front-load washer, like our No. 1 product, Bosch WFVC3300UC, but we think that is mostly ok. This unit offers a lot of wonderful bang for relatively little buck. It has a fantastic reputation and comes in at a lower price point than our No. 3 product, Samsung WF330ANW. We think this LG front-load washer represents a better mixture of overall value and quality than the Samsung washer and the rest of the appliances in our lineup."]},"id":"c42b7b0a-6248-42e3-a220-530d7a81d60e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Efficiency"},"id":"8b0c9fa1-d100-4204-acf9-37ecf6e448f4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG WM2050CW offers the usual suspects in terms of front-load washer features, including an automatic dispenser, time-delay start and easy add-a-rinse. This appliance has added finesse with little extras, like the short melody it plays when it is done with a cycle – though some said it was hard to hear. We’d take that any day over the obnoxious buzzing of some older machines.","Major plusses include the LoDecibel Quiet System and the TrueBalance anti-vibration system.","In their relatively short life, front-load washers have built up a reputation for belonging exclusively on the ground floor and away from any flooring that you care about due to the way they shake. The TrueBalance system on this machine was designed to remove a lot of the motion associated with agitation that occurs during the cleaning process. Additionally, a one-piece cabinet structure is at least partially to thank for making the LG WM2050CW as quiet as it is. There are less puzzle pieces to shake.","These types of advances are a reminder of how much front-load washers outshine traditional top-loaders. They should. None of them are cheap, but as you sit in the next room and can detect little sound or motion coming from your LG WM2050CW where there was once a loud rumble, it will be worth every penny.","It is worth mentioning, however, that not every consumer was completely bowled over by the advances in sound and movement reduction.  One customer wrote: “The only part of the cycle that is semi loud is the final 8-10 minutes while it’s spinning the water out, otherwise not too bad noise-wise. We live in single level ranch home and I will admit maybe I had too high expectations for the noise level, but overall not LOUD, but not whisper quiet.”","We think refugees from the ancient and rambunctious top-loader camp will still be pretty impressed overall."]},"id":"5cf5c639-2285-4241-bfc4-879bc68d0797","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"4898774e-bf7e-4e84-92a9-c72c280147d0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Those new to this style of washers will be astounded by the timing options with this machine. Program your machine to run up to 19 hours from the time you collect the load. Set it and forget it. Just don’t expect the relatively quiet end-of-cycle melody to remind you.","Configure this appliance any way you like. The matching pedestal (sold separately) is designed to prevent stooping and promote order. Most of the units we considered have a digital display, but it is still a wonderful feature, even if it is common. The time left on a cycle is crystal clear, and in the case of this LG front-load washer, the display also offers other important information, including information about load size and each stage of the cycle. It functions much like the modern vehicle dashboard, keeping you abreast of any developments in your machine.","Nice touches include a four-tray dispenser, which reserves a spot for prewash liquid in addition to the usual main wash, bleach and softener spots, and we think users will love how the SenseClean feature adjusts water levels and cycle length automatically for load-specific, effective cleaning. No more trying to guess how many pairs of jeans it takes to make a “large” load."]},"id":"a008d481-7f4e-4c2d-89f8-e00055ee0edb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"889aee9d-85f6-4e32-a949-42a7e0c4e543","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The optional stacking kit will come in handy if you are looking to save space, and the overall look is very sleek.
