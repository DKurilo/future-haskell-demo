Sprint has the weakest network of the Big Four <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\">cell phone providers</a> (<a href=\"/verizon-review\">Verizon</a>, <a href=\"/att-wireless-review\">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href=\"/t-mobile-review\">T-Mobile</a> are the others), though there are a few pockets where it has excellent service. On a national scale, RootMetrics, OpenSignal, and Ookla have tested and reported that Sprint has the slowest network. Fortunately, however, Virgin customers benefit from the same level of network performance as direct Sprint customers. In tests performed by Tom’s Guide, our sister site, Virgin performed as well as its parent company. That said, Virgin customers are still subject to the same data deprioritization threshold as Sprint users – up to 23GB of high-speed data per cycle before your speeds are throttled.","Virgin’s Inner Circle is the company’s only cellular plan and offers one line of unlimited data, unlimited talk and text, and DVD-quality streaming for $60 a month – or $50 if you enroll in autopay. There are no family plans and no budget options. Adding 10GB of mobile hotspot data costs $10 a month, and international calling add-ons start at $5. The plan isn’t a particularly great value. The same price gets you comparable plans through other budget carriers like <a href=\"/metropcs-review\">MetroPCS</a> and Cricket, which both run on better networks. Virgin also limits multimedia quality. Video streaming is limited to 480p (DVD quality), music streaming caps at 500 kbps and mobile gaming tops out at 2 Mbps.","Virgin further limits its customers’ options when it comes to device selection. Apple phones are your only options. You can bring your own or purchase a device through Virgin – iPhones 6 through X are available on Virgin’s website. Older models are slightly discounted compared to Apple’s prices, and you can purchase pre-owned phones for a discount as well.","Virgin Mobile is best for people who only need one phone line (so not families) and people who use iPhones. Virgin’s member benefits include giveaways and discounts from various popular retailers. At the time of writing, these benefits included discounts for H&amp;M, Booking.com and Hulu."]},"id":"158f8abb-e01c-47f9-a0a7-a0c78fd61f69","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1273","url":"/virgin-mobile-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","name":"Virgin Mobile","synopsis":"Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint and runs on its network.","review":{"rating":74,"verdict":"Virgin Mobile could be a good choice if you use an iPhone, want an unlimited plan, live in a Sprint coverage area and want access to Virgin&#8217;s exclusive discounts.","pros":["Virgin Mobile customers have access to discounts from several brands."],"cons":["It has very limited device and plan options."]},"strapline":"Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint and runs on its network.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","id":"PZdKtD2zWkaibqoRueQJ66","meta":{"title":"Virgin Mobile Review - Pros and Cons of Virgin’s Coverage and Service","description":"Virgin Mobile could be a good choice if you use an iPhone, want an unlimited plan, live in a Sprint coverage area and want access to Virgin&#8217;s exclusive discounts."},"products":[{"slug":"virgin-mobile","url":"/product/virgin-mobile","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","name":"Virgin Mobile","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","id":"iS5pKnkDCVnKfaK9hsed4A","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/puTHmRpWxrH5jiGgDKPqgY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"71e4b7bbdeb1f73f8489098858a02121.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/71e4b7bbdeb1f73f8489098858a02121.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","id":"puTHmRpWxrH5jiGgDKPqgY","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/puTHmRpWxrH5jiGgDKPqgY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Virgin Mobile Review - Pros and Cons of Virgin&#8217;s Coverage and Service","description":"Virgin Mobile could be a good choice if you use an iPhone, want an unlimited plan, live in a Sprint coverage area and want access to Virgin&#8217;s exclusive discounts."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/puTHmRpWxrH5jiGgDKPqgY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"71e4b7bbdeb1f73f8489098858a02121.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/71e4b7bbdeb1f73f8489098858a02121.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","id":"puTHmRpWxrH5jiGgDKPqgY","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/puTHmRpWxrH5jiGgDKPqgY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Virgin Mobile Review - Pros and Cons of Virgin&#8217;s Coverage and Service","description":"Virgin Mobile could be a good choice if you use an iPhone, want an unlimited plan, live in a Sprint coverage area and want access to Virgin&#8217;s exclusive discounts."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/virgin-mobile-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"mobile","url":"/electronics/mobile","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","name":"Mobile","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:56:38Z","id":"LWfuBdpYombsbwBKLD65DE","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
