We have watched (and continued to update our testing methods) as toasters have evolved from a relatively simple appliance that you never think about to a versatile one with many settings and features to help create perfect toast and bagels. We’ve toasted many bagels, dry bread slices and frozen bread during our testing to make sure we can tell you exactly how each one performs. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","To evaluate each toaster’s performance, we conducted four tests:","Evenness<br/>The evenness test was the most critical and heavily weighted test we performed. We set the toaster on the medium heat level and toasted a slice of white bread. We checked for evenness on both sides of the bread, as well as for burn marks.","Consistency<br/>Some toasters get hotter after repeated use. The toaster will toast the first batch of bread evenly, but the second and third batches progressively become more burnt. We toasted several slices back-to-back on a medium setting and in the same slot to determine heat consistency. Toasters that maintained evenly toasted bread after several uses received high scores.","Frozen<br/>If you freeze bread for longer storage, you’ll want a  toaster that can cook frozen bread. We tested how well the appliance toasted frozen bread by setting the toaster on the medium level. If the toaster offered a defrost setting, we used it for the tests. We looked for evenness and consistency in the toast. We noticed that toasters with a defrost setting did much better than ones without it.","Bagel<br/>Finally, we checked to see how well each model toasted bagels on a medium setting. If the toaster had a bagel setting – to toast just one side of the bagel – we used that.","<strong>How Much Do Toasters Cost?</strong>","Toasters come in a wide variety of styles but spending more is not always a guarantee of better toast. In our tests we found that some of our cheapest toasters made better toast than some high-end models. Toasters can range in price from less than $20 to over $150 and can feature digital or manual controls. Generally speaking, toasters with more cooking slots cost more – depending on the quality of the toaster. Our advice is to purchase a toaster that has enough slots to fit your favorite breads or bagels and fits your budget.","<strong>Toaster Safety</strong>","While toasters are simple in function, they can still be a dangerous appliance. We&#39;ve all laughed as a cartoon character or actor was zapped by putting a fork in the toaster or from dropping their toaster in the bath - but these aren&#39;t the only safety considerations for your toaster. Firstly, you should always make sure the crumb tray is regularly cleaned out. This can prevent smoke and burning food. Toasters generate heat, but do you ever think about where that heat goes? It goes up. Use your toaster in an area that doesn&#39;t have overhanging cabinets or appliances to avoid possible flames or heat damage.","Other simple safety tips include:"]},"id":"14aa9f69-b9b2-4a91-a843-a883cac40280","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Keep the toaster and cord away from countertop edges where it could be pulled or bumped off.","Unplug the toaster and let it cool completely before storing.","Keep it out of reach of children and teach older children how to properly use the toaster.","If a piece of bread gets stuck - unplug the unit before attempting to remove it."],"type":"ul"},"id":"259a2de8-cba1-4679-9b34-d57385b1a55c","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Other Important Considerations</strong>","Cleaning &amp; Reliability<br/>If you are looking for a toaster that won’t leave a mess, find one that has an easy-to-remove crumb tray. A crumb tray that can be removed from the front is the most convenient and easiest to clean and replace. When we spoke with Alexus, an appliance associate at Best Buy, she told us that the number one reason toasters were returned – surprisingly enough – was because the crumb trays were difficult to remove. “You get what you pay for. The cheaper ones won’t cost as much, but they might be plastic or require a manual to know how to remove [the crumb tray].” She went on to say that the more expensive devices, while they do cost more, are typically better designed and easier to use.","We contacted multiple restaurant locations of a well-known breakfast franchise to get a better idea for the reliability of these appliances. The general managers from each location told us that they have never had an issue with their toasters even though they typically use their devices at least 20 times a day. This isn’t very surprising since toasters are relatively simple machines. They did note, however, that cleaning the crumb trays regularly helps the toaster work better and prevents them from giving off any smells.","2-Slice vs. 4-Slice Toasters<br/>If you’re in college or live on your own, you will likely only need a two-slot toaster. These are typically cheaper and take up less counter space. However, if you have kids or usually have breakfast at the same time as someone else in your household, having a four-slice toaster can help make your mornings run more smoothly. The best four-slice toasters have dual control, meaning that the two sets of toaster slots operate independently of each other so you can perfectly toast your bread while your significant other toasts their bread at a different setting. This way if you and someone else want to use the toaster at the same time, you can. These machines are often twice the size of the two-slice toasters so you will want to make sure you have counter space available.","Checking on Your Toast<br/>Another design feature to look for is an automatic lift. Rather than pulling down a lever to lower your bread, all you need to do is press a button. The toaster then smoothly lowers the bread for you and lifts it when it’s finished. Although this feature doesn’t affect the functionality of the toaster, it gives it a luxurious and impressive feel.","<strong>Can You Toast a Croissant in a Toaster?</strong>","Because of the flaky, delicate nature of croissants, toasting them in a traditional toaster isn’t the best way to heat them. This is because, first, it is easy for the croissant to catch on the heating elements and tear, both ruining your croissant and creating a possible fire hazard. Second, it’s hard to tell how high to set your heat level to avoid burning. A lot of standard toasters don’t have slots big enough to fit a croissant either.","We suggest using either a <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">traditional oven</a> or a <a href=\"/best-toaster-ovens\">toaster oven</a> for croissants. Both of these have windows that let you watch your croissant to ensure it doesn’t overcook. Both also cook croissants without squishing or tearing them. Using a toaster oven also lets you bypass a tray or baking sheet so you can get a good, golden color on both sides of the croissant without having to flip it over."]},"id":"b6babca6-b271-4e81-96aa-0a5250e9ed2d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_140","url":"/best-toasters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T14:03:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T14:03:00Z","name":"Best Toasters of 2019","synopsis":"We spent over 40 hours reviewing the best 2 and 4 slice bread and bagel toasters from Breville, Oster, Cuisinart, Krups, and Smeg.","review":{},"strapline":"We spent over 40 hours reviewing the best 2 and 4 slice bread and bagel toasters from Breville, Oster, Cuisinart, Krups, and Smeg.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-02T08:49:26Z","id":"iagpnq9Bz29vrFBprTNChG","meta":{"title":"Best Toasters of 2019 - 2 and 4 Slice Toaster Reviews","description":"We spent over 40 hours reviewing the best 2 and 4 slice bread and bagel toasters from Breville, Oster, Cuisinart, Krups, and Smeg."},"products":[{"slug":"breville-smart-toaster-bta840xl","url":"/product/breville-smart-toaster-bta840xl","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","name":"Breville Smart Toaster BTA840XL","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"8FtHatj4vD8ZDGDxrb9RYX","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"dash-clear-view-dvts501rd","url":"/product/dash-clear-view-dvts501rd","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","name":"Dash Clear View DVTS501RD","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"KEqmJ7GwAW3ncqYDzdi7oJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"smeg-2-slice-tsf01pgus","url":"/product/smeg-2-slice-tsf01pgus","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","name":"Smeg 2 Slice TSF01PGUS","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"4SHsS9duR52bhttmrhgDd4","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"waring-wct-708","url":"/product/waring-wct-708","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","name":"Waring WCT 708","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"XSaY7T2d3gZN5cwTW7MiFW","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"cuisinart-cpt-440-touch-to-toast","url":"/product/cuisinart-cpt-440-touch-to-toast","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","name":"Cuisinart CPT-440 Touch to Toast","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"CCriC6BgiL6WWkYWaPRaw4","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/pBQmKGdYXUcap5yK7KrTpZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Toasters-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/2/7/819151/original/_Hero-Toasters-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"pBQmKGdYXUcap5yK7KrTpZ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBQmKGdYXUcap5yK7KrTpZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Toasters of 2019","description":"We spent over 40 hours reviewing the best 2 and 4 slice bread and bagel toasters from Breville, Oster, Cuisinart, Krups, and Smeg."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/pBQmKGdYXUcap5yK7KrTpZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Toasters-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/2/7/819151/original/_Hero-Toasters-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"pBQmKGdYXUcap5yK7KrTpZ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBQmKGdYXUcap5yK7KrTpZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Toasters of 2019","description":"We spent over 40 hours reviewing the best 2 and 4 slice bread and bagel toasters from Breville, Oster, Cuisinart, Krups, and Smeg."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"small-cooking-appliances","url":"/kitchen/small-cooking-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","name":"Small Cooking Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:27Z","id":"p328QmaaapynF26pfsLwkW","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
