What this means is that you receive your settlement in monthly payments rather than a single lump sum. A structured annuity can last for a set period of time, 30 years for example, or until the death of the beneficiary.","If you have debts, medical bills or a significant expense looming, you may want your cash up front. There are many services that buy structured annuities in exchange for a single cash payout. In fact, you may have seen a commercial or even been contacted by one of these companies since they market their services aggressively. Many brokers will offer different types of structured settlement loans as well. In these situations, you can borrow cash against your structured settlement, just like you can with a loan for any other asset.","You can sell the entirety of your structured settlement or a portion of it. Many factors affect the amount you&#39;ll ultimately receive, including the total amount of the settlement, the number of payments you&#39;re selling and how often these payments are made.","<strong>What Is the Process for Selling My Annuity</strong>","The process for selling a structured settlement is lengthy and needs to be approved by a court. Usually it takes two to three months to complete a sale.","Selling a structured annuity should not be undertaken lightly. Since a court must approve the sale, the entire process can take several months. The process differs widely depending on the state you live in. Most structured settlement companies will aid you in the process.","If you&#39;re considering selling a structured settlement annuity, you&#39;ll want to follow these important steps:","First, shop around to find the best quote. Structured settlement companies apply what&#39;s called a discount rate to the future payments you receive, so the lump sum payment is smaller than the total amount of your settlement.","Second, you&#39;ll need to provide documents to the company you are selling the structured settlement to. This includes the documentation from the insurance company responsible for the annuity, the settlement and release agreement from a lawsuit, and the application for selling the settlement. If you&#39;re divorced or have declared bankruptcy since receiving your annuity, you may need to provide additional documentation.","Third, depending on the state you live in, you may be required to consult an attorney or a financial advisor before selling your structured annuity. You can find a list of the state-by-state requirements here.","Fourth, a judge will need to approve the sale of your structured settlement. The judge will take steps to determine whether you understand the terms of the sale. You&#39;ll also need to demonstrate that you have a convincing need to sell your annuity. Most structured settlement sales are approved, but reasons for denial include a failure to demonstrate adequate financial need, improper documentation or a poor discount rate from the company.","<strong>Pros &amp; Cons of Selling a Structured Settlement</strong>","There are benefits and drawbacks to selling your structured settlement.

Structured settlement companies take into account the depreciation of future earnings and apply a discount rate to your settlement (more on that below). What this means is for a $100,000 settlement, you can expect to receive anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000.","It can sometimes take months for the paperwork to be completed and for a judge to approve the sale. If you need money immediately, you may want to look into alternate ways to get it.","If you rely on your structured settlement to pay bills, selling is unwise. You can compromise your income stream and leave yourself at risk for dire financial consequences."],"type":"ul"},"id":"271803a5-49c9-4514-8a8e-4024a3f1fe1c","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What Is a Discount Rate?</strong>","The discount rate represents the amount the company deducts from the total of your structured settlement. While it may sound like a simple percentage, it is much more complicated than that. The discount rate assumes that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future and applies that principle to the payments you&#39;re selling.","Take the example above of a $100,000 settlement that is sold for between $30,000 and $50,000. This implies a discount rate of 50 to 70 percent. But discount rates typically range from 8 to 18 percent and can sometimes be as high as 30 percent.","The math doesn&#39;t seem to add up, and this is because the structured settlement company applies a different discount rate to each payment depending on how far into the future the payment is. Therefore, next month&#39;s payment has a different discount rate than a payment five years from now.","When you receive a quote from a structured settlement provider, just be aware that it will usually reflect an average of all the discount rates on all the payments you plan to sell rather than it being a certain percentage applied to the total of your structured annuity.","There is a benefit to selling just a portion of your settlement. By selling some of your forthcoming monthly payments, they have a lower discount rate than payments that are further out in the future, which means you&#39;ll be able to get more money and still have access to future payments.","Here are few more things to keep in mind when selling a structured annuity:","Explore your options. Get multiple quotes from different structured settlement companies. You&#39;re not obligated to go with the first offer you receive.","Haggle. Once you get an offer, don&#39;t feel like you need to accept it. You can negotiate the rate and try to find a middle ground with the buyer.","Understand what you&#39;re getting into. Most states require some kind of consultation with an attorney or financial advisor. We recommend taking advantage of that service so you fully understand the impact of selling your annuity.","<strong>Tax Repercussions</strong>","As mentioned earlier, when you sell your structured settlement, the payout is not taxed. The exception, though, is from lottery winnings, which are taxed, and the funds from selling a lottery annuity are taxed as well. And if you invest the money from your lump sum payout, earnings from those investments will be taxed.","If you&#39;ve received a structured settlement annuity through a lawsuit, an accident or winning the lottery, selling it to a structured settlement company can let you take advantage of that money more quickly. We&#39;ve assembled a lineup of the 10 best structured settlement companies so you can explore your options and find the best deal for you. You can read more about these companies and what they offer in our buying guide.","<strong>Avoid Structured Settlement Scams</strong>","Structured settlements are complicated, and the industry isn’t very transparent. Unfortunately, that means it’s easy for scammers to find people to prey on. Here are some things to watch out for as you sell your structured settlement or annuity:","One simple way to avoid scams is to do a little research before calling. Check to see if the company has had any lawsuits brought against it and if any complaints have been brought to the BBB or the CFPB. You should also make sure the company has a physical location. Further, find out how long the company has been in business – you’re less likely to be dealing with scammers if the company has been operating for several years. Long-standing companies are also more likely to be in compliance with the various rules and regulations that govern the selling of structured settlements and annuities.","Another way to avoid scams is to contact the settlement companies yourself. If you get cold called by a structured settlement company, it’s likely it found you through court records or it paid someone for a referral. If you want to sell your settlement or annuity, you should be in the driver’s seat and initiate the contact yourself.","Be wary of any company that tells you it doesn’t charge fees – it&#39;s likely it has hidden some of the costs in the discount rate it applies to your settlement. If a company claims there are no fees, you’ll likely pay a higher percentage and recoup less on your settlement payments."]},"id":"95b47aa5-8444-4c37-8fce-30695a725a9c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"cdd54237-52b0-4a92-8f84-1d6daf06a087","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.jgwentworth.com/lp/yt/offer.html?marketSource=AFL_JGW-SS_Top-Ten-Reviews&channel=Affiliate&sub-channel=SEO&_vsrefdom=TopTenReviews\">J.G.
