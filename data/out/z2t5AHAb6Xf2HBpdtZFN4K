The ClearSounds ANS3000 offers features like remote access so that you can always access your messages from anywhere, in addition to the ability to record memos and store up to 30 minutes of messages.","This telephone answering machine is designed quite simply, with large and visibly labeled buttons. Each button allows you to control things such as message playbacks, deleting, volume and language. When it begins recording a message, the device uses call screening to play the call over the speaker while it’s recording so you can easily intercept those calls you want to take immediately. When a message is left on the device, the LCD screen begins to blink with the total number of new recordings.","The digital answering machine comes equipped with 30 minutes of digital recording time. This allows you to record dozens of messages at a time before you need to clear up space. If you think you may need a larger storage capacity, consider the <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">AT&amp;T 1740</a>. Whereas most other answering machines only record inbound messages, you can still use the device for memo recordings so you can keep your own audio recordings up to three minutes in length. In addition, this machine comes with a remote access option that gives you control over listening to messages and changing the greeting from any phone outside the house.","The audio menu of this phone answering machine is announced clearly by an automated female voice to allow callers to leave messages. You can also use this voice as the default greeting, or record your own messages. Unfortunately, however, the microphone used to record greetings isn’t the highest quality and often results in a grainy recording that makes your voice difficult to distinguish.","If you own a cordless phone and want an answering machine to go with it, the ClearSounds ANS3000 is a popular option due to the quality of its name brand. It allows you to perform numerous functions, from recording memos to remotely accessing and listening to messages. While the subpar microphone for recording your own greeting is a downside, the device otherwise performs quite reliably as both a recording and screening device for your calls."]},"id":"7e18715f-a015-4664-9498-d82ee6dad730","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61312","url":"/clearsounds-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-26T20:41:24Z","datePublished":"2014-11-26T20:41:24Z","name":"ClearSounds ANS3000","synopsis":"While stand-alone answering machines are becoming less common, what few models there are still find ways to offer unique and useful features.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"While stand-alone answering machines are becoming less common, what few models there are still find ways to offer unique and useful features.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-26T20:41:24Z","id":"z2t5AHAb6Xf2HBpdtZFN4K","meta":{"title":"ClearSounds ANS3000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
