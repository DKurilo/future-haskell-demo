You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Finding a budget-friendly <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD camcorder</a> is sometimes the biggest challenge when you&#39;re shopping for video cameras. Vivitar camcorders may not be super flashy, and they are not generally full of features, but Vivitar camcorders like the DVR990 shoot full HD video and won&#39;t break your bank account.","This HD video recorder is that it records video in full 1080 HD. However, the picture may not be as clear as it could be because the Vivitar DVR990 only captures video at 30 frames per second (FPS). A 60 FPS camcorder would record crisper and clearer video, but the DVR990 still does relatively well. This device come with a 23x optical zoom, but it also sports a 4x digital zoom – a nice addition, considering that many Vivitar camcorders, even in the DVR900 series, only include a 4x digital zoom and no optical zoom at all.","The Vivitar DVR990 is the top of the class for the DVR900 series of Vivitar video cameras. Unfortunately, this does not mean there is a gluttony of features available. This camcorder pretty much has all the basic features you would expect to find on a camcorder. For instance, the DVR990 does have an intelligent auto mode that chooses the correct settings for a particular shot, adjusting to the lighting situation. This is a very user-friendly feature  because  you don&#39;t have to worry about a shot being over or under exposed. A nice addition would have been an integrated memory, but as opposed to some other HD video cameras in the DVR900 series, the DVR990 is compatible SD, SDHC and SDXC cards. Some other camcorders only give you one memory card option.","Looking for help and support from Vivitar&#39;s customer service is hit and miss. The company has two primary options for customer support: phone or email. Vivitar also has a Facebook page where they take questions from customers. However, almost every wall post is answered with a variation of &#34;please contact us through email or by phone.&#34; However, it is gratifying to see that most of the wall posts are at least responded to, and most of the time the email address or phone number will be posted as well. We sent numerous emails out to them, and the ones that were responded to took about a day or two. However, a majority of the emails went unanswered. We also tried the phone service multiple times and were able to get ahold of a customer service rep fairly quickly. However, we found it difficult to get all the answers we needed, and the representatives we spoke to seemed more  trained to deal with defects and returns as opposed to general inquiries about Vivitar&#39;s camcorders."]},"id":"9a81ebe4-034c-4fec-af30-9f67e810e4c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"311133d9-4afb-456c-aa00-1f534ee48cce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a no-frills, basic camcorder that records full HD video; if that sounds like something you are looking for, then the Vivitar DVR990 is right up your alley.
