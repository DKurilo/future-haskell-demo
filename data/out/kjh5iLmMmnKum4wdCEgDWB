This <a href=\"/best-freezers\">upright freezer</a> is unique and is set apart from its competitors by a split contoured design with the bottom half a dedicated freezer and the top half a convertible refrigerator or freezer. While we like this design, we were disappointed in the lack of features that comes with the Freezerator. Not only is it missing non-standard items like a fast freeze setting or an external temperature display, it is missing essential features like a lock and a power on light. These missing elements knocked this upright freezer’s rankings way down.","Although it is Energy Star compliant and it has an estimated yearly operating cost of  $82 – the same price as the non-Energy Star compliant, GE FUF21SVRWW. As for capacity, this upright freezer has the potential of 21 cubic feet of freezer space. Of course, this number includes the top half of the Freezerator which can also be used as a refrigerator. If you choose to use the upper space at a warmer temperature, the freezer capacity drops to 15 cubic feet. The same goes for baskets, door bins and shelves. If you include the upper half of the upright freezer, you have a total of six door bins and six inside shelves. Conveniently, to avoid digging blindly through all of those bins and shelves of frozen food in your dark garage, this upright freezer comes with an interior light.","Out of the nine features we recommend an upright freezer have, the Freezerator only has one – a frost-free defrost system. A Frost Free feature means that the freezer prevents ice buildup by automatically defrosting the freezer each day. If you’ve ever had to manually chip ice off the side of a chest freezer, you’ll agree that if it could only have one feature, this would be it. However, we would have liked to have seen even some of the basic features like a lock, a temperature monitor or a power on light included.","Very industrial in appearance, the exterior façade of the Gladiator Freezerator has a silver tread plate finish with a black border. This “toolbox” look is perfect for your garage and Gladiator actually has several other garage workshop products that have a matching exterior. A reversible door also makes garage storage easy because you can reverse the door to open from the left or right side, depending on which works best for your space. Adjustable leveling legs with castors are built into the Freezerator for further taste-specific space tailoring.
