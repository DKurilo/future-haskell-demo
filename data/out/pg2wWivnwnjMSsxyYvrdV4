You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Singer 7258 has the features and capabilities to complete almost any sewing project. With over 100 stitch patterns and 10 different presser feet, you can alter your <a href=\"/best-sewing-machines\">sewing machine</a> to fit whatever project you’re working on. While the options and features can be intimidating, the sewing machine’s intuitive design helps beginners learn how to sew and adapts with them as they become advanced sewers.","The Singer’s 100 stitch patterns include various straight, zigzag and decorative stitches. While the machine will automatically adjust the stitch length and width for the type of stitching you are doing, you can also manually adjust the length and width of each stitch.","This automatic sewing machine has an adjustable speed with a maximum of 750 stitches per minute. While the sewing machine is slightly slower than comparable machines, it has six single-step buttonhole styles to help you create custom looks on your projects. The Singer also has twin-needle capabilities, but it does not include a twin needle with its accessories. If you&#39;d prefer a sewing machine that has faster stitching speeds, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/brother-cs-review\">Brother CS6000i</a>.","The Singer 7258&#39;s automatic features make this one of the best sewing machines for beginners. With an automatic needle threader, cutter and bobbin winder, you only need to know what buttons to push. For beginners, one of the most beneficial features of this machine is the automatic tension control. The Singer 7258 automatically adjusts the machine’s tension to fit your project.","This computerized sewing machine has an LCD display that illustrates the different sewing patterns, which makes it easier to use. The design also includes a drop-in bobbin that makes loading the bobbin into the machine easier than with a standard bobbin holder. While the sewing machine lacks adjustable feed dogs, it comes with a darning plate that serves the same purpose.","The sewing machine includes several parts that help it adapt to fit your project. It includes a light, so you can sew in areas that have low lighting. You also can adjust the machine for free-arm sewing on bigger projects. This sewing machine does not come with an extension table; however, you can purchase one separately. This machine also includes both a foot pedal and a start and stop button to control the machine.","Singer includes several accessories with its sewing machine. In addition to 10 presser feet, the Singer 7258 includes a sewing kit with needles, spool caps, screwdrivers, a seam ripper and a cleaning brush. A dust cover comes with the machine to protect it from dust particles, but the sewing machine does not include a transportation case.","The Singer has three different warranties for specific parts of the machine. The sewing machine head has a 25-year warranty, with a five-year warranty on the motor, light assembly, wiring, switches, speed control and electronic components. The adjustments, rings, belts, bulbs and attachments have a one-year warranty.","Singer’s website has an online edition of the 7258 instruction manual, as well as some instructional videos and a FAQs section. Additionally, the sewing machine comes with a DVD that demonstrates how to use it. If you need further help, the website lists contact information by either phone or email."]},"id":"b4bf84af-0ecd-4da4-85e9-8d76d3bc6670","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dc12b070-59fd-4706-9cf5-1a20a516f933","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Singer 7258’s intuitive design makes it a good sewing machine to learn on, and with the advanced features, you can still use the machine as an intermediate sewer.
