The smallest model has a monitor that measures 9 inches, and the largest is 17 inches. These units include many of the same features, such as built-in FM transmitters, infrared transmitters, remote controls and dome lights.","The smaller overhead DVD players from Rockville are more affordable than the company&#39;s larger ones, but they don&#39;t lack in features. You can play your favorite movies on DVD in your car, or you can connect other media devices using the USB input. These overhead roof-mounted DVD players include infrared transmitters, so your passengers can watch a movie and listen to the audio with wireless headphones. This keeps the rest of the car cabin quiet so the driver can focus on the road and other passengers can listen to the radio or read a book. You can also use the FM transmitter to broadcast a DVD&#39;s audio to the whole car so everyone can enjoy the movie.","Many of Rockville&#39;s flip down DVD players include an HDMI input, so you can plug in any other device that uses HDMI connections â€“ turning your car into an entertainment hub of movies, music and video games. Some also include a disc full of games, and you can use the remote control as a wireless game controller. The screen resolution on each of these in-car DVD player monitors is high, which results in crisp images. Also, a backlit display offers extra brightness, so you can watch your movie during the day or at night and see the images clearly.","Overhead DVD players take over your car&#39;s central dome light, so it&#39;s an added benefit that these Rockville models all come with lights so you don&#39;t lose that illumination. Many of these in-car entertainment systems are available in a variety of colors, including black, gray and beige, so you can choose the one that works with your car&#39;s interior.","All of Rockville Audio&#39;s flip down DVD players include a one-year warranty, which protects you from defective units. If you get an overhead DVD player that is defective, you can return it to the manufacturer for a replacement or to have it repaired.","The Rockville Audio line of flip down DVD players includes many features that can turn your car, van, SUV or RV into an entertainment system while you&#39;re on the road. You can use wireless headphones or your car&#39;s speaker system for audio, and various inputs let you connect other devices so you can watch movies in other formats or play video games."]},"id":"68712d43-305a-4c3f-9a31-3001289e11dd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68356","url":"/rockville-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-09T15:51:44Z","datePublished":"2016-09-09T15:51:44Z","name":"Rockville","synopsis":"Rockville Audio makes several models of flip down DVD players in several monitor sizes and with different features to suit your in-car entertainment needs.
