You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For most of its history, <a href=\"/best-prepaid-cell-phones\">prepaid cell phone provider</a> H2O Wireless didn&#39;t offer 4G LTE data. Operating on AT&amp;T&#39;s network, the company delivered capable prepaid phones and plans for relatively cheap prices, but it only let you access 3G speeds. Now, with access to AT&amp;T&#39;s 4G LTE offerings, H2O Wireless competes with the very best prepaid phone plans around.","H2O Wireless offers two kinds of prepaid phone plans: monthly and pay as you go variants. All four monthly plans feature unlimited talk, texts and international calling minutes in over 50 countries. The prepaid plans only vary in the amount of data is allotted each month. On one end of the scale, you can pay $30 a month for 3GB of data, for $40 a month you get 8GB, $50 each month warrants 8GB and for $60 you get 12GB of 4G LTE data. H2O Wireless doesn&#39;t offer an unlimited plan, though. We were glad to see that H2O Wireless offers an autopay incentive. You can save between $3-6 each month, depending on what plan you have, if you sign up for automatic payments.","H2O&#39;s pay-as-you-go phone plans are somewhat different. You buy service in $10 buckets, which are then deducted from as you use your minutes, texts and data. Minutes and texts cost five cents each, multimedia messages costs 10 cents, and data is 10 cents a megabyte. This means you can get up to 200 minutes of talk time, 200 texts, 100 multimedia messages or 100 MB of data, but not all at the same time; using any of them deducts from your balance.","Along with H2O’s three 90-day buckets – available in $10, $20 and $30 increments – there’s also a $25 plan and a $100 plan. The $25 plan halves the cost of minutes and texts to just 2.5 cents each, so you can potentially double your talk time or texting habits. The downside: the $25 only lasts for 30 days. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the $100 plan, which lasts for a full year. Minutes and texts deduct from your balance at the same rate as the $10 through $30 plans; you just have more time to use them before they disappear unused into the ether.","Since it operates on AT&amp;T&#39;s network, H2O&#39;s users have access to comprehensive coverage across the country. And with its recent upgrade to 4G LTE service, the provider essentially offers the same experience you&#39;d enjoy with AT&amp;T but at the significantly reduced rates of a prepaid phone company. You can expect coverage virtually anywhere in the United States, and data speeds are second only to Verizon.","The prepaid cell phones available from H2O aren&#39;t always the latest-generation models, but they&#39;re cheap and diverse. If you only need a simple no-contract cell phone, you can get an off-brand device for as little as $30. If you prefer flagship devices, H2O has the iPhone 6S. The company has many midrange prepaid smartphones for sale, including the superb Moto X and Galaxy S5.","Beyond its device selection and simple, affordable plans, H2O offers some nice extras that should endear it to its customers. Every plan has free long-distance calling, caller ID, call waiting, three-way calling and voicemail. It does not, however, have family plans or group discounts; if you’re buying service for more than yourself, don’t expect bulk pricing or shared minutes. This is one of H2O&#39;s largest downfalls when compared against services like <a href=\"/metropcs-review\">MetroPCS</a> or <a href=\"/boost-mobile-review\">Boost Mobile</a>.","The company&#39;s help and support are excellent, with easy access to friendly customer service online, by email and over the phone. Previously we harped on H2O for not utilizing its Twitter account for support. We are glad to see that H2O Wireless has started to respond to its customers, and even potential customers on its social channels. Previously support agents consistently referred customers to the company&#39;s telephone hotline."]},"id":"d57f58af-ed80-4404-b613-73ba4f35d341","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7977004-cc65-4117-80c8-efb437c7d099","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["H2O Wireless may not be a provider many are familiar with, but it offers no-contract cell phone plans at great prices on a network that&#39;s as solid as you&#39;ll find among its competition.
