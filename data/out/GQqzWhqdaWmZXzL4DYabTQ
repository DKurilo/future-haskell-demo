The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-electric-wall-double-ovens\">Electric Wall Double Ovens</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The GE JB850SFSS is a freestanding electric double oven range that features two separate cooking chambers so you can cook different dishes at different temperatures simultaneously. Buyers of this double oven note its reliable performance and attractive price tag, making it ideal if you want a solid oven without breaking the bank.","This double electric oven is standard in terms of its oven capacities. The upper oven has a capacity of 2.2 cubic feet and the lower oven has a capacity of 4.4 cubic feet, for a total of 6.6 cubic feet of cooking space. The varied size of each cooking chamber makes each one ideal for different types of dishes. For example, the top oven is good for cookie sheets and small casserole dishes while the lower oven can fit large roasting pans, such as Thanksgiving turkeys or Christmas hams.","This electric double range also features a dual-element bake in each oven. This feature ensures each chamber produces an even heat for the best cooking results. People who have purchased this oven say it does in fact deliver excellent results. It heats up quickly and to the accurate temperature. Some electric double ovens have difficulty with temperature accuracy, but according to its online reviews, this GE appliance doesn’t have any such issue.","Since it is freestanding, you can place this oven anywhere you have space in your kitchen. Many double ovens are built in, which means you must place them between countertops and cabinets. This one gives you the flexibility to place it either on its own or in a space designated for a built-in double oven.","Users say one of the best features of this double oven is its cost. This GE oven costs far less than many of its counterparts. It is extremely cost effective, particularly given the performance, functionality and features it delivers.","The GE JB850SFSS isn’t especially unique among the masses of double ovens on the market. However, it carries the solid GE name, and its reliable performance, inexpensive price tag and polished aesthetics makes it a good fit in most American kitchens."]},"id":"1028868e-e89e-4329-b6ba-668e916f7238","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0165f1e9-453b-43c5-adbe-fa2433d7ede5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE JT3500EJES is an electric wall double oven that excels with its cooking performance and design. The large 5 cubic feet of cooking space on each oven helps this product stand out when compared to similar models.

However, it&#39;s missing certain additional features such as rapid preheat and a temperature probe.
