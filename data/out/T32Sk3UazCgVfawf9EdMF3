great waterproofing and advanced features, including hands-free talking, a vibration feature and an LED flashlight. In addition, this walkie talkie comes with some unique emergency features, such as a built-in emergency whistle and access to NOAA weather channels and emergency alerts.

In our range and clarity test it didn’t reach anywhere near the advertised 35 miles, but this is not unusual because the manufactures’ advertised ranges usually represent optimal conditions rather than real-world use. That said, this model performed exceptionally well in our tests against other long-range radios. We tested the reception at half-mile intervals on two different channels. On the high-power GMRS channel, communication within a 2-mile range was one of the best for clarity, though our testers did encounter static. On the lower-power FRS channel, the T600 H2O showed surprising stability, with the clarity only decreasing by 3 percent between the mile and 2-mile tests. And while transmission quality dropped after distances of 1.5 miles, it stabilized again at our 2-mile test.","On both channels, the longer distance tests were sometimes hard to understand because of static, but the transmissions were still discernible—the biggest factor when it comes to a walkie talkie. Many of the other walkie talkies we tested couldn’t transmit anything at the 2-mile distance, and if they could broadcast, the transmissions often cut in and out."]},"id":"36627015-41c7-4db2-8d35-e8106d6a64b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/6NQszWeaFFA8s9H7f7x8s5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/reviews/69202/motorola-talkab-5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6NQszWeaFFA8s9H7f7x8s5.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6NQszWeaFFA8s9H7f7x8s5","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6NQszWeaFFA8s9H7f7x8s5.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f966690c-f705-4e79-9a0a-5eed49aa6547","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola T600 H2O comes with a rechargeable battery pack but no charging cradle.

This mode emits a loud emergency tone and then sends a 22-second transmission, hands-free, to any compatible Motorola walkie talkie within the range of the unit. As an added bonus, the T600 H2O features a removable belt clip that also functions as an emergency whistle.

There is also a pattern of small rubber grips on the back of the unit that helped our testers hold the unit. The unit was a little awkward in our testers’ hands because the body of this walkie talkie is rounder and thicker than many we tested.

The other units we tested floated completely on top of the water, much better than bobbing along partially underwater.","As mentioned before, the belt clip for this unit also serves as an emergency whistle, which is innovative.
