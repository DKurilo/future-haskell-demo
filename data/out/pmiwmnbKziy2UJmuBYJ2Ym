This dynamic machine can scan, fax and copy quickly and well, making it a worthwhile addition to your home office or small business.","Clearly, this all-in-one printer&#39;s main benefit is its ability to produce great-looking photos, and it does that. With a maximum color resolution of 9600 x 2400 for color prints and a maximum resolution of 600 x 600 for black and white prints, the HP Photosmart 7520 can hand you some splendid prints. It features a 25-sheet auto document feeder, a 125-page tray for paper, duplex printing and borderless printing. Unfortunately, you get a somewhat meager monthly duty cycle of only 1,250 pages, which is not that much if you need to make numerous prints for personal use or for your company.","You get the ease of wireless printing from nearly anywhere using smartphones, tablets or other mobile devices with the help of HP ePrint, Google Cloud Print or Apple AirPrint. You can get extra free apps for your device from HP. You also can print directly from a USB device, but unlike many other all-in-one inkjet printers, this one does not offer Ethernet connectivity. That could be problematic if that is something you employ often in your small business.","You can send faxes easily since they glide seamlessly over the internet rather than via phone connections, which is a boon since you will not need to worry about any phone-related disruptions. You can send faxes at a rate of four seconds per page, the fax memory holds 101 pages and the fax speed dial will retain 99 phone numbers.","You can scan documents directly to email. Unfortunately, copy speeds are a bit slow at 7.5 copies per minute for black and white copies and seven copies per minute for color copies. This five-ink printer features a 4.3-inch touchscreen color graphics display panel that handles the controls for whatever you need to do."]},"id":"4597a6d6-27db-433d-9a13-57750ed62994","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"71321566-ac19-4319-8880-e94fff8f9274","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This multifunction printer gives you great prints with clear colors, easy scanning and faxing and easy-to-use wireless connectivity.
