When it comes to home appliances such as <a href=\"/best-coffee-makers\">coffee makers</a>, Cuisinart has a deservedly great reputation for manufacturing excellent coffee makers, and the Cuisinart Brew Central line is the place to find the best coffee maker as far as design, functionality and just plain good-tasting brew.","Of this line of coffee makers, the Cuisinart Brew Central DCC-2650 is a top-notch model that offers plenty of useful features without being overly complicated. Who needs complications when you are standing there bleary-eyed in the morning yearning for a &#34;cup of ambition,&#34; as Dolly Parton so aptly called it in her award-winning song, &#34;9 to 5&#34;?","This coffee maker is one of the best coffee makers around for the various adjustable features it presents, helpful characteristics such as an audible alert when the brewing is finished, and its healthy three-year warranty."]},"id":"e7d54256-dccc-4b80-8ede-a7ed7966d084","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Pricing"},"id":"fc5d8927-2bd5-4ce1-b168-d8e962aff455","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/XHdyVMupiZT5U9j6WAV5BJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"You will not run out of java with this generously sized 12-cup-capacity coffee maker.

That capability certainly helps smaller households, or homes in which only one person is a coffee drinker. You also can adjust the strength to either regular or bold, so you can determine just how strong your coffee will be.","In addition, this device is equipped with a charcoal water filter to remove the smell and taste of chlorine and other chemicals that your water district might be adding to the stream coming from your kitchen tap.","If waking up is tough without coffee, your worries are now over. With this device, you can awaken to the delicious aroma of a freshly brewed pot of coffee every morning. This drip coffee maker comes with a built-in clock, and you can program the device so it starts brewing your morning coffee at a designated time. Purists might scoff at adding the water and coffee grounds the night before, but anyone who simply cannot face the morning without a good cup of joe will be grateful for this feature.","This coffee maker comes with a glass carafe that sits on a nonstick heating plate. You can adjust the plate to high, medium or low settings to keep coffee from becoming bitter while it stays hot. A permanent filter is included for the coffee grounds, but if you prefer, you can use paper filters. These disposable filters make a coffee maker easier to clean and add an extra level of protection against the cholesterol in coffee oils, which a permanent filter lets through. However, many coffee drinkers like the fuller flavor of the oils. If you use the built-in filter, it is wise to clean it regularly so that any remaining oils do not take on a rancid flavor.","Unfortunately, you cannot replace the glass carafe with one that is the thermal type.","This machine also protects against forgetfulness: There is a handy automatic shut-off function. You can program the timer to keep coffee warm for as long as four hours.

This device also provides a useful audible alert once all the coffee that you have planned to brew is done and waiting nicely for the coffee drinkers in your home to fill their mugs. You get five beeps to let you know that coffee is about ready as  the brew finishes up dripping into the pot – surely a welcome sound at any time of day or night.","It is easy to use this device, since the coffee maker&#39;s water level indicator shows how much water you have poured in.","Another helpful convenience is the 60-second memory that recalls the settings you have programmed and also where it was in the brewing process before the coffee-making ritual came to a halt.","When your Cuisinart DCC-2650 has accumulated enough calcium and needs a good interior cleanup, it will let you know that it is time for some quick and easy cleaning. The device is equipped with a &#34;Clean&#34; light that flashes when it is time to get to work.

Then, all you need to do is run a single cycle of fresh water through the pot to remove any vinegar taste.","You also can clean the charcoal water filter by simply rinsing it in cold tap water for about 10 seconds and letting it drain.
