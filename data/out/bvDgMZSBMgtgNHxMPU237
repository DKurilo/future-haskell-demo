The 25cc, two-cycle gas engine is rugged and blows air through the tube at 230 mph, which is among the highest air speeds of the leaf blowers we evaluated.","Despite the power, however, this <a href=\"/best-leaf-blowers\">leaf blower</a> only pushes leaves about 12 feet, which is a shorter distance than other blowers we examined. This is also a heavy leaf blower, weighing in at 10.8 pounds, and it is the loudest we found of those we evaluated, with the noise level registering at 106.7 decibels. When using any leaf blower, and especially with this one, it&#39;s a good idea to use ear protection. If you need a less noisy leaf blower, consider the <a href=\"/black-decker-leaf-blower-review\">Black &amp; Decker LSWV36</a>.","Along with those drawbacks, this gas-powered leaf blower requires more maintenance than an electric model, which is true for all gas leaf blowers. You will need to mix oil and gas since it is a two-stroke engine that requires that fuel source.","However, this leaf blower is a versatile yard tool with some nice features. You can attach a bag and use it as a vacuum for your yard, which is a handy way to clean up wet, messy leaves. You can also use it as a mulcher. The mulch ratio is approximately 16:1, meaning you can mulch 16 bags of leaves into one bag. This drastically reduces the amount of bagged leaves you have to deal with after clearing your property.","In addition, the Poulan Pro PPBV25 is designed with comfort in mind. Despite its weight, the antivibration capabilities built into its design and its cushioned handle make it easy to operate and reduce muscle strain while ensuring a firm, comfortable grip. This leaf blower comes with a two-year warranty, which is standard. This machine has a good feature package and is one of the more affordable gas-powered models in our lineup.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Poulan Pro PPBV25 produces impressive air speeds, but underwhelming results in terms of distance when it comes to pushing leaves. Still, it does a decent job of clearing leaves and debris from your yard. It has a number of convenience features like cushioned handles, antivibration and it effectively vacuums and mulches leaves. Wearing ear protection is an important consideration with this blower, since it produces 106.7 decibels of sound. This leaf blower doesnâ€™t perform at the level of some of the competition, but its affordability combined with its feature package make it a valid option for people who prefer gas-powered tools."]},"id":"3d8ea996-ac94-46ec-a8a6-b2cb845e9e9e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56472","url":"/poulan-leaf-blower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-22T23:49:35Z","datePublished":"2013-05-22T23:49:35Z","name":"Poulan Pro PPBV25","synopsis":"The Poulan Pro PPBV25 is a leaf blower that extends to 38 inches, putting it close to the ground where it can really do its work.
