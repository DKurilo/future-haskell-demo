The best LED light bulbs help save you money and power by using less energy to produce the same amount of light a regular incandescent bulb would.","In addition, LED bulbs last much longer than an incandescent bulb, saving you the cost of replacing them as often. The Sylvania bulb has a 22.8-year lifespan and uses 10 watts of energy to produce the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent. Moreover, based on a runtime of three hours, seven days a week, it only costs about $1.20 per year to run this bulb. This means you could save on your monthly power bill.","One of the best features of the Sylvania LED 73014 bulb is its versatility. You can use it in indoor fixtures as well as outdoors, such as in a porch lamp. Most other LED light bulbs are only designed to be used safely indoors. This doesn&#39;t mean you should use the bulb in areas that are constantly soaked with water or submerge it, but it is reassuring to know that it can handle being used in most covered outdoor fixtures.","This LED bulb produces directional light, largely due to its flood-light design. The bottom half of the bulb is covered with an opaque plastic and the LED lights inside the bulb are aimed up. This makes the Sylvania 73014 good for fixtures that hold the bulb facing down toward the floor, such as ceiling fans or bedroom lights, but it is not as optimal if you need even light distribution.","One of the best features of LED light bulbs is that they come on instantly and don&#39;t need to warm up to reach their full brightness like a CFL bulb. This provides the level of light you need immediately, helping you safely navigate across a room without using your toes to reveal where your furniture is.","Unfortunately, you can&#39;t use the Sylvania LED light bulb with dimmers. Sylvania covers the LED bulb for three years, and will replace the bulb if it fails during this period with normal use."]},"id":"816446b8-9379-4ad1-9ea7-26caf2f44c9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6896a750-464e-4080-a382-e5e4a5425f4d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it doesn&#39;t offer full omnidirectional light, the Sylvania is still a fine replacement bulb for your home.
