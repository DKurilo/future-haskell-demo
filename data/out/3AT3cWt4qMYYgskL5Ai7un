While it is not as extreme as the Atkins diet, it does focus on significantly reducing the amount of carbohydrates you consume on a daily basis. This Zone Diet is sometimes referred to as the 40–30–30 diet.","Created by Dr. Barry Sears, the goal is to manage your insulin levels through a diet designed to keep them within a “zone.” When you are in this “zone”, you will lose weight, have more energy and avoid feeling hungry.","While on the Zone Diet, you will eat three meals a day and two snacks using the proportions 40 percent protein, 30 percent carbohydrates and 30 percent fat. A portion of protein should be about the size and thickness of your palm. You will never go more than five hours without eating. The Zone also includes fish oil supplements.","The Zone Diet online provides tools like a weight tracker, meal plans and a diet journal. The diet journal is designed to help you keep track of your meals and snacks as well as record your feelings and moods toward various combinations of food. There are also message boards to communicate with other members and dietitians.","The Zone Diet website is more helpful than some other diet websites and allows you to search much of the website without always redirecting you to the payment screen. While the Zone Diet online provides many useful tools regarding food and health, it neglects to address the need to exercise and doesn’t provide tools to facilitate an exercise program. There is also no contact information prior to payment and signing up.","The Zone is $52 every 13 weeks. After your first quarter on the program you can customize your payment options. You may be refunded for unused time on the program; however, there is a four–week minimum requirement.","For low–carb. options which also provides exercise and customer support, see our <a href=\"/ediets-com-review\">#1 review, eDiets</a>."]},"id":"3b7d0869-b8ba-4e6e-9a3f-d4e8b5f20058","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1572","url":"/the-zone-diet-online-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-07-30T19:39:07Z","name":"The Zone Diet Online","synopsis":"Editor's Note: When originally reviewed this product was officially an online service.
