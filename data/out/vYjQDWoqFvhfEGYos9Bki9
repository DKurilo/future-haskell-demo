The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-power-scooters\">Power Scooters</a> here.</em>","The Shoprider Scootie is a versatile power scooter that offers four-wheel stability in a three-wheel, travel-size scooter. Its patented articulating front wheels make it the only motorized scooter on the market that can offer four-wheel stability with three-wheel maneuverability. The innovative wheel design reduces tipping, making it great for outdoor and indoor use alike.","This motorized scooter can go up to 10 miles per charge, so you can get to your day-to-day activities without a second thought. Though we reviewed scooters that go up to 25 miles per charge, a 10-mile range isn&#39;t overly restrictive. And with a removable battery pack, replacing your battery is fast and hassle free when you&#39;re on the go. At 82 pounds, with batteries, this is one of the lightest medical scooters on the market.","This compact electric mobility scooter comes with some great features, including adjustable flip-up arms for a roomier ride and an adjustable length that makes it fit in more places. At 17 inches wide and with a 38-inch turning radius, it&#39;s great for crowded areas or narrow halls, such as on a cruise ship.","The scooter comes with a removable basket, which is convenient for customizing your scooter for your needs. If you&#39;re planning a trip to the grocery store and need the extra storage space, the scooter&#39;s basket is a great add-on. And if you have a family dinner to attend, you can travel lighter by easily removing the basket.","The Shoprider Scootie has sophisticated safety features such as electromagnetic brakes. With a max speed of 3.5 mph, it&#39;s among the slowest scooters we reviewed. However, you&#39;ll always feel safe and in control. The scooter&#39;s seat is a compact foldable chair made of molded plastic. The scooter disassembles into five pieces, including the basket and battery."]},"id":"fd05a24f-921e-4047-bed9-19c782675ac1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a66fca9d-f0e7-47c8-b0eb-5ff4787390a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Keep in mind this is a travel-size scooter, so it won&#39;t have all the comforts found in some of the other scooters on the market.
