Whether it&#39;s for purpose of monetary gain or simply to show that they can indeed bypass security measures, hackers have a penchant for finding cracks in computer systems  security and slipping inside. In addition to traditional hackers, entire organizations are dedicated to slipping through companies&#39; internet security for their own gain.","These organizations and hackers employ tools such as <strong>fake security updates</strong>, Trojans, spyware, plain old computer viruses and other types of malware to reach that end. As the new kids on the mobile-device block, Android users must be increasingly aware and educated about avoiding these kinds of security update traps. In addition, due to the nature of the Android operating system, devices that run it have a peculiar vulnerability for fake security updates.","Although warnings that state which content a download will access usually precede the download process, most users simply ignore these warnings, especially for downloads as mundane as a security update. Users either don t take the time to read these warnings because they assume the platform is safe, or they don t really know what the warnings mean. The problem with this should be obvious. If you&#39;re not careful, you run the risk of thoughtlessly giving a bad security update the ability to infiltrate your system.","The good news is that, so far, Android remains a fairly secure operating system. As a descendant, more or less, of Linux, Android already has some intimidating security measures in place. The bad news is that it only takes one bad bug to severely compromise your phone and, by extension, your life. This is especially true if you store private, personal information like your bank account or social security number on your phone   which many people do. That s the benefit of having a smart phone, right?","We tend to do what we want to do and hope that we don t lose our phones, trusting that security updates will take care of any potential security problems. Now, there probably aren t any apps that make sure you never lose your phone. We all do dumb things sometimes and no software can fix that.
