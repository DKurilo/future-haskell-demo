The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-glucometers\">Glucometer Reviews</a> here.</em>","The ReliOn Ultima blood glucose meter is a low-cost alternative for people who need to check their blood sugar levels on a regular basis. It&#39;s compact, fast and affordable, and it doesn&#39;t require complicated coding when using its branded glucose testing strips.","The ReliOn Ultima blood glucose meter uses low-cost diabetic testing supplies that make it a good choice if you are uninsured, under-insured or on a limited budget. The glucometer comes with a lancing device and a small batch of lancets, and the unit&#39;s required test strips are very affordable. This glucose meter is for sale exclusively at Walmart and Sam&#39;s Club stores.","Speed, accuracy and ease of use are all hallmarks of the ReliOn Ultima blood glucose meter. It comes with a comprehensive user manual, and it only takes a few steps to set it up for your first test. It can read glucose levels between 20 and 600 mg/dL, and it only takes five seconds or less to process blood test results and display them on the oversize display screen. Built-in memory is capable of storing up to 450 test results.","This blood sugar monitor allows alternate site testing on the fingertips, forearm, thumb base or upper arm; although, the manufacturer recommends using blood only from the fingertip if you suffer from hypoglycemia or suspect that your blood sugars may be running low. To make testing more comfortable, the ReliOn Ultima blood glucose meter requires a blood sample size of only 0.6 microliters to get accurate results.","The compact size of the ReliOn Ultima blood glucose meter also makes it an attractive option. The glucometer measures only 2.94 inches long by 2.10 inches wide by 0.64 inches thick, and it weighs less than 1.5 ounces when loaded with the required CR2032 battery.","When you purchase a ReliOn blood glucose monitoring system, you receive access to a library of information about diabetes and monitoring blood sugar levels. There are also sections with recipes, exercise routine suggestions and general well-being information.","The ReliOn Ultima blood glucose meter is a simple, no-frills glucometer. Its low-cost test strips and inexpensive startup kit make it attractive to all income levels; although, it does have its limits in that it does not include data-management software and alternative testing sites are limited. However, its small size and simple features make it a popular choice."]},"id":"670851f5-f629-4763-b4e5-bf0c13ffb548","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60909","url":"/relion-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:53:06Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:53:06Z","name":"ReliOn Ultima Blood Glucose Meter","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
