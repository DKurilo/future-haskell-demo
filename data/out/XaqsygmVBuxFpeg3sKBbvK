The top of the speaker is covered with fabric and responds well to touch controls. You tap the top panel to pause the song, or hold your finger on either side to turn the volume up or down. When you say the wake phrases “Hey, Google” or “OK, Google,” there are four LEDs that light up on the top panel to let you know the voice assistant is listening. There’s also a switch on the side panel that turns the microphone off, which is good if you are nervous about having an active listening device constantly monitoring your conversations. The bottom panel of the Google Home Mini is made from slip-resistant matte plastic and hides fingerprints well.
