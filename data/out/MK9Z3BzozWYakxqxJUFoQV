The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use. Top Ten Reviews does not endorse piracy or any other illegal activity.</em>","BurnAware ranked in the middling portion of our review of the best <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software\">Blu-ray copy software</a>. The program itself is a full-bodied optical disc-authoring application. However, it comes up short on certain features, such as compressing movies to fit onto smaller discs, found in the best applications.","All of BurnAware&#39;s tools can be accessed from the main window of the interface. To copy a Blu-ray disc, simply select the &#34;Copy Disc&#34; option from the main menu. From there all you have to do is load the disc you want to copy and select your Blu-ray burner in the destination field. Next, click &#34;Copy.&#34; This initiates a disc-to-disc copy. Depending on the size of the Blu-ray you&#39;re copying and the processing power of your computer, this process can take hours, but this is true among all the Blu-ray copy applications we reviewed.","If you&#39;re making multiple copies of a Blu-ray movie, there is a way to avoid hours of waiting. It involves extracting a Blu-ray&#39;s disc image (ISO file). You do this by selecting the &#34;Copy to ISO&#34; tool. This scans your disc and saves the image to your hard drive. Once the file is saved there, you can use the &#34;Burn ISO&#34; tool to make as many copies as you want. Since this option bypasses the extraction step of a disc-to-disc copy, it literally saves you hours of time.","While this program is very useful in burning, copying and authoring CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays and more, it lacks some of the customization options found in the best products in this category. For example, the <a href=\"/blue-cloner-review\">Gold Award winner</a> has the ability to compress commercial movies to fit onto smaller-capacity blank Blu-rays or even DVDs. Other top-rated products allow you to only copy the feature presentation and discard special features and menus. BurnAware only allows you to make identical copies of your Blu-ray movies."]},"id":"0da7d17f-61e7-45d5-80de-f5270a5fccd3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"69e1fe8a-0f16-48b0-9ef3-4bd6aab10215","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["BurnAware has a lot of great authoring features that allow you to create, copy and burn CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs and more.
