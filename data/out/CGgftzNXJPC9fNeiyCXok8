The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-electric-hair-clippers\">Electric Hair Clippers</a> here.</em>","Last time we tested electric hair clippers, the Andis Promotor was our number one pick. While we still rank it among our top 10, its placement slid for several key reasons. First, it took more than two weeks to ship to our lab, while most of the others came in two days. And two weeks was on the speedy side. When we ordered this clipper online, we were told shipping could take up to five weeks.","Once it finally arrived, it unfortunately came out of the box with damaged or missing accessories. We never found the instructional DVD we expected, the clipper’s blending comb was broken, and the kit’s styling combs were tweaked. Also, the ties on its neck cape pulled off at first use. Finally, when we used the Andis during haircuts, its attachments seemed less durable than those of our higher-ranking clippers. We accidentally snapped off the clips of two guard combs, and their quality in general seemed flimsy.","Our disappointment with its accessories aside, the Andis Promotor is stylish. At 6 1/2 inches long and weighing 14 7/8 ounces, our testers considered it a manageable size and even commented, “It’s pretty!”","Although it’s a little bit slippery to grasp, the clipper is contoured for comfort and control. It has adjustable carbon steel blades that can cut through both wet and dry hair, and its guard combs give you eight cutting lengths. The trimmer comes with four combs of its own for added versatility in detailing, but our focus in testing was on the clipper. The cutting lengths of the clipper’s guard combs range from 1/16 inch to 1 inch, while the trimmer’s cutting lengths are 1/16 inch to 3/8 inch.","The Andis Promotor kit comes with 16 attachments, including right and left taper combs, a blade guard and a blending comb. It also has stainless steel scissors, barber and styling combs, blade oil and a small cleaning brush. The product packaging list says there’s also a hairbrush, but it isn’t pictured in advertising photos and didn’t come in the box.","Among the higher-priced clippers we tested, we hoped for better performance from this kit. While giving eight haircuts, we exchanged this clipper after just a few swipes, most often for the <a href=\"/wahl-comfort-review\">Wahl Comfort Grip Pro</a>. Comparable to the Comfort Grip Pro, the Promotor does come with a five-year limited warranty, and Andis customer service is accessible by both email and telephone."]},"id":"6193e8d1-b8e2-425b-9919-5f90758ddedf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58170","url":"/andis-promotor-clippers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:28:44Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:28:44Z","name":"Andis Promotor Combo + 23-piece Clipper","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
