With 29 charts, the software offers more options than most programs, including charts for DNA records. And the chart quality is certainly better than that of half of the programs I reviewed. But the charts simply don’t have the frame-and-hang quality of the charts you can generate in programs such as <a href=\"/heredis-review\">Heredis</a>. That said, you can add background images, and the Legacy software does give you a lot of control over how you display the charts.
