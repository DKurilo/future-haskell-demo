It can be used both for above-ground and in-ground swimming pools.","With a diameter of 12 feet, this is the smallest round solar pool cover from Poolcenter. The material of the solar blanket is a heavy-duty polyethylene that absorbs heat from incident sunlight during the day and retains it at night. Overall, this solar blanket can raise the temperature of your swimming pool by 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit and significantly reduce the cost of heating your pool with solar or propane pool heaters.","To absorb solar heat, the solar pool cover has raised air pockets on its surface. These air bubbles create an insulating layer that prevents the evaporation of pool water and the heat loss due to cold winds and nighttime cooling. Furthermore, the air pockets in the bubbles act as heat traps that allow solar heat to reach the depths of a swimming pool while blocking it from escaping out of the pool. These bubbles also serve as tiny prisms that refract sunlight into a pool. In this way, they increase the surface area of the pool touched by sunlight. This is an especially useful heating effect for those who use this pool blanket to cover only parts of their swimming pools.","The solar pool cover has a thickness of 12 mils. Although, there are thicker solar pool covers available, 12 mils is the average thickness of such blankets. It is sufficiently thick to remain sturdy and durable, as long as you diligently store in while not in use. While Poolcenter covers this blanket with a seven-year warranty, you should take good care of it to make it last longer than the first year. Therefore, you should make sure to roll up and deploy this solar cover with a reel and also protect it from highly acidic and chlorinated water.","Yet another reason to keep the solar pool cover covered on hot days is its lack of a UV-resistant layer. With no protective film on its outer layer, UV rays easily breaks down the air pockets and turns the plastic polymer material of the pool cover brittle. The blue solar pool cover is actually not as efficient as clear pool covers at heating up pools, although some may prefer its looks. If you’re in the market for a bigger solar blanket, the <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Leslie’s 5-Year</a> comes in sizes that range from 10 by 15 feet to 30 by 60 feet.","Overall, the Poolcenter Swimming Pool Solar Blanket is a thick solar blanket that traps and radiates solar heat in a swimming pool. However, with no UV protection, it soon breaks down when left out in the sun."]},"id":"b71fc501-9a23-4784-a817-dda2d8c5ee59","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63266","url":"/poolcenter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T20:11:19Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T20:11:19Z","name":"Poolcenter 12 Mil 12-Foot","synopsis":"The Poolcenter Swimming Pool Solar Blanket is a round solar cover that measures 12 feet across.
