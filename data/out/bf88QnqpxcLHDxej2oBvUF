The Google Home Mini had a deeper knowledge base and could answer questions that Alexa and Siri couldn’t. Google’s answers were also more location-centric. For instance, when we asked Alexa, Google and Siri, “What NBA games are on tonight?” Google listed our local NBA team’s game before the other games even though the game time was later than others.    <br />\n    <br />\nWe weren’t expecting much from the smaller smart speakers when it came to audio quality, but the Google Home Mini surprised us.

Google and Amazon claim they only record and store the interactions you have with your smart speaker after you say the wake word for each device, like “Alexa” or, “OK, Google.” All the speakers we tested have a microphone mute button, so you can keep the microphone muted. Or you can unplug the speaker when you aren’t using it, if you have concerns about security.","I talked to John Simpson, the privacy and technology project director at <a href=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/\">Consumer Watchdog</a>, about which software platform he thinks is the most secure. He told me, “Google and Amazon have business models that rely on monetizing your personal data. Apple is more about building devices and protecting privacy on them. I’d be inclined to go with Apple if I wanted to protect privacy.” Siri may not be the most efficient search partner, but the fact that Apple doesn’t care how much toilet paper you buy or how many people live in your house may be more important for those concerned with privacy and personal data collection. Simpson’s article about the potential violation of the <a href=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/privacy-technology/consumer-watchdog-asks-ftc-act-against-google-home-amazon-echo-digital\">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</a> is worth reading if you have young children in your home and are considering buying a smart speaker.","I’ve been critically listening to speakers for more than 10 years.

We downloaded the necessary mobile applications on an iPad and went through the process of connecting each speaker to a dedicated Wi-Fi network that reacts similarly to a home network. We then used the app to connect the speakers to a couple of our favorite music streaming services, like Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music. We also connected the speakers to some smart home devices, like Phillips Hue bulbs and smart switches, and took note of how easy or hard it was to add smart devices to the voice-controlled network. We issued a grade for overall ease of setup based on how many steps each of those processes took and how efficient the app was at changing their settings.","The next test compared the efficiency of the microphone arrays to make sure Alexa, Google and Siri can hear you in an adjacent room if you need to turn down or pause the music. We put each smart speaker inside a room 3 feet from the door and played music at 70 dB. We walked around the corner and said the wake word at 70 dB to see if the speaker would hear and obey.

Speakers in the $100 range sound better, but you get significantly better audio results in the $200 range. Battery-operated portable smart speakers cost between $150 and $200, but the voice-control features only work when the speaker is connected to Wi-Fi.","<strong>Lesser-Known Voice Assistants</strong>","We only tested the best smart speakers with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri voice assistants, but there are a couple other entrants in the race for voice-controlled supremacy. The hardware lineup with these lesser-known voice assistants isn’t very diverse – in fact, there are only two, and only one was teased at Samsung’s Unpacked event.","Cortana<br/>At the time we published this update, the only smart speaker that uses Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant, is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Harman-Kardon-Voice-Activated-Speaker-Graphite/dp/B076F9ZD1L?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Harman Kardon Invoke</a>. Cortana uses the Bing search engine to find answers to questions that aren’t specific to a brand or skill, but it has a growing list of partners, including Domino’s Pizza, Food Network and StubHub. Unlike Alexa-enabled smart speakers, there is no need to download or install skills, but you do need to download the Cortana app on an iOS or Android device to complete the setup process.","Bixby<br/>Samsung is jumping into the smart speaker market with its own voice assistant and a high-end speaker that promises to compete with the Apple HomePod&#39;s audio quality and elegant design. The Galaxy Home was announced alongside the Galaxy Note 9 at the Unpacked event in August 2018, and it uses the same voice assistant as the company&#39;s lineup of smartphones, Bixby. As of January 2019, the speaker hasn’t shipped to retailers.","The Galaxy Home looks a bit like a fabric-wrapped fondue pot, with three metal legs, six speakers, and eight far-field microphones designed to deliver 360-degree sound and detect your voice from long distances. We are anxious to get our hands on the Galaxy Home to test the audio quality and search capabilities side by side with the best smart speakers available.","<br/><strong>Important Features to Consider When Buying a Smart Speaker  </strong>","Smart Home Control<br/>Alexa-enabled smart speakers have the upper hand when it comes to compatible smart home devices. Google is slowly catching up, but if you plan to buy and use multiple smart devices, your best bet is to stick with Alexa. If you aren’t concerned with audio quality or using your smart speaker to search the web, the pint-size smart speakers are just as effective for controlling your smart home as their larger counterparts. But keep in mind that the microphone arrays in the Echo and Google Home had better range than the smaller smart speakers, so they’re better designed for large, open areas of your home.","Search Engine Efficiency<br/>We had no problem getting accurate answers for popular questions, but we noticed a big difference in the approach the voice assistants took when answering the questions. Alexa’s approach was definitely more shopping-centric, so Alexa-enabled speakers are a good fit for Prime membership users who periodically order products with a smart speaker. The Google assistants’ answers more closely mirrored a traditional Google search and included in-depth search results and helpful ratings from companies like Yelp and TripAdvisor. Siri has some work to do, especially in the realm of search engine functionality, compared to Google and Alexa.","Sound Quality<br/>If you don’t plan to listen to music, podcasts or audio books with your smart speaker, any of the devices will have sufficient sound quality. However, our side-by-side testing proved that even Alexa’s voice can be hard to understand if the speaker sounds garbled and muddy. The Amazon Echo Dot has the same search functionality and smart home control as its larger siblings, but the speaker is terrible. We noticed speakers above the $150 price range sound significantly better and are loud enough to fill a large family room. The larger speakers, like the Google Home Max and Harman Kardon Allure, sound great but take up a good amount of shelf space and are almost as expensive as buying a low-cost smart speaker and hooking it up to a decent sound bar.<br/>"]},"id":"78bb401b-ab4d-4112-b64d-1adc61ecb9d2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_316","url":"/best-smart-speakers","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-04T17:13:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-04T17:13:00Z","name":"Best Smart Speakers of 2019","synopsis":"We tested the 12 best smart speakers for over a week to compare their sound recognition capabilities and features.
