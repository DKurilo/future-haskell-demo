The three-year warranty and the fact that you can use the battery in other WORX tools are also excellent reasons to buy the Hydroshot. While we found the WORX Hydroshot WG629 quite capable when washing a car, it struggled to remove the set-in oil stain from our driveway, so it's not very good for heavy-duty cleaning. Amazon reviews are also mixed on how good the unit is. Compared to other brands, WORX doesn't make many accessories for the Hydroshot, but you can get most of them in a bundle with the unit itself for about $30 more. There's no built-in detergent tank and the soap nozzle costs extra.

We paid attention to this and scored accordingly.","We ran each machine and placed a decibel meter one foot away to measure how loud it was. The quietest pressure washer we tested was the WORX Hydroshot WG629 at 79 dB. Two units tied for the loudest at 91 dB, the Greenworks GPW1501 and the Harbor Freight Portland 63254. Regardless of the machine, these results suggest you should use hearing protection every time you run a pressure washer."]},"id":"0ef98525-65b4-447a-9cfd-90dbf26ef401","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/NFcnu4QdATMrJNpD2wz3Yo.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"<strong>How Much do Pressure Washers Cost?</strong>","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/pressure-washers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8wLzcvNzY1OTQzL29yaWdpbmFsL1ByZXNzdXJlLVdhc2hlcnMtQ3JhZnRzbWFuLUNNMTgwMC1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMi5KUEc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFcnu4QdATMrJNpD2wz3Yo.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"NFcnu4QdATMrJNpD2wz3Yo","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFcnu4QdATMrJNpD2wz3Yo.jpg","alt":""},"id":"12a2985e-6cfd-44aa-ad25-cc9653543a4a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We found the average cost of an electric pressure washer to be around $120, well within the budget of someone that only needs it a few times a year. However, you can expect to see prices as low as $75 or as high as $250 for most residential models. Electric pressure washers costing more than $250 are mainly for commercial use and may be a better option if you plan to use the machine on a regular basis or for heavy duty cleaning.","<strong>Things to Consider When Buying a Pressure Washer</strong>","Safety Matters Most","Before buying a pressure washer, you should be aware that they can cause serious injuries if used improperly. For this reason, you shouldn&#39;t use the machine until you read the manual and are using proper safety equipment. Anderson says that Mi-T-M asks users to &#34;follow all safety instructions on decals located on the washer and always wear safety goggles and closed toe shoes to protect yourself from the possibility of direct spray.&#34; Regardless of safety equipment, keep the spray away from people and animals.","With electric pressure washers, check that your power cord has a working ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) by hitting the &#34;test&#34; button before every use. While a GFCI can help prevent electrocution, you should keep water away from electrical cords and outlets as much as possible. Lastly, always turn the machine off and pull the trigger a few times to release any remaining pressure when you&#39;re not actively using it, when switching nozzles or performing maintenance.","Pressure &amp; Flow Rate","When buying a pressure washer, pay attention to the pressure rating, measured in pounds per square inch (PSI,) and the water flow rate, measured in gallons per minute (GPM.) In fact, you can get a quick idea of the cleaning power by multiplying PSI and GPM together to get what pressure washer manufacturers call cleaning units (CU.) While higher pressure and flow rate lead to more cleaning power, Anderson says &#34;in most cases, a 2,000 PSI pressure washer will be sufficient for most homeowner cleaning tasks.&#34;","Likewise, our testing revealed that pressure washers with ratings as low as 1,500 PSI are good for most homeowners, though they can take longer to match the results of more powerful units. As such, you can expect to use most electric pressure washers for cleaning cars, wood decks, plastic patio furniture and concrete."]},"id":"67dbc4e5-9bfb-44a2-9ca2-49b35fcaf646","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/saaQt4Qun2zhQXk9LnRbbh.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/pressure-washers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8wL0EvNzY1OTQ2L29yaWdpbmFsL1ByZXNzdXJlLVdhc2hlcnMtS2FyY2hlci1LLTMtRm9sbG93LU1lLVRlc3RpbmctMDAzLkpQRw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saaQt4Qun2zhQXk9LnRbbh.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"saaQt4Qun2zhQXk9LnRbbh","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saaQt4Qun2zhQXk9LnRbbh.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5cd061fb-e765-4bf8-a504-adda1ba7c7e6","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Nozzles","Nozzles are rated in degrees with lower numbers, meaning more concentrated streams for jobs that require more power. However, no nozzle is perfect for every task, so while a 15-degree nozzle is great for cleaning mildew and stains off concrete, it&#39;s less-suitable than a 40- or 65-degree nozzle for applying soap to and washing a car.","Top Ten Reviews cautions against using red zero-degree nozzles, as well as similarly performing turbo nozzles, because they are too powerful for inexperienced residential users. However, Anderson says that when these nozzles are used properly, they can be very useful for removing tough stains from concrete and metal.","Electric vs. Gas-Powered","Although we only tested electric pressure washers, gas-powered models from manufacturers such as Generac and Simpson are still useful for frequent medium- to heavy-duty cleaning. This is because gas engines often have pressure above 2,000 PSI. Gas-powered units are also more useful for areas without access to an electrical outlet. However, gas models are larger, heavier, usually cost more than $200 and require more maintenance than ones that run on electricity.","Aside from a pressure washer&#39;s other features, accessories such as additional nozzles, attachments and hoses are still an important factor to consider. Before buying a pressure washer, you may want to see if the manufacturer sells attachments such as water brooms, brushes and extensions for your machine. Likewise, third-party accessories and hoses need to be able to handle the PSI rating of your machine."]},"id":"7b4a3d5a-a66f-4581-b143-5ff2291c4602","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["id:1872"]},"id":"11dc7c43-327d-47d9-9fc4-ed389ceac235","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_286","url":"/best-pressure-washers","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-23T19:26:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-23T19:26:00Z","name":"Best Pressure Washers of 2019","synopsis":"We spent over 65 hours researching, testing and rating eight of the most popular pressure washer models available.
