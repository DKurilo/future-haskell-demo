All televisions are equipped with tuners that allow the monitor to decode the signal coming through the cable into comprehensible images and sound. A TV tuner card allow your computer to do the same thing. Such a card also allows you to record these signals digitally on your system. It performs much like a DVR device that records programs from your television.","Generally, these cards are not standard in PCs you buy off the shelf at your local electronics store. Therefore, you have to buy a TV tuner card from a third party and either install it yourself or have a computer-minded friend or hired IT professional to install it for you. Truth be told, there really isn&#39;t a reason you shouldn&#39;t be able to do it yourself; if you can construct a structure out of Lego&#39;s or Construx, you can install a TV tuner card into your computer&#39;s PCI slot.","We rated and ranked all the best TV tuner cards on the market today.
