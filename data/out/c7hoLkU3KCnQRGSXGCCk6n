The oven has a 5-cubic-foot capacity, which is on par with many of the models we reviewed. Inside, there are two racks that fit in six positions, so you can customize the space for the pans you use. Since it is a convection oven, hot air circulates inside to cook food evenly – a great feature not often found on gas ranges in this price range.","The oven has both heat and steam cleaning modes. The steam clean is good for quick regular maintenance, while the heat clean gets rid of tougher, built-up grime. Underneath the oven, there’s a storage drawer where you can keep pans, cookie sheets and accessories so they are easy to access.","Unlike most of the gas ranges we reviewed, the GE JGB700SEJSS’s cooktop doesn’t have continuous grates. However, its level surface still makes it easy to move pots and pans. The stovetop has four regular burners, including a 18,000 Btu power boil burner and a 5,000 Btu warmer for precision cooking. The fifth burner is a unique integrated nonstick griddle that sits in the middle of the cooktop.","The knob controls for the burners are on the front of the range, and the electronic control panel for the oven sits behind the burners. This range lets you know when the oven is preheated, and you can broil foods in the upper portion. There is also a Sabbath mode that keeps food warm, in case you keep a kosher kitchen.","Since it comes in six colors, you should be able to match this GE range to your kitchen. You can choose from white, slate, stainless steel, black, black stainless steel or black slate.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"ec0dd127-fe66-49f7-b542-02d7b5f61ec0","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its nice feature package and affordable price, the GE JGB700SEJSS range is a good value.
