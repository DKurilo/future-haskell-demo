You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Ariens 986103 is a walk-behind gas <a href=\"/best-edgers\">edger</a> that can trim, edge and bevel almost any landscape. It has a curb-hopping feature that offers stability and easy adjustment for curb edging. This American-made gas edger starts easily and cuts crisp lines. Because of its raw power and durable construction, this edger is best for large yards with numerous areas that require edging.","With two wheels in the back and one in front, this lawn edger offers special wheel features so that you can trim almost anywhere. The front wheel is laterally adjustable for balance with an attached 110-degree head that pivots. The rear wheels allow you to adjust their height so that your edger can go along the outside of the curb to support its weight while cutting along uneven terrain or curbs. The only problem you might run into is if the curbs in your area are higher than the wheel adjustment allowance.","Instead of a push-button start, this edger has a recoil start, but it tends to start easily. It also has an operator presence control on the right handle. If you release this handle, the operator presence control disengages and shuts the engine down. This is a safety feature that prevents the machine from running while your hand is near the blade. If you want a mower with a push-button starter, consider the <a href=\"/troy-bilt-review\">Troy-Bilt TB516 EC</a>.","The gas edger has four cutting positions that you can easily adjust. A yellow lever within easy reach of the push handles allows you to choose which cutting position works best for the area you are edging. The 9-inch blade cuts through even the toughest grass roots.","A powerful 136 cc Subaru engine rests on top of the frame. The fuel tank can hold up to 0.71 gallons, which is enough to get through most projects, large or small, with one tank. You start this edger with a pull cord, which isn&#39;t as convenient as the push buttons found on electric edgers, but it isn&#39;t difficult to get started. It weighs a hefty 65 pounds due to its all-steel construction. This gives the machine extra strength and durability for long-lasting use, but it can feel heavy to operate, especially on difficult terrain.","The edger comes with a three-year limited consumer warranty. The warranty covers parts and labor cost to make repairs or replacements due to faults from defective workmanship or materials.","The Ariens 986103 gas edger has a lot of engine power and multiple height options in a quality build. It&#39;s a heavy machine, but this is because it&#39;s made completely of steel, making it one of the most durable edgers. This edger is fully capable of giving your property the finished, professional look to make it stand out."]},"id":"339e8306-95b5-4d47-8938-360c46eef0f4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63486","url":"/ariens-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-13T17:03:42Z","datePublished":"2015-03-13T17:03:42Z","name":"Ariens 986103","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer.
