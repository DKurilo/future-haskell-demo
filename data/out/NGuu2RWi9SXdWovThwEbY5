You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Bosch has a long-standing good name in large appliances, and the Bosch 500 series of <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerators</a> lives up to the name. Each model has adjustable spillproof shelves, humidity- and temperature-controlled drawers, a deli drawer and a variety of additional features many refrigerators do not offer. Unfortunately, while all of the features add up to stellar products, the Bosch 500 side-by-sides have a significantly smaller capacity than many similar products do.","Because the Bosch 500 series are shallow, counter-depth refrigerators, they naturally do not have as large of a capacity as many side-by-sides. The B22CS50SNS only provides 21.7 cubic feet of interior space, with 13.3 cubic feet of refrigerated space, which is the smallest capacity model in our side-by-side refrigerator reviews, and 8.4 frozen, which is significantly less room than the best side-by-side refrigerators we reviewed have.","Despite the small capacity, the Bosch 500 series has stellar refrigerator features. Each model has four spillproof shelves, three of which are adjustable, and a humidity-controlled drawer and a temperature-controlled drawer, something many side-by-side refrigerators do not offer. Each one also comes with a deli drawer for meats and cheeses, and a bottle rack to keep your beverages at the ideal temperature and eye level. The refrigerator door has two large-capacity bins, two standard-sized bins and a dairy compartment.","Additional refrigerator features include a door-ajar signal that warns you when the door has been open for more than one minute. If the door is open long enough to affect the internal temperature, you can use the quick-cool feature to quickly restore the proper temperature. The Bosch 500 also has special power-saving modes, including economy, vacation and Sabbath modes.","The freezer portion of the side-by-side Bosch 500 series is also impressive. Similar to quick cool, the quick-freeze option restores the temperature in the freezer or quickly freezes new food items. The icemaker sits above the three glass shelves and two clear, plastic freezer drawers. The door provides four storage bins and houses the ice and water dispenser, which uses the Bosch UltraClarity filter for clean and crisp water.","This side-by-side is Energy Star compliant and has an average yearly operating cost of about $60, using 539 kWh annually. Bosch&#39;s warranty is fairly standard, with parts and labor covered for one year and the sealed system and compressor covered for five years.","Bosch offers a number of support options for its major appliances. You can find user guides, FAQs and tutorials on the website, and you can contact customer service by telephone or email form."]},"id":"331f3f7a-679d-47cb-b915-4b8c465c7afd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6271f62e-30f5-4fd4-b60e-f0ddd2d189c7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch 500 refrigerators offer a great deal of features, both standard and additional.
