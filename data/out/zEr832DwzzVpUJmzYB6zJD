We looked for a range of capabilities in the products we investigated, from those easily used by beginners to more sophisticated applications. We also looked at what each could do and price ranges to suit all pocketbooks.","We scoured company websites, contacted manufacturers with questions, looked at anything new on the marketing horizon, and conducted tests ourselves to make sure we thoroughly understood the merits and drawbacks of the models we ultimately reviewed.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent more than 40 hours testing video capture software, which combined with our other research, led to our scoring and ranking for the 10 best products on the market. Our first goal was to find software that is easy to use, even for people who have little or no experience when it comes to creating digital videos. We looked at each application&#39;s features, interface, stability, workflow and other characteristics that can make all the difference between a terrific experience and a disaster. We gave low scores to products that were difficult to use.","There is no point in using any video capture software if the result turns out badly. We prepared a test project and used it for each of the software products we had chosen for testing, checking in particular the quality of the final video. We looked for anything that could detract from the viewing experience and graded the products accordingly.","We examined how much customer support you can expect and how easy, or difficult, it is to get in contact with the software publisher if you run into a problem. All the information we learned, particularly from our testing, helped us produce a numerically ranked lineup of best video capture software.","Sound is a big part of the video viewing experience, so it&#39;s best to seek out an application that lets you record and improve it.","<strong>Things to Look for in Video Capture Software Visual &amp; Audio Capture Tools</strong>","Our testing showed the best video capture software lets you record in a variety of ways, including the whole screen of your computer, portions of it, different windows or applications. In addition, the software&#39;s recording function lets you capture other things including video games and streaming content, and in some cases, VoIP calls from programs such as Skype. It also helps if your video capture software lets you record your face, especially if you want to be seen via a picture-within-picture fashion on the final video as a narrator or commentator while other material also is being displayed on the video.","We especially liked software that records sounds from a microphone or your computer. Having both of these capabilities gives you considerable opportunities for creativity as you add your commentary or sound effects to what&#39;s visible on the final video.","Editing Tools<br/>The best video capture software permits you to edit the original content so you can get rid of footage you don&#39;t want, add special effects and do much more. The more editing tools available on an application, the better since it lets you make the finished video free of unwanted material or sounds and makes it look more professional.","Output<br/>Excellent video capture software offers multiple video formats. We found some software that provides just one format, while others offer more than 10. In this case, the more, the better. You also will no doubt appreciate the top-notch software that lets you optimize video to be played back on various kinds of mobile devices. If someone is going to watch your video on a tablet or smartphone, it&#39;s great to be able to prepare your content so it shows up well on those devices. ","How Much Does Video Capture Software Cost?<br/>Video capture software can cost anywhere from $15 to $300. Obviously, there’s going to be a huge difference depending on how much you pay. Keep in mind that the more expensive products are geared toward professionals. If you only need basic features, a product that costs less than $60 should fill all your needs nicely.","<strong>Is It Legal to Download YouTube Videos?</strong>","The short answer is yes – you can download any YouTube video without running afoul of copyright law. However, you can get in trouble if you reupload it to YouTube or another video sharing service. If you get caught posting copyrighted videos, you run the risk of the content&#39;s rightful owner issuing a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000?hl=en\">copyright strike</a> against your channel. If you get three such strikes in three months, your channel will be shut down permanently.","There’s a little more wiggle room if you use the videos you download to make new videos of your own. This is known as <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html\">fair use</a>, which allows you to use copyrighted videos if you’re commenting on them, remixing them or making them <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/fair-use-what-transformative.html\">transformative</a>. But you should keep in mind that what’s transformative is subjective, and the creators may issue copyright strikes against you even if you believe your work is transformative. You can appeal, but YouTube generally sides with copyright holders to stay in compliance with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act\">DMCA</a>.","Since YouTube doesn’t have a native download feature, you need to install a <a href=\"/best-video-downloader-software\">video downloader program</a>. We recommend <a href=\"/allmytube-review\">AllMyTube</a> because it has great features that go beyond downloading. It also has basic <a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">video editing</a> tools and can <a href=\"/best-video-converter-software\">convert videos</a> you download into different formats.  ","<strong>Can You Legally Monetize Gameplay Videos?</strong>","You have no doubt heard that video game streamers like <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ninja/clips?filter=clips\">Ninja</a> have made profitable livings by uploading their gameplay videos to <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a> and YouTube. Obviously, Ninja hasn’t been shut down by <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/\">Epic Games</a> for his Fortnite uploads, but what are the copyright rules about posting your gameplay? Well, it&#39;s a bit of a grey area.","As <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/youtube-gaming-pewdiepie-fair-use-1.4309312\">CBC News</a> reported, most video gaming companies &#34;tacitly permit YouTubers to violate their copyrights, with creators and publishers turning a blind eye out of consideration of the promotional value of being featured on high-audience channels.&#34; So, the fact that video gaming companies are getting free publicity for their creations in one of the top reasons they don&#39;t take legal action against lucrative streamers.","However, video game companies do retain the right to take action against streamers should they choose. With this being a relatively new form of media consumption, it wouldn’t be surprising if copyright rules changed in the near future to be more strict against streamers. But the push for this change might not come from the services you’d expect.","According to <a href=\"https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/esports-%E2%80%98let%E2%80%99s-play%E2%80%99-revenues-to-reach-$3-5-bill\">Juniper Research Report</a>, it’s believed that the growth of game streaming consumption will create $3.5 billion in revenue by 2021, a massive jump from current earnings. Additionally, Netflix stated that video games like Fortnite, not other streaming services, are its largest competitors for viewers’ eyes. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/netflix-thinks-fortnite-is-a-bigger-threat-than-hbo/\">Netflix even stated</a> that when YouTube globally went down in October, it saw a spike in account signups and viewings, which isn’t conclusive but further shows just how popular video game streaming is.","If you plan on making money from gameplay postings on YouTube, you first need to agree to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857?hl=en\">YouTube’s Partner Program</a>. The same goes for any other video posting site.
