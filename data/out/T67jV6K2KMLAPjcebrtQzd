Garmin Vivosmart <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness tracker</a> is smart, capable and very well designed. You can control smartwatch-style notifications, as well as accurately track your steps, calories burned and sleep. The stylish band is easy to wear, lightweight and comfortable, and it has a very clear, easy-to-read and unique backlit display.","It’s important to consider accuracy when selecting a fitness tracker, and for this, the Garmin Vivosmart is a good choice. It scored fairly well in our accuracy tests, only falling behind other products in how accurately it counts steps. Its 89 percent score is only slightly below normal, so it still gives you a very good idea of your overall health. Sleep analysis and calories burned are the Vivosmart’s most accurate metrics, scoring above 95 percent in both cases. The Vivosmart doesn’t track how many minutes you&#39;re active each day. Still, this activity tracker is one of the top bands, and it can help you stay fit and make healthy choices every day.","The Garmin Vivosmart is well equipped to monitor your progress over time. You can establish step, sleep and weight goals, as well as see your daily progress toward meeting those goals. This watch fitness tracker only lets you set a few custom goals, but we found that there are enough to encourage practicing healthy behaviors every day. Whether you’re at your desk or on the couch, the band vibrates and shows an idle alert when you&#39;ve been sitting too long.","One of the best things about the Garmin Vivosmart is that it&#39;s actually smart. It displays notifications from your phone, and you have full control over the types of alerts you see. If you don&#39;t want to be bothered by emails on your early morning run but want all phone calls to come through, you can adjust the settings.","Unlike other fitness trackers, using the Vivosmart you can read full texts or the beginnings of messages since you can scroll through more than a few words at a time on the screen. Other trackers’ screens are so small, you might miss an email’s subject line altogether.","Compared to the other fitness trackers we reviewed, the Garmin Vivosmart’s compatible app isn’t the easiest to use. While it’s easy to view individual metrics, it’s hard to compare them across days and to other metrics. This fitness tracker band has a 28-day history, so your data is stored for a month if you&#39;re unable to sync it with your phone regularly.","This lightweight tracker weighs only 19 grams. It also sports a seven-day battery life, which is a little longer than average. Depending on how often you use the smartwatch features, the battery could last a shorter or longer amount of time. The band comes in five different colors and is completely waterproof up to 5 ATM (50 meters), so you can go swimming, take a shower or splash around in the rain on your morning run without damaging the device.","The Vivosmart is one of the best designed fitness trackers; it is touch sensitive and responds to taps, swipes and holds on the screen. The device doesn’t have a traditional screen. Instead, information is displayed on the band using backlighting that completely disappears when not on. This saves battery life, is attractive and doesn’t attract the fingerprints that most other trackers with screens are plagued by. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get the screen to turn on, but for the most part, the screen is fairly easy to use.","The Garmin Vivosmart comes with a 12-month warranty. Should you have questions about setting up or using the device, customer support email and phone information is available on the company’s website. Garmin is quick to respond to any questions or problems."]},"id":"4efb5d3e-1531-4d4e-a152-6544a767853c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b96933cf-470d-47b5-a9d4-d6782e156292","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This activity tracker wristband is perfect for everyday or exercise-only wear.
