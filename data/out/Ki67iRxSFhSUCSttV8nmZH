It took almost 11.5 minutes to heat to 500 degrees Fahrenheit in our test. But when it came time to grill meat, it quickly became apparent this was one of the best outdoor grills we&#39;d seen. It cooks meat evenly and thoroughly. You can place the meat anywhere on the grill and get similar results. The cast-iron grates lock in the heat and create nice sear patterns on the meat.","We found that, at high temperatures, meat has an above-average tendency to stick to this grill. But you can largely overcome this problem by simply lowering the temperature. The cast-iron grates cleaned up nicely after we finished grilling. Although the grill takes longer to heat than most, it cooked our meat quickly because of the grates&#39; high capacity for retaining heat.","Btu measures power as it relates to the generation of heat. You want a barbecue grill with a Btu that isn&#39;t too high or too low for its grilling area and number of burners. This grill generates 50,000 Btu across four main burners, which is neither too high nor too low for that many burners.

We could fit only 15 hamburger patties on its surface. For most occasions, that is more than enough space, but it&#39;s something to consider if you are accustomed to feeding large groups of people. The warming rack is also small and only accommodated up to five buns. Its cooking space is expanded with the side burner, which allows you to cook side dishes of all kinds at the same time your meat cooks. If you need a grill with more space, consider the <a href=\"/weber-genesis-review\">Weber Genisis II</a>, which can cook up to 24 burgers at once.","On the plus side, this grill is quite compact, so you can store it away in tight areas. The end table on the right folds down to economize space even more. Like other Broil King grills, this one looks bigger than it is. Its height of 45.5 inches is no taller than average, yet it seems taller because the handle is positioned higher than on most grills. The Baron is one of the heavier grills in our lineup at 154 pounds, which attests to its sturdiness, but it handles nicely and is easy to maneuver around the yard, despite its heft."]},"id":"774e3610-d559-4172-9e28-42ce46150de6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Heating"},"id":"f843db95-707d-496d-9440-63ae5a33c2a6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/BdFmyNHxFN5TefEELP3x2S.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/64717-broil-king-baron8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdFmyNHxFN5TefEELP3x2S.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"BdFmyNHxFN5TefEELP3x2S","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdFmyNHxFN5TefEELP3x2S.jpg","alt":""},"id":"72b74d74-56de-4d41-a255-0c9947a0554c","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Broil King Baron is made of sturdy, durable materials.
