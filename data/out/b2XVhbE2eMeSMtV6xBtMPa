You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool ED5FVGXWS is more practical and traditional than exciting and innovative, but if you are looking for a <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a> that is energy efficient and has enough bins and baskets to store all of your favorite things, then read on, friends.","Whirlpool has created a great refrigerator. It has great features, it looks great and it has great storage, but nothing, not one thing on the inside or outside of this fridge, wows us; everything is pretty adequate, which is really too bad because other top-rated refrigerator companies have clearly shown that the technology is out there.","The control panel is probably the most blasé feature of this refrigerator. The best side-by-side refrigerators sport a digital control panel with one-touch controls. The Whirlpool has push-button controls. Most of the controls have two linked buttons, and only one of these can be pressed at a time. For example, if you want crushed ice, you will push the corresponding button down, and the cubed ice button will pop up, releasing that command. The other linked buttons include switches for the light and the power. Although these controls are not as sophisticated at the controls the best side-by-side refrigerators use, they are simple and provide the essential functions you need in an ice machine.","The temperature controls for the ED5FVGXWS refrigerator are on the inside of the fridge instead of on the control panel, which some may prefer. Also inside the refrigerator is the filter-replacement reminder. A green light indicates that the filter is good, a yellow light warns you to order a filter replacement and a red light reminds you to replace the current filter. These visual reminders are helpful.","This side-by-side refrigerator has a total capacity of 25.1 cubic feet. Of that total, 15.2 cubic feet make up the refrigerator storage area and 9.9 cubic feet are found in the freezer area. For a five-member family, 23 cubic feet is estimated to be enough storage space, so the Whirlpool refrigerator can store enough food for between five and six people, depending on your family&#39;s food consumption.","The refrigerator storage area has:"]},"id":"91ef465a-58f0-47c6-8885-8985e5592b76","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Three adjustable SpillGuard glass shelves","Three clear, adjustable door bins","One crisper","One meat drawer","One snack drawer","One dairy compartment"],"type":"ul"},"id":"efad5aea-5140-43d6-ade9-586589c5cbb4","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We have seen the inside of many different side-by-side refrigerators, but this model is one of the few that still places the deli drawer in the middle of the fridge, breaking up the crisper and drawers.","The freezer storage units include four wire shelves, four door bins and one slide-out basket. The ice maker is stored in the freezer, and it is rather large, limiting your freezer storage space.","Water from the faucet is fine if you let it run for a long, long, long time until it reaches frigid temperatures so you can&#39;t actually taste the tap. With the Whirlpool ED5FVGXWS, you don&#39;t need to wait for almost-good-tasting water. This refrigerator uses a PUR water filtration system for delicious water every time. Just note, however, that you will need to change the filter every six months or so.","Whirlpool boasts a brand of energy-efficient refrigerators – refrigerators that are Energy-Star compliant as well as CEE Tier II rated, making them some of the most energy-efficient refrigerators on the market. The Whirlpool ED5FVGXWS holds true, also receiving the best marks in energy conservation. In fact, this side-by-side refrigerator is said to use less energy than a 60-watt light bulb if they were both constantly running for a year.","One way the Whirlpool model saves money is through its adaptive defrost system. This system monitors the frost build-up on the evaporator coil and adjusts the defrost time and periods between defrost cycles accordingly. By only running when necessary, the adaptive defrost system saves energy and makes the Whirlpool unit more eco-friendly. This defrost system also makes your food last longer, limiting freezer burn that can ruin frozen foods.","The Whirlpool fridge uses an estimated 577 kilowatts every year. You will pay an average of $61 annually on your utility bill in operating costs for this side-by-side refrigerator. This boils down to $2.43 for every cubic foot of food storage space, which is a reasonable cost.","If you have technical, installation or warranty questions, you can contact Whirlpool customer support via telephone and, our favorite, live chat support, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST. You can also fill out an online form and connect with the company via Twitter and Facebook.","On the Whirlpool Gold GSS26C4XXW product page, you will find a Manuals &amp; Literature tab.
