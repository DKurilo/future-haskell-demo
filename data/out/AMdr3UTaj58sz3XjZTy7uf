Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sitecom, a European-based company, has a very straightforward mission statement: Make it Easy. They strive to create home network solutions that are simple and easy to use with user-friendly designs and comprehensive warranties. All of their products are backed up with a 10-year warranty. The Sitecom WL-330 is a Wi-Fi booster that bears the Sitecom name and guarantee.","Wireless reception can be a problem in any home or office. Competing signals, electrical interferences and even walls can disrupt a wireless network. Wi-Fi boosters harness your current wireless network and rebroadcast the connection across dead zones. The Sitecom WL-330 uses two antennas to capture and extend your wireless internet connection with the same speeds (up to 300Mbps) as the primary internet source. The unit only has one Ethernet port, so you won’t be able to connect more than one device to have direct access to the rebroadcasted internet signal. However, if you have devices that only need to connect wirelessly, rather than directly to an Ethernet port, like an iPad or Kindle, this won’t be a problem.","Equipped with the latest wireless-N technology, the Sitecom wireless range extender will enhance an older router to fully take advantage of its internet connection capabilities. The extender will work with most B, G or N Wi-Fi devices. When installing, set the Wi-Fi booster next to your router. Once the repeater has captured the signal, you can move it to wherever you need the enhanced signal most. Signal status lights on the device will indicate if the wireless connection has been collected, as well as its strength. If for some reason you need to reset your router, you can also reset the Wi-Fi booster with a handy reset button on the back of the unit.","When compared to the size of an average router, this Wi-Fi booster is quite compact. It measures 4.5x4.7x1.1 inches and weighs only 2.12 ounces. It definitely doesn’t take up any unnecessary space. Because the Sitecom WL-330 has an IP address where you can initially set up features, you can also access and manage the device remotely. Another handy feature is the on and off button that allows you to conserve energy or cut off the extended range.","Sitecom has done a good job in helping you gain access to whatever kind of help and support you need. Their website has FAQs, an installation video, downloadable drivers and data sheets. They also have a technical support phone number or email address you can contact for direct help. Best of all, Sitecom backs up all of their products with a 10-year warranty against manufacturer defects or incompatibility – by far the best warranty on the market."]},"id":"6177ae44-4c96-4de2-98cb-b508d04f9123","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d6b324a3-b44b-40b3-9abc-01f4e0f359d8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sitecom WL-330 is quite a handy little device – compact yet powerful.
