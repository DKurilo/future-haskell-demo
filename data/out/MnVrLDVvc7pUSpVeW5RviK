This racing wheel and pedal set is made specifically to plug-and-play with PS3 and PC games. One appeal of this product is the Ferrari license. It utilizes the brand with its inclusion of two Ferrari style-digital gearshift levers that sit behind the wheel.","The buttons of the Ferrari GT Experience are clearly marked and closely resemble the interface of a Playstation controller. Because of Thrustmaster&#39;s partnership with Ferrari, the look and feel of their wheel peripherals are close to the original thing, and the Ferrari GT Experience wheel is no exception. It&#39;s a simple design encased in sturdy plastic and rubber. The comfort level is great. There&#39;s really only one drawback to the design here: The lack of a stick shift and clutch means the racing experience lacks realism.","The pedals are quality material, but the gripping bottom doesn&#39;t work well and slips easily. It seems like it was designed to be built into a cockpit and racing seat, instead of just using it on the floor. Also, the pedals don&#39;t give force feedback on every PS3 game, but they do vibrate to simulate road conditions. The wheel uses bungee cord technology to keep it auto-centered and to give the effect of power steering. The wheel only turn 90 degrees in either direction, and that takes some of the control away on hard turns.","While the Ferrari GT Experience wheel and pedal kit looks custom made for the PS3, it actually works the best on PCs. Only on a PC can you use the full extent of the force feedback that gives you the full experience of road conditions and the accurate feel of being behind the wheel."]},"id":"03de681d-da5d-43a8-833b-34e976a8eb16","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"19495798-e42c-4b6b-bc41-f722658a4e75","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ferrari GT Experience looks great.
