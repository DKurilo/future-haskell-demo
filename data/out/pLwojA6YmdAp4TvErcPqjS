It has a simple interface with the standard grid of colors to represent your hard drive as it defragments the disk. It has tabs to indicate the various functions, including selecting specific files or folders for special attention or doing a boot-time defrag only.","When you need to focus your hard drive maintenance in a single area, this defragmenter allows you to exclude specific files and folders from your scans. As is the case with <a href=\"https://o-o-defrag-professional-review\">O&amp;O Defrag</a>, it has automatic scheduling features as well. These functions default to the off position, but you can select a scan style and frequency that works for you.","Glarysoft Disk SpeedUp also includes an optional background scan. Just select how long you want to wait before the scan starts and the software will automatically perform micro disk defrags during your down time. If you prefer, you can also set it up to start automatically whenever you start up your computer. The software application can also optimize your solid-state drive if you have one. However, it is unable to scan for and detect duplicate files on your computer.","In addition, it has file – and drive – analysis tools to show you disk capacity, fragmentation, analyzed file amounts and which fragments need optimizing. It can also do a boot-time defragmentation that targets startup programs. Analysis usually takes less than a minute and can help you decide if it’s time for a full defragmentation or if only certain files need to be worked on. Like many defragmentation programs, Glarysoft recommends defragging your PC once a week rather than daily.","This defragmenter requires 1.24KB of free space for installation. It works on Windows versions 7, 8 and 10. Though it does not include adware or bloatware, it does ask if you want to install Glarysoft Utilities before you open the application. Glarysoft Disk SpeedUp handles most of the functions of any disk defragmenter with advanced features that let you focus on specific areas."]},"id":"a10a8268-8ca8-4f87-a8b8-d44eb9a411cd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68060","url":"/glarysoft-disk-speedup-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-29T21:03:49Z","datePublished":"2016-06-29T21:03:49Z","name":"Glarysoft Disk SpeedUp 5.0.1.62","synopsis":"Glarysoft’s Disk SpeedUp is a defragmenter application that offers distinct types of scans, so you can focus on specific files or organize your entire hard drive.","review":{"rating":92,"verdict":"Glarysoft Disk SpeedUp is a solid disk defragmenter packed with advanced functionality and an easy-to-use interface.","pros":["The process to download and install it is fast and easy."],"cons":["It has no duplicate file finder tool."]},"strapline":"Glarysoft’s Disk SpeedUp is a defragmenter application that offers distinct types of scans, so you can focus on specific files or organize your entire hard drive.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-09-13T00:00:00Z","id":"pLwojA6YmdAp4TvErcPqjS","meta":{"title":"Glarysoft Disk SpeedUp 5.0.1.59 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Perform daily micro defrags when your computer isn&#039;t in use with Disk SpeedUp.
