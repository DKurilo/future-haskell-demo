The modem is certified by CableLabs for DOCSIS 1.1 (Data Over Cable Service Specification) and software upgradeable to DOCSIS 2.0 with no hardware changes.

If the cable modem is installed to connect to an ISP that has stepped up to DOCSIS 3.0, it will work, but it will not be able to take advantage of the DOCSIS 3.0 improvements in speed or services. DOCSIS 1.1 improved on DOCSIS 1.0 by supporting Voice Over IP (Internet phone) and allowing ISPs to provide tiered services. DOCSIS 2.0 improved on DOCSIS 1.1 by adding commercial services, video conferencing and video phone.  DOCSIS 3.0 adds support for entertainment video, mobile devices and IP TV.","DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 had no differences in theoretical maximum speed: 40Mbps downstream and 10Mbps upstream. DOCSIS 3.0 uses a technology called &#34;channel bonding&#34; to join multiple 6MHz channels together to quadruple the data throughput speeds that were possible with DOCSIS 2.0. The SMC EZ Connect External Cable Modem supports concurrent computer connections via Ethernet and USB, which allows two computers to be simultaneously online without adding a hub or a switch.","In order to prevent unwanted network traffic, the product supports IP address filtering. ISPs equipped with SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) servers can take advantage of the SNMP agents in the cable modem for remote configuration and monitoring. Inclusion of DES (Data Encryption Standard) secures the privacy of data transmissions over cable media."]},"id":"a1e119ca-d30a-4ce5-af82-a189c51d05bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"a1718151-ee1b-4cf1-99db-3db3db63c995","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SMC cable modem is compact and can be placed in a vertical or horizontal position.

Just as Linksys sells DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems to cable operators and only retails DOCSIS 2.0 cable modems, SMC has a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem named the SMCD3USG for cable operators to test and deploy, but SMC only retails DOCSIS 2.0 cable modems. Now the SMC EZ Connect DOCSIS 2.0 Compliant External Cable Modem (SMC8004CM) is certainly an excellent cable modem as far as DOCSIS 2.0 cable modems go. And support for appropriate communications software standards makes it easy to install, register and manage from the user or cable-provider perspective. Concurrent support for two PCs, one on Ethernet cable and one on USB cable, is an unusual feature. The fact that technical support is available every day and all day by toll-free telephone in ten languages contributes to the winning status of the product."]},"id":"d30f983a-5318-4775-86ea-5e37962b7d2b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49453","url":"/smc-ez-connect-8004cm-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-05-04T15:54:24Z","datePublished":"2010-05-04T15:54:24Z","name":"SMC EZ Connect External Cable Modem SMC8004CM","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"The SMC cable modem is one of the better DOCSIS 2.0 devices.","pros":["The SMC cable modem allows two PCs to simultaneously access the Internet."],"cons":["This is not a DOCSIS 3.0 compliant cable modem."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-05-04T15:54:24Z","id":"QFGd5Z2Z7Ryxccg5rEwPPm","meta":{"title":"SMC EZ Connect External Cable Modem SMC8004CM Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
