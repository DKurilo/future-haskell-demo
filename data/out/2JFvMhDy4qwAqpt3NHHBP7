Here&#39;s what you can expect from the best thermostats:","Lower Utility Bills<br/>Instead of setting a single, stable temperature as on a traditional thermostat, you can use a programmable thermostat to set a schedule for your home’s temperature at different times of the day. This saves money in both the short and long term by heating or cooling only when it&#39;s necessary. All programmable thermostats have schedules, but smart ones make the process of setting them easier in the following ways:","Auto-Scheduling<br/>A smart thermostat builds on your schedule by adapting when your plans change. Some, like the Nest Learning Thermostat, auto-schedule by tracking your habits over time to learn your routines. Eventually, they may pick up on your schedule and preferences so well that you don’t need to adjust them at all. Other smart thermostats don&#39;t try to predict your schedule and instead respond to your activities.","Smart thermostats with auto-scheduling create a foundation for their programming by observing your habits and local weather patterns or by asking you simple questions. This works best when a thermostat has at least one of the following:","<strong>Usage reports</strong> let you know how much energy you use and give feedback on how you can save even more. The best smart thermostats keep a record of your energy use starting the moment you activate them. Some thermostats have icons, like the Nest Leaf, to let you know you&#39;re improving.","<strong>Motion sensors</strong> allow the thermostat to react to events outside of your regular schedule, such as if you come home from work early one day. This is an advantage if you don&#39;t interact with your thermostat very often. Unlike schedules and geofencing, however, motion sensors can&#39;t make your home comfortable before you arrive home.","<strong>Geofencing</strong> creates a zone around your house and tracks your smartphone&#39;s GPS location to activate home or away modes. This useful feature can adapt to your schedule in a way that sensors and scheduling don&#39;t always get right because it knows when you&#39;re home or not.","However, sometimes geofencing doesn&#39;t work. When we asked Booth about this he said, &#34;There are a lot of variables that play into geofence reliability; everything from the data connection you have on your phone or the carrier you&#39;re on, or the location services.&#34; As location services improve on smartphones, this feature will become more useful.","Smart Home Integration<br/>Some Wi-Fi thermostat manufacturers include home automation functionality so their products can link to popular smart home devices. For example, a smart lock can activate your thermostat’s away mode when you lock the door, a security camera can record a video clip when someone adjusts the temperature, and a fitness tracker can adjust the heat while you sleep.","If you have a smart home system, make sure the thermostat you want works with it before you make your purchase. Most thermostat makers have a list of compatible smart home platforms on their website."]},"id":"08535f9e-d416-47d4-bdd6-f0b65b81c42e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/2owJ7gbAcJsP9fBf6akESh.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Smartphone App","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/programmable-thermostat/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9HL0YvNzgyMDc5L29yaWdpbmFsL1Byb2dyYW1tYWJsZS1UaGVybW9zdGF0cy1OZXN0LVRlbXBlcmF0dXJlLVNlbnNvci0wMDEuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2owJ7gbAcJsP9fBf6akESh.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"2owJ7gbAcJsP9fBf6akESh","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2owJ7gbAcJsP9fBf6akESh.jpg","alt":""},"id":"afc7faf2-664c-4c57-ae4f-ccedc7fd3695","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Using a smartphone app, you can control your system remotely, view usage data and set schedules. All are useful in case you forgot to set an energy-friendly temperature before you left the house.<br/>","<br/>Rebates<br/>Find out if your local energy company offers rebates before you buy a new thermostat, since some offer incentives for you to install a programmable one, which can help pay for part or all of the upgrade. Your utility company wants you to conserve as much energy as possible, since that allows them to put what you save to use elsewhere. Booth also suggested checking with thermostat manufacturers to see if they have a directory of rebates available in your area.","A Long Service Life<br/>Although new smart thermostat models come out every year, you don&#39;t need to replace them often. You can expect most units to last 10 to 20 years under normal conditions. We suggest you replace your smart thermostat when it breaks, when you upgrade HVAC equipment or if the mobile app stops working when a company goes out of business.","<strong>Decoding Common Thermostat Features</strong>","Temperature Swing<br/>Temperature swing is how many degrees above or below the set temperature your home needs to reach before the thermostat activates your HVAC system. Models with narrow temperature swings of less than a half degree keep your home the most comfortable, but they run your HVAC system more often, which can wear down equipment and increase your energy bill. A wider swing is more efficient because it allows the temperature to vary more before activating your home’s heater or air conditioner.","Multistage Heating &amp; Cooling<br/>The thermostat can activate heating and cooling incrementally instead of just turning the system on or off. If one stage isn&#39;t powerful enough to adequately cool or heat your home, a stronger stage activates to reach the desired temperature. By using higher blower speeds only when necessary, the system saves energy.","Weather Conditions<br/>Knowing the weather conditions near your home can help you save energy. For example, you can use this information on especially hot days to set the air conditioner warmer than normal or turn down the heat on mild winter days. Some thermostats, like the Nest Learning Thermostat, gather this data and use it in tandem with auto-scheduling.","Programmable Fans<br/>The thermostat can run your air conditioner&#39;s fan to circulate the air in your home, which helps eliminate uncomfortable hot and cold spots. Some thermostats can also run the fan briefly after the compressor turns off, which uses leftover cold air in your system that would normally go to waste.","Remote Sensors<br/>One of the latest industry trends is a thermostat with remote sensors you can place in different rooms of the house. These sensors track motion and temperature so your system can tailor its activity based on the room you&#39;re in, rather than an unoccupied hallway, which is where most homes have their thermostat.","For a while, ecobee was the only company that made remote sensors for its digital thermostats, which gave the ecobee4 and ecobee3 lite distinct advantages in larger homes. However, the Nest Temperature Sensor shows that other thermostat makers are starting to catch up.","While many other manufacturers make thermostats that support remote sensors of some kind, this functionality is mainly available if you use a smart home hub and the sensors it&#39;s compatible with."]},"id":"97eab40a-dcf9-4719-b6c5-615c834363fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/VvwhWhpkyssr9JkjRHvqWZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Smart thermostats can give you maintenance reminders for basic tasks like replacing air filters, which should be done every few months.

This is particularly helpful in extreme climates where HVAC systems regulate heat, cold or humidity to protect your home from damage. The alert helps you catch problems before they get worse.","Warranty<br/>The best programmable thermostats come with warranties of two or three years. However, some manufacturers provide a longer warranty if you have a professional do the installation. For example, the Carrier Cor has a five-year warranty if it’s professionally installed, but only a three-year warranty if you install it yourself.","Support<br/>The best wireless thermostats come with complete customer service, including support reps who can be reached over social media, email, phone and live chat. Because social media support requests are so public, they add a layer of accountability that private communications, such as phone calls, emails and chats, often don&#39;t. For example, Twitter is one of the most effective ways to get help with your thermostat because responses are quick and often direct you to the most effective solution."]},"id":"882d94ec-170d-47e0-af02-ab973672c76c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"60aa33b0-f118-4905-8c73-f997abdfae37","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/nest-review\">Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd Gen)</a>","<a href=\"/ecobee4-review\">Ecobee 4</a>","<a href=\"/nest-thermostat-e-review\">Nest Thermostat E</a>","<a href=\"/ecobee3-review\">Ecobee 3 Lite</a>","<a href=\"/emerson-sensi-review\">Emerson Sensi</a>","<a href=\"/honeywell-lyric-t5-review\">Honeywell Lyric T5</a>","<a href=\"/honeywell-wi-fi-smart-review\">Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart RTH9580WF</a>","<a href=\"/radio-thermostat-review\">Radio Thermostat CT-80 B</a>","<a href=\"/carrier-cor-review\">Carrier Cor TP-WEM01</a>","<a href=\"/lux-geo-review\">LuxPro GEO-BL Wi-Fi Connected Thermostat</a>","<a href=\"/venstar-colortouch-review\">Venstar ColorTouch T7850</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4564afc3-9046-4f76-af87-0340fa8cfeb9","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_211","url":"/best-programmable-thermostats","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-25T16:39:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-25T16:39:00Z","name":"Best Smart Thermostats of 2019","synopsis":"We tested a variety of smart thermostats (including models from Nest, ecobee and Honeywell) and ranked them by efficiency and effectiveness.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested a variety of smart thermostats (including models from Nest, ecobee and Honeywell) and ranked them by efficiency and effectiveness.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-09T20:59:08Z","id":"2JFvMhDy4qwAqpt3NHHBP7","meta":{"title":"Best Thermostat 2019 -
