Typically, you can choose from natural down or synthetic fill, or sometimes a combination of both. Each have pros and cons.","Natural down (goose or duck) is lightweight and durable, and it provides exceptional warmth in cold and dry conditions. However, down is all but worthless if it gets wets. Synthetic fill is quick-drying material that, while heavier, is a good choice in wet or humid conditions.","Many companies, though, are now using hydrophobic treatments on their down fill, essentially making the water resistant. And many sleeping bags themselves are water resistant, further protecting the down, if that is your choice of fill.","Down rating is another consideration when purchasing a sleeping bag. When looking at the fill number, the higher the number, the lighter weight and smaller the bag. For example, take two 20-degree sleeping bags, one with a 650-fill and the other with an 800-fill power. Both have the same temperature rating, but the 650-fill bag will be bigger and heavier than the 800-fill bag. Because backpacking bags need to weigh less and be more compact, you’ll typically see fill between 750 and 900."]},"id":"91fa0d67-1e14-43fb-b3a7-6ce9d25269d0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"How We Evaluated: What Went Into Our Sleeping Bag Reviews"},"id":"726077ba-70a8-45a5-b0e1-992db730b365","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In addition to testing in the Utah desert during winter months, Active Junky also took these sleeping bags to humid conditions in the Pacific Northwest and into the Colorado Rockies during wetter spring months.
