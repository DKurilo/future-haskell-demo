You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magellan SmartGPS 5390 is a <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> with some unique smartphone-enabled features. It also has many additional features that can make your commute easier. Its high-definition touchscreen can show you a variety of nearby points of interest as well as navigational information.","It comes preloaded with 3D maps of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, and you can even get maps of Mexico, though you’ll have to purchase them from Magellan. It has built-in Wi-Fi, which makes it easy to download maps and other information. It is also loaded with 7 million points of interest like nearby gas stations and restaurants. The included speed limit meter helps you obey local traffic laws, even in unfamiliar areas.","You can tether the GPS system to your smartphone to enable additional information and functionality, such as the ability to look at gas prices, view upcoming weather, find local businesses and even review them thanks to the Yelp connectivity. Being also equipped with Bluetooth, the device can act as a speakerphone and let you receive phone calls.","Despite being packed with functionality and a smartphone integration capacity, the car GPS lacks voice recognition software that would allow it to process voice commands. Some comparably priced competitors have this feature, which is meant to save you time and keep your hands and eyes on the road.","The GPS navigator has a capacitive touchscreen, which means it uses the same technology as a smartphone. This enables it to respond quickly and accurately to touch input. Its screen has a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels – the second highest resolution of any in our lineup.","If you unplug the unit, it does have a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery that can give you about 1.5-2 hours of battery life. This is handy if you’re only taking a short drive, or need to charge while navigating.","If you have a question or issue, you can contact Magellan’s customer support team via live chat, email or telephone, whichever you prefer. The company also has various educational resources about the product on its website. The 5390 ships with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"a2ee0e52-8175-4d05-ae54-052d0b64c347","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8c746066-be62-4e0e-bd30-6cea3c79fe90","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magellan SmartGPS 5390 has good functionality overall.
