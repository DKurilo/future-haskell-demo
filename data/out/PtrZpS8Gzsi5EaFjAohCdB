You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The <a href=\"/best-genealogy-websites\">best genealogy search engines</a> have large, diverse databases. WorldVitalRecords has 4.2 billion sources from 47 countries, with the oldest records dating back to the 16th century. The more diverse a database is, the more likely you are to find information on your ancestors. This is especially true when sources date back centuries, which is something this genealogy site as going for it. Navigating through such a large amount of research may seem daunting, but this site is well organized. Even rare sources are classified with geographic information, an especially useful feature if your family lived in one country for generations. In addition, the geographic emphasis gives you context about your ancestors&#39; lives and links you to additional records that may not have been obviously applicable otherwise.","WorldVitalRecords gives you the ability to browse the databases by several categories, such as exact or Soundex matches, record type, location, or database title. You can dig through individual databases covering specialized topics like Revolutionary War records or the 1940 Census. This genealogy site also offers a wide range of record types, like census records, court records, directory lists, family histories, family trees, immigration records, military records, newspapers and other reference materials. Records are updated regularly, and featured collections and the database of the month can be found on the home page, making them easy to access.","Beyond the normal sources, WorldVitalRecords has a hefty collection of yearbooks. The more than 8,000 high school, college and military yearbooks offer a priceless glimpse into your relative’s early life. While you can find most essential types of records such as birth, death and marriage documents, there is no surname&#39;s index. Luckily, this isn&#39;t a huge setback.","This website does have plenty of records, but extra features are lacking. For an extra fee, you can access several types of DNA tests through this genealogy site to discover your maternal or paternal origins. The DNA tests are the most outstanding feature available on this site, beyond the database. Ancestry search sites often have family tree builders or file uploaders that allow you to enter the sources you already have into the database, which is not possible with WorldVitalRecords. You also won&#39;t be able to connect with other users as easily as you can on other genealogy searches. There are no forums or message boards, but you can search other members through the directory or interact with the website through social media sites like Twitter or Facebook."]},"id":"ce2e52ed-91b5-4f4a-be16-a357ab83a90c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4338132b-d653-4e8e-ac80-dc5756698d86","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["WorldVitalRecords.com has a promising number of resources for genealogists around the globe, but it misses the mark on extra features.
