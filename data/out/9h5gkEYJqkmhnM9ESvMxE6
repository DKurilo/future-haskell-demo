You can use the bread blade for cutting bagels and rolls without shredding them, which is a common problem even with regular knives.    <br />\n    <br />\nThe motor is quiet and powerful enough to get through most foods like bread, vegetables and turkey but can struggle with food like thick roasts. The blades are slightly longer than 8 inches, which is on the small side and limits its versatility.

The blades are made of durable stainless steel that will resist corrosion and retain sharpness and won’t easily bend.  <br />\n  <br />\nThis knife has its own self-contained butcher block that doubles as a storage device for the blades and handle.

The gray carrying case it comes with holds everything neatly inside.

Since you have two blades intersecting, food can occasionally get jammed between the blades. This is easy to fix but can be a little annoying when cutting certain foods.

While this knife is designed for the outdoors, the variety of blades could make it a versatile kitchen tool. You could use it for cutting all kinds of meat and other food, but its rugged design makes it look out of place on a countertop and better suited for storage in a drawer. <br />\n <br />\nThe storage bag it comes with is purely utilitarian. It’s a simple mesh bag that zips on top and has no compartments for any of the individual pieces. It’s just meant to keep all the parts in one place. The bag makes sense for this knife because a plastic case could cause odor buildup and encourage corrosion. This knife also comes with a durable Teflon mesh glove for cleaning fish.  <br />\n <br />\nThe handle of the knife is big and may be hard for people with small hands to grasp, but for most people the rubberized handle provides a solid grip for cutting raw fish or moist turkey. This knife is powered by an 8-foot cord that plugs into a 120-watt power outlet. This gives it a lot of torque for smooth, snag-free cutting. This does limit its mobility, however, which is something to consider since it’s built for outdoor use.

And you can take it to the park for a BBQ or take it to your campsite for cutting meat.  <br />\n <br />\nThere are a few downsides to cordless electric knives. The Rapala is much more expensive than similarly performing carvers. It's also heavier. And both issues are related to the rechargeable battery.

We talked to professionals and industry insiders both before and after deciding on the products in our comparison to find the best knives available and to ensure we were emphasizing the most important features. When questions arose during research for our reviews, we frequently contacted manufacturers to get answers. We also read dozens of user reviews online to get an idea of people’s varied experiences using the products.  Our in-depth research is reflected in our detailed reviews to help you make an informed decision about the best electric knife for you.","<strong>How Much Do Electric Knives and Meat Slicers Cost? </strong>","Electric knives and slicers come in a wide variety of styles and uses. The most common electric knives, used for filleting meat and carving turkeys and hams, cost between $10 and $140, depending on the size, quality and variety of blades. Cordless electric knives cost even more. Hand-held meat slicers cost between $150 and $500.","<strong>How We Evaluted Electric Knives &amp; Slicers</strong>","When considering electric knives and slicers, we did extensive online research to find a variety of knives that represented the best on the market. We considered blade length, blade materials, safety features and power choices. We paid attention to each knife’s construction, versality and ease of use. For instance, most of the knives in our lineup have a handle that is easy to grip and requires the simple pull of a trigger to operate. However, several of the knives have a wide grip that may be difficult for people with small hands to grasp.","For people with health issues like arthritis, electric knives are often a necessity, so we took that into account and found knives with ergonomic designs. We reviewed knives that would serve sportsmen, cooks and people with specific challenges. Our lineup of electric knives will serve a wide variety of people, and our reviews will help you narrow your choices.  ","<strong>Why Buy Electric Knives &amp; Slicers?</strong>","Electric knives and slicers are designed to take the work out of slicing and carving meats and chopping vegetables. Much more efficient than traditional knives, electric knives do all the work for you, which makes food preparation and serving quicker and easier. The blades run off some type of power source – batteries or electricity – and they are usually detachable for cleaning.","These tools can be necessities if you have arthritic hands or if you suffer from health problems that rob you of your strength. Typically, two blades lock into place and then you turn the electric knife on. The blades move quickly back and forth, and a serrated edge cuts into the food.","Todd Smith of Brisbane, Australia, who enjoys cooking at home, said he liked using an electric knife to slice ham and said he’d probably use it for a roast or chicken.","Bruce Kjar of Utah, another individual who enjoys cooking, says he prefers using electric knives for two reasons. “One of the main things I like is how much easier it is to cut through whatever you’re slicing,” Kjar said. “The other is you can slice everything in equal slices, instead of big and little slices like you get with a regular knife.”","Everyday cooks favor electric knives, but even the professionals love them.","Food Network host Alton Brown on his show “Good Eats” has deftly carved a Thanksgiving turkey while extolling the virtues of electric knives.","“Knife-happy as I am, the tool that separates the Boy Scouts from the samurai is nothing more than a $15 hardware store electric knife,” Brown declared before easily carving smooth, even turkey slices for people around the dinner table and, later in the kitchen, preparing meat for the freezer.","<strong>Electric Knives &amp; Slicers: What to Look For</strong>","Electric knives and slicers come in a wide variety of styles and sizes. Looking at the following factors will help you distinguish the right one for your needs.","Blade Length<br/>Electric knives come in a variety of different sizes. The size you need depends on what type of food you will frequently be cutting. For fish, you want to choose a smaller knife with thin blades that allow you to slice the fish quickly and easily. For carving turkey or other larger animals, an electric slicer with a blade that is 9 or 10 inches is ideal. The longer the knife, the larger the slices of meat your slicer can handle.","Safety Features<br/>Many electric knives and slicers on the market are designed with safety features that make it hard for young children to turn the appliance on, such as a locking trigger or a double trigger. However, some double-trigger slicers are hard to use unless you have bigger hands.","Power Choices<br/>Electric knives and slicers are usually available in two different power choices: electric or battery operated. Electric knives can&#39;t be carried with you to picnics or outside, but they often offer more power than a battery-operated slicer. Battery-operated slicers make the appliance much more portable, and you do not have cords that get in the way.
