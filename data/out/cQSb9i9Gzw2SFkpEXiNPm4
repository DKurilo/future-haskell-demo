You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Replicant 3, from Rdestiny LLC, converts a DVD movie that has already been decrypted to multiple CD-Rs so you can play it in a DVD player that supports VCD or SVCD format. The benefit of doing this is you don&#39;t need a DVD burner. But the drawback is that it requires multiple discs and is a painstaking process. It took us 6 hours to accomplish this task whereas other products we reviewed can do the same thing in an hour. One feature that most others do not offer is the ability to copy DVD games. However, if you are looking to backup your DVD movies to DVD discs, this is not the product you are looking for. Also, for the same price range, there are products available that do what Replicant does and much more. Before you buy, read our other reviews and look at our product comparison chart for DVD copying software."]},"id":"025e84c6-01ad-4d15-8c55-7516cbc22c5f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Copy Tools"},"id":"da6970c8-6441-4f24-8e12-2fd5466b9cbc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["To put it simply, Replicant just converts a DVD movie to CD-R discs so you don&#39;t need a DVD burner.
