He said the problem with both the store-rented and the store-bought machines we compared is that they don’t have enough suction and they overuse soaps and detergents. Payne also said that nothing can replace a professional cleaning every six months to a year.","&#34;Your carpet is the largest filter in your house,&#34; said Payne.","You either need to switch out that filter or have it thoroughly cleaned. Even frequent vacuuming is not enough to maintain carpeting properly, because it only picks up loose dust. Vacuuming can&#39;t remove the sticky stuff that accumulates, such as cooking oils, body oils, mud etc. In addition to these sticky substances getting stuck in your carpet, dust and other residue can then stick to them as well.","Payne concedes that the machines we tested might be useful for maintenance between professional cleanings and for spot cleanings, especially if you have pets in the home. However, he recommends using very little soap, because it makes your carpets stickier.","<strong>How Often Should I Shampoo My Carpet?</strong>","Payne was adamant that you need a professional cleaning at least once a year, and that is the answer generally given by cleaning experts. But how often should you shampoo your carpets yourself if you own a machine? The answer depends on a lot of factors, including whether you have kids or pets. There are also high-traffic areas in your home that could use a cleaning more often. ","With that in mind, we checked with a few manufacturers whose products we reviewed, including Bissell, Hoover and Rug Doctor, for their general recommendations. Rug Doctor recommends every six months, with spot cleaning more often. Hoover leaves it entirely up to the user, based on individual need.","Alyssa Lett, upright deep cleaning marketing manager at Bissell, recommends shampooing every six months, with a few caveats.","&#34;How often you clean carpets really depends on the amount of wear your carpet gets,&#34; she wrote in an email. &#34;We recommend cleaning carpets at least every six months, but would step that up to every 3-4 months for a home with kids and pets.&#34; She had a good tip for remembering when to shampoo, too. &#34;A good way to remember when to wash carpets is to get it done when the seasons change,&#34; she wrote.","With the input from all three of these manufacturers in mind, we recommend shampooing at least twice a year and more often if you have pets and kids. You want to shampoo somewhat sparingly, though. It wears down the fibers of your carpet over time, which can attract more dirt, so you don&#39;t want to shampoo every day, for example. You also have to let carpets dry thoroughly between cleanings, to avoid the risk of mold.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","I took all the machines to my home, assembled them and used them to clean a variety of messes.  For one test, I piled potting soil onto light-colored carpet, moistened it, ground it in and then vacuumed it the next day. I also poured grape juice on the carpet and left it to dry.

When we compared <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaning-services\">carpet cleaning services</a>, we got estimates – to cover three rooms of carpet cleaning – from 10 companies serving an area of California. The average cost came out to about $128 per cleaning. Although the average price of the home machines we tested was $172, you can reuse the machines. Thus, you&#39;ll get your money&#39;s worth after just a couple of cleanings. ","But are carpet cleaning machines as effective as professional carpet cleaning services? People in the carpet cleaning industry say home machines don’t clean as thoroughly, but people who sell the home machines disagree. We did not do microscopic-level testing to see whether carpets were cleaner after using a cleaning service or a home machine, but the carpets looked dramatically cleaner after both types of cleaning.","We recommend a combination of professional and home cleaning, especially if you have pets and kids. Get a professional service to come in once a year and a home cleaning machine for maintenance, spills and accidents.","<strong>How Long Do Carpet Cleaners Last? </strong>","You can expect your carpet cleaner to last about seven years. We arrived at this estimate after spending hours researching. We asked a couple of the manufacturers, but they said the lifespan really depends on how you treat your machine.","There isn’t much data on how long consumer carpet cleaners last, but we found a handful of sites that give estimates for commercial carpet cleaners and vacuum cleaners. The sites that listed estimated lifespans on these similar products gave similar numbers – all in the range of five to eight years.","Additionally, Consumer Reports periodically surveys owners of certain types of products about the products’ reliability. The last time they did one for vacuum cleaners, the result was a median of eight years.","Cleanfax, a publication that serves cleaning and restoration professionals, also estimated that commercial carpet cleaners last anywhere from five to seven years, so we figure you can expect about that long of a lifespan from your consumer-level one.","<strong>Things to Look for in a Carpet Cleaner</strong>","Performance<br/>It is pretty difficult to gauge how well a carpet cleaning machine is going to perform while shopping. Most of the numbers on the boxes don’t indicate what its performance is going to be like. For example, manufacturers use phrases like &#34;2X cleaning power&#34; but never really give information to back that up or on what that actually means.","However, one number that impacts performance is the width of the cleaning path. The width of the cleaning path doesn&#39;t vary widely between machines, but you want a model with a large cleaning head if you are going to be using your carpet cleaner to clean large areas on a regular basis.","The two things that matter most – stain removal and water extraction capabilities – can really only be determined through testing and comparison. That&#39;s why hands-on testing is so important. We compare how popular products perform in real-world situations. The user reviews found on lots of shopping websites can also help you predict a carpet cleaner&#39;s performance."]},"id":"5df222e0-6c0c-4a75-850f-cbd4d72bb277","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/C2f4bmTnXtz9PhwNcak2TB.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Consider factors that can provide you with overall convenience as you shop for your new carpet cleaner.

Also, consider how easy it is to contact customer service representatives.","<strong>What Can I Clean My Carpet With?</strong><br/>","Most manufacturers will indicate on their packaging that you have to use the associated brand-name cleaning solution with their carpet cleaners, while some carpet cleaning experts recommend cleaning only with water. Other cleaning experts recommend making your own cleaning solution for the best results. Whatever works best for you is the right answer. Experimenting with your own carpeting to find the best solution is worth the investment of your time. ","One thing we can recommend is lessening the quantity of soap. It became apparent during our testing that you do not need the amount of soap recommended by most manufacturers. ","In order to level the playing field, we followed the manufacturer instructions exactly, which included using too much soap. In most cases the manufacturers&#39; soap was effective at removing stains, but it left our carpeting with a subtle stickiness, regardless of which brand we were using. This could attract more dust and require you to clean more often, which can lead to overcleaning your carpets and frayed carpet fibers. This can lead to attracting even more dirt and eventually require you to replace your carpet.","We recommend lessening the amount of solution you use or trying some of the recipes for homemade carpet cleaning solutions available online.","<strong>How Do You Make Homemade Carpet Cleaner?</strong>","The commercial carpet cleaning soaps we tried were pretty effective, even on pet stains, but there are some solid homemade options as well. All you need for a homemade cleaner is vinegar and baking soda. This combination works well for just about any kind of pet stain. It requires some patience, though. You have to pour vinegar over the stain (without letting it get too soggy) and cover that with a layer of baking soda. Then, wait a day or two for everything to get dry. Remove the bulk of the baking soda with a dustpan and vacuum up the rest. This process removes unwelcome odors and colors. Doing this for the occasional pet stain, in combination with regular professional cleanings, will help maintain your carpeting.","<strong>Can You Put Vinegar in a Carpet Cleaner?</strong>","The blogosphere is packed with ideas on using vinegar not just as a spot treatment but as a substitute for soap in your carpet cleaning machine. The idea of using fewer chemicals in the home is inviting, but vinegar may not be the best idea for your cleaner.","Hoover gave us an unequivocal no, saying the vinegar is acidic and will damage the machine. Bissell folks said the same thing – the machine needs the manufacturer&#39;s recommended soap to really do its job. A Rug Doctor representative also said to avoid putting vinegar in their machines.","Since those are the people selling the soap, though, it makes sense to be a little skeptical about their answers. However, in our experience, the plastic used to construct the home version of carpet cleaners was not very sturdy, so it might be wise to heed the manufacturers&#39; warnings or risk shortening the life of your machine.","Vinegar is decent at a lot of cleaning jobs, but use caution if you try to use it as a full replacement in your machine.","<strong>Carpet Cleaner </strong><strong>Maintenance</strong><br/>","Carpet cleaners have moving parts that can wear out over time, so a little maintenance makes sense.

Others are more geared towards avoiding dirt in the first place. Druggets are one example. Also called crumb cloths, these heavy woolen fabrics were spread over rugs, under dining tables and in high-traffic areas to protect these areas from spills, sun damage and other wear and tear. An 1829 painting called &#34;<a href=\"https://www.oceansbridge.com/shop/artists/r/rid-rog/edward-villiers-rippingille/the-young-trio\">The Young Trio</a>&#34; shows a drugget spread over a rug where children are playing. You can also see examples of druggets in other 1800s paintings depicting domestic life at the time. Druggets were removed when visitors came over so that the full carpet design could be on display.","In some cases, people would do the opposite, covering their carpets when guests came over. In Cranford, an 1851 novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, some of the characters sew together pieces of newspaper in order to form paths to different chairs so new carpet couldn’t be ruined by guests.","<strong>Carpet Rental</strong>","People still cover existing floors for special events, but they do it for style, not to protect.
