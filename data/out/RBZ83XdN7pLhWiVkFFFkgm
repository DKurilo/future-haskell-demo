Note: Since our last review, the provider has notified us that they have added a mobile management portal, partnered with a debt management provider and gotten accredited with the IAPDA. These will be included in our next update of this site. Read also our list of the <a href=\"/best-debt-consolidation-companies\">Best Debt Consolidation Loan</a> and Service companies.</em>","Pacific Debt Inc. debt relief has some of the lowest overall fees, ranging from 15 percent to 22 percent of your enrolled debt. This means fees paid for service are taken off the total amount of debts you enroll in the program.","Begin working with Pacific Debt Inc. by filling out the online form on the company homepage. Simply provide how much debt you have, what types of debt you have and which state you live in to see if you qualify for a consultation with Pacific Debt Inc. Based on this information, a personal debt specialist will contact you to discuss your finances and consolidation options.","Fees for consolidation range between 15 and 22 percent of your total debt; these numbers are on the low end of fees for the lineup and compare well with <a href=\"/new-era-review\">New Era</a> and <a href=\"/debtmerica-review\">Debtmerica</a>. Average savings after fees is 30 percent, which is about average when compared to other services on the lineup.","To be eligible to work with Pacific Debt Inc., you need $10,000 in unsecured debts, including medical bills, credit cards, other lines of credit and bills that have been sent to collections. Certain debts, like payday loans and student loans, are not eligible for consolidation, though make sure to check with a debt specialist. The amount of debt you need to owe to work with this service may vary depending on where you live.","While every situation is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the consolidation program typically takes between 24 to 48 months to complete. This is well within the industry average. While this may seem like an excessive timeframe, it takes time to fix your finances, and there is no quick fix. When your debt representative begins negotiating with your creditors, you put money into an FDIC-insured account. These funds will go toward paying your creditors and Pacific Debt Inc. fees when your debt is successfully consolidated.","This bill consolidation company advertises that it does not charge upfront fees but does not mention that it is legally prohibited from doing so. This business is AFCC accredited, meaning it has been surveyed by a third party and found to be upholding FTC rules and regulations in its interactions with consumers. It is not accredited with IAPDA, although many debt consolidation services are accredited with only one of these bodies.","The company website provides useful information and educational tools about debt and other financial tips. Other resources include workbooks about investing and helping you track your spending. To contact the company, you can call it directly or email it. When you enroll in the program, you are assigned a personal account manager and can access your information through the online portal. However, you do not have a mobile account management option."]},"id":"78aaf4f2-5619-4131-a1ed-f799a5ad7f3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9325e4ba-b0fa-4b02-9a58-f927d8d4ced5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pacific Debt charges relatively low fees for service and offers good resources for helping you manage your finances during and after your consolidation program is complete.
