Security specializes in home security equipment for business and residential use. The company sells many notable <a href=\"/best-nanny-cams\">nanny cams</a>, including its own Camscura line of hidden nanny cameras. The Camscura Micro Hidden Camera is one of the smallest nanny cams in our review.","Although rated with a 720P resolution, this camera struggled in our tests when recording at night. The recordings were difficult to make out due to graininess, and overall we gave it a score of 48 percent in our night vision tests. For comparison, the average score for all the cameras we tested was 67 percent.","Video quality during day conditions was much better for this camera than nighttime quality. The recordings came fairly clear, making them easy to see. Itâ€™s important to note, however, the camera&#39;s low tolerance for bright light, which in our testing masked out details of objects as they got further away from the camera.","When it comes to recording, the Camscura Micro offers some unusual options. In addition to continuous and scheduled recording modes, the camera activates by vibration and sound. This means if someone moves or makes noise near the unit, it begins recording. Although sound can trigger recording, be aware that this camera does not actually record audio in accordance with federal and state wiretapping laws. The only recording option that this camera doesn&#39;t have is the ability to take still photos, which isn&#39;t a major disadvantage. The feature itself is nice to have, but rather impractical, as taking a photo would reveal the camera.","This nanny cam was rather difficult to use in our testing. We found it difficult to know if the camera was actually recording, and the motion detection was inconsistent. This unit also does not come with any storage included. You will need to purchase your own microSD card. Aside from ease of use and storage, this nanny cam did fairly well on our test for concealment. The unit is rather small and can be easily hidden in a variety of locations. Its pinhole camera is also small and does not have the obvious glare of a camera lens."]},"id":"56345c0a-6dde-4cd3-9590-9fb31a99b02d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8b0f0a61-3aae-46e6-a9ec-a9f60013a1ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BrickHouse Camscura Micro has much to offer in terms of features and recording options.
