Like other DVD ripper software products, ImTOO DVD Copy allows you to copy one DVD to another DVD or create a backup file that will be saved on a hard drive. You can rip an entire DVD including extras and special features, or you can rip the movie only and omit the extras and special features. One of the features this DVD ripper software lacks is the ability to restore defective or scratched DVDs and the ability to save ripped files in AVI and DivX or to burn on a CD-RW. While we were impressed with the other features, the application is limiting.","As we mentioned above, ImTOO DVD Copy’s main functions include the ability to copy, compress and burn your DVDs. The features of this DVD ripper software all stem from these functions. ImTOO Software Studio considers some of the product’s key features to include the ability to copy a DVD-9 movie to a DVD-9 and to copy a DVD-5 movie to DVD-5, with a 1:1 ratio. The application also has the ability to copy a DVD-9 movie and compress it to fit on a DVD-5 disc. In addition to these great features, ImTOO DVD Copy has a decent ripping time. It took us approximately 45 minutes to rip a 115-minute DVD. This rip time is pretty comparable when compared to other products, being slower than some but faster than others.","ImTOO DVD Copy receives a great deal of praise from users for the simple interface design and navigation. The application will appear on your screen with a few details that are easy to follow and understand. The movie will appear in a boxed screen within the application. Underneath this screen you will have two options: full disc and main movie. These options allow you to rip and save just the movie or the disc, including bonus and special features. Beneath these buttons there is source and target information. Next to these is a circle button used to start the DVD ripping. It’s that simple! For additional settings and features there is a tab on the right-hand side of the page that will pop out to provide options that include: language, subtitles, volume, skin, and include or skip menu. We were impressed with the ease of navigation and feel that the simplicity will be a great benefit for users who decide this application is the best choice for them."]},"id":"7ffb0053-f9d6-454a-ac18-c1d43eab9c6f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"67e59753-ad02-456d-a27a-b97198028a8a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In comparison, ImTOO DVD Copy is one of the better DVD ripper software choices available but not one of the best.
