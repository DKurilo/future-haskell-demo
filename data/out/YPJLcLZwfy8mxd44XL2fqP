You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Moultrie Game Spy M-80xt <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-cameras\">game camera</a> offers four different modes. The user&#39;s manual describes them as Trail Cam mode, Plot Cam mode, Hybrid Cam mode and Video mode. Few game cameras provide this many options for capturing video and images. In addition to the number of modes that this camera offers, it also has the unique capability of capturing audio with video files. The camera doesn&#39;t perform as well at night, but it can still capture decent footage to help you know which animals are coming into the area after dark.","On the front of the camera you will see the LED flash as well as a light sensor that tells the camera if a flash is necessary. There is an LCD display for navigation, but it is not one that you can use to view photos or footage that you have taken. Once the camera is opened, there is a control panel on the right-hand side of the camera. It includes navigation buttons, an Enter button, Mode button and on On/Off/Aim switch. The design of this camera makes it very easy to use for new and experienced users alike.","This game camera offers a 5 MP resolution and provides excellent photos of the areas and of the game that you are scouting. The camera is able to capture a focus range of up to 60 feet, day or night. There are four different options for photo quality: Enhanced, High, Medium or Low. You can customize the settings using the control panel and the display screen to select the option you prefer. At the highest setting, you can hold up to 19,040 photos or eight hours of video footage.","One of the unique features that this game camera offers is its ability to capture video footage with audio. While many other game cameras capture video footage only, this game camera and its new model capture audio as well. This camera also offers three different ways to capture footage: through infrared technology that will capture footage after sensing motion, through a time-lapse function that allows you to set specific hours in which you would like periodic footage captured, and through a hybrid setting that will give you time-lapse function during the day and infrared technology at night.","We were impressed with the options that are available with this camera and with the high-quality results that each setting yields.<br/>The camera runs on four or eight AA batteries and has approximately a two-month lifespan. The life span may be longer or shorter depending on the amount of footage that is captured and the method that is used. The camera has an SD memory card port and is compatible with cards that have up to 32GB of memory. You will need to be purchase the card separately. With the combination of the battery life and the memory card capacity, you should be able to gather months of footage with a single setup.","Although Moultrie offers customer support via email and through a toll-free telephone number, we were never able to reach customer service using the email address provided on the company&#39;s website. We attempted to make contact but never received a response. We were able to get in touch with support through the toll-free phone  number provided on the website and received great feedback and in-depth information regarding the game camera. The representative that we spoke to on multiple occasions was very knowledgeable regarding the Moultrie game cameras and was able to answer each of our questions and assist us as requested."," "]},"id":"19bcfec3-b747-43b6-9519-115a531e530a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8189ee87-9eaa-4ab1-b584-34a5b65e948a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While we are impressed with the quality and the features of the Game Spy M-80xt, there are some things to be cautious of. The red light from the infrared flash is noticeable, and while animals may not run away because of it, they will notice it. Also, when animals are too close to the camera at night, the infrared flash will turn them white and wash them out so that the photos do not turn out with the same quality that they do during the daytime. The camera still has several valuable features that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked, including its capture methods, continuous-shooting capabilities and audio-recording capabilities for those who are interested in that. While the newer Game Spy model boasts each of these features in addition to a 2-inch display screen, the M-80xt model is one to consider because it still provides top-of-the-line features for a lower price."]},"id":"2dd509a1-f743-438e-af02-2e725c9e62aa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54330","url":"/game-spy-m-80-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-01-26T01:22:18Z","datePublished":"2012-01-26T01:22:18Z","name":"Game Spy M-80xt","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.
