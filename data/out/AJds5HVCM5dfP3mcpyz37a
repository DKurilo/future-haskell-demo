The app correctly identified the location of the tag both in the middle of downtown as well as up in the mountains. It also shows where you are in relation to the location of the tag, something we found useful when out on hiking trails and away from roads. The app updates relatively quickly to show you the location of your pet with minimal lag time, which isn’t perfect for a dog that’s running at a full sprint but will work in most cases. In our tests, the lag time was slightly longer in town than it was out in wide open spaces. We really liked that even when this tracker did lag, the app would send a push notification to our phone noting the tag hadn’t been found yet but the app was still searching. This way we weren’t left wondering if the tag had died or the app had simply stopped working.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69703-whistle10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vm7LAfF5YYdR3hYyJRke9P.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Vm7LAfF5YYdR3hYyJRke9P","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vm7LAfF5YYdR3hYyJRke9P.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d1486368-19a7-45b6-9210-5ccc4903eca0","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/7kfwHs9hQhvCDy42PbY6hL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Whistle 3 is totally waterproof  just like the <a href=\"/pod-review\">Pod 3</a> and the <a href=\"/safepet4me-review\">SafePet4Me</a> – we made sure – and it comes with a one-year warranty just in case something does happen. You’ll also get about seven days of battery life on one charge depending on cell phone coverage, which was impressive compared to other trackers we tested. It also comes with extra features like an activity tracker to make sure your pooch is getting enough activity. If you know your dog has been an escape artist in the past, you can also set up virtual fences and get an alert when your pet crosses those predetermined boundaries. In our tests, the alerts popped up promptly when fences were crossed.
