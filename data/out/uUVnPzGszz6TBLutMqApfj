The Roamio improves on most DVRs by offering more than just TV recording. Other DVRs simply record your TV shows. This device can record up to four shows at once (six with the upgraded Plus or Pro), grant you access to streaming apps and even connect to the internet using Wi-Fi. The TV Roamio is perfect for the TV enthusiast in your house and makes a <a href=\"/best-christmas-gifts\">holiday gift</a> that will be used every day.","Once they start using this device, TV lovers will find themselves exclaiming, &#34;O Roamio, Roamio, where have you been all my life, TiVo Roamio?&#34; They will love being able to easily browse the web on their TV screen and perform keyword searches to find shows and events in their cable or satellite programming. And the TiVo Roamio lets you search streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video for your favorite TV shows and movies.","The basic Roamio has four tuners, which means you can record up to three shows at once, while watching another one. Or you can record four shows at once, while catching up on other shows using the video streaming apps. The best part is you can access these internet apps by connecting your TiVo to your router with an Ethernet cable or through the new built-in Wi-Fi feature, an upgrade from previous models.","The TiVo Roamio keeps you mobile. Not only can you enjoy watching an episode of your favorite show bundled up on the couch with some popcorn, but you can watch it on the go as well. Using the TiVo Stream device, which is sold separately, you can stream your favorite shows to your iPad or other iOS device. It&#39;s perfect if you canâ€™t always be home to watch TV. The Plus and Pro versions have this feature added in, without the extra peripheral needed. A little &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; while working at the office anyone? As of right now, Android support is not available, though it is being developed.","The TiVo Roamio is not for everyone. First off, this DVR is not compatible with satellite service or AT&amp;T Universe; however, for customers with cable service or just a regular HD antenna, TiVo is the primo digital video recorder.","You can give someone a happy holiday with a brand new TiVo Roamio. This DVR will record up to four shows at once, and you can even take advantage of the newly built-in Wi-Fi to search for shows on Netflix, Hulu Plus or Amazon Instant. iOS users rejoice, because you can even stream your favorite TV shows to your mobile device. The TV lover will rejoice at this gift, and it won&#39;t be the sort of present that sits forgotten in a closet. Once you start using the TiVo Roamio, you will never believe how you ever lived without it."]},"id":"80d0898c-8003-47b1-9ab4-831c9717f685","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58102","url":"/tivo-roamio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-11T18:42:04Z","datePublished":"2013-11-11T18:42:04Z","name":"TiVo Roamio","synopsis":"With the TiVo Roamio you never have to miss your favorite TV shows again.
