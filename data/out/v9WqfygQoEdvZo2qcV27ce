Note: ProgeCAD Perpetual is now available. Clicking the “Buy” button will take you to this version for purchase. We will evaluate, rank and review the new version when we next update the CAD Software reviews. Meanwhile, enjoy our review for ProgeCad 2018 below.</em>","ProgeCAD Pro is a great resource if you&#39;re creating 2D designs. Compared to the other <a href=\"/best-cad-software\">CAD software</a>, 3D functionality is a bit lacking, but ProgeCAD has plenty of editing tools for a wide range of products, especially considering its lower cost.","While this program isn’t the least expensive option in our comparison, it is on the less expensive side of things. Before committing to buy, you can test this software using its 30-day free trial. To receive direct technical support, you have to purchase a support plan from the manufacturer because support is only free for the first month after you purchase your license. However, students and educators can get access to a free student version of this software. ","This software has a few helpful design tools, including hatching, textures and lighting effects. However, considering the animation technology we have today, the rendered graphics in this CAD program are poorly presented. It also takes much longer for a design to render than it would in a comparable program, which can be frustrating when you’re on a deadline. The software comes with Artisan, a photorealistic rendering tool that helps you visualize your designs. While this rendering function is decent, it isn’t as good as other programs, like <a href=\"/solidworks-review\">SolidWorks</a>.","The interface of ProgeCAD isn&#39;t the easiest to use, but there are some helpful features to make designing less difficult. The tool palette is customizable and a command line allows you to quickly input data. Although you can import other existing designs, there is no setup wizard or tool to speed up the process of a new model or design.","The editing tools included with ProgeCAD are possibly the best part of the software. All of the standard features are present, such as text and color editing, a layer manager, a point marker and a few others.","The professional version of ProgeCAD has limited file compatibility with native DWG and DXF support but not much else. The CAD software does have a DXF converter so you can convert PDFs to a readable DXF file. You are able to save in DWF and DGN formats. There’s no raster image support, so you can’t import of export JPG, GIF, PNG and TIFF files. When it comes to CAD software, the ability to export raster images is useful because they are not an editable format. ","The software’s publisher offers a handful of useful resources that can help you become more familiar with the application and lessen your learning curve, which is steeper than most. The user guide can be downloaded as a PDF. With nearly 700 pages, it can be a bit cumbersome to browse, but it offers valuable information on how to use the software. There’s also a built-in help section that’s accessed directly from the interface and can be searched by topic or keyword. The support plan doesn’t include telephone support, only support via email, which is common among CAD software publishers."]},"id":"cfe5fadd-f446-42a9-a99b-4e51c48d04b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"063ceda3-ac14-4e11-b756-01a3577a827e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ProgeCAD Pro offers decent 2D functionality and usability.
