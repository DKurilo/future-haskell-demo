We learned that there are different types of filtration systems, including single-cartridge and three- and five-stage systems, each with its own pros and cons.","The <a href=\"http://www.nsf.org/\">National Sanitation Foundation</a> (NSF) sets international standards for clean food and water, and we are familiar with its guidelines since several products we review, including water filters, are eligible for NSF certification. All the filters we reviewed are NSF-certified to meet strict health and safety standards. They are also compact enough to fit under your sink, and most of them are easy to install by yourself.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We read customer feedback and installation guides to learn how to install water filter systems. By reading customer reviews, we learned which systems are easy to install and which come with everything you need to attach the components to your sink. Some models include extra connectors for sinks with non-traditional plumbing.","As we reviewed these systems, we considered the number of contaminants each one removes to be its most important feature. Most filter out about 40 compounds, including chlorine and lead. The best system, the Aquasana 3-Stage Under Sink, removes 60 contaminants. We found that some filters don’t remove contaminants such as mercury and asbestos, and we gave higher scores to systems that do remove these harmful elements.","We also considered each system’s overall value. To determine whether the water filter is a good value, we looked at its price, warranty length and filter lifespan. The industry-standard warranty is only a year, and we preferred systems with longer coverage. Also, we gave higher marks to systems whose filters don’t need to be changed monthly.","<strong>Water Filter Systems: What to Look For</strong>","The best water filtration systems remove several contaminants, have a long life and don’t take up a significant amount of space under the sink. Furthermore, these systems offer a long warranty. Here are the criteria we used to evaluate these products:","<strong>Pricing</strong><br/>Water filter systems tend to be relatively expensive. Some companies need to know more about your current set up before they can quote you a price for their product. We found that the least expensive water systems cost roughly $160 to $170. It isn&#39;t uncommon for some water filter systems to cost anywhere from $400 to $800. These more expensive systems should do a better job of removing contaminants from your drinking water and making it taste fresher. Some of these pricier units will let you know when the water filter needs to be changed, which can improve the life of your unit. Remember that you will need to replace your water filter every 6 months, which will also add to the cost of your water filter system.","<strong>Contaminants Filtered</strong><br/>Most likely, the reason you desire a tap water filter is to remove any unhealthy contaminants and improve the water’s taste, smell or color. The best water filters will reduce 10 or more contaminants. Furthermore, look for water purifiers that have been NSF certified. The NSF Certification tells you the product meets strict health and safety guidelines and is routinely tested to ensure those standards are met. The best filter systems provide a performance sheet to show test results under the NSF standards. These sheets show the specific contaminants that are reduced and how much of each contaminant the filter removes.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"cad9461b-1243-4def-8cfa-2b7b35fe3210","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In addition, after a certain period of time, the filters on the system will need to be replaced. These can become costly if the faucet filters do not have a long lifespan. Six months is the average length of time most filters will last. A few filters, like the <a href=\"/kinetico-aquakinetic-review\">Kinetico AquaKinetic</a>, have a lifespan of 12 months. The best systems have a notification system, whether by light or sound, that will alert you when it is time to replace a cartridge.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>You do not want a water filter system that is large and bulky and takes up all the space under your counter. Before purchasing a system, ensure that it will fit under your sink. A water filter like the <a href=\"/pelican-pro-6-stage-ro-review\">Pelican Pro 6</a> is especially compact and should fit in tight spaces. Additionally, most of these products do not require professionals to install them; you can hook them up on your own. We recommend looking for systems that include installation kits and filters that are easy to change. On many of the best water filtration systems, you can change a filter by simply twisting it on and off.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Most water filters are covered under a one-year warranty. However, some manufacturers offer shorter time frames. Additionally, if questions or concerns do arise with your system, you want to ensure representatives are available, whether by email, telephone or live chat support.","Installing a water filter system is an easy way to keep you water safe as well as improve its taste, smell and color. A drinking water filter can be a little thing that has a lasting effect on your health.","<em><strong>Contributing Reviewer:</strong> Noel Case</em>"]},"id":"aa2d74af-62f0-4457-afe1-c01a73a45106","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"c71b8abc-e19c-425e-867a-d7029726ca50","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHYLXLW/?&tag=ttr_water-filter-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1104[art|NA[pid|61729[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Aquasana 3-Stage Under Counter</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004USLKLG/?&tag=ttr_water-filter-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1104[art|NA[pid|56794[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">WaterChef U9000</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0ZGOZM/?&tag=ttr_water-filter-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1104[art|NA[pid|61730[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Apec Water ROES-50</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kenmore.com/kenmore-reverse-osmosis-drinking-water-system/p-04238156000P?prdNo=2&blockNo=2&blockType=G2\">Kenmore Reverse Osmosis System</a>","<a href=\"//pelican-water.evyy.net/c/13013/234962/3448?subId1=Water+Filter+Systems&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pelicanwater.com%2Fdrinking-filters%2Fpelican-reverse-osmosis%2F\">Pelican Pro 6-Stage RO</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017IAM02/?&tag=ttr_water-filter-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1104[art|NA[pid|61733[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Multipure AquaRO</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ecowater.com/ero-375-p-9-l-en.html\">EcoWater ERO 375</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009YA27SK/?&tag=ttr_water-filter-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1104[art|NA[pid|61735[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">GE Reverse Osmosis Filtration System</a>","<a href=\"https://www.kinetico.com/drinking-water-filtration-systems/aquakinetic-a200-drinking-water-system/\">Kinetico AquaKinetic</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f18ad4f6-fe61-4702-8838-cd2d1b002e2a","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1104","url":"/best-water-filter-systems","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-17T19:21:59Z","datePublished":"2017-11-22T19:38:37Z","name":"Best Water Filter Systems","synopsis":"Reduce unwanted contaminants and improve your water's taste with a drinking filter system.
