Also, it fits perfectly into car cupholders, can be opened for a quick drink with one hand, and lets you control how quickly your drink is poured out through the lid’s spout.","When we tested the Contigo thermos, the hot water we poured into it cooled down 57 degrees over five hours, the amount of time Contigo promises to keep your drink hot. And after two hours the hot water in this travel thermos was 161 degrees. This is still quite warm, but the length of time is half of most of other thermoses, including the <a href=\"/thermos-review\">Thermos Sipp</a>, another commuter thermos that lost the same amount of heat over a 12 hours period. The Contigo West Loop is a lighter thermos and easier to keep ahold of during your ride into work, though.","The cap of the Contigo thermos has a double lock to keep your drink from spilling. After the top lock is opened, you then press the Autoseal button to control how fast your drink pours from the spout as you drink it. When not pressed the Autoseal button doesn’t allow any liquid to slip through. We tipped and shook and bounced the Contigo West Loop thermos with both locks secured and with only the Autoseal closed. Both tests proved the Contigo remains secure and protects you from being burned by hot liquid.","The Contigo West Loop we tested holds 16 ounces of liquid, though there are 20- and 24-ounce options, too. And all three sizes have 16 different color options, so you can choose a thermos that matches your style. The body of the Contigo thermos is contoured so it fits snug in your hand, and the stainless steel finish and insulated walls keep the outside from heating up too much from the temperature of your drink inside.","Though the body of this thermos isn’t dishwasher safe, you can wash the lid on the top rack. The lid comes apart, so the entire thing can get clean, but taking each piece apart and putting them back together can be a challenge. It’s almost like taking apart and putting back together a jigsaw puzzle, and it took us several tries before we could remember the steps of both dissembling and reassembling the lid."]},"id":"087e42de-ccf9-4a76-9de4-d4d295b7f0e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f623e13d-c684-4b00-8805-527490c2e87a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Contigo is our top pick for a commuter thermos because of its good design, including a double seal lock mechanism that can be opened with one hand, and you can control how much of your drink pours from the spout.
