You have multiple locations where you d like to view them, and you re running out of space to store them. You want to share your media library with all of your devices, but you can t always see your movies on your computer or listen to music through your flat screen in the living room. If you re suffering from this syndrome of media-sharing paralysis, have no fear   a home media server can solve your sharing woes.","Beyond simply sharing your media content with multiple devices, a home media server can be used for centralized backup and standard data storage. So not only can you stream your collection of movies to your television in the front room, but you can also share documents with multiple computers by storing them on a central server. With the correct software, the storage drives in your server can also be used to perform periodic backups for your connected devices."," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","When all is said and done, a home media server is a solid investment for anyone with a respectable amount of digital media files. But what if you d rather build your own to match your needs than purchase a pre-configured device? Read on and we ll show you how to construct your very own home media server.","<strong>Building the Box</strong><br/>For starters, you ll need to assemble a computer that is capable of storing all of your files. This generally means you ll want the largest hard drive (or drives, for some configurations) that you can find. In this area, there are several options available to you; for most needs, a few hundred gigabytes to a handful of terabytes should be enough for most users, and these can all be found for reasonable prices at major online computer parts retailers.","Along with your massive hard drive(s), you ll need the other basic components of a computer for your home media server: motherboard, RAM, processor, power supply, video card (probably), optical drive (if desired). Be sure your motherboard supports the type and number of hard drive connections that you ll be using. There are few things worse than buying several high-capacity SATA 3.0 drives when your motherboard only supports SATA 2.0. This same rule of thumb applies to your other computer components: make sure they ll all work together!","The computing hardware on your home media server computer is less important than the hardware in your client (which we ll discuss later). All of the processing takes place on the device that s pulling the files from your media server, and almost none of it takes place server-side. In some cases, the only thing needed to stream content to your TV is a client and a NAS (network-attached storage) device. This will vary depending on the setup you choose to implement.","<strong>Making a Computer a Server</strong><br/>Servers are a bit different than your standard computer. Often, they are built on different operating systems than your more common Windows or Mac interface. These other operating systems are generally much smaller and less computing-power intensive, making it easier to devote space on the hard drives for storage and power from the computing components to sharing and streaming content. Ubuntu and Apache are two of the most common server software operating systems that you can use for your home media server. You can find information on setting these servers up on your server from any of their proprietary websites. Now, let s get your media onto your server.","<strong>Getting Your Media on the Server</strong><br/>First, you ll want to get your DVDs, CDs, VHS tapes, photos and everything else you may want to view in various places onto your server. You can do this with a number of converter software applications, like DVD ripper software and VHS to DVD converters. Using this software, you can either place the media directly on the server with appropriate optical drives or cables, or you can simply place the media on a standard computer and transfer it to the media server through the network, if you don t want to include an optical drive or standard motherboard into your media server. Once you ve gotten all of your media onto the server, there s only one thing left: streaming your content to your TV!","<strong>Talking to the Server</strong><br/>In order to see the home media server, it has to be set up and recognized by your home network. Often, this is as simple as connecting it via an Ethernet cable or wireless card (if you choose to include one in your configuration). If you ve set it up properly, other devices on your network should be able to recognize and access the drives. Issues in this area will need to be resolved by consulting your operating system s help forums or FAQs sections.","Any standard desktop or laptop computer can access the content stored on your media server as long as the files are shared. If you choose to use a computer to do so, a good choice is the Mac Mini, which provides a built-in HDMI port for easy HD movie viewing. Other options include game consoles like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. If your server is sharing its files over the network and your computer or chosen client is set up properly, you should be well on your way to watching your personal content with no problems. Relax, sit back and enjoy access to your entire media library without having to change discs or transfer files.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "," "]},"id":"fb4e9c1c-9958-485f-a2e8-e0c501df7fa2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6059","url":"/home-media-servers-how-to-build-your-own","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"mitch-monsen","url":"/author/mitch-monsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Mitch Monsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"JjDfBX7h9Ju2FtnDQ2YRD5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-01T18:27:45Z","datePublished":"2011-06-01T18:27:45Z","name":"Home Media Servers: How to Build Your Own","synopsis":"If you’re interested in home media servers, your situation probably looks something like this: You’ve assembled a huge collection of movies, music and pictures.","review":{},"strapline":"If you’re interested in home media servers, your situation probably looks something like this: You’ve assembled a huge collection of movies, music and pictures.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-02-05T21:22:06Z","id":"oDqxLZos22CHhV89qqQcHa","meta":{"title":"Home Media Servers: How to Build Your Own","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
