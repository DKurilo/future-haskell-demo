You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Char-Broil Classic 4-Burner is a powerful, affordable <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">barbecue grill</a> with several features that make it a good choice for your backyard or patio. It generates plenty of heat from its four primary burners and has a lot of cooking space, allowing you to cater to both small and large parties. However, this grill produced uneven cooking results in our tests.","The four primary burners generate up to 38,000 Btu, which is similar to other barbecue grills of this size. The grill also has a 10,000-Btu, flush-mounted side burner with a convenient cover. The electronic ignition allows quick startup of all the burners.","It heats extremely quickly, reaching 500 degrees Fahrenheit in just over three minutes. Like other fast heaters, it doesn&#39;t do quite as well at retaining that heat. This propane grill cooks less evenly than we expected. In our tests, food on the sides of the grill was overcooked, while food closer to the center cooked more evenly.","This is a nice-looking grill with good maneuverability. Its four swiveling caster wheels can lock into place or unlock to allow you to reposition it, a feature you can find on the best gas grills.","The Char-Broil makes the most of its space. This four-burner gas grill can cook up to 24 burgers at a time, and the warming tray can hold eight buns at once. The flush side burner gives you extra space that you can use as a cooking area or as a storage shelf when the burner isn&#39;t in use. There is an additional side shelf on this gas grill for storage, along with a built-in temperature gauge to help you monitor your barbecue.","The grill&#39;s lid, control panel and knobs are stainless steel, and the cooking grates are coated in porcelain; both of these materials prevent rust and wear along the outside of the grill, while the porcelain keeps food from sticking to the grates. Anyone who has cleaned outdoor grills knows how helpful porcelain coating can be, as food tends to stick stubbornly to the metal grating without it. You can add accessory hooks, a rotisserie kit or a condiment rack, but you have to purchase these separately, whereas accessory hooks come standard on most gas grills we tested.","The stainless steel burners on this gas grill are covered with a five-year warranty. The grill also comes with a one-year parts warranty. Compared with our top-rated gas grills, this is a short warranty, but the Char-Broil website contains helpful FAQs sections and an online manual to cover the basics of this four-burner grill. For individual assistance, you can reach a Char-Broil representative via phone or email. The company also has videos on its website that cover some of the common questions about grill ownership."]},"id":"eef10f16-6dfd-4b0f-835b-6f64f91e8c64","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cd063540-1208-419b-b822-d911458d5300","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Char-Broil Classic 4-Burner makes a good addition to your outdoor cooking parties, as it&#39;s powerful and durable, but you have to watch food on the edges of the grill carefully to prevent overcooking.
