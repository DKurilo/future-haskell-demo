They have included many features to help offices run more smoothly and environmentally friendly. In fact, the iRex Digital Reader probably has the largest array of features out of all the readers we reviewed (with the arguable exception of the Kindle 2), making it a very attractive choice.","However, there is a significant reason why the large feature set of the iRex Digital Reader didn’t make it rank higher in this review: the price. The additional features just couldn&#39;t justify a price that was more than double the price of most other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook readers</a>. Ultimately the value score was the iRex Digital Reader’s downfall. However, if you are in need of a specific set of features, especially a touchscreen interface and compatibility with business formats, the iRex Digital Reader may still be a good choice for you."]},"id":"4fec361f-1dfc-4fd9-a743-df67a5fc64dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Readability &amp; Display"},"id":"3658829e-c4d6-4c10-bd9a-d5655ff38bf5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" The iRex Digital eBook Reader has similar features to other offerings from iRex technologies (like the iLiad 2nd Edition and Book Edition found on this review site). At only .5” thick, it’s super thin and ultra portable, making it much smaller than the briefcase and more efficient than it too.","iRex focuses on one feature, the ability to “print” documents to the reader thus saving paper and time. Instead of having to print the same document several times, you can send it to the iRex Digital Reader and it will be converted, much like an Adobe PDF file, into a format you can store on your reader. From there you can make notes on it and save it all together.","One of the biggest attractions of the iRex Digital Reader is the touchscreen. It’s larger than the screens of any other reader in this review, and the touchscreen can be used both for navigation and taking notes or highlighting text. For this reason, the iRex Digital Reader is one of the easiest readers to use for editing or marking text in a document."]},"id":"a9d15a5e-b865-483c-9273-18412cc97da8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Portability"},"id":"22ea1d09-f23f-43ac-a26e-e4856e836419","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the iRex Digital Reader doesn’t have a dedicated content provider, it does have the ability to read just about anything you can find on the internet and print or convert to PDF, so that makes the amount of available content almost unlimited.
