With a variety of functions available, including specific B2B services, such as digital document signing, web conferencing and email, you can find options that will simplify the workflow for both you and your employees. Business-to-business software options, like <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">HubSpot</a>, <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">Adobe Connect</a> and <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">Infusionsoft</a>, exist to streamline your business offerings and processes.","<strong>Business-to-Business Software: What to Look For</strong>","With a variety of features and functions to choose from, it&#39;s important to look for B2B software that suits the needs of your company and your clients. Because features, volume and available amenities, such as live help or on-the-job training, can vary a great deal, deciding what you need and want from your product can help you narrow down the options.","<strong>Features &amp; Functions</strong><br/>You most likely need specific features and functions for your business, so you have to find the B2B software that fills those requirements. While options include marketing automation, lead generation, sales, telephony and management, you have to choose a niche and then choose the specific option that offers the most for your business. For example, choosing marketing automation software that works with your existing analytics and programs is considerably more convenient than choosing one that requires you to set everything up again.","<strong>Volume Capacity &amp; Users</strong><br/>Most B2B software options work with multiple users or support guest logins to allow your employees the access they need. If you have a specific number of people who have to access the software, then you have to make sure that the software supports that number of users. You should also check to ensure that it works at the volume needed by your business. Some business-to-business software is scalable, allowing you to pay for what you need, but some options have a maximum reach, volume or number of accounts.","<strong>Training</strong><br/>It is important that you or anyone who uses the software knows how to use it properly and to its fullest effect, or you may be wasting money. Some business-to-business software companies charge for training while others offer it free, and some do not offer it at all. If the company does not include training with their software, double check to make sure that learning resources are available.","<strong>Live Support</strong><br/>Live support is important when you are running a business and don&#39;t have time to figure out software issues that could be costing you money by the minute. If you are running a large marketing program and your software isn&#39;t working, then you need live support to help you fix it. While some companies only offer email or a knowledgebase, this type of support is not suitable unless the software fulfills a nonvital role in your company.","Many business-to-business software options are available to assist your business with its workflow and processes. Deciding what you want and need out of B2B software allows you to choose the right option for your business."]},"id":"5d25225e-19a8-4212-9b19-df62d3a2102f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"e6ac4248-3dec-4bf9-982b-c80a9754ddf9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.act-on.com/pricing/\">Act-On</a>","<a href=\"http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(264355)a(2856467)g(22804962)url(http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html)epi(Connect)epi2(BusinessToBusiness)\">Adobe</a>","<a href=\"http://docusign.sjv.io/c/13013/315785/4764?subId1=B2Bsoftware&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docusign.com%2Fproducts-and-pricing\">DocuSign</a>","<a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/pricing-comparison\">HubSpot</a>","<a href=\"http://www.infusionsoft.com/pricing\">Infusionsoft</a>","<a href=\"http://www.marketo.com/software/marketing-automation/pricing/\">Marketo</a>","<a href=\"http://na.sage.com/us/sage-one/pricing\">Sage</a>","<a href=\"http://www.thrivehive.com/solutions\">ThriveHive</a>","<a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/pricing\">WordStream</a>","<a href=\"http://www.yesware.com/plans-and-pricing\">Yesware</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"aa073596-d9cf-4ff8-97cc-92954961ee85","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1640","url":"/best-business-to-business-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T22:20:39Z","datePublished":"2016-10-27T18:14:54Z","name":"Business-to-Business Software Review","synopsis":"Business-to-business software allows you to streamline your business services by improving the process of capturing leads, selling, marketing and emailing to improve your business workflow.","review":{},"strapline":"Business-to-business software allows you to streamline your business services by improving the process of capturing leads, selling, marketing and emailing to improve your business workflow.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-27T18:14:54Z","id":"FJpjKBsTBXoVoGVdsPHWeC","meta":{"title":"The Best Business-to-Business Software","description":"Our experts have reviewed the best business-to-business software for 2017.
