The second best antennas were the <a href=\"/antennas-direct-review\">ClearStream Micron</a> and <a href=\"/terk-review\">Terk OMNITV20 FLAT </a>which recieved 26 channels.","In some cases, when a digital HD antenna grabs a large number of channels, many of the subchannels from major networks have poor reception. This was not the case with the Eclipse. There wasn’t one channel that had interference. All of the channels, including PBS, ABC, NBC and CBS, had great HD picture quality.","Our second location was a second story apartment a few miles south of our downtown office. Outside of the apartment there are no structural obstacles, in fact, it’s an empty field. This is more of a simulation of a rural or suburban area with few structural obstacles.","As in our office, we connected the antenna and moved it around to find the best place for reception. In the apartment, we were able to receive 33 channels. This was among the highest in our group. Here we were able to pick up an extra local channel that had some light breakup, but was still watchable.","The great thing about this receiver is it doesn’t matter if you are in a downtown metropolitan city or in a rural area, you’ll be able to receive free TV with top notch reception. It is important to keep in mind that the number of channels you receive will vary based on your location.
