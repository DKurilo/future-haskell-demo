The Gerber Multi-Plier 600 Bluntnose Stainless weighs in at 9 oz with 14 tools and an easy, one-handed opening feature with a single snap of the wrist, which becomes easier with practice.","Those who often employ this Gerber multi-tool for cutting metal will appreciate the replaceable wire cutting inserts, which means longer time before needed a sharpening or replacement. This multi-tool is better suited for manipulating metal with its tungsten carbine cutting surface than for cutting rope, carving or sawing. Testers noted the file, slotted drive head and can opener to be solid elements to its overall value.","<strong>Tester Comments: </strong>&#34;Fighting off the Transformers? Escaping from a sinking submarine? Repairing anything made of aluminum, steel or alloy? Employ the carbide cutters and reliable jaw teeth to grip-it-and-rip-it, friends. The look of this tool inspires confidence, but don’t raise the bar on performance with wood. Call it a dedicated metal-muncher, and you’re in business. And out of trouble anywhere.”","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Durability","<strong>Best For:</strong> Use with metal, such as repairs, wiring and medium-duty tasks at home and in the field – less so than in the backcountry.","<strong>Trial Results</strong>"]},"id":"a2261b9b-db81-448f-98f0-cc62496f5603","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Point Break: </strong>The carbine cutting blades made for clean and easy cut with a two-handed single snip.","<strong>Around the Bend: </strong>Despite small jaw deflection, this multi-tool easily bent the wire through the S bends.","<strong>Rope &#39;Em In:</strong> The design of this multi-tool and its blade placement can make it difficult to have access to the entire blade. However, the blade produced a clean cut.","<strong>No Turning Back:</strong> Active Junky testers reported up to 25 percent more torque compared to the other tools, making it the best multi-tool for jobs that require a driving head. This is likely due to the drive location in the handle.","<strong>Eyes on the Pries:</strong> To test prying capabilities, testers chose the large slotted driver, which proved to provide average penetration and prying in line with its competitors.","<strong>Lumberjack Olympics:</strong> The multi-tool underperformed in this trial, only achieving shallow carves with the knife, and the saw blade was inadequate for anything besides webbing or rope."],"type":"ul"},"id":"f53f854a-ecce-43fd-a9cf-ee907020b159","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67962","url":"/gerber-multi-plier-600-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-10T18:30:46Z","datePublished":"2016-06-10T18:30:46Z","name":"Gerber Multi-Plier 600","synopsis":"If you have some heavy-duty tasks to complete – driving, prying, snipping – this is a great choice of multi-tool.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you have some heavy-duty tasks to complete – driving, prying, snipping – this is a great choice of multi-tool.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-06-10T18:30:46Z","id":"Ngw5gFVAeLdSB8UMbV2kMk","meta":{"title":"Gerber Multi-Plier 600 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"With replaceable tungsten carbine blades, the Gerber Multi-Plier 600 Bluntnose Stainless is great choice for cutting and manipulating metal.
