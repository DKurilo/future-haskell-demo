However, if you live in an area with heavy snow fall, it&#39;s easy for the winter months to turn you into a humbug. Removing snow piles from your deck or driveway is long, tedious work, especially if you expect 6 inches or more every year.","Much like lawn mowers and power tools, snow blowers use either gasoline or electric power. Many gas-powered snow throwers use combination of the two to function, with an electric starter and gasoline power. Three of the top gas snow blowers in the market are the <a href=\"/cub-cadet-review\">Cub Cadet SWE</a>, <a href=\"/toro-review\">Toro SnowMaster 724 QXE</a> and the <a href=\"/husqvarna-review\">Husqvarna ST 227P</a>.","Electric snow throwers are best for light weather conditions; clearing areas near an outlet; or flat, paved surfaces. We recommend a gas-powered snow blower when you need to handle heavy snowfall, rough terrain or large areas. Gas snow throwers require more maintenance, but they&#39;re tougher than electric models, easy to store and come in a variety of sizes. These snow blowers come in sizes from 12 inches to 4 feet in length, and the larger the snow blower, the more power it produces.","There are differences between gas blowers. For example, the auger is the corkscrew-shape paddle that pushes snow into the blower. Single-stage blowers only use one auger, while dual-stage blowers have an auger and an impeller that breaks up large chunks of snow and ice. This allows the blower to push snow out of the chute smoothly. Single-stage blowers are best for snowfalls under 4 inches, and their dual counterparts are better for heavy jobs. For more information, look for our articles on gas and electric snow blowers.","<strong>Gas Snow Blowers: What to Look For</strong>","There are three main things to consider when looking for a gas snow blower: annual snowfall, terrain and the size of your yard or business. If you have a small area that collects less than 4 inches of snow, we recommend looking for an electric <a href=\"/best-snow-blowers\">snow blower</a>.","For more than 4 inches of snow, plow piles and tough terrain, we recommend a medium to large gas snow blower. Large blower augers clear up to 2 feet of snow.  Moving all that snow creates big plow pikes, too. The self-propelled machines can help you power through the piles at the end of your driveway.","Many of the models we highlight have multiple speeds to clear through different depths and types of snow. Headlights and safety features are important to consider since most plowing happens during the dark of the morning.","<strong>Power </strong><br/>Whether in lawn mowers, chainsaws or snow throwers, gas power packs a punch. In many models, one of the main advantages is the power transfers to the wheels. This makes maneuvering and pushing through snowdrifts easy. The best snow blowers have skid shoes that raise the auger and avoid small rocks and particles.","On average, the clearing width for dual-stage snow blowers is between 24 and 26 inches, so you can expect to clear a path of around 2 feet, on average. We also include gas blowers that clear even more and are good for clearing parking lots and full streets.","Something else to consider with most gas-powered tools is engine displacement. Measured in cubic centimeters, this stat measures the volume of gas taken in by each piston. As gasoline pumps into the engine, the pistons push ignited gas through the machine. The more cubic centimeters of gasoline pumped through the snow blower, the more power the snow thrower produces.","<strong>Control </strong><br/>Whether you have a short, straight driveway to manage; an entire parking lot; or a winding path to clear, it&#39;s crucial to keep control of the snow blower. Typically, dual-stage blowers have multiple speeds. Changing speeds is most important for hilly terrain or uneven amounts of snow in your path. Most snow blowers have about six different forward speeds and two reverse speeds.","<strong>Safety &amp; Maintenance</strong><br/>Waking up to fresh snow is a soothing sight, unless you have to clear all of it. Mornings are dark in the winter, so you need extra safety features to boost visibility. Headlights are a valuable feature, especially if you live in a rural area without many streetlights.","If you have to clear gravel or areas with loose rocks, adjustable skid shoes add height to the snow blower to clear small objects. This helps you avoid jamming the machine or expelling rocks and hard debris out of the snow blower. In case of a jam or problem with the snow blower, use the safety override features to shut the machine down completely.","Two-stage gas snow blowers require more care than electric models. You should plan for annual maintenance before Jack Frost visits. For example, add stabilizer to the gasoline to stretch fuel use and avoid engine corrosion. Always empty the tank before storing for the off-season. Additionally, check the spark plugs and tires every year before the first snowfall.","<strong>Warranty &amp; Support</strong><br/>Gas powered snow throwers are a serious investment and often cost twice that of electric models. This means you want to purchase a snow blower from a helpful, responsive company that answers questions and provides plenty of information before you purchase.","The best snow blowers come with support lines in several forms. Most often, you can find a downloadable PDF of the user manual online through a third-party retailer or directly from the manufacturer. Additionally, look for companies that provide assistance over the phone, live chat or email. Because snow throwers are so expensive, you want to look for a model with a long warranty of around two to five years so you can use it for several winters.","Winter can be a cozy, enjoyable time of year. If you&#39;re used to large snowfalls during the season, consider ditching the snow shovel for a more effective tool. Gas-powered snow blowers are powerful and help you get the job done fast so you can enjoy fun winter activities with your family."]},"id":"d451540b-1c71-4010-8dcd-6588668e68bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"595a6e11-f8f9-4581-ab76-169e3a242533","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L0VOHSY/?&tag=ttr_gas-snow-blowers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1824[art|NA[pid|67322[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Ariens</a>","<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7928483-11034749-1424824741000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sears.com%2Fcraftsman-24-in-208cc-dual-stage-snow-thrower%2Fp-07188173000P&cjsku=07188173000\">Craftsman 88173</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7928483-11034749-1424824741000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sears.com%2Fcraftsman-quiet-208cc-dual-stage-snow-thrower%2Fp-07188694000P&cjsku=07188694000\">Craftsman Quiet</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cubcadet.com/equipment/cubcadet/2X-524-SWE\">Cub Cadet SWE</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LHN4MX0/?&tag=ttr_gas-snow-blowers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1824[art|NA[pid|67326[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Husqvarna</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064O22CU/?&tag=ttr_gas-snow-blowers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1824[art|NA[pid|67327[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Power Smart</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7928483-10368321-1398432624000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FToro-SnowMaster-724-QXE-24-in-Gas-Snow-Blower-36002%2F206125346&cjsku=206125346\">Toro</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7928483-10926682-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_189194-270-31AS62N2711_0__%3FproductId%3D3255746&cjsku=189194-270-31AS62N2711\">Troy-Bilt 2410</a>","<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7928483-10926682-1366227542000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_662363-270-31AM66P3766_0__%3FproductId%3D50324133&cjsku=662363-270-31AM66P3766\">Troy-Bilt Storm</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LHN4MX0/?&tag=ttr_gas-snow-blowers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1824[art|NA[pid|67331[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Yard Machines</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3f489e7d-20d6-4f8d-b0a2-4dd9c3b35abd","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1824","url":"/best-gas-snow-blowers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-07T15:16:53Z","datePublished":"2015-11-11T01:47:00Z","name":"Gas Snow Blowers Review","synopsis":"If winters bring serious snowfall to your area, a typical electric snow blower may not be enough.
