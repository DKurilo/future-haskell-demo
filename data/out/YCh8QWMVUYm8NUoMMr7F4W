It has the brightest LEDs among the solar lights we looked at, shedding a total of 850 lumens.","Sunforce 82156 Solar Motion Light gives you added security around your home or property. Besides providing bright light to illuminate a large area, this solar security light lets you customize its settings to suit your needs. The three dials on the bottom of the device let you choose the light level, the motion-detector sensitivity and the duration of light once motion is detected.","The outdoor solar light has a detection range of 180 degrees and brightly lights a 30-foot area with its 60 LEDs. This automatic motion-detection solar light provides a light source for darkened areas around garages, homes and pathways. This light comes with a 6-volt solar panel, a pack of 6-volt rechargeable AA batteries, screws for mounting it and the 60 LEDs it uses to illuminate the area.","You can install the light outside without the need for electrical wiring or the help of a professional. Before installing it, you will need to connect it to the solar panel and leave it out in the sun for three days to fully charge. It has an on-off switch, and is constructed of aluminum and plastic. The design is similar to that of the LE Lighting 6500001-DW.","The motion sensitivity can be set between zero and 30 feet. The duration is adjustable between 8 seconds and 2 minutes. The adjusts the level of darkness that will activate the light. When the dial is set at its lowest setting, the motion sensor can only turn on at night, which saves energy. The motion sensor spans a full 180 degrees.","The materials are good, but not the best. It is weather-resistant, but some online reviews attested that the weatherproofing wasn’t always effective. Some also complained that the dial was overly sensitive, making it difficult to fine-tune the reaction of the motion detector. With that said, however, most customer feedback we read was positive. This solar light comes with a standard one-year warranty.","Sunforce 82156 Solar Motion Light is a solar motion-detector light that covers a large 30-foot radius and has adjustable settings, allowing you to customize it to your space. While most online reviews were positive, some customers complained of weatherproofing issues and an overly sensitive settings dial. Its affordability, brightness and nice feature package make it the good pick for most users, but it doesn’t function perfectly for everyone.","<strong><em>Contributing Reviewer:</em></strong><em> Noel Case</em>"," "]},"id":"72ae5b46-ca07-4a46-8303-35d2ff783036","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8ddcba65-7b96-4b00-8f7e-341e3e81e4a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" "," "]},"id":"532b6e64-730c-43b5-ba3d-65f7c3e25d36","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67019","url":"/sunforce-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-18T18:49:21Z","datePublished":"2015-09-18T18:49:21Z","name":"Sunforce 82156","synopsis":"The Sunforce 81256 is one of the best solar lights we looked at.
