LFXS28968S is a super-capacity fridge with several innovative features, including a slim, space-saving icemaker that lets you use the majority of the 28-cubic-foot interior for storing food. Also, the fridge’s contoured doors, hidden hinges and smooth interior add to its aesthetics appeal. The LG LFXS28968S’s clever storage solutions, large capacity and sleek design make it one of the best French door refrigerators on the market. If you’re looking for something a little more economical, check out the <a href=\"/amana-review\">Amana AFI2539ERM</a>.","<strong>Capacity, Efficiency &amp; Price</strong>","This LG is considered a super-capacity refrigerator, and with a total capacity of 27.9 cubic feet, it’s one of the largest <a href=\"/best-french-door-refrigerators\">French door refrigerators</a> we reviewed. The refrigerator portion has 18.6 cubic feet of storage space, enough to hold several bags of groceries.","The icemaker is slim enough to sit behind two shelves in the left door. Many French door fridges surrender the top shelf to bulky icemakers, and this model’s compact one gives you extra refrigerator storage space.","The freezer portion has 9.3 cubic feet of storage space divided into two tiers. The bottom tier is the largest and has a divider splitting it into two sections. The smaller drawer pulls out above the large drawer.","This LG French door refrigerator is sold at a midrange price, which makes it a great value for a fridge of its size. It has an estimated yearly operating cost of $88, according to the Energy Guide on LG’s website. This comes to about $3.15 per cubic foot per year, which is well below average compared to the other fridges we reviewed. The LG LFXS28968S uses more energy than many of the refrigerators we looked at, but it is Energy Star certified. Also, given its large capacity, it is one of the most energy efficient refrigerators we reviewed.","<strong>Refrigerator Storage &amp; Controls</strong>","The LFXS28968S has an LED lamp inside that illuminates the clear shelves and drawers. At a glance, you can see all your stored food items. This fridge has a total of four split shelves that you can move up and down to accommodate tall and awkward-size objects. Some shelves fold, so you can quickly flip them up rather than completely remove them. Made from tempered glass, the shelves come with spill protection.","This fridge also has two crisper bins for fresh fruit and vegetables plus a bin that runs the full width of the compartment. This drawer is perfect for storing meats, cheeses or large platters for dinner parties. You can control the humidity in the two crisper drawers, and the long drawer has three temperature settings.","There is additional storage in both of the LG LFXS28968S’s doors, including six bins for items you grab often such as drink bottles and condiments. Two of these bins are big enough to hold gallon-size containers such as milk. One is a dairy compartment designed to hold items like butter and eggs.","The external digital controls display the LFXS28968S’s temperature, filter replacement dates and more. Separate digital sensors monitor the refrigerator, freezer and room temperature. The fridge vents cold air onto each shelf to maintain an optimal food storage environment and has a filter to keep the air inside fresh. Further, the fridge sounds an alarm every 30 seconds if a door stays open for over a minute. This feature not only helps prevent costly food spoilage but can also save on energy expenses.","Thanks to its smart features, you can also control the LFXS28968S with a phone app. When you use the app, you get notifications if a door is left open or if there are other issues. In addition, you can use Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa to adjust the fridge’s temperature and other settings.","<strong>Freezer Storage</strong>","This French door refrigerator has a spacious freezer with a full-width drawer on top made of clear plastic that is great for holding small items. The bottom drawer is the largest and deepest and is separated into two sections. A separate LED lamp lights the interior of the freezer compartment.","The LG LFXS28968S comes in only two colors: stainless steel and black stainless steel. While these finishes complement most kitchens, it is a somewhat limited selection – other refrigerators we reviewed include color options like white and slate.","The space-saving icemaker holds about 3.8 pounds of ice at a time, which is more than many other French door fridges we reviewed can hold. It’s also easy to access behind a small door. The LFXS28968S delivers fresh-tasting water and ice free from impurities. In addition, the dispenser accommodates tall containers such as water bottles and pitchers.","<strong>Warranty &amp; Customer Support</strong>","This refrigerator uses a linear compressor motor, so it has fewer moving parts than many of the other models we reviewed. As such, the freezer is quiet and efficient and has fewer parts that can break. But just in case, LG Electronics covers the LFXS28968S with a one-year parts and labor warranty, an extended five-year warranty on the sealed system, and a 10-year warranty on the linear compressor."," many of the top refrigerator manufacturers, LG Electronics has a unique diagnostic tool to help with repairs. If something breaks, you can call LG and the customer support agent will instruct you on how to run the diagnostic test. Your French door refrigerator comes with a small speaker, which emits a tone that contains the necessary information to diagnose the situation. You have to hold your phone up to the speaker, but the customer service agent will be able to tell what needs to be repaired.","The LG LFX28968S’s many innovative features and impressive amount of space make it one of the best French door refrigerators on the market. Its space-saving design gives you ample room for all your groceries. Also, while it uses a lot of energy, given its capacity, it’s not excessive – something its Energy Star compliance attests to. The color options are attractive and complement most kitchens but are limited – this may be deal breaker if the other appliances in your kitchen are predominantly white."]},"id":"9ec9084e-8bd5-4100-85d9-e5e7f11d92d7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51083","url":"/lg-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-12T15:33:09Z","datePublished":"2010-10-12T15:33:09Z","name":"LG LFXS28968S","synopsis":"The LG LFXS28968S is a super-capacity fridge with several innovative features, including a slim, space-saving icemaker that lets you use the majority of the 28-cubic-foot interior for storing food.","review":{"rating":92,"verdict":"The LG LFXS28968S is a large-capacity fridge that makes great use of space.
