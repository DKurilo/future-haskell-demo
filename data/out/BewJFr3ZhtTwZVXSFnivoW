Estwing is a no-nonsense brand that favors strong construction and usability over fancy features. Estwing is a trusted name among roofers and other tradesmen, and they put that same attention to quality in their <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-camp-axes\">camping axes</a> as well.","The Estwing Camper&#39;s Axe is a larger camping axe than a hatchet, with an overall length of 16 inches, and a 4-inch blade. The entire axe is a single piece of forged steel, so the blade won&#39;t detach from the handle. The blade itself is harder to sharpen than many other axes on our lineup, so be sure to get a heavier-grain sharpening stone. However, the steel handles impacts well.","This camp axe is good for felling and trimming trees, splitting wood and notching timbers, while the back side (the poll) is effective for driving wooden or plastic stakes into the ground.","This camping axe has good balance, making it an ideal choice for a first-time owner. In addition, the nylon vinyl handle has excellent shock reduction. Our testers said it eliminated nearly all vibration caused by striking immovable objects. (We do not recommend trying this at home.)","Because it&#39;s a single forged-steel axe, it&#39;s heavier than most of the camping axes on our lineup. Thus, it&#39;s a better choice for a home toolkit, the family cabin or camping trips without too much hiking. The simple sheath, made from ballistic nylon, covers only the blade as opposed to the whole head and does not have a belt loop for attaching to a belt or pack.","This durable axe comes with a limited warranty covering &#34;failure in normal use&#34; but not damage from misuse or normal wear and tear from use or age. Estwing&#39;s warranty isn&#39;t actually all that different from most warranties you get with hatchets or other tools.","While this is not the camp axe for long hikes or alpine adventures, the Estwing Camper&#39;s Axe is an excellent choice for established campsites, car camping or survival kits as well as for all-around home use."]},"id":"3eb11892-8c3a-4309-a2b6-d035ccb9eee2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68359","url":"/estwing-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T18:48:11Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T18:48:11Z","name":"Estwing E44A 16-inch","synopsis":"The key feature for Estwing axes is durability.
