You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","AKDY is known for its European-style bathroom and kitchen fixtures. The AWR3130S Wall Range Hood offers that modern design element with a variety of features for the gourmet cook.","This AKDY <a href=\"/best-range-hoods\">range hood</a> is constructed of stainless steel for a contemporary, industrial look. It mounts directly to the wall behind the stove. The chimney needs a clearance of at least 8 feet, no more than 8.5 feet. The 60Hz, three-speed fan circulates air at a robust 760 CFM, so it can quickly remove smoke and odors from your kitchen. The fan runs on a standard 120-volt circuit.","The digital LED touch panel has smooth buttons to give you convenient control. You can remove and wash the aluminum grease filter for quick maintenance. Two LEDs provide energy-efficient lighting.","The dimensions of the hood are 29 x 18.9 inches. You should check the installation dimensions and ventilation requirements carefully prior to purchase. Because this is a vented range, you&#39;ll need to consult a licensed HVAC contractor prior to installation to ensure that makeup air requirements for your area are satisfied. This hood comes equipped with both a wiring kit and a standard three-prong electrical cord. The warranty may be voided if you don&#39;t hire a licensed electrician to connect the wiring properly.","You can maintain the hood simply with soap and water or kitchen cleaners. The baffle filters are dishwasher safe. AKDY provides a three-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty and a one-year limited parts warranty. You should install the hood no further than 29 inches from the cooking surface. The vent must terminate out of the house, through the roof or another opening.","You can also have this hood installed as a non-ducted hood, which simply circulates air within the kitchen. This is an option for a condo dweller or homeowner who can&#39;t satisfy the venting requirements. If the hood is installed unvented, you can purchase charcoal filters from the manufacturer or online. A six-month replacement cycle for these filters is recommended.","The AKDY 30-inch Wall Range Hood offers modern style and efficient air circulation. The fan blows air at a rate of 760 CFM. You can have it set up either as a ducted hood or a recirculating fan. The manufacturer provides a three-year warranty for security. Professional, licensed installation is recommended."]},"id":"28e1bf3c-5707-4073-8227-bf9b6846b820","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66580","url":"/akdy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T21:18:02Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T21:18:02Z","name":"AKDY Wall AURW130SS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-14T21:18:02Z","id":"mDF8Re9FPGu8BFMgX3weYm","meta":{"title":"AKDY Wall AURW130SS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The AKDY 30-inch Wall Range Hood has a modern design that you can convert to a non-ducted hood.
