When ready to place a call, simply tap the call button and clearly state the name of the person or business (previously programmed into your phonebook) you wish to reach, and the car kit will connect you. While this feature is wonderful, it can pose issues if the contacts in your phonebook are titled non-traditional names such as &#34;homeboy&#34; or &#34;Cutie Pie.&#34; If you have friends named &#34;Matt&#34; and &#34;Pat,&#34; these may also get confused. But the Motorola T305 will always ask you &#34;Did you mean…&#34; before connecting you.","If you wish to reach an associate or business whose phone number is not already programmed into your phone, the Motorola T305 will also allow you to speak the phone  number and easily connect you as well. Pretty simple.","We know that your lives are hectic, that is why the toggle feature is fantastic for commuters and moms on the go. Boss on one line and friend on the other? Press and hold the call button to place your boss on hold and then press the call button again to greet your friend.","As mentioned above, we enjoy the varying indicator lights that help identify what stage (standby, paring, mute) the phone is in. The Motorola T305 Bluetooth car kit also has audio tones to accompany these lights and other statues. When first using the Motorola T305, all of these tones may be confusing. We suggest carrying around your quick-start user manual for the first week to identify the tones.","Resembling a 1990&#39;s pager, the Motorola T305 Bluetooth kit is small and unassuming, but it has an attractively simple design. The face of the device has a gray section (designed to look like woven fabric), the main indicator light (which also doubles as the call button) and the speaker. The volume up and down buttons are positioned on either side of the Bluetooth car kit, while the power button and microphone reside at the top of the device with the charging port at the bottom.","Included in the box are two metal-clips, which (and we totally love this) also double as desk stand for increased mobility and functionality."]},"id":"2c90dd2d-836f-4e9b-90b8-47896e763027","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3a1ea7a6-776b-4dae-985e-af615560743c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While <strong>Motorola T305</strong> Bluetooth car kit requires a more hands-on approach than some of its counterparts, we still believe Motorola kept the hand-based functions simple enough for a quick, infrequent touch that will still keep your hands on the wheel.
