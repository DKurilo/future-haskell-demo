It appears that the processing takes place right then and there, and it does when a merchant uses real-time processing. However, many merchants actually use batch processing for credit card payments.","Batch processing works like this: After a credit card is swiped and authorized for a purchase, the card information is stored in a group, or batch. The merchant electronically sends the batch information to an acquiring bank, which is an entity that sends all of the information to a credit card processing company that takes money out of customer accounts. The money comes back to the acquiring bank electronically, the bank extracts a fee and the remaining proceeds go into the merchant&#39;s bank account.","Convenience is a primary reason many merchants use this type of processing as an alternate to real-time processing. With authorization confirmed for each transaction, the merchant knows the payment will be accepted but doesn&#39;t have to spend the time on individual processing. Plus, batch processing typically allows the merchant to see all credit card transactions quickly and easily for the day, shift or other pre-determined period. Batch processing also tends to be more secure than real-time processing.","If you&#39;re considering this type of processing, you should ask about fees. Online payment gateways tend to charge one fee per batch, which saves you money compared to the fees charged per transaction. However, other card processing companies usually charge additional fees for batch processing and sometimes require special equipment that also comes with added costs. So while convenience may draw you to batch processing, you must consider the attendant fees.","In addition, there sometimes are problems with batch processing. While authorizations help ensure there are sufficient funds for each transaction, things can occasionally go wrong with batch processing, and some transactions fail to go through. In cases like this, it&#39;s difficult for the merchant to track down the customer to ask for an alternate form of payment.","While brick-and-mortar businesses typically use terminals to execute batch processing, any retailer can use a virtual terminal for the same process thanks to several payment-gateway services. These services eliminate the equipment involved in card processing and reduce your costs somewhat. Virtual payment gateways typically accept all types of credit cards, from Visa and MasterCard to American Express, Discover and debit cards. These services also allow you to carry out real-time processing as needed.","If you aim to process hundreds or even thousands of transactions, do your homework. Working with a traditional merchant-services provider can be more expensive overall than working with an online merchant-services provider. While you avoid the terminal equipment and associated fees when you sign up with an online provider, you add a monthly gateway fee in many cases. You must also charge monthly minimums to maintain your account and pay a monthly statement fee.","Other things to consider include customer-service support. Whether you&#39;re batch processing via a terminal or a payment gateway, you&#39;ll want to know that you can contact someone immediately if your card-processing terminal or interface goes down."]},"id":"483f7b8e-5878-4d4c-a784-6f689b04451b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6593","url":"/benefits-of-batch-processing","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-09-14T14:52:49Z","datePublished":"2011-09-14T14:52:49Z","name":"Benefits of Batch Processing","synopsis":"In the world of credit card processing, a merchant swipes a card and a customer signs for payment.","review":{},"strapline":"In the world of credit card processing, a merchant swipes a card and a customer signs for payment.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-05-09T20:51:09Z","id":"r93Dv993oq6ANkJ6nNiZmJ","meta":{"title":"Benefits of Batch Processing","description":"How this alternate to real-time processing works."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:58:46Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/gDbpN33TpUrrPTziq3xswm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:58:46Z","mimeType":"","name":"6593-benefits-of-batch-processing.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6593-benefits-of-batch-processing.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:58:46Z","id":"gDbpN33TpUrrPTziq3xswm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDbpN33TpUrrPTziq3xswm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Benefits of Batch Processing","description":"How this alternate to real-time processing works."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/gDbpN33TpUrrPTziq3xswm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:58:46Z","mimeType":"","name":"6593-benefits-of-batch-processing.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6593-benefits-of-batch-processing.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:58:46Z","id":"gDbpN33TpUrrPTziq3xswm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDbpN33TpUrrPTziq3xswm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Benefits of Batch Processing","description":"How this alternate to real-time processing works."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/benefits-of-batch-processing","label":"","tags":[]}
