You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Philips DVD players are great for families, with their wide range of features, ease of use and durability. Philips DVD players are loaded with features, offering a versatile entertainment experience. Most Philips Blu-ray and <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD players</a> let you play discs from any region. Many models also allow you to stream movies and TV shows from services like Amazon Video and Netflix.","Across the range, these products have HDMI connections, and some offer Wi-Fi Direct, or can link to a local area network to connect to peripheral devices like cameras, smartphones, tablets and computers. Some Philips DVD players feature a USB 2.0 port, allowing you to play musical videos or access files and data saved on a USB storage drive for a USB-compatible peripheral. The majority of DVD players from Philips can connect to the internet, some via Ethernet and others wirelessly.","Image resolution across most of the Philips Blu-ray and DVD player lines is at least 1080p, or Full HD, and many offer Ultra HD quality. If you’ve got a 3D-compatible television, Philips DVD players&#39; 3D playback allows you to enjoy an immersive 3D experience. The majority of the DVD players offer, at minimum, low-resolution upscaling. This feature enhances the image quality of low-resolution and old DVDs to near-HD quality. Some models also upscale 720p to 1080p, or 1080p to Ultra HD.","TI Burr-Brown audio components, including digital-to-analog converters, are found in a number of high-end Philips DVD players for clear, audiophile-quality sound. Select Philips models are DivX Plus HD certified, allowing you to stream HD content directly from the internet without buffering or loss of quality. Mid- and top-range players come with an EasyLink remote control that lets you connect and operate all HDMI CEC devices from just the one handset. You’ll find some Blu-ray and DVD players that support Miracast, letting you mirror content from a compatible smartphone or tablet onto your television.","Some of the products that let you access photos also provide picture enhancement options, including image rotation, slideshows with or without accompanying music, and a zoom function. The easy-to-use parental controls let you stop your youngsters watching anything inappropriate."]},"id":"f21dfbc7-667a-47f0-abe3-3076ebbf8d04","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53443","url":"/philips-dvp3560-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-16T18:32:43Z","datePublished":"2011-08-16T18:32:43Z","name":"Philips","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-16T18:32:43Z","id":"Xdnzr8miun5j5vrP6JByYH","meta":{"title":"Philips Standard DVD Player Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Philips DVD players are versatile and durable, perfect for students on a budget as well as movie buffs and home theater lovers.
