Like a chemistry class, the manual for this set moves from general lessons on topics, such as the nature of elements, the behavior of atoms and molecules, and the proper procedures for scientific experimentation, into more advanced lessons demonstrating complex chemical properties, such as combustion, and finally into more real-world applications, such as understanding environmental forces and measuring water quality. Though you might have to buy the chemicals you need for some experiments, this is the most complete chemistry set we reviewed.","While even this complete set cannot take the place of a standard science education, the hands-on experience of conducting experiments cements the lessons learned in the classroom and inspires students to want to learn more.","That said, be aware that the CHEM C3000 set is not a toy anyone can play with carelessly. The experiments in this kit can be dangerous, and you need follow the procedure manual closely. The manufacturer recommends parental supervision and guidance for all experiments involving heat and chemicals.
