It’s one of the least expensive electric shavers we tested, but its performance rivals higher-priced razors. Both the Wahl and the $199.99 (MSRP) <a href=\"/panasonic-arc5-review\">Panasonic Arc5</a> earned A grades for user experience. Only the <a href=\"/panasonic-arc4-review-review\">Panasonic Arc4</a> and the <a href=\"/braun-review\">Braun Series 7</a>, our pick for best performance, tested better in this area. ","The Wahl LifeProof 7061-100 is a waterproof, shock-resistant electric razor with dual foil shaving heads. Its rechargeable lithium ion battery is the most impressive we tested, providing 90 minutes of shaving time between charges. This is the equivalent of 30 three-minute shaves. Like most of the razors we tested, the Wahl also has a quick-charge feature. If you need a quick touchup while the battery is low, charging it for one minute gives you just enough juice for one shave. A full battery recharge takes 90 minutes.","Be aware that this razor has no corded-use option, so you can’t plug it in and use it on a low battery. If you’d like a shaver you can use while it’s plugged in, the Panasonic Arc4 and the <a href=\"/braun-series-3-review\">Braun Series 3 3050cc</a> are our favorite choices with this capability.","The Wahl LifeProof is designed for both dry shaving and wet shaving. It can be safely used in the shower, and it’s fully washable and easy to clean. In fact, this electric razor can be submerged in 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes with no risk of shock or malfunction.","While each razor we tested has a pop-up trimmer, this one stands out because it is full size and has precision-ground, stainless steel blades. This makes the Wahl a versatile, long-lasting tool for trimming sideburns and facial hair. The shaver also has ergonomic, rubber grips and a durable housing. Its foils flex with the contours of your face and neckline for a close and comfortable shave, and its shaving heads have a bi-directional cutting bar to intercept and trim longer hairs, making it quite efficient.","The shaver comes with a foil guard, charging adapter, cleaning brush, blade oil and styling guide. However, it doesn’t have a cleaning station or a charging dock. Its battery is charged with a simple power adaptor, and its blades are washable under running water once you remove loose hairs with its cleaning brush. For optimum performance, Wahl recommends replacing this razor’s blades every five to six months, and blade oil is provided for maintenance in between. This razor does have a travel pouch and worldwide voltage adaptation, but it lacks a travel lock feature to prevent it from turning on accidentally.","The Wahl LifeProof has the best consumer protection we found, with a five-year manufacturer’s warranty. The other razors we reviewed have two-year warranties. If you need help with this electric razor, consumer support is available by phone and email. We experienced responsive customer service when we reached out with questions."]},"id":"68e82d90-870a-4a33-b453-aee9f046b54c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66717","url":"/wahl-shaver-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-26T22:48:24Z","datePublished":"2015-08-26T22:48:24Z","name":"Wahl LifeProof 7061-100","synopsis":"The Wahl LifeProof is our top pick in electric razors because it provides an excellent user experience at an affordable price.","review":{"rating":94,"verdict":"This high-performing foil shaver that provides a comfortable, close shave at an affordable price.
