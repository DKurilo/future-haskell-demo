DVDs, CDs, photos, Roxio does it all. Any criticism we have for Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier is the file size for download or the actual software file. It’s big. It takes longer to get started than any other of our reviewed programs, but the subsequent launch and time to complete burning tasks is rewardingly short.","Also, that file size is a good indicator of the vast possibilities offered by Roxio MyDVD 10. From the main interface you can choose to copy data, video-movies, music-audio, photo or online. Once you select one of these main subjects, you are presented with a whole host of other, more specific options. Choose your selected platform and destination, hit the big green button and you’re off.","A word of warning: this program is not intended for the copying of write-protected movies or discs of any kind. If you feed it a protected disc you will be prompted as such and the process will abort: nor will it let you make a copy of a copy.","For DVD burning projects, MyDVD 10 Premier will take your DVD, compress it, and create a copy on a virtual drive. From the virtual copy – which takes up no actual space on your hard drive – you can then make copies of the image on your choice of format: DVD, iPod, PSP and other mobile applications."]},"id":"88f9e5c9-1817-4eff-9201-27598b78bcdc","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Import movies from your digital camcorder and camera.","Make slideshows with a custom soundtrack.","Burn movies and slideshows to DVD or your mobile devices.","One-click upload to YouTube.","Convert your copies and creations to mobile phones."],"type":"ul"},"id":"414ec5fb-7b8d-44b8-894e-68298f743896","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Roxio MyDVD 10 Premier does not remove region codes or CSS decryption, abiding by the terms set forth by the Digital Rights Management act (DRM).<br/>The rip time – time it takes to copy to the hard drive or destination drive of your choice – varies depending on the project. The burn time is satisfyingly short – but again, depends on the length of the project.","At the install you can choose from seven supported languages, which is very convenient if you exist in a bi-lingual environment. German, Spanish, English, French, Italian, Japanese and Dutch are all supported here.","Our first test of Roxio MyDVD 10  was to just make a copy of an unencrypted DVD movie. It won&#39;t even begin a project if the DVD you feed it is copy protected. Choose Video Copy &amp; Convert from the main interface. You can then choose to add a movie from an existing file or put a disc in the drive. Also, specify the output format and destination, click Burn and you&#39;re off. A pop-up window will show you the progress bar, which phase the program is in and give you the option to create a label. About an hour later the copy was read to our hard drive and subsequently copied to a disc.","Next we wanted to try the compilation feature - theoretically this would be the function to select if, say you wanted to compile your favorite jungle trek clips from the second season of Lost (if Lost DVDs weren&#39;t write-protected, which they are). OR if you wanted to compile all the best video clips of the wife&#39;s (husband, sister, bro, etc.) for an upcoming celebration, here is where you&#39;d accomplish such a feat of technological wonder. We chose Video Compilation from the Video Copy &amp; Convert interface, easily added movie files on the left from disc and file, chose iPod format and output to disc/disc image and the rest is history. The program did all the conversion needed, made the image, then copied to disc. The quality of the copy turned out to be excellent.","We found dozens of menu styles from which to choose. They all have matching chapter and scene selections as well as the option to use your own video or photos as menu backgrounds.","The other functions we loved were photo slideshows where we could choose from stills, video and music and lots of effects from which to choose. Then you can burn the whole thing to a disc, make copies for the friends or family, etc. The audio capabilities are also nothing to shake a stick at - full wav editor with 32 overlay, audio and text effect tracks.","Roxio MyDVD 10 is easy to launch. It’s easy to pick a project icon and proceed to the copy status. What we found slightly challenging was burning the image to a disc. The menus are unclear how to accomplish this – rather, the menus point you in what seems to be the correct direction but then it turns out that you actually just made another image copy.","The support structure for Roxio MyDVD 10 consists of user manuals, email support, FAQs, knowledge base, forums, tutorials and live chat. The user guide and manual is built in to the program so you can easily ask it for help. Any question we had was answered by the built-in user guide and online forums."]},"id":"77948582-eabd-45ec-b432-746303e4e9c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ebf2be9e-5994-4a34-b0ea-0edd9de402ae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["My DVD 10 by Roxio is a comprehensive DVD burning software with audio, video, DVD and editing functions.
