Most make use of the proprietary PerfectStroke system to ensure consistent, reliable typing. These keyboards are suited to users of all levels.","The desktop models in the Logitech Wireless series tend to connect to your computer using a 2.4GHz radio frequency wireless connection via Logitech&#39;s Unifying Receiver. This receiver lets you connect up to six compatible peripherals on a single adapter so you don&#39;t unnecessarily tie up USB ports. For example, using a single receiver, you can connect a mouse and a keyboard to your computer. Some, but not all, models in this series feature USB pass-throughs and audio-out and mic-in ports.","Scissor switches are the most commonly used key switches in the Logitech Wireless series, but some of the budget models have membrane or silicone dome switches. The keycaps are slightly concave for a smooth, comfortable typing experience. Some models in this line have as many as 18 programmable keys, including 12 F-keys and six separate hotkeys. There are a few models with saveable profiles, so you can switch between specific programmed key sets for different games, programs and tasks.","Higher-end models in the Logitech Wireless keyboard series feature special keys, including dedicated media keys, programmable function keys and hotkeys. If you choose a model with programmable keys, you need to use Logitech SetPoint software to program them. Full-size models all feature 10-key number pads, but the majority of compact models don&#39;t.","Not all of the keyboards in the Logitech Wireless series have much in the way of ergonomic features, although some models do feature palm rests. You can also find a couple of ergonomically built options, with large palm rests and curved-keyboard layouts. The presence of robust, adjustable tilt-legs increases ergonomic comfort and allows you to adjust the slope of the keyboard based on your preferred typing position and posture.","These keyboards generally operate on two AA batteries, but you can switch out the disposables for rechargeable ones to save money and reduce your carbon footprint. This wireless keyboard series from Logitech caters to users with any budget and includes both inexpensive, no-frills models and special ergonomic ones."]},"id":"ad0b29c2-868a-4fd2-8d66-454561c6b58c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68435","url":"/logitech-wireless-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-21T18:27:43Z","datePublished":"2016-09-21T18:27:43Z","name":"Logitech Wireless Desktop","synopsis":"The Logitech Wireless keyboard series includes full-size desktop and ergonomic models.
