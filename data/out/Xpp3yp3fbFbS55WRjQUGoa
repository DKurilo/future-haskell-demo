You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Berlitz Spanish Premier, by Nova Development, is a <a href=\"/best-learn-spanish-software\">learn Spanish software</a> product that contains some outstanding features. With this application, you get video, audio and text lessons to teach Spanish from a conversational point of view. You also get a set of audio CDs with another Spanish course and a version of the program that works on an iPod and other mobile devices. A significant strength of this application is the variety of word recognition activities and word tools that you get with Berlitz Spanish Premier. The software includes many different word activities and several ways to get information about specific words and translations. One drawback with this approach is the feeling that the learning process is more like textbook learning than intuitive context learning. However, the upside to this method is that you can learn many individual words and phrases that makes holding spontaneous conversations in Spanish much easier. One thing we noticed with Berlitz Spanish Premier is that there is little feedback from the program, which prevents you from understanding how well or poorly you are progressing through the system.","Berlitz has many great features that make it useful in any setting. The mobile version of the program makes it possible to learn even if you are away from your computer. The audio CDs can be taken anywhere too. Many seasoned classroom teachers will tell you that flashcards are a great way to memorize material. Berlitz employs the same technique in this program as well, but makes it more fun than sitting there and trying to memorize tedious lists of words or phrases that mean nothing to you. The lessons are engaging, and speak to different levels of learning and ability.","Berlitz gets the fundamentals right. Almost everything is based around vocabulary, though there are grammar lessons. Much of the learning focuses on video conversations where you learn the words as the conversation progresses. There is also a speech recognition function that helps to teach pronunciation by letting you compare your voice to that of a native speaker. Experienced language learners will tell you that repetition and exposure to the proper patterns of speech are the best ways to nail down correct pronunciations. In addition, one of the biggest hurdles for someone learning a new language is the sudden realization that you can’t actually understand a native speaker because you have not been exposed to the speed and vocal inflections that come naturally to native speakers. The speech analysis portion of Berlitz Spanish Premier lets you have as much immersion in the language as you need so you can be comfortable with hearing the language spoken by someone other than a student.","This application could be a bit better when it comes to ease of use. While there are many different choices and features, it’s not immediately clear what everything does. There are tutorials and explanations for everything, but we found that, even after watching the tutorials, we weren’t sure what all the buttons did. In order to understand the function of many of the buttons, you will need to explore the software before you begin the lessons. A tab system lets you easily navigate between parts of a lesson. In order to understand this application, you will need to dabble and test it out first before delving into the subject matter. However, with a little curiosity, you can find your way around.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"f9ad566c-6d40-4790-abc1-cdc29423c839","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Berlitz has several different types of word tools. There is a standard dictionary that can help translate, but you can also instantly translate words in a lesson if you are stuck. You can also make a log of words that are particularly difficult for you and the software makes a list with definitions for you to study later.","The FAQs section for Berlitz Spanish Premier is helpful. The user manual is extensive and complete, making it a good resource for problems and questions. There are also several tutorials designed to teach you how to navigate the program, though they may not be enough to explain everything.
