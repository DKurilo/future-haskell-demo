The <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">underwater camera</a> is built to withstand the elements. It can be submerged underwater down to 65 feet and still work for up to an hour.","In addition to its impressive maximum depth, the FinePix XP120 is also highly durable. If you are skiing or snowboarding in a blizzard, you can still bring the camera out of your pocket and shoot pictures. Its lowest operating temperature is a fairly standard 14 degrees Fahrenheit. It is also shockproof from a maximum drop of 5.8 feet. If you are trying to snap a photo but the camera slips out of your hand, it’ll survive the fall. Its IP6X dustproof rating means you can bring it along as you go four-wheeling in the sand dunes. Wherever your adventures take you, this camera should be durable enough to handle it.","For our underwater testing, we positioned the camera in a large fish tank. The underwater images that the XP120 produced were slightly above average, with good and fairly vibrant colors. The underwater flash brightened up the image but didn’t do as much for image sharpness as it could have.","Our dry-land testing included photos of our test scene in a controlled lighting environment. When we compared the FinePix XP120 to our best dry-land images from the <a href=\"/nikon-w300-review\">Nikon W300</a>, there was the slightest bit of noticeable grain (noise) when we zoomed in on the scene. Sharpness and other details were pretty good as well.","The Fuijifilm FinePix XP120 has a 16.4-megapixel 1/2.3-inch BSI-CMOS sensor and, impressively, 10x digital zoom and 5x optical zoom. Optical image stabilization reduces blur that occurs when you zoom in. And, if you’re new to photography, there are 22 scene shooting modes you can choose – from Action Camera to Snow to Night – that will automatically optimize the camera settings for taking pictures in that particular scenario. Additionally, the XP120 gives you 11 advanced filters to choose from to create a photo effect; seven of those can be used on any video you shoot.","The camera is also packed with features, including face detection, image stabilization, GPS for image geotagging and 4K video recording. It even has built-in Wi-Fi functionality, so you can connect and send the photos you take to your phone for review or upload them to your favorite social media sites."]},"id":"2f3bcb94-4036-4c1a-8d42-10c58f5b8a40","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e84c966b-bf7d-414d-bc99-92a11108f2fc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The FujiFilm FinePix XP80 isn&#39;t the greatest underwater camera in our comparison, but it has its definite upsides.

The image quality is average at best. Although there are other cameras in our lineup that take better pictures, the XP80 makes for a good secondary camera to take on adventures."]},"id":"24f352d7-5731-43a6-a4e1-f18f8a33e2c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64608","url":"/fujifilm-finepix-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-30T22:34:32Z","datePublished":"2015-04-30T22:34:32Z","name":"Fujifilm FinePix XP120","synopsis":"With the Fujifilm FinePix XP120, you get a camera that can keep up with your adventures and capture your memories along the way.
