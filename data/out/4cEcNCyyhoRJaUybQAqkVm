It tackles many video input and output formats and does it all from a compact interface that can fit into a corner of your screen and convert files while your computer does what it would normally.","Even though the user interface is compact, it is not all that easy to use. With so little real estate, the buttons are tiny, and it is not immediately obvious how to start converting videos. When we got it going, we were impressed with the tools and available formats.","We had an issue with the software crashing on a regular basis. This can happen for a number of reasons, but since we didn&#39;t experience it with many of the other video converters we tested, we hesitate to recommend this one without reservation.","With WinMPG, you can convert to AVI, MPEG, VCD and even iPod-compatible formats. If you click the More button, you will find a fair selection of output options. In all of our conversion tests, WinMPG worked just fine. However, the picture is a little grainy and pixilated. We still suggest using caution with this software, and youâ€™ll definitely want to use the trial download before you buy.","WinMPG can rip an unencrypted DVD directly from your computer&#39;s disc drive, but you have to go into the advanced settings to choose which section or episode you would like to convert.","In the advanced settings, you can adjust start and stop times, aspect ratio, bit rates, frame rates and start and stop times. These feature options may differ depending on your original input file and your selected output file, however.","WinMPG only has DVD ripping and combining, and batch conversion as its additional features. We would like to see more features in this area because the software&#39;s competitors make additional features a high priority.","If you have any questions, you can contact the company&#39;s quality customer service representatives by email any time, day or night. Before you send that email, you should consult the FAQs section and Assist file within the application first. You might be able to find the answer to your question in one of these informative resources."]},"id":"963e97dd-a26d-436b-b200-53c5fec32563","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8c20ff2f-8cd6-4b6b-b55b-68c22a0378c7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["WinMPG is good video converter software with many file types from which to choose.
