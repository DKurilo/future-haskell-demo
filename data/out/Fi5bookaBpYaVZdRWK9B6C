A window air conditioner is a good way to keep cool. However, when it comes to air conditioning units, it&#39;s not a one-size-fits-all scenario. Choosing the right AC window unit can mean the difference between enjoying even the hottest of midsummer days comfortably and braving a cold shower to keep cool.","The SPT WA-1211S is a great model that produces up to 12,000 BTUs and can cool a medium sized room of 400-700 square feet comfortably. With three fan speeds, you can modify the airflow to your needs; and with five different modes, including Dry, Auto, Energy Saver and Sleep, you can customize your room to feel exactly the way you want.","This window-mounted air conditioner has received an Energy Star award, which means it is guaranteed to run efficiently. It also has an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 10.8 (anything over 10 is considered great), so you&#39;ll be spending less on your energy bill this summer."]},"id":"da0c56ef-61dc-4324-a572-2379ad7244ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/pdYFA6P5mzTd7DcNKU2GxJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57200-spt-12000-wa-1211s2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdYFA6P5mzTd7DcNKU2GxJ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"pdYFA6P5mzTd7DcNKU2GxJ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdYFA6P5mzTd7DcNKU2GxJ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"db543a00-aea4-45a9-8511-cab909a7b3c0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The air conditioner has a thermostat that senses and regulates the room temperature to ensure your room always has a comfortable feeling. Plus, there’s an adjustable vent, so you can direct the airflow as you please. There&#39;s also an auto-restart feature that will preserve your settings if the unit is unexpectedly turned off – say, in a power outage. You’ll also get a remote control so you can change the temperature from a distance. The timer lets you program the unit in half-hour increments for up to 10 hours, and in one-hour increments up to 24 hours in advance.","This is one of the quietest air conditioner units on the market, at about 51 decibels. To put this in perspective, an ordinary conversation is about 60 decibels.","Perhaps the best part of this window air conditioner is the features it comes with, including electronic controls with a digital display to make setting the unit more convenient. It includes a washable air filter, so you can ensure that the air is always clean without having to buy a new filter. Included in the package is an installation kit to make setup easy. It also has a flexible window mount to make adjusting the unit to your window simple.","This air conditioner is perfect for cooling a medium sized room to a studio style apartment. There&#39;s no need to toss and turn in a puddle of your own sweat. Stay cool and comfortable with an air conditioner than can get the job done."]},"id":"cbb50072-eb7b-44d7-a160-d4e2479c8151","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57228","url":"/spt-12000-wa-1211s-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-08T19:36:17Z","datePublished":"2013-08-08T19:36:17Z","name":"SPT 12000 WA-1211S","synopsis":"Editor's note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
