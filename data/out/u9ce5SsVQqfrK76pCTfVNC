In this line of <a href=\"/best-elliptical-machines\">elliptical machines</a> is the Octane Q37c. This machine presents you with eight different workout programs that you can vary to your heart&#39;s delight using the 20 different resistance levels that are included.","The workout programs on this machine include manual, random, custom interval, beginner, the 300-calorie, the 750-calorie, the 10k and the half-marathon programs. If you want to jazz up your exercise routine further, you can make use of the &#34;workout boosters&#34; such as X-Mode, the GluteKicker and the ArmBlaster. These boosters are designed to work out specific areas of your body.","For an additional cost, you can add Octane&#39;s trademarked CROSS CiRCUIT training kit, which includes power bands for arm strengthening and stationary foot platforms. With these extras, you can undertake some serious strength training and perform interval workouts that help you tone and trim your entire body. You can also do such things as seated or upright rowing, flys, curls, tricep extensions and chest presses for an upper body workout. For the lower body, you can do calf raises, leg extensions and more.","Even without the extra training kit, you can still get a thorough workout on this machine, one that is geared toward the particular fitness goals that you want to achieve.","This elliptical cross trainer can handle workouts by someone who weighs as much as 300 pounds. It is 76 inches long, 30 inches wide and 65 inches high and weighs 220 pounds.","There are a couple of drawbacks with the Q37c. First, you cannot change the fixed stride length of 20.5 inches. You also cannot change the incline.","You can enjoy your workout more by making use of the reading rack and holder for MP3 players. You also get a water bottle holder with this elliptical cross trainer, so you can stay hydrated during your entire workout session.","The warranty on this elliptical is reasonably good, but not exceptional. You get a lifetime warranty on the frame, a five-year warranty on parts and a one-year warranty on labor.","If you need to contact the company with questions, its website offers a blog and a FAQs section. You also can make use of email or phone support."]},"id":"f76509a7-684b-4804-a639-4b2f9cf0175d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ecf75e6a-45b4-486f-b553-113741840878","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Octane Q37c elliptical cross trainer gives you the opportunity to set certain goals and work toward them with its selection of programmable workouts and adjustable resistance levels."]},"id":"1f069e9b-a4d0-49f5-8aa9-3a74f12e69fc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58403","url":"/octane-q-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-10T21:13:29Z","datePublished":"2013-12-10T21:13:29Z","name":"Octane Q37c","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
