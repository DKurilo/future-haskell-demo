This is especially useful when you&#39;re away at work because you can set it to turn off while you&#39;re away and to turn back on as soon as you arrive home, so you&#39;re never wasting energy.","The remote control makes it easy to set the air conditioner unit to a specific temperature, to change the timer or to adjust the fan speed from anywhere in the room, so you don&#39;t have to get up or out of bed to adjust the settings. This window mounted air conditioner also has an auto restart function that will turn your unit back on automatically when power is restored after an outage.  Plus, the unit runs relatively quietly."]},"id":"d4d12127-1255-4e07-9400-accce935b790","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Jmmz4kkhsFZ9uASJMvRTwZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57205-lg-energy-lw8012er4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jmmz4kkhsFZ9uASJMvRTwZ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Jmmz4kkhsFZ9uASJMvRTwZ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jmmz4kkhsFZ9uASJMvRTwZ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"22813a9f-8492-4678-80e5-0d394ab366bf","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The fan feature has three cooling speeds that allow you to keep your space comfortable on your terms. The four-way air direction feature means you can adjust the air flow to go up, down, left and right, so you can concentrate the cool where it&#39;s needed most. This Energy Star rated AC window unit has an energy efficiency ratio of 10.8, which means you&#39;ll be saving money and cutting your energy usage.","The filter is washable, so you have the assurance of fresh air in your home without having to go out and buy a new filter every time it gets dirty. At 59 pounds, this window-mounted air conditioner is rather heavy, so when it comes time for installation, you don&#39;t want to attempt to do it alone. The unit does come with instructions, but you might need additional brackets, that do not come with the product, for your window.","If you&#39;re looking to cool a small room or studio apartment, then the LG Energy LW8012ER is a good choice. It has features such as a convenient remote control, a high energy efficiency rating and other coveted functions. What&#39;s more, this AC window unit runs quietly, so it would be a great addition to a bedroom or office."]},"id":"ac6ef5f0-878f-4a3c-8572-9ecc03acb39d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57233","url":"/lg-energy-lw8012er-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-08T19:37:01Z","datePublished":"2013-08-08T19:37:01Z","name":"LG Energy LW8012ER","synopsis":"Editor's note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
