The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-photo-organizing-software\"><em>Photo Organizing Software</em></a><em> here.</em>","Systweak Photo Album is simple photo organizing software. While it does offer some editing options, it doesn&#39;t give you much control over the editing adjustments. It also doesn&#39;t include options to share your photos with social networking websites such as Facebook and YouTube.","With Systweak Photo Album, you can assign the photos to albums. It&#39;s easy to create albums; you simply drag and drop the photos into the viewfinder. If you&#39;d like, you can add templates to your albums from Systweak&#39;s collection. You can search through your photos for particular photos or sort your photos by occasion or keyword.","As we stated above, Systweak Photo Album doesn&#39;t have many editing options. You can lighten, darken, add or decrease contrast, sharpen, soften, blur, convert to black and white, resize, flip and rotate the image. The controls are all automatic, so you don&#39;t have control over the precise adjustments. You can use shortcut keys to quickly edit your photos. For instance, you can press Shift, Control, &#34;D&#34; to darken the photo. We wish there was a red eye removal tool. We also didn&#39;t see any preset filters, which are quite frequently available with photo organizing software.","As you&#39;re editing, you can increase the size of the photo. You can also zoom into the photo. This can help you see more clearly the detail in the photo so you can adjust the contrast and sharpness of the photo as precisely as possible.","Although you can share your photos through this photo organizing software, the options are out of date. It doesn&#39;t include direct access to your Facebook, YouTube or Flickr accounts. Systweak Photo Album can create recordable CDs, download images directly from a camera or scanner, and access images already stored on your computer. This photo organizing software offers a Burn Album Wizard to help you create an album of your favorite photos.","Systweak Photo Album is not complicated software to use; however, it isn&#39;t as user-friendly as some of the other software we reviewed. The navigation is along the top of the screen. Some of the controls are marked, but some are not, which makes it somewhat  difficult to use. If you aren&#39;t sure what the symbol means, you can roll over the symbol and read the tag that describes the function of the button.","If you have questions, you can contact tech support via telephone or email. You can also access the knowledge base and FAQs if you have general questions about your software. However, the FAQs generally focus around receiving your software instead of how to use your software."]},"id":"f671db80-19d6-48b7-8fae-3ba2efe1bf9f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d6a09600-e96a-419e-83b2-075c265196df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This straightforward software has wizards that guide you through the setup process.
