It is an intuitive program that is more than able to duplicate and back up your entire DVD movie library – even if doesn’t have every feature we looked for.","Magic Mac DVD Copier is a basic application. There are no splash screens or load times when you launch the program. It loads directly into the application’s main interface where all of its features are located. All you have to do is insert the DVD you want to copy or back up into the optical drive.","This application has two main functions that are located at the top of the interface: Burn DVD and Copy to Local Disk. There&#39;s no guesswork involved – burn DVD creates a copy of your disc on a new, blank one while Copy to Local Disk rips the DVD file and folder structure off the disc and saves it to your hard drive.","Each option has identical customization options that are limited to two radio buttons marked Full Disc and Main Movie. The former duplicates everything on the original disc, including the movie, menus, extra features, subtitles, etc. The latter copies only the main movie, which the software automatically selects as the file with the longest running time.","These features are good as far as they go. This application omits several customization options found in other Mac DVD copy software we reviewed. Notably absent is the ability to choose which specific files you want to copy onto the new disc. Additionally, the ability to split a commercial DVD onto two separate new discs is not found in this application. And even though you can copy the files of a disc onto your hard drive, there is no option to rip the DVD&#39;s disc image, the ISO file. This would allow you to store the ISO file and burn new copies of the original disc without having to actually have physical possession of it. The inclusion of any of these features would have earned this software a higher spot on our side-by-side comparison chart."]},"id":"b73dac42-25c8-4253-b6c9-2de6d6227492","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"84aaaea5-0ec7-4348-ba1c-493ddfee70ac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Magic Mac DVD Copier is straightforward and performs as advertised.
