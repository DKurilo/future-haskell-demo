Many of these machines come with additional features to ensure your everyday business runs as smoothly as possible. They alert you to the presence of counterfeit bills and some units sort currency based on denomination. Only the most advanced machines come with sorting features, but most money counting machines batch out currency into individual stacks for banding and labeling. With the help of a money counter like the <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-pos-systems\">Cassida Tiger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-pos-systems\">Royal Sovereign RBC-650PRO</a> or <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/best-pos-systems\">SteelMaster 2005520UM</a>, you can ensure accurate counts at the end of the day before depositing even stacks in your bank account.","<strong>Money Counters: What to Look For</strong>","The right money counting machine depends on the size and complexity of your business. If you currently sort bills, a basic money counter provides accurate counts to prepare bills for banding and labeling, facilitating accurate bank deposits. Depending on the amount of cash you deal with, your business might require a unit with more advanced functionality. Read through these features to find out what to look for in your next money counter:","<strong>Capacity</strong><br/>High-capacity money counters speed up the process of counting bills since a large stack capacities result in less time loading the machine. While the unit works through a primary stack, you can often add the next stack into a hopper to expedite the process. An extra hopper is not a standard feature, and many machines differ in the size of the primary stacker capacity. Look for models that hold at least 200 bills in the stacker, so you can operate your business as efficiently as possible.","<strong>Counterfeit Detection</strong><br/>Most commercial money counters offer some form of counterfeit detection. Many official currencies, including U.S. currency, use both magnetic and ultraviolet inks, and specific functions on the units can detect the presence or lack of these inks. Money counters that offer counterfeit detection on only one of these two inks often do not offer enough protection. For example, some counterfeiters use printers with magnetic ink but not ultraviolet, so an automatic bill counter with only magnetic fraud detection doesn&#39;t provide a complete solution.","<strong>Speed</strong><br/>Money counters are more efficient than counting bills manually, but some models work much faster than others. Look for a machine with a speed that exceeds at least 1,000 bills per minute. Units that offer slower speeds are often low-end units that may also require a second or third count to ensure accuracy.","<strong>Functionality</strong><br/>All money counters determine the number of bills in a stack, but many also come with batch functions that make it simple to prepare cash for storage or bank deposits. The most advanced units sort currency based on denomination, but this feature does not come as a standard option on most midrange machines.","Your money counter should perform with the speed and precision you need. As you read through each of the options, consider the way that each unit checks for the bill&#39;s legitimacy, the overall capacity and the speed at which the machine completes its task. With this information, you can find a model that suits the needs of your business."]},"id":"4afcb5d5-9ec1-4268-a1f6-67209cc2507b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"e9b09d85-29d2-41bc-8ead-0aba3be1d05a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CRM0EA/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67003[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">AccuBANKER</a>","<a href=\"http://armoredbrandusa.com/armoredb/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=145\">Armored Brand</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I8VURLK/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67008[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Bluedot Trading</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G58LRO/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67002[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Carnation</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NOJLYQ/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67006[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cassida</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KRMLA1Y/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67005[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">HFS Bill</a>","<a href=\"http://www.houseables.com/new-money-bill-cash-counter-bank-machine/#.VVtTIPlViko\">Houseables</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F0WZIA0/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67010[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Ribao</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067PN8L0/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67007[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Royal Sovereign</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HNSOGCU/?&tag=ttr_money-counters-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1799[art|NA[pid|67009[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">SteelMaster</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2f177a2e-8c76-4e57-b0de-a68c69fad209","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1799","url":"/best-money-counters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-06T18:16:36Z","datePublished":"2015-10-02T23:48:31Z","name":"Money Counters Review","synopsis":"Money counters help quickly track cash flow for businesses of all sizes.
