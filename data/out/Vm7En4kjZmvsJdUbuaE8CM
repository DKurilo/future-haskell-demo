The Sherwood R-807 is the newest product from this series. The audio quality is good, and while there are very few HDMI ports, you will find many other useful ports. Some great video and network features make your experience more enjoyable. The technical support has many practical services.","While this home theater receiver delivers a great performance, it doesn&#39;t measure up to the higher-rated receivers we reviewed. With that out of the way, the R-807 has good audio performance thanks to a high signal-to-noise ratio of 98 dB and a relatively low distortion of one percent. The 7.1-channel sound system has a peak power output of 100 watts and continuous power output that equals 100 watts.","Three HDMI ports is a rather meager offering that limits the number of devices you can connect to the system. The HDMI output brings audio from your TV using the same input cable with an audio return channel. This digital receiver comes with modern connections, such as USB, Ethernet and Wi-Fi Direct. Wi-Fi Direct connects the receiver to any wireless device with or without a network connection. This is the only receiver available with this feature at this time.","A setup microphone calibrates your speaker system. This unit also lets you set up speakers in two different rooms. The legacy ports available include composite, optical and coaxial, but there are no ports for component video. A headphone jack and an AM/FM radio are also present in this receiver.","The Sherwood R-807 has many useful features such as 3D video compatibility and 1080p video scaling. The included network media server accesses the digital music libraries of each computer on your home network and allows for internet radio. Download a remote control app for Android or iOS to control your receiver using a tablet or smartphone.","Sherwood offers satisfactory technical support for the R Series with phone, email and FAQs. One problem is the lack of a user guide on their website. The R-807 has a two-year warranty."]},"id":"b9d0132b-2599-43b8-853d-545035740feb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6cabf7ef-da34-4688-ace5-ff9f35b7595a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sherwood R-807 offers good audio performance and some unique features like Wi-Fi Direct.
