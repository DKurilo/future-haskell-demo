It gives off pleasing white light and falls high on the color-rendering index, which means that objects appear close in color to how they would in natural daylight. This LED light will save you energy and last a long time.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>The GE Energy Smart 13DA19/830 light bulb uses 13 watts to emit about the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent. This light bulb has a lighting output of 800 lumens. This LED lighting is just a little dimmer than an incandescent bulb. It also has a lifespan of 25,000 hours, which is the industry-standard length.","The correlated color temperature (CCT) for this bulb is 3,000 Kelvin. GE labels the color as white, which we think is accurate. It&#39;s not a warm light, but it doesn&#39;t feel cold either. Its color rendering index (CRI) number is 82, which is about average among the bulbs we reviewed. The CRI doesn&#39;t measure the color of the light from the bulb, but instead determines how accurately colors in the surrounding area appear in the presence of this light source compared to that of daylight. The higher the CRI, the deeper and more accurate the colors appear.","This light bulb is dimmable. It works outdoors and indoors. While it can experience some humidity, you shouldn&#39;t allow it to be directly exposed to water. The LED also needs air circulation to help maintain its long life. For this reason, do not place it in totally enclosed fixtures.","It is UL listed, meaning it passed the required safety inspections. It is also RoHS compliant, so you can be sure it&#39;s free of hazardous materials. It also complies with FCC rules for not creating harmful interference with other devices.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>This LED bulb has an interesting design. Overall, the shape is that of an A19 light. The bulb itself is only about 1.5 inches in diameter. Prong-like extensions surround the bulb and increase the diameter to a total of 2.375 inches at its widest point. These aluminum extensions are a heat sink that directs heat away from the light-emitting diodes to preserve the lifespan of the bulb. The maximum overall length (MOL) is 4.43 inches, which is a little longer than a standard incandescent bulb. This bulb weighs 4.16 ounces. The standard incandescent bulb we weighed was approximately one ounce. Some lamps may not be suited for this additional weight.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>This LED bulb comes with a three-year warranty based on a usage pattern of 8 hours per day. If the bulb doesn&#39;t last that long, you can return it plus proof of purchase and your mailing address to receive a replacement bulb. You can find the manufacturer&#39;s telephone and email information online, as well as FAQs."]},"id":"b0ced8d2-3ee5-4961-aa86-64cf5265e14d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a5e928b-93fc-43b7-b49b-a1238cb4defc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This LED light bulb gives off almost as many lumens as a standard incandescent.
