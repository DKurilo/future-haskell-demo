Here are some of our favorite sub-$300 turntables without a USB output:","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-RT81-Elliptical-Counterweight-Anti-Skating/dp/B01F2EXIFM/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Fluance RT81 - $249</a><br/>This turntable has a great list of quality components and is an attractive addition to any vinyl enthusiast’s entertainment room. It comes with an Audio-Technica diamond elliptical tipped stylus attached to a replaceable headshell. The aluminum platter sits atop a high-gloss walnut cabinet with adjustable feet. The RT81 has a built-in phono preamp that allows you to plug it into speakers or a home stereo with an RCA input, and in case you plan to upgrade to an audiophile-caliber preamp, the built-in one is switchable.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT-LP3BK-Automatic-Belt-Drive-Turntable/dp/B01N6YK1GA/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Audio-Technica AT-LP3 - $249</a><br/>Our colleagues at <a href=\"https://www.whathifi.com/audio-technica/lp3/review\">What Hi-Fi</a> think this is, “One of the best automatic turntables we’ve ever heard.” It&#39;s fully automatic, so you can just place a record on the platter and press the start button, and the AT-LP3 seamlessly and safely places the needle at the beginning of the record. Once the tonearm reaches the end of the side, it automatically returns to its resting place and stops the platter. This turntable has a switchable phono preamp and comes loaded with an Audio-Technica dual moving magnet cartridge and replaceable stylus. ","<strong><br/>More Audio Conversion Guides: </strong>"]},"id":"c1ecf299-852b-4308-a5c6-f7d61e9314c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-audio-converter-software\">The Best Audio Converter Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-cassette-to-mp3-converters\">The Best Cassette to MP3 Converters</a>","<a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">The Best Audio Receivers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b81b5d7e-3b16-4521-9ab3-7db653555df6","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_49","url":"/best-vinyl-converter-turntables","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-10T00:56:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-10T00:56:00Z","name":"Best USB Turntables of 2019","synopsis":"We spent 30 hours lab testing each USB turntable’s conversion quality using the converter software included in the retail packaging.","review":{},"strapline":"We spent 30 hours lab testing each USB turntable’s conversion quality using the converter software included in the retail packaging.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-14T21:53:31Z","id":"6nd6Hs3mmbpb2c2ZjSG4gX","meta":{"title":"Best USB Turntables of 2019 -
