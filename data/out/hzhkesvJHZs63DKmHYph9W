It gets deeper into the pockets between teeth and is gentler on gums than a toothbrush. Besides dislodging plaque and food debris, a water flosser also helps to prevent periodontal infection and inflammation by flushing away bacteria responsible for gingivitis and other oral infections.","As an oral irrigator, a flosser can clean orthodontic appliances, implants and crowns without wearing them down. Water jet flossers are ideal for diabetics, as they reduce gum bleeding and combat gingivitis more effectively than other flossing solutions. Some examples of water flossers are the <a href=\"/waterpik-ultra-review\">Waterpik Ultra</a>, <a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic Oral Irrigator</a> and <a href=\"/oratec-review\">OraTec ViaJet Pro</a>.","<strong>Water Flossers: What to Look For</strong>","The best water flosser to choose depends on how much you want to spend and how you plan to use it. For example, you can&#39;t take a countertop oral irrigator with you on a trip, and a flosser attached to a faucet may not be ideal for a small bathroom. Water flossers come in different sizes and with varying feature sets, but the key features to look for when comparing them are explained below.","<strong>Tips</strong><br/>The tip or nozzle of a water jet flosser squirts out water bursts with the force required to remove plaque and leftover food particles. All flossers come with at least one standard tip. In addition to a standard floss tip, you can also find tips specially designed for cleaning the spaces around braces, crowns and implants. Besides the tips themselves, having a flosser with a swiveling head helps direct tips to hard-to-reach places and adapt to different types of dentition.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>There are three main oral irrigator designs: cordless, corded with basin and corded with faucet attachment. A cordless water flosser runs on batteries and comes as a self-contained unit that you can take on a trip. Although convenient, cordless flossers are not as powerful as corded ones and they don&#39;t hold as much water. A corded flosser with its own basin contains more water but isn&#39;t portable. A corded flosser with a faucet attachment can either be a shower water flosser or connect to a sink faucet. Such flossers need no electric power and are typically quieter than the other two types. On the other hand, they cannot generate more flossing pressure than the pressure of water flowing through faucets.","<strong>Water Pressure</strong><br/>Water flossers clean out food debris and gingivitis by blasting the spaces between teeth and gums with a jet of pressurized water. Ideally, the higher the pressure, the better the cleaning action. However, a high water pressure may damage orthodontic appliances and implants and cause gums to bleed. Therefore, being able to control a flosser&#39;s water pressure is an important feature. While some oral irrigators only have one pressure setting, some have multiple settings, and a few have a dial that allows you to finely adjust the pressure of the water coming out of their tips.","<strong>Water Reservoir</strong><br/>The water coming out of the tip of an oral irrigator comes from a reservoir. While cordless flossers have built-in water reservoirs, these are usually small and barely hold enough water for a minute-long flossing session. Corded flossers with basins are connected to bigger reservoirs. However, corded flossers attached to faucets usually have no water reservoirs since they directly draw their water supply from taps.","Compared to string flossers, water flossers are simpler to use, faster, less abrasive and more effective. They can significantly improve your oral hygiene when combined with a regular brushing regimen."]},"id":"33ee2b99-7f96-4666-af92-c2ef62b348c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"b7e72a9e-20b2-4771-b40f-fbb5d039838f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UE9SAU/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66920[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Interplak</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODVGOM/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66917[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Oral Breeze</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VQZ30K/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66919[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">OraTec</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027LSEPS/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66916[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Panasonic</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CUG270S/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66924[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Philips Sonicare HX8211/02</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QZ67OES/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66923[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Philips Sonicare HX8331/11</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUBL50/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66922[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Profloss</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQFH0JO/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66921[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ToiletTree</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFQQ0VU/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66925[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Waterpik Aquarius</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBYIUUK/?&tag=ttr_water-flossers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1801[art|NA[pi6d|66918[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Waterpik Ultra</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4dab77a0-e353-4cbb-9dbb-cee424038bfb","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1801","url":"/best-water-flossers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-06T18:28:05Z","datePublished":"2015-09-26T00:07:31Z","name":"Water Flossers Review","synopsis":"A water flosser is an oral care device that removes plaque and food particles from in-between teeth and below the gumline with pulsating jets of water.
