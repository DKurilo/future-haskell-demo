They don’t offer the multi-tiered variable life insurance policies of many of the competitors, which reduces your options with SLBI. This isn&#39;t an issue if you are looking for affordable and reputable life insurance – SBLI provides standard life insurance at fair premiums. This life insurance policy does not double as a retirement plan or investment portfolio.","SBLI’s massive learning center ensures that you’ll understand the ins and outs of comparing life insurance well before you commit to any policy. In addition to comprehensive articles and FAQs that detail every feature of their life insurance plans, SBLI provides general financial advice on everything from college savings accounts to maintaining a good credit score.","You won’t find a multitude of options at SBLI. You are limited to term, whole and children’s life insurance policies. Term insurance is as flexible as the offerings from the competition, with terms of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years available and payouts of $100,000 through $20 million.","Unlike term life insurance, SBLI’s whole life insurance policy does not expire and accumulates equity that can be leveraged. In comparison to universal life insurance policies, SBLI’s whole life insurance is inflexible in terms of premiums – your premiums never change and you are required to pay them in full to keep your coverage. Whole life insurance has the additional benefit of going untaxed so long as it is not cashed out.","Children’s life insurance from SBLI has some benefits worthy of consideration. The payouts on children’s life insurance policies aren’t extraordinarily high, but they would cover typical expenses in the event of unexpected tragedy. Additionally, children’s policies warrant consideration because the premiums are very low. By locking in a low premium for your child, you can assure that they have affordable life insurance rates for life.","SBLI has a superior customer support network in place. Claims are easy to file and policy inquiries are answered promptly via telephone or email. SBLI also makes it easy for you to find life insurance quotes online, over the phone or via email with helpful, sometimes local, agents."]},"id":"61bc0169-7d20-4a9a-b258-82b5bc437fbb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"50d9eb35-849e-470a-ba0c-c135fae2becc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SBLI provides straightforward life insurance policies that come unencumbered from dizzying contractual terms and limitations.
