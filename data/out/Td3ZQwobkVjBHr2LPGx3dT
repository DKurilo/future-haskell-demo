We installed each program on our own children’s tablets and cell phones, then used the online parent portals and companion parent apps to set basic rules and filters. We let our kids have their phones and watched what each app captured and recorded.","After we got a good feel for how the programs work, we experimented with setting time limits, enabling internet filters and blocking apps. We knew when a program worked well because we would hear groans coming from all corners of our homes as our kids were locked out of games and chat apps or as they reached their daily time limits.","We gave extra credit to programs that both monitor and block content, and we were really impressed with apps that captured screenshots of our kids’ screens, logged their keystrokes, and showed us text and chat transcripts.","<strong>FAQs</strong>","<strong>How much does smartphone parental control software cost?</strong>","Cell phone parental controls programs are subscription based, meaning you have to pay either a monthly or annual fee to continue using that program. You often must also purchase this subscription for each device you wish to monitor, though there are a few apps that will give you multiple licenses for a decent price.","You can expect to pay around $60 per year for a single user licence from a decent smartphone parental control program. There are some programs that charge over $100 per user license for a year’s access, but we’ve found many lower cost options that are easier to use and come with more than one license and more features. Our favorite is <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-parental-control-softwaremobicip-review/\">Mobicip</a>.","<strong>What’s the right age for a smartphone?</strong>","There is no age requirement when it comes to owning a smartphone, unlike social media accounts that typically require a person to be 13 or older to sign up. <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/\">Common Sense Media</a> and <a href=\"https://www.connectsafely.org/\">ConnectSafely</a> both suggest basing cell phone ownership on your child’s maturity level rather than their age.","Before giving your child their own smartphone, sit down and talk with your child about internet etiquette, privacy, security, cyberbullying, malicious websites, harmful content and time management. This is a lot of info to bombard a child with, so take your time and spread out these topics over several conversations rather than running through them like a lecture or presentation. When you child is able to understand why good smartphone habits matter on their own, it’s a good indication that you can trust them with one.","Make sure, when your child is ready for a cell phone, that you set clear rules. Be prepared to set firm rules on the things that matter most to you, but be open to negotiating rules such as how to earn more screen time. The <a href=\"https://www.connectsafely.org/family-contract-smartphone-use/\">Family Contract for Smartphone Use</a> from ConnectSafely is a good tool to help you set specific rules and responsibilities for both children and parents.","For more information and advice on deciding when to get your child a smartphone, check out <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/right-age-for-a-smartphone,review-5547.html?_ga=2.9627319.300778693.1552321027-614739746.1546559666\">When Is Your Kid Old Enough for a Smartphone?</a> from our colleagues at Tom’s Guide.","<strong>Teaching Kids About Responsible Smartphone Use</strong><br/>While setting rules is an important part of helping your child establish healthy smartphone habits before they hit adulthood, they still need to understand why these rules exist. If you can help your child find value in the guidelines you set, it’s possible they’ll want to keep a rule instead of break it.","An excellent way to explain smartphone rules to kids is to talk about how you use your smartphone. Although this may cause you to question your own smartphone habits, it can teach your child the potential advantages and hazards of smartphones. For example, you could talk about why you set time limits for yourself, why you value privacy, why you avoid certain types of online content and why you don’t text while driving. By setting an example your child wants to emulate, you become a powerful influence in developing healthy smartphone habits for your child.","For more ideas, check out this <a href=\"https://www.scholastic.com/parents/family-life/social-emotional-learning/technology-and-kids/10-tips-cell-phone-safety.html\">article on cell phone safety</a> from Scholastic.","For advice on teen apps, check out <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1538-keep-these-apps-off-teenager-phones.html\">10 Apps to Delete from Your Teenager&#39;s Phone (and 4 to Watch Closely)</a> from our colleagues at Tom’s Guide.","<strong>Official Parental Controls on iPhone: Screen Time</strong>","If your child has an iPhone, you can take advantage of its built-in Screen Time parental controls to place restrictions on apps, purchases, explicit content, Siri, privacy and other settings. Check out Apple’s support website for a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982\">brief explanation of Screen Time</a> as well as <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304\">detailed instructions on how to use it</a>. However, you may want to consider blocking your child from deleting apps, which <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ios-screen-time-hack-kid,news-28177.html\">removes the time restrictions</a> if redownloaded later.","While Screen Time may not have the comprehensive tools of some parental control apps, it might meet your needs and save you money in the long term. Screen Time is available on devices running iOS 12, which was released on September 17, 2018. The oldest iPhone model that can run iOS 12 is the iPhone 5S.","<strong>Official Parental Controls on Android: Family Link</strong>","If your child has an Android smartphone, you can use Google’s parental control app: <a href=\"https://families.google.com/familylink/\">Family Link</a>. This isn’t built in like Apple’s Screen Time, but it’s easy enough to find in the Google Play store. Family Link allows you to track your child’s smartphone usage, manage apps, limit screen time, lock devices manually or on a schedule, limit Play Store purchases and track their location.","The <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylinkhelper\">child version of Family Link</a> only runs on devices with Android 7 or later (with limited support on some devices running Android 5.1 and later), so it’s best used with newer Android smartphones. The parent version runs on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink\">Android 4.4 devices and higher</a> as well as <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-family-link/id1150085200\">iPhones</a>.","Google also has an app called Digital Wellbeing, which allows you to self-restrict app access on devices running Android 9. This app is geared towards adults tracking and managing their own screen time, but we like the potential of using this app to help older children and teens learn about healthy smartphone habits. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing\">Digital Wellbeing</a> is currently only available on Google Pixel smartphones, but will eventually roll out to other Android devices. We’ll update our article as Google adds support for additional smartphones.","Since smartphone manufacturers often use their own custom versions of Android, some devices may have different apps for parental controls, so it’s a good idea to see what your child’s smartphone has in terms of built-in tools. For example, the <a href=\"https://kidsmode.samsung.com/en/manual.do\">Samsung’s Kids Mode</a> app replaces the phone’s home screen but also allows you to set restrictions.","<strong>Official Parental Controls on Amazon Fire: FreeTime Unlimited</strong>","The <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8\">Amazon Fire HD 8</a> is one of the most affordable tablets on the market, making it a prime choice if you don’t want to buy an expensive iPad for your child. Unlike official software on Apple and Android devices, you only get access to the Amazon Parent Dashboard if you pay for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17395968011\">FreeTime Unlimited</a>, Amazon’s child-oriented subscription service.","A single-child FreeTime Unlimited subscription is $2.99 a month for Prime members and $4.99 a month for everyone else. There’s also a family subscription option, which covers up to four children for $6.99 a month with Prime and $9.99 a month without.","FreeTime Unlimited has common parental control features, including time limits, web content filters, and app restrictions. However, it also has a few unique features such as an extensive library of kid-friendly books, videos, games, audiobooks, apps, and educational content. In addition, FreeTime Unlimited works on <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/amazon-echo-freetime-setup,review-5399.html\">Amazon Echo</a> and Kindle devices. Despite its primary focus on Amazon devices, FreeTime Unlimited also works with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.tahoe&amp;hl=en_US\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-freetime-unlimited/id1324809509?mt=8\">Apple</a> devices.","<strong>Parental Controls from Wireless Carriers</strong>","The wealth of smartphone parental controls also extends to your <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\">cell phone provider</a>. Unlike the free official controls for iPhones and Android devices, you’ll need to pay a monthly subscription for similar parental controls through a wireless carrier. The costs are comparable to those of dedicated smartphone monitoring apps we’ve reviewed. These services focus on location tracking and alerts, though they also allow you to set limits and filter content on your child’s device.","These are the current parental control offerings from the four largest U.S. cell phone providers:"]},"id":"1a0939d7-4e88-4f50-9a39-d52e7f4963be","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/verizon-smart-family/\">Verizon Smart Family</a>  <em>(starts at $4.99/month depending on the features you choose)</em>","<a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/t-mobile-family-mode\">T-Mobile FamilyMode</a>  <em>(starts at $10/month depending on the features you choose)</em>","<a href=\"https://www.att.com/features/secure-family-app.html\">AT&amp;T Secure Family</a>  <em>($7.99/month)</em>","<a href=\"https://safeandfound.sprint.com/\">Sprint Safe and Found</a>  <em>($6.99/month)</em>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"ec64b321-65bb-422a-afed-b0503192bbd4","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What to Expect from Smartphone Parental Control Apps</strong>","<strong>When Is Smartphone Monitoring Legal?</strong><br/>Smartphone parental control apps are typically legal to use on your kid’s phone, but only if your child is a minor and you are the person legally responsible for the device. You may be required to tell your child that you are monitoring their device, depending on where you live. However, even if you aren&#39;t, it may be a good idea to tell older children and teens about monitoring apps on their phones and explain why it’s important to you and why it should matter to them.","If you need legal advice before using parental control apps on your kids&#39; phones, you should contact an attorney or legal counsel. Because wiretap laws vary by state, we do not advocate using smartphone parental apps to record phone calls, either audio or video.","<strong>Activity Tracking</strong><br/>Look for apps with clear-cut reports that make it easy to track relevant information. We especially liked the colorful reports in Qustodio. Most programs let you choose from a variety of reports, including monthly or hourly reports with graphs, lists of frequent contacts, browser history, newly installed apps, message history, calendar events, pictures taken, GPS location and keystrokes.","<strong>Time Limits</strong><br/>Time limit settings, like those in Qustodio and Net Nanny, are among the most beneficial features, as they help kids focus on schoolwork free of smartphone distractions. You can set a window of time when your child can access apps and the browser and adjust it whenever needed. Some of the apps we tested allow you to remotely unlock the phone for a few minutes of open access if your child requests it.","<strong>App &amp; Web Restrictions</strong><br/>It&#39;s essential that the parental control smartphone app you choose lets you restrict access to other apps and the internet. Look for one that allows you to flag or block certain apps, websites and contacts – for example, Net Nanny or Qustodio. This feature helps you protect your children from undesirable people and inappropriate content. You can even restrict web searches and set the app to notify you if your child discusses inappropriate things via text or chat.","<strong>Remote Device Control</strong><br/>Most smartphone parental control apps have tools that let you remotely lock your child&#39;s phone, backup important data and even remotely wipe the phone if necessary. Some of the apps we reviewed, including Qustodio and WebWatcher, run invisibly on the target device, while others, such as Net Nanny, are visible no matter what. Choosing an invisible app can make it more difficult for your child to bypass the restrictions on their phone.","<strong>Viewing Deleted Content</strong><br/>Some smartphone parental control apps, including Mobistealth and WebWatcher, let you view deleted material such as texts, emails, chats, media, browser history and web activity viewed in an incognito window, along with how often your child accessed content on a given smartphone. This feature isn’t a necessity, but it may be useful depending on your situation.","<strong>Device Compatibility</strong><br/>Though these apps support most common smartphones and carriers, not all are compatible. It&#39;s important that you double-check the brand and model of the phone you want to monitor so you don&#39;t waste money on incompatible software. Most developers have extensive lists of compatible devices on their websites.","Each of the apps in our comparison works on Android and iOS devices. Features are generally more limited on iOS than Android because Apple maintains strict control over the operating system. You need to have physical access to the target device to install the software, as none of them can be installed remotely.","Some features require a rooted Android or jailbroken iOS device. Jailbreaking or rooting your device to install unauthorized software or applications on your smartphone is generally considered a bad idea because it opens the door for malware and “bricking” your phone, making it unusable. Because of the inherent risks that come with either of these processes, we do not advocate doing so. Of the apps we reviewed, only Mobistealth, XNSPY and TheOneSpy have features that require a rooted Android device.","<em><strong>Contributing Reviewer:</strong> John Carlsen</em>"]},"id":"af2b5948-0bcf-4e97-ae87-342ad4b75a9c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0a76a697-d2c8-4bbc-bf2f-cc59dc1e8fe6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7874&awinaffid=103504&clickref=CellphoneParentalControl&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qustodio.com%2Fen%2Ffamily%2Fpremium%2F\">Qustodio</a>","<a href=\"https://www.mobicip.com/pricing\">Mobicip</a>","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/surfie-parent/id997309073?mt=8&afftrack=TTRParentalControlSW\">Surfie</a>","<a href=\"https://www.theonespy.com/android-spy-software/\">TheOneSpy</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8900250-12205320?sid=TTRParentalControlSW&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.norton.com%2Fps%3F%26ctry%3DUS%26lang%3DEN%26selSKU%3D21127900%26ptype%3Dcart%26tppc%3DPL_100%26trf_id%3Dnortoncom%26inid%3Dhho_nortoncom_store_norton-family-premier_pdpage&cjsku=norton-family-premier-1year-US-en-cart\">Norton Family</a>","<a href=\"http://www.mobistealth.com/products.php\">Mobistealth</a>","<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Cty0dj6o3sg&offerid=225718.10000068&type=3&subid=CellPhoneParentalControl\">WebWatcher</a>","<a href=\"http://xnspy.com/android-spy.html\">XNSPY</a>","<a href=\"http://kidlogger.net/features.html\">Kidlogger</a>","<a href=\"https://www.netnanny.com/mobile/?pid=602-cellphoneparentalcontrol\">Net Nanny</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e80a62d2-bc41-45d9-a2d1-3a2fe37dd5b5","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_809","url":"/best-cell-phone-parental-control-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-24T21:03:20Z","datePublished":"2017-06-15T22:04:13Z","name":"Best Cell Phone Parental Control Software","synopsis":"Cell phone monitoring and parental control software lets you keep track of your kids’ online activities on their smartphones so you can keep them safe and help them learn smart technology practices.","review":{},"strapline":"Cell phone monitoring and parental control software lets you keep track of your kids’ online activities on their smartphones so you can keep them safe and help them learn smart technology practices.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-20T00:00:00Z","id":"Td3ZQwobkVjBHr2LPGx3dT","meta":{"title":"Best Cell Phone Parental Control Apps 2019 -
