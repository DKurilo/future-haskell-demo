The faster you drive, the more sensitive the detector is to radar. This means you get fewer alerts when you&#39;re driving slowly through a city.","The GPS has an auto-learn feature that helps minimize false alerts. With most GPS radar detectors, you must manually lockout a false alert by marking the location. The RedLine EX&#39;s GPS does this for you. It records the GPS coordinates for every alert you receive. When you receive alerts in the same location multiple times, it automatically mutes the alarm.
