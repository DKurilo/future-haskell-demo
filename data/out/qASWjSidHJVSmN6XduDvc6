You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The <strong>Chicco KeyFit </strong>is the original version of Chicco&#39;s award-winning KeyFit <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a>. It is smaller than the other baby travel systems in our lineup, holding babies between 4 and 22 pounds up to 30 inches long. This small range is ideal for premature babies, but it can mean that you&#39;ll need to purchase a new car seat before your child reaches his first birthday.","However, besides being small, this car seat still has almost all of the safety features you need in a baby travel system. A stay-in-car base is included, and to secure the base into the car, the seat is equipped with the federally regulated LATCH system. We think the Chicco LATCH system with its one-click design is even easier to install than competitors&#39; car seats are. The LATCH connector looks just like a little seatbelt buckle that clicks onto the car&#39;s LATCH component. When connected, level indicators will show whether the seat is at the right angle.","Side-impact protection is essential in a car seat. Many companies simply worry about a frontal impact when designing baby products, but most car accidents with injured children are side collisions. This KeyFit has energy-absorbent foam encasing the back and sides of the baby car seat. The foam distributes excess energy created by the collision away from your child.","The adjustable harness holds your child at five different points on the body, protecting and distributing for an even fit. The harness should match up with your child&#39;s shoulders and hips and fit comfortably between her legs. The five-point design includes a harness buckle and chest clip, both of which can be adjusted using the center-pull adjustment strap. The center-pull strap is located on the bottom front of the car seat. Push the red button while simultaneously pulling the strap to loosen the harness. To tighten, pull the adjustment strap until the harness fits snuggly around your baby.","Installation instructions come with the car seat&#39;s packaging, but you can also watch a video that shows you how to install the KeyFit on its online product page. For those visual learners out there, this instructional video is your ticket to installing this baby car seat correctly.<br/>The KeyFit is compatible with Chicco&#39;s line of strollers and has an adjustable handle for easy transport. You can even strip the covering off the car seat and throw it in the washing machine to clean up any messes.","To add to your child&#39;s comfort while in the car seat, Chicco has designed this seat to recline, and it has a canopy that you can pull down to cover your baby. Because this baby car seat is meant for smaller children, a headrest is included that can secure your infant&#39;s head. As the child grows, this headrest can be removed. A cold weather boot is not included.","Chicco is excellent in the help and support category. The company has a well-laid-out website with detailed product information, a customer-support phone number and an online form to submit questions by email. A one-year warranty is also included."]},"id":"8c815878-2a68-46ca-97c2-6b9a85f0f3bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3e79f579-760e-4495-b6f0-bb5872069c21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Chicco KeyFit</strong> may be smaller than the other car seats on our lineup, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t a good product.
