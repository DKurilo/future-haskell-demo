You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","In addition to making excellent electronics, Samsung makes excellent dishwashers, and the Samsung DMT800RHS is no exception. As the quietest <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> in its class, and featuring Samsung&#39;s StormWash technology, this dishwasher is designed to clean your dishes quietly and effectively. With the StormWash technology, you won&#39;t have to waste time pre-rinsing or pre-washing your dishes to ensure they are clean when they come out of the dishwasher. The StormWash uses powerful spray jets at multiple angles to clean and sanitize your dishes.","As the quietest Samsung dishwasher in its class with just a 49-decibel (dBA) rating, you won&#39;t have to worry about waiting for the perfect time to run this dishwasher. The low sound level is due to the dishwasher&#39;s six-layer door and advanced motor sound system. You will be able run it at any time, and you may not even know that it&#39;s running.","The Samsung DMT800RHS comes equipped with a plethora of features, including the following cycle options:  normal, heavy, delicate, pots and pans, quick and  smart auto cycle. We are most impressed with the smart auto cycle option this dishwasher has because when selected, it will automatically detect the level of soil on the dishes you have placed in the dishwasher and will run the cycle that fits best. Additionally, this dishwasher has delay start, sanitize, half load and StormWash options that you can select along with each cycle.","Some additional impressive features that this Samsung dishwasher boasts are the cancel and drain ability and the high temperature option. If you are running a cycle and need to cancel it, all you have to do is hold down the heavy and delicate cycle buttons together for three seconds and the dishwasher will cancel the cycle and drain the water. This will allow you to add dishes and restart the cycle from the beginning.","For a dishwasher that excels in so many areas, we were disappointed to see that it doesn&#39;t have a rinse-only cycle. Furthermore, this dishwasher doesn&#39;t have an air-dry option, which many dishwashers are beginning to include as they begin to become even more eco-friendly.","This Samsung dishwasher comes backed with lengthy warranties overall. The labor and parts both feature the standard one-year warranty that the majority of dishwashers come with. Additionally, the racks and electronics of the dishwasher feature a five-year warranty. A lifetime warranty kicks in on the tub and door liner, making this dishwasher backed very well by Samsung.","Samsung is known for making sleek and sharp looking products, and it&#39;s the same story with this dishwasher. This unit comes in three different color options: stainless steel, black and the standard white. The controls are touch sensitive and are hidden on top of the door, giving the dishwasher its sleek look. The front of the dishwasher features an easy-to-grab handle and a small screen, which shows the progress of a cycle when it&#39;s running.","Getting a hold of Samsung for help and support is extremely simple by either phone, email, live chat or even social media. We were especially pleased by the service we received via live chat, as we spoke to representatives who were very prompt to reply and answered all of our many questions professionally and efficiently. In addition to contacting Samsung for help and support, you are also able to easily access the product user manual, frequently asked questions and tutorials on the manufacturer&#39;s website."]},"id":"85249386-1cb6-4e93-b824-84acbc789830","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d2247aa3-e156-4755-8f6c-52f5d830261a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung DMT800RHS ranks among the top-rated dishwashers.
