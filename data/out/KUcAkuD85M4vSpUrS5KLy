You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Triumph, an <a href=\"/best-audio-editing-software\">audio editor</a> formerly known as Wave Editor, has received a massive face-lift and rebrand. Audiofile, the creator of this Mac audio editor, made such massive changes to the previous audio editor that it has become a whole new program.","The new audio interface is clean upon opening. All of your projects are broken up into workspaces that you manage like tabs you would find in your internet browser. The interface is broken up into a few main areas: the wave editor, the sidebar, the layer list and the assets list. Each section is there to help you keep all of your edits organized. It takes some getting used to, and you&#39;ll need to keep the user manual handy at first, but Triumph does a good job at keeping your workspace clean and uncluttered.","The first noticeable difference between this audio editing software for Mac and others, like <a href=\"/wavepad-review\">WavePad</a>, is that when you edit pieces of your wavelength, the software breaks your audio into layers. These layers don&#39;t work like a multi-track recording does. When you are working on a single piece of audio, you can break it into layers and change sample rates to certain layers or reorder layers, all of which remain editable until you render and export. When you are done, you can merge all the layers to become one singular file.","We were able to import all of the audio formats that we tested for except WMA file formats. This isn&#39;t surprising, considering WMA is a Windows media audio file. This audio software for Mac was also able to extract the audio from four out of the seven video files we tested for, including MOV, MP4, MPG and M4V. It was not able to extract the audio data from DIVX, DV or WMV video files during our tests.","This sound editing software for Mac uses an iZotope restoration plugin to remove unwanted hiss and hum from your audio recordings. In our experience, Triumph removed most of the hum from our audio recording, but there was still some noticeably present.","Triumph is strictly an audio editor, not a place to record audio. We were unable to record using a line-in source such as a microphone or multi-track record. This is a big issue if you are looking for an audio editor to record your podcasts or other audio projects so you can edit them in the same program.","Triumph takes some time to adapt to. Some really great ideas are integrated into this new interface, but following along with the user manual while you use the software is recommended. You can&#39;t record audio using this audio editor for Mac, but many of the tools to edit audio are useful and unique."]},"id":"32951d67-e931-4ad0-ae43-cc73edcf12f6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69328","url":"/triumph-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-23T14:25:51Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T14:25:51Z","name":"Triumph","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":19,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-05-23T14:25:51Z","id":"KUcAkuD85M4vSpUrS5KLy","meta":{"title":"Triumph Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read on to find out how Triumph stacks up against other Mac audio editors."},"products":[{"slug":"triumph","url":"/product/triumph","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","name":"Triumph","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","id":"dq3EA3mmThiZfteYrzLrnn","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ye8X27n3HqifEJtyWokTmi.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"69294-triumph-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/69294-triumph-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","id":"ye8X27n3HqifEJtyWokTmi","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ye8X27n3HqifEJtyWokTmi.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Triumph Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read on to find out how Triumph stacks up against other Mac audio editors."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ye8X27n3HqifEJtyWokTmi.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"69294-triumph-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/69294-triumph-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","id":"ye8X27n3HqifEJtyWokTmi","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ye8X27n3HqifEJtyWokTmi.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Triumph Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read on to find out how Triumph stacks up against other Mac audio editors."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/triumph-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"audio-production","url":"/hobbies/audio-production","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","name":"Audio Production","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:57:32Z","id":"JakJdN7Gfzy3SwVYuaDJCJ","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
