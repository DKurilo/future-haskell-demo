Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/best-home-computers\">Home Computer</a> here.</em>","The Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 is a decent home computer with a fast processor, DDR4 RAM and more USB ports than you may ever need. However, it doesn’t have much storage, and it only has a small amount of memory, so it may leave you hanging.","This particular home computer has an impressively powerful CPU, a sixth-generation Intel i5-6500, which is one of the best in our review. Its speed clocks in at a neck-breaking 3.6GHz. You can also watch videos or view photos on your computer thanks to the integrated graphics card and multiple audio outputs.","If you know you want to store a lot of files on your PC computer, this machine isn’t your best bet. It only has 500GB of storage, which is small compared to the 1TB and 2TB hard drives the best home computers come with.","The ThinkCentre has only 4GB of memory, but it counteracts this somewhat with its DDR4 RAM. Systems with DDR4 RAM are more efficient and stable than those with DDR3 options. However, if you regularly multitask online or off – watching streamed videos, visiting content-heavy sites, having multiple programs open or switching frequently between programs or webpages – you may want to consider upgrading the memory or choosing a different unit altogether.","With four USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports and four SATA 3.0 ports, the ThinkCentre M900 is a good choice if you have a lot of external devices to connect to your machine. It has both DisplayPort and VGA ports to plug in monitors, as well as an HDMI connection. With built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, you can connect to the internet and other devices without cord clutter.","The tower measures 15.98 inches tall, 6.89 inches wide and 16.26 inches deep, and it comes stock with Windows 10. If you purchase it from the manufacturer, you have the option to upgrade a wide variety of standard components – like the processor, memory, peripherals and drives – ensuring you end up with the right system for your needs.","Lenovo’s customer service received a B-minus score in an undercover test performed by our sister site Laptop Mag that examined its efficiency and effectiveness. The test revealed that the company has decent informational resources on its website and fairly acceptable wait times for live reps. If you need to contact its technical support team directly, you can do so via phone, email or live chat. The desktop PC includes a one-year warranty, though Lenovo gives you the option to extend it up to five years – the longest any manufacturer on our lineup allows."]},"id":"2c0ddb46-30cd-46e1-9461-ae88a3ccfc56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"25c1f05d-2fb5-4524-9382-054b81e0aab2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 isn’t the best option for heavy users or those needing to regularly store lots of files.
