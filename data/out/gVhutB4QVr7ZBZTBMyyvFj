The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">Home Subwoofers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The MartinLogan Dynamo is one of the few 10-inch woofers that holds its own among the best home theater subwoofers in our review.  The 10-inch model is affordable, yet still packs enough power to push the bass in your entertainment room. The 15-inch and 12-inch models from MartinLogan are pricey and we don’t recommend getting an 8-inch subwoofer if you desire powerful and deep bass.","This 10-inch subwoofer’s low frequency response is 29Hz. The low-frequency response of 10-inch woofers usually ranges between 25Hz and 30Hz, which isn’t as low as a 12-inch woofer can achieve. The lower the frequency response, the deeper the bass tones the subwoofer can handle.","What sets this subwoofer apart from others we reviewed is its balanced versatility. Whether you are watching your favorite action movie or listening to music, this subwoofer delivers punchy, clean bass tones on both fronts. Music rarely has tones that go below 20Hz, while many movies do. The 200Hz high-frequency response of this subwoofer gives it a wide enough range of frequency to deliver low musical tones that are clean and not muddled by too much bass. While the low-frequency response of 29Hz isn’t as low as other subwoofers we reviewed, it still highlights the desired low-end bass tones found in many movies.","When it comes to small subwoofers, there really isn’t an ideal placement for the woofer and port on the body of the woofer. The Dynamo 500 is a front-firing woofer with a rear-firing port. The rear-firing port is something to take into consideration. The port allows the woofer to “breathe,” which means you shouldn’t place it directly against or touching a wall. If you place the port side directly against a wall, it will block the passage of air and your subwoofer will not respond to low-end frequencies like it should.","Compared to other manufacturers in our subwoofer reviews, MartinLogan delivers excellent customer service. The company offers a 3-year warranty on all parts of the subwoofer hardware. If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact MartinLogan via phone or email."]},"id":"24fb19a2-85bc-46dd-84ab-b24f52f060d3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"76dce035-9771-4463-85c3-692ced16cf3f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you use your home entertainment center for more than just watching movies, this subwoofer is a smart choice.
