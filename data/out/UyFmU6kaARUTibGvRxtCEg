You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This is a solidly built <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">wine cooler</a> that can hold up to 33 standard-size wine bottles. The NewAir AWC - 330E’s compressor cooling system can reach exceptionally low temperatures, making it especially suitable for cooling white wine and sparkling wine. It is also a good wine fridge for those who desire to purchase three coolers and have one set to red, another to white and the last for sparkling wines.  And it is designed to be able to accommodate odd-shaped bottles of all kinds. For a more compact unit, consider the <a href=\"/spt-review\">Sunpentown (SPT) WC-20TL</a>.","This wine refrigerator can be set to cool from 39 to 64 F, making it capable of ideally cooling all types of wine. Even though this is a single-zone cooler, that does not mean you cannot store most reds and white in one unit. Most coolers vary temperatures by shelf and in most cases are cooler at the bottom. You will need to experiment with this unit, but you likely can put your reds toward the top and your whites at the bottom to reach serving temperatures ranging from about 55 to 64 F. You will just need to use your digital thermometer to test the regions to learn where to put certain types of wines.","The NewAir AWC - 330E can hold up to 33 standard bottles. However, it can also hold a variety of odd-shaped bottles. If you pull a shelf out and flip it over, it can hold larger-circumference bottles. Its depth is nearly 20 inches, so it can also accommodate unusually tall bottles. The bottom includes a bin for odd-shaped bottles or (don’t worry, we won’t tell) small-to-medium boxed wines. It is an excellent choice if you often entertain with champagnes or sparkling wines, since it can cool lower than most.","This wine fridge is black inside and out with stainless-steel door trim. Inside are modern blue LED lights. The door is reversible to accommodate wherever you may choose to place it. The unit does include a lock that would be a deterrent to small children, but it could easily be bypassed by a teen or adult. As with most freestanding coolers, this wine chiller needs adequate ventilation to work properly."]},"id":"be83de43-332c-40d8-b0f2-2c3c8e663e49","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"25754ada-1eb5-4583-8ddd-6d7b73e53ee7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The NewAir AWC - 330E is one the best single-zone wine coolers we have reviewed.
