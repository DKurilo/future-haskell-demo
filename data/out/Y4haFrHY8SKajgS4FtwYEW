There&#39;s enough security to worry about when processing plastic credit card transactions, and mobile phone payments add a whole new dimension of security to be concerned about, so get up to speed.","If you&#39;re new to the concept of mobile <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a>, here&#39;s the skinny. On the merchant side, there are a number of companies that offer you the ability to accept card payments via your mobile phone or other mobile device, such as an iPad or Android tablet. Companies such as Intuit and Square provide both a small card reader that plugs directly into your phone or device. To process a payment, you simply swipe the card through the reader. This eliminates the need for a traditional credit-card-reading terminal.","On the consumer side, technologies from Google and Isis, which was jointly developed by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon, are allowing consumers to use their smartphones to make payments. The concept of a so-called virtual wallet eliminates plastic cards altogether and puts payments in the hands of any mobile device that&#39;s equipped with a near-field communications chip. Consumers can simply wave their phones to pay. Both Google and Isis are testing this technology now and will continue to do so into early 2012.","So where does mobile credit card processing security come in? The primary concern is that consumers&#39; information cannot be breached during any type of mobile transaction. In particular, processors are concerned that processing transmissions could be intercepted, thereby making private financial information available to would-be thieves. In addition, some consumer groups are concerned that virtual wallets could leave consumers open to fraud if their phones are stolen or if they accidently upload a virus that corrupts their payment information.","For the moment, it&#39;s likely that cyber criminals are more concerned with obtaining batches of credit card numbers rather than single numbers here and there. Additionally, the technologies are moving so quickly that it may be some time before hackers can develop quick and easy ways to break into mobile card transactions. Moreover, there&#39;s sure to be a long learning curve for both merchants using mobile card readers and consumers adopting virtual wallets when they become widely available.","Still, safety concerns go hand-in-hand with all technological development. In August 2011, Square released a new version of its mobile card reader that uses encryption to safeguard transactions details. Meanwhile, the Intuit GoPayment card reader uses secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. This type of encryption is nearly impenetrable, experts say. In both cases, there&#39;s security for merchants because card information is not stored in their phones and security for consumers because they can see the swipe happen right in front of them.","As for virtual wallet security, service providers will allow you to load credit, debit and loyalty cards onto your phone and then encrypt that information. In some cases, a PIN will be required for payment, and the mobile phone will need to be held by the user and waved near a reader. This combination of encryption, a PIN number and the phone never leaving the consumer&#39;s hands is expected to add up to a full security system, according to those currently testing virtual wallets in the field."]},"id":"ee10d974-1ec8-414d-a655-c94434bc6feb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7258","url":"/how-your-information-stays-secure-with-mobile-card-processing","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-10T14:04:58Z","datePublished":"2012-05-10T14:04:58Z","name":"How Your Information Stays Secure With Mobile Card Processing","synopsis":"With virtual payment systems developing quickly, merchants and consumers alike are rightly asking how mobile credit card processing works and how safe it is.","review":{},"strapline":"With virtual payment systems developing quickly, merchants and consumers alike are rightly asking how mobile credit card processing works and how safe it is.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-05-31T17:10:09Z","id":"Y4haFrHY8SKajgS4FtwYEW","meta":{"title":"How Your Information Stays Secure With Mobile Card Processing","description":"Whether you&#039;re accepting a customer&#039;s payment or paying for something yourself, you should know the ins and outs of mobile card processing security."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:49:25Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/MeB3WYEYFqmKTv2WJKApwG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:49:25Z","mimeType":"","name":"7258-how-your-information-stays-secure-with-mobile-card-processing.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/7258-how-your-information-stays-secure-with-mobile-card-processing.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:49:25Z","id":"MeB3WYEYFqmKTv2WJKApwG","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MeB3WYEYFqmKTv2WJKApwG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"How Your Information Stays Secure With Mobile Card Processing","description":"Whether you&#039;re accepting a customer&#039;s payment or paying for something yourself, you should know the ins and outs of mobile card processing security."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/MeB3WYEYFqmKTv2WJKApwG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:49:25Z","mimeType":"","name":"7258-how-your-information-stays-secure-with-mobile-card-processing.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/7258-how-your-information-stays-secure-with-mobile-card-processing.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:49:25Z","id":"MeB3WYEYFqmKTv2WJKApwG","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MeB3WYEYFqmKTv2WJKApwG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"How Your Information Stays Secure With Mobile Card Processing","description":"Whether you&#039;re accepting a customer&#039;s payment or paying for something yourself, you should know the ins and outs of mobile card processing security."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/how-your-information-stays-secure-with-mobile-card-processing","label":"","tags":[]}
