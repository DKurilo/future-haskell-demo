It&#39;s not surprising the Avanti W798SS ranked second in our <a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">portable washing machine</a> lineup and won the Top Ten Reviews Gold Award.","This portable washer&#39;s sparkling stainless steel tub spins at three different speeds, maxing at 700 rotations per minute. You can be a little bit less careful when loading your clothing in the Avanti W798SS, as the tub features a bottom pulsator instead of an agitator. Having no agitator ensures clothes won&#39;t tangle, and more of them will fit – up to 1.76 cubic feet or 12 pounds in this machine. A disk in the bottom of the tub pulsates so clothes can move freely through the tub to wash and rinse thoroughly.  Pulsating washing machines are more popular throughout Europe and Asia than in the United States."]},"id":"4515f07d-0f29-4507-90b9-ab17eec62120","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Portability"},"id":"58835c85-65d7-41fb-8c17-6510d659ca0a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This portable washing machine has four water level settings, which allows you to save water and money by matching your load size to the suitable water level. By utilizing this function, you will be friendly to the environment in wasting less water. Your wallet will appreciate the smaller utility bills, too.","When you need to heft this 77-pound washer up or down stairs, built-in cabinet handles alleviate any strain. Two handles also create the option of making carrying the washer a two-person job. Once you have the washer where you want it, you can install the four included casters to the rustproof base. With these wheels installed, you can easily roll your portable washer over carpet and tile, from room to room.","The Avanti W798SS is the perfect size to be stored in an out-of-the-way corner or closet. However, it&#39;s endearingly miniature dimensions are also appealing to children. Avanti considered this risk in the design of the W798SS. If the lid of the portable washing machine is lifted at any time during operation, and you have turned on the children-proof setting, an alert will sound. If the lid is not closed in 10 seconds, the alarm will proceed and the water will drain. If you do not select this function, the washer continues to run with the lid open for seven seconds. After the lid is open longer than seven seconds, the washer stops but does not drain. The cycle continues once the lid is closed."]},"id":"e7cfff51-e268-456c-aecd-4b9e838af670","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Cycles &amp; Wash Settings"},"id":"6a51a409-94f5-4c8b-aedb-9503a79cbb16","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This portable washing machine has style. It is the only washer in our lineup to come in a color other than white. The sleek Platinum body of the W798SS is lustrous, almost futuristic. It is slightly reminiscent of a tiny, adorable space robot with an affinity for eating dirty socks and spitting them out clean.","While installing the machine&#39;s casters for optimum mobility, don&#39;t forget to install the included sound-muffling plate. Simply slide it into the slot at the base of the washer and fasten it in with two screws, also included. The result is a hard-working yet quiet washer. If you&#39;re already using your washer in a small space, it&#39;s nice not to hear it running in the next room. The majority of Avanti users commended the quiet operation of this portable washing machine.","This compact washer operates best when it&#39;s on a level surface. If the surface you have is less than level, don&#39;t worry. The machine has a leveling foot to help you keep it from rocking around. Keeping the machine level also prevents excess noise by preventing unbalanced loads."]},"id":"19737460-45bc-46e7-92c0-18cdbbacc849","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use Features"},"id":"87c828c1-a556-4144-aad4-05cd8157e3fb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We can tell Avanti is confident in their portable washing machine, because they offer solid warranties on parts.

If Avanti trusts their parts that much, we do too.","We are not the only ones pleased with this portable washer. In addition to our findings, we noted that this unit has stellar user reviews.
