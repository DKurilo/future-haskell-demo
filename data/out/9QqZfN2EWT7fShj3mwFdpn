The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">Aunt Farms</a> here.</em>","When it comes to making educational toys, Uncle Milton is an industry veteran known for the play and instructional value of its products, including its popular ant farms. The company&#39;s Giant Ant Farm is an example of the firm at its best. This ant habitat offers a sizeable viewing area so kids can observe the ants hard at work, dividing tasks, moving about, creating tunnels and maintaining their environment. The Uncle Milton Giant Ant Farm is a classic sand-filled enclosure that, unlike the gel-type habitats, requires children to take care of the ants by feeding them and giving them water. It comes with a fact-filled manual so the children can learn more about ants and their habits, and the company also provides additional information on its website for youngsters who want to learn more. You do not get all the ant farm tools on the market with this kit, but there are additional items you can buy if you choose.","Perhaps the most enlightening educational material for this ant habitat is in the manual you get with the kit. The company’s website also provides a frequently asked questions section that is full of ant facts.You get instructions for your kit and an ant tunnel tool that you will need to make those first tunnels. This is useful to help the ants get started on tunnel digging when they are initially placed in the ant habitat. In addition, you get a water dropper to moisten the sand. You also can reuse this ant farm by getting refill sand and extra ants from the company once your original colony dies off, which it will. This eco-friendly device can be cleaned out and used again, either with ants from this manufacturer or from other sources – including the great outdoors if you want to catch your own.","One drawback is that you do not get such things as a magnifying glass, specimen chart or display tray with the kit, which all would add to its educational value. Uncle Milton’s Toys offers a number of extra accessories that are quite helpful, but you must pay extra to get them. These would include such things as a magnifying glass, ant water tray, anatomy poster, feeding schedule and more. However, these are not sold as separate items. They come in packages that include a vial of live ants, so presumably most consumers would buy these things only when they need to repopulate the colony. That is unfortunate since many young first-time ant farmers would no doubt be enthralled with the extra tools and it would add more educational value and play value to the habitat.","Uncle Milton’s Toys is one of the very few companies that sell ants directly rather than simply linking customers with third-party online stores. The cost of the harvester ants is included in the purchase price of the Uncle Milton Giant Ant Farm and you get a mail-in certificate to claim your ants. There will be times when ants cannot be shipped due to bad weather, and even when the temperatures are ideal, the company’s website said that you will always have to wait a bit before getting your ants. The delay in getting ants is true for many ant farm companies. If your ants all arrive dead, you can get free replacement ants. You also can capture ants from the outdoors and use those in your colony. However, Uncle Milton’s website cautions you to not mix ant species or colonies because they just don’t get along. If for some reason you want ants from another online store, you can certainly buy them elsewhere. However, that makes little sense since you can get ants with your purchase price from Uncle Milton’s Toys.","Speaking of ants, when your ants die – and eventually all the ants in the colony will expire – you can buy vials of replacement ants from Uncle Milton’s website. You also can purchase refill sand, which means you can reuse and repopulate your ant farm as often as you want. If you find your own ants in nature, you may be lucky and get a queen ant and some males, which would mean the ants could then reproduce so children could see the entire life cycle. U.S. federal law forbids shipping queen ants across state lines because that could upset the ecosystem in another part of the country. In addition, male ants exist simply to mate and then they die off. If you capture them in the wild, so to speak, they would be indigenous to your area and could lay eggs that will eventually produce more live ants. The ants that you buy for an ant farm, are typically all female harvester ants, which are sterile worker ants.","This ant farm is 10 inches high, 15 inches wide and 2.5 inches deep. It weighs 2 pounds.","Uncle Milton’s Toys offers some useful information on its website, including a frequently asked questions section. You also get email and phone support.","This product offers plenty of play value and educational value for youngsters and can be put to good use in classrooms and at home. This is one of the best ant farms offered by Uncle Milton&#39;s Toys and you and your child will no doubt enjoy hours of fun as you put it together and observe the ants."]},"id":"3344d90a-359a-471e-9ce5-a4d835a384aa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55333","url":"/uncle-milton-giant-ant-farm-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-07T15:23:01Z","datePublished":"2012-11-07T15:23:01Z","name":"Uncle Milton Giant Ant Farm","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
