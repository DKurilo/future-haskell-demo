It determines how the keyboard interacts with your computer and whether you can connect other peripherals to the keyboard rather than to the computer.","<strong>RF or Bluetooth</strong><br/>Most wireless desktop keyboards connect to your computer via 2.4GHz radio frequency. You simply take a tiny USB dongle and plug it into an available USB port on your desktop. These plug-and-play keyboards are easy to set up and generally have better battery life than Bluetooth keyboards, with the exception of Bluetooth 4.1 low-energy standard.","Yes, RF wireless keyboards take up an extra USB port and can be subject to interference, but they perform well and come at a reasonable price. In addition, they usually have secure 128-bit encryption to ensure your keystrokes can&#39;t be read. Some models, like those in the Logitech Wireless Desktop and Logitech Illuminate lines boast compatibility with Unifying technology. This lets you connect up to six wireless devices on a single Unifying receiver – you plug in the single tiny dongle receiver and can then use a keyboard, mouse, headset and three other wireless peripherals without plugging in additional dongles. Keyboards that use 2.4GHz wireless technology are compatible with more computers than Bluetooth keyboards.","New Bluetooth keyboards may not be backward compatible with some older systems. Even if the old computer has some form of Bluetooth support, it may not support newer Bluetooth standards, so it&#39;s important that you check compatibility before purchasing a Bluetooth keyboard. These models aren&#39;t plug and play. Instead, you have to go through a number of steps to successfully pair your keyboard with your computer. While it&#39;s a reasonably simple process, it&#39;s not quite as easy setting up an RF keyboard, and it&#39;s a more involved than pairing a Bluetooth device to your cell phone.","Bluetooth keyboards are often more compact than RF models, making them portable. Additionally, Bluetooth models are popular with those who want to connect their keyboards to a range of devices, including tablets, game consoles and even cell phones.","<strong>USB Pass-Throughs</strong><br/>USB pass-throughs are USB ports on the keyboard, much like those found on your computer. You can use these pass-through connectors to connect USB peripherals like flash drives, headsets and a wired mouse. While it typically isn’t a deal breaker if a computer doesn’t have pass-throughs, they keep your desk clear, and you don’t have to use an external USB hub.","<strong>AV Ports</strong><br/>Some keyboards have headset or headphone and microphone ports. When you hook your headset to your keyboard rather than your PC, you have more reach and the peripherals are easier to maneuver, since your keyboard is closer to your body than your computer tower."]},"id":"abd69cc8-56b1-400a-a9c8-12ef6331a29e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/pCovvTcmbBnzZqfR6vjNZj.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/prod/large/68406-logitech-illuminated-box.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pCovvTcmbBnzZqfR6vjNZj.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"pCovvTcmbBnzZqfR6vjNZj","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pCovvTcmbBnzZqfR6vjNZj.jpg","alt":""},"id":"446f385e-03df-4b2f-8a6e-e13d0af2f4b6","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Logitech Illuminated\", \"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"Visit Site","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAGXWK/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68406[tid|NA[bbc|NA","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"button","review":{"rating":0,"url":"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse","name":"Logitech Illuminated","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">Logitech Illuminated</a>","pros":["Empty List"],"cons":["Empty List"]},"id":"f1d15750-f33f-4185-9c8c-fbf138304ffa","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Logitech is well-known for its reliable computing peripherals, and its Illuminated <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">wireless keyboards</a> are a popular choice for consumers and business users alike.

Key switches sit under every key cap on a keyboard. The type of key switch you choose directly influences the usability, feedback, responsiveness, lifespan and durability of your keyboard.","<strong>Silicone Dome</strong><br/>Silicone dome key switches are usually found on budget keyboards that come as part of a standard desktop bundle. Beneath the keys there is a silicone membrane, under which lays a series of small domes, one located beneath every key cap.","While silicone dome keyboards usually cost less than other types and are more than adequate for light use, they lack sensitivity. Because of their construction, you have to fully depress each and every key to register the keystroke, which can significantly slow down typing speed. When you&#39;re involved in a serious bout of button-mashing gaming or otherwise need to make a quick succession of precise commands or button sequences, you may find yourself frustrated if you don&#39;t press every key hard enough and end up not registering a quarter of your strokes.","In addition, silicone dome key switches don’t provide any tactile feedback, though some soft models do provide quiet audible feedback. Good quality silicone domes are suitable for light to moderate users.","<strong>Scissor Switch</strong><br/>Scissor switches are the middle ground between dome and mechanical switches. Good quality models, like some HP wireless keyboards, provide tactile feedback – this lets you know when your keystroke registers. This can speed up touch typing, gaming and general productivity.","Scissor switches have a central plunger and a scissor-style durable plastic switch beneath each key, and it depresses to register your keystroke as you press a key. These keyboards tend to have low-profile keys for shallow typing. Because of their switch construction, each time you press a key, the pressure is spread evenly over the surface of the key and the switch beneath, which helps to maximize lifespan. These keyboards are popular choices among all types of users who want durable, reliable, long-lasting and affordable keyboards.","<strong>Mechanical</strong><br/>Mechanical keyboards, like the wireless Razer Turret models, are the choice of power users. Gamers, touch-typists and heavy-duty daily users, along with general users who prefer the look, feel and typing experience, choose mechanical keyboards. Beneath each key cap is a spring-loaded key post. This makes the keys particularly sensitive, and they require only light key presses to register strokes. Their responsiveness improves keystroke or typing speed.","As you press each key, you get tactile feedback, and some models provide audible feedback in the form of the old-school clack sound as you press each key. Although mechanical wireless keyboards are often more expensive than other types, they have long lifespans, are reliable and responsive, and the keys and keycaps are easy and inexpensive to replace."]},"id":"55ecf54b-d89e-4eaf-95c1-d9a6830a235a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/2YYhyrUhCTafMbnrbKT7dJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/prod/large/68411-hewlett-packard-box.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YYhyrUhCTafMbnrbKT7dJ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"2YYhyrUhCTafMbnrbKT7dJ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YYhyrUhCTafMbnrbKT7dJ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4572f11b-2037-4dfa-835a-de8140d2e3b6","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"HP\", \"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"Visit Site","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FARSAVY/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68411[tid|NA[bbc|NA","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"button","review":{"rating":0,"url":"/hp-wireless-comfort-keyboard-review","name":"HP","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/hp-wireless-comfort-keyboard-review\">HP</a>","pros":["Empty List"],"cons":["Empty List"]},"id":"202c2ac8-19f2-4e3b-ad97-281978a2649b","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is an extensive selection of HP <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">wireless keyboards</a>, including budget, no-frills models and multimedia editions.

You can find models that have media player controls, a browser launch button and search bar launch, as well as screen adjustments and volume controls. Some also include keys that open specific programs like your calendar, calculator, email and word processor.","<strong>Number Pad</strong><br/>Not every wireless keyboard features a full 10-key number pad, so consider whether or not you need one. If you enter a lot of numeric data, for example, a built-in number pad is an important feature. You can purchase a separate number pad if you want to quickly enter numerals while still having a compact, portable keyboard.","<strong>Programmable Keys</strong><br/>Programmable keys are a nice addition. They let you set macros or commands to specific hot keys. For example, you can take your gaming to the next level by setting a complicated combo series involving eight separate keystrokes to a single hot key to deliver an awe-inspiring mega beatdown combo that sends your enemies reeling and gives you a definite edge in your favorite game. Alternatively, you can set each hot key to open a different program, select and copy text, paste text, launch your choice of browser, or anything else that improves productivity and speeds up tasks.

There are differing levels of ergonomic design, from lightly curved boards with wrist rests to split-board types with misaligned keys and odd shapes. Each one aims to keep your hands and arms in a neutral position, which improves blood flow and reduces musculoskeletal stress. While some keyboards, like the Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboard line, are laid out like regular keyboards with a lightly sculpted shape and foldable rear legs, others with more unfamiliar designs can take a while to get used to.","<strong>Anti-Ghosting </strong><br/>While ghosting happens to anyone who types quickly, it mainly happens to gamers and touch-typists. When you make a number of keystrokes simultaneously or very quickly, one or more of them may not register, and if you&#39;re a gamer, your opponent can quickly vanquish you. That&#39;s ghosting. This is annoying for those who need to use their keyboards with any speed. To avoid this, look for a keyboard that can handle between five and 10 simultaneous keystrokes. Gamers may find they only need a keyboard with an anti-ghosting zone over the WASD/QEZC keys.","<strong>Polling Rate</strong><br/>Polling rate is a feature primarily used by gamers. It&#39;s the frequency with which the keyboard communicates with the computer. As standard, most keyboards have a polling rate of 125Hz, which means that the keyboard touches base with the computer 125 times per second, and this is adequate for most tasks. Serious gamers require a higher polling rate so that every keystroke is accurately logged in a precise manner. In this instance, look for a polling rate of 500 to 1,000Hz for the best results.","<strong>Profiles</strong><br/>Profiles aren&#39;t essential, but they are nice to have. If your keyboard supports profiles, it lets you set different sets of macros. For example, you could have a whole set of hot keys or macros stored specifically for Microsoft Word or Excel functions to speed up your word processing or spreadsheet tasks. Then, when you&#39;re in another program creating a presentation or editing videos or images, you can switch to an entirely different profile with macros you&#39;ve set for task-specific functions. If you&#39;re a gamer, you can set profiles for different games. For example, you can have your keys programmed for World of Warcraft on profile one, profile two set for The Elder Scrolls and profile three set for GTA V.","<strong>Backlighting</strong><br/>A backlit wireless keyboard isn&#39;t strictly necessary, but it does have a few uses, and it gives your setup a distinctive look. Some keyboards let you change the color and brightness of your backlighting and even set the lights to change color in sequence. Aside from the visual appeal, having a backlit keyboard helps you quickly get your fingers back in the right position if you&#39;re working or playing in low light."]},"id":"96087fbc-6a49-4bcb-a131-67fca7f93fc2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/S2ZhcSkzjwx2pGes6x6WzH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/prod/large/68408-microsoft-sculpt-box.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2ZhcSkzjwx2pGes6x6WzH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"S2ZhcSkzjwx2pGes6x6WzH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2ZhcSkzjwx2pGes6x6WzH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"58c296e4-8d03-49e2-a215-9fa7d0d1821d","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Microsoft Sculpt\", \"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"Visit Site","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OEHS04/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68408[tid|NA[bbc|NA","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"button","review":{"rating":0,"url":"/microsoft-sculpt-comfort-review","name":"Microsoft Sculpt","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/microsoft-sculpt-comfort-review\">Microsoft Sculpt</a>","pros":["Empty List"],"cons":["Empty List"]},"id":"3c7eb703-97f0-4d35-8c5c-34e9d7ca3b84","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Microsoft Sculpt <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">wireless keyboards</a> combine ergonomic form and practical functionality for a comfortable, healthy and efficient typing experience.

Whether you&#39;re an avid gamer, a writer, a business professional or a transcriptionist, the right wireless keyboard can make all the difference to your performance."]},"id":"a7c8b34a-fdac-453c-bd9d-8ab31219bcae","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"5fdf37c9-1d80-4fa3-a793-8aaad57c8cb3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTR1370/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68410[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Anker</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SWIZ2KA/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68412[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Arion</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FBCGHJA/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68413[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Gyration</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FARSAVY/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68411[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">HP</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005S0YO0O/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68414[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">IOGEAR</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAGXWK/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68406[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Logitech Illuminated</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MMY4WY/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68407[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Logitech Wireless</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014N53JVO/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68409[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Microsoft Desktop</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OEHS04/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68408[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Microsoft Sculpt</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D04YU94/?&tag=ttr_wireless-keyboard-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|913[art|NA[pid|68405[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Razer</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"05f44a72-c2df-412a-952a-b5fa035dbac0","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_913","url":"/best-wireless-keyboards","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-11-15T17:15:34Z","datePublished":"2016-12-09T00:25:05Z","name":"Wireless Keyboard Review","synopsis":"Wireless keyboards let you work comfortably and efficiently, with programmable keys, well-designed ergonomics and an array of other features.","review":{},"strapline":"Wireless keyboards let you work comfortably and efficiently, with programmable keys, well-designed ergonomics and an array of other features.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-12-28T19:07:33Z","id":"gd7PaUqdnL9yCcWzZ3npae","meta":{"title":"The Best Wireless Keyboards | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Compare the latest and best wireless keyboards with professional reviews and compare prices and features helping you choose the best wireless multimedia keyboard for your computing, gaming or multimedia keyboard needs.
