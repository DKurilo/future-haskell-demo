Our impressions were that while the image quality was good for the most part, it struggled when in compared to our top picks, particularly in the areas of low-light performance and dynamic range. In other words, compared to our top picks, its video is grainer in low light and lacks details in the highlights and shadows.","These findings back up what we suspected after our analysis of the specifications. The 1/4.85-inch sensor, for example, is slightly smaller than those found in our best HD camcorders. Larger sensors often do better when it comes to low light and dynamic range.","In addition, its maximum aperture is f/1.8. While that’s a respectable aperture for a camcorder, it pales in comparison to the Panasonic HC-X920&#39;s f/1.5 lens. Since an f/1.5 lens gathers more light, a camera with an f/1.8 lens would have to boost the sensitivity of its sensor in order to produce an image of equal brightness. Boosted sensitivity leads to increased levels of noise in your images.","Although the R72 doesn’t quite reach the standard set by the top two picks on our lineup, its image quality is not bad by any means. It performs just as we’d expect a video camera in its price range to perform. Furthermore, image quality is not the only consideration to make when choosing a video camera, and those who prefer to Canon’s design, features and interface would still be well served by the R72."]},"id":"867e7fa4-919d-497c-9baf-5c96247fd7c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"0f859096-42cc-479b-8c06-63e480d25656","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/8ur5Cq9bJ9EEASQcg6qQrQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"As far as overall design is concerned, the R72 is the best camcorder that we tested.

That’s it. Realistically, those are the only two functions you’re going to use for the vast majority of the time, so we think it makes sense to declutter the camera body as much as possible. We only wish that a built-in viewfinder had survived this simplification – they tend to make it a little easier to shoot in some situations, especially in bright sunlight.","With the display open there are a couple more buttons and a touchscreen display. Touchscreens are a fantastic tool for cameras as they allow for intuitive navigation of menus without necessitating an overabundance of buttons. In our experience, however, they can often be buggy or slow to respond in HD camcorders.","This wasn’t the case with the R72. Although it’s not nearly the same quality you’d find in a smartphone, we found it to be the most responsive touchscreen on any camera we tested. In addition to this, its menus were well labeled and easy to navigate.","Most camcorders require users to purchase a separate SD card to save video files. Rather than follow that trend, the R72 offers 32GB of built-in storage space – yet another reason why we think the R72 is one of the easier cameras to use. Some people would rather not mess with memory cards at all.
