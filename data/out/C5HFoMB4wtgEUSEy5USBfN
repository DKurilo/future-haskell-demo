You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Pioneer Electronics is well known for high-end speakers for home and vehicles. The Nautica series of marine audio products is almost an afterthought. It&#39;s certainly not a priority for Pioneer. The 6.5-inch TS-MR1640 is the <a href=\"/best-marine-speakers\">best marine speaker</a> in the series, and it features below-average power handling, volume and audio quality. However, this also makes it one of the most affordable marine speakers we reviewed. It&#39;s an easy upgrade to your factory-installed boat speakers.","We found the audio quality to be average. It&#39;s not terrible for a speaker in its price range, but it doesn&#39;t compare to the best marine speakers available. It scored an 89-percent for the low-range and 86-percent for the midrange frequencies, but it scored a 90-percent for the high-range frequencies, which gives it one of the better tweeters. While the bass reaches as low as 30Hz, which is among the lowest frequency ranges in our review, the bass really begins to lose definition around 100Hz. This is fine for punchy kick drums and heavy distorted guitar, which you want to feel resonate in your chest more than hear, but it lacks the clarity for clean bass lines and lower-end instruments. The treble is also inconsistent. It reaches as high as 30kHz, which is 10kHz above what a human can hear.","The biggest downside to the TS-MR1640 is the low power handling of 30 RMS watts. This is the amount of power it can handle on a continuous basis, which is far below the 100 RMS watts of the best boat speaker. Even the 160-watt peak power handling is among the lowest available. Even with the above-average 91 dB sensitivity rating, it&#39;s not capable of being very loud, which is important for a boat speaker because it performs in an open acoustic landscape. However, it&#39;s also one of the most affordable 6.5-inch marine speakers available.","The woofer is made of molded polypropylene, which is waterproof. The tweeter is made of polyetherimide, and the frame is made of acrylonitrile-elastomer styrene glass fiber, which means it should withstand yellowing caused by sunlight and corrosion from saltwater and fog. These are all durable materials designed for a marine environment. Even the input terminals are gold-plated to enhance the signal transfer while maintaining noncorrosive properties. However, while it has all the properties of a durable marine-grade speaker, it lacks the certification of the ASTM for fog, salt and UV protection.","Pioneer includes a comprehensive installation features to make self-installation easy. The speaker comes with a detailed, step-by-step guide that makes sure that you have the wiring correct. It even comes with a cutout stencil that allows you to easily install it anywhere you want, so long as you have the courage and skill to cut a hole in your boat. The 2.25-inch mounting depth makes it the shallowest boat speaker in our comparison, which means it&#39;ll fit in most places."]},"id":"f19229ad-f23e-4cba-9766-95a6e75a82e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b3402536-20d3-491f-b005-206e04f29f6e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pioneer Nautica TS-MR1640 is one of few marine speakers made by Pioneer.
