You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The AOS U200 <a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">humidifier</a> caught our attention because of its combination of safety and sanitation features. With automatic shut-off, a cool mist and a carbon filter that removes chemicals and bacteria from your water, you can feel comfortable using it in your baby&#39;s nursery or child&#39;s bedroom.","This cool mist humidifier is ideal for use in rooms up to 430 square feet and has an operating time of seven hours. With the built-in shut-off feature, the unit will automatically turn off if it runs out of water, preventing the unit from overheating. However, it has a shorter run time than most of the units we reviewed.","Water purity is important to consider when using your humidifier, especially with children in your home. This unit includes a carbon filter that removes unwanted chemicals such as lead and mercury along with other impurities that may be present in your tap water.","Be aware that when ultrasonic humidifiers convert water into steam, they produce a fine white dust. The demineralization cartridge will help filter out minerals that may be present in your water to prevent that from happening.","This air humidifier&#39;s demineralization cartridge is treated with a patented technology to inhibit microbial growth. This ensures that only pure air and mist are dispersed throughout your infant&#39;s nursery.","This handy room humidifier comes with a 3-year warranty. There is a toll-free telephone number on the company website that you can use to call them if you have a question. Additionally, you can browse the FAQS page for answers to commonly asked questions regarding the unit."]},"id":"43ab4090-1e95-4faf-8a68-a0233042c003","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7c241e56-aa3b-41c8-ab3b-bf0efe603a1e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AOS U200 is ideal for use in a nursery or other small room in your home.
