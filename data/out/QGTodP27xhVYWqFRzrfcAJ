This new version gives a more improved scale appearance resplendent with electronic features and a machined aluminum appearance. The nose gear comes equipped with sequenced gear doors which offer a more aesthetically pleasing appearance and greater reliability in use.","This <a href=\"/best-remote-control-airplanes\">RC plane</a> measures in with a 37-inch wingspan and 52-inch length, which means this is a sizeable plane to carry around. But thanks to its larger size, that means it comes with even more fancy features.","The jet is equipped with a 90mm fan unit, a 1750kV outrunner brushless motor and an 85 amp ESC with a switch mode BEC. The airframe comes pre-painted and decorated, which cuts some of the work out of preparing the device for liftoff. It offers nine pre-installed servos as well as carbon tubing-reinforced wings.","The landing gear is a huge plus on this plan as its aluminum construction and functioning shocks absorb the landing load while still remaining retractable for a more realistic piloting experience. The landing gear doesn’t use servos or end-point adjustments, instead actuating via small electric motors and worm drives."]},"id":"901d1b3f-92ec-48ba-8582-25bec15daa82","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ofg9aBiVWUDSkDZe7S2T3L.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The only items you won’t find included with this remote control plane are the seven-channel radio system and a six-cell flight battery of around 3700mAh.

Even at low speeds, you won’t find any issues in retaining control due to the rudder function of the nozzles.","You will find takeoffs to be quite powerful, as is common among jets. The fan and motor system in use will produce more than 80 ounces of thrust, a display of power you can only imagine until you’ve seen it for the first time.","The eRC F/A 18E Super Hornet is an incredible experience for remote control plane pilots of intermediate and advanced skill levels. Controlling a remote control jet is a different experience from traditional propeller-based planes and will require some additional skill to handle the higher channel remotes. But once you’ve got the hang of it, you will have countless hours of fun with this RC jet."]},"id":"fab22ed9-834c-45f5-82f2-4291499562ac","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55273","url":"/erc-f-a-18e-super-hornet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-10-31T17:55:32Z","datePublished":"2012-10-31T17:55:32Z","name":"eRC F/A 18E Super Hornet","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it is no longer available.
