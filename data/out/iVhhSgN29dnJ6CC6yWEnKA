It does a good job mowing your lawn, and it is lightweight and easy to maneuver.","This cordless lawn mower uses a rechargeable 4-pound lithium-ion battery that provides up to 30 minutes of run time. While this is not as much time as you get from the best electric mowers, the battery charges in as little as two hours, allowing you to mow your yard without having to wait long in between to finish up if you run out of power.","This is an excellent electric mower for homes with a lawn that&#39;s a quarter-acre or smaller. The cutting path is only 15 inches wide, making it an inefficient solution for yards much larger than a quarter-acre. If you keep up on your trimming, the Recharge Ultralite can cut your grass quietly and efficiently without draining the battery too quickly. Additionally, it does not take up much space and is extremely light, weighing 35 pounds with the battery installed. The handle folds down, almost flat, and the built-in handle at the front of the mower makes lifting and moving the collapsed mower easy.","You can discharge the grass clippings to the rear-mounted bag or mulch them back into your yard. The Recharge Ultralite does not have a side discharge, and you have to push the mower with your own power, as it is not equipped with a self-propulsion system. Fortunately, because the mower is lightweight, it is easy to maneuver this electric mower around, even with a full bag of grass clippings."]},"id":"fb8a52ac-351b-4de4-8518-f46179bd2e2f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ad0838b4-d82d-4d32-bfba-ad373ae39ad7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you live in a townhome with a patch of grass or a traditional single-family home with a smaller lawn, the Recharge Ultralite makes an excellent electric lawn mower.
