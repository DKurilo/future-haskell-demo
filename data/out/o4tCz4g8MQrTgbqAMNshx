Still, its print quality and performance aren’t without several flaws.","This multifunction printer can print, copy, scan and fax, though only in black and white, much like the <a href=\"/brother-review\">Brother MFC-L6700DW</a>. The Canon imageCLASS is a fairly large machine but not as big as some of its competitors. At 15.4 x 14.2-inches, it doesn’t take up too much space on a desk or table.","The Canon imageCLASS MF249dw’s print quality is middling. Our 10-page text-heavy test document had nine unwanted ink spots, and there were printing errors on several letters. The prints were still readable, just not as pristine as those made on the higher-ranked wireless laser printers in our review. This machine prints 18 pages per minute, on average, making it one of the faster wireless laser printers we evaluated.","Based on the price of toner cartridges, it costs approximately $0.04 per page to print with this machine. This is in line with other black-and-white printers we reviewed, though understandably much less expensive than the color laser printers we tested.","The MF249dw has a comparatively low duty cycle of 15,000 sheets, and the manufacturer recommends only printing between 750 to 3,000 pages per month for optimal performance. This makes it a better option for a home office than a business.","This printer has a decent selection of connectivity options. You can print from your smartphone or tablet using Apple AirPrint, Mopria, Google Cloud Print and the Canon Print Business app. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi Direct, so you don’t need to go through a router to connect your mobile devices. However, you cannot print from USB storage or scan documents directly to a website or online storage.","Canon’s tech support is available via email and telephone, but there isn’t a live chat support option. You can download the printer’s user manual directly from the Canon website, but we could not find any troubleshooting guides, FAQs or forums that would provide additional help.","The Canon imageCLASS MF249dw has a multifunction design and low operating costs. However, its print quality isn’t on par with higher-ranked models, and it’s not designed for high-demand jobs. Overall, this black-and-white Canon printer is a better fit for a home than an office."]},"id":"4dc67cfc-8b04-4888-99c3-b246c85324d8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58195","url":"/canon-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-18T18:24:52Z","datePublished":"2013-11-18T18:24:52Z","name":"Canon imageCLASS MF249dw","synopsis":"The Canon imageCLASS MF249dw is a wireless laser printer that makes printing from a mobile device easy.
