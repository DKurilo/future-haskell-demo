Useful along paths, walkways, gardens or pool areas, these lights provide needed illumination for dark areas and do not require the addition of wiring.","This light is designed by Ross Lovegrove, a well-respected Welsh artist and industrial designer. It’s shaped like a mushroom and sits at a slant like many mushrooms. As such, it’s not merely stylish, but it has a personality that makes it stand out in your yard. This solar light is constructed of an anodized aluminum post with a solar panel on top that recharges during the day and lights up once it becomes dark. It can be used near doorways, paths, garden areas, driveways or any-where else it makes sense to place it in your yard.","This solar outdoor lighting fixture measures 6 inches across at the top and has a height of 15 inches. A photovoltaic cell powered by rechargeable batteries of nickel-cadmium only requires five hours of daylight to recharge and runs 13 to 15 hours after the sun sets, so they will remain well-lit throughout the night. In contrast, some solar lights only stay on for a few hours.","The design of an outdoor solar light is an important consideration, since you are placing it in an open area where it is subject to weather conditions, including hot sun and rain. One nice feature of this solar light is that the top of the lights that house the LED bulbs and solar panel have a UV-resistant film to prevent damage from the sun&#39;s rays. The aluminum construction and a tight seal around the top prevents the entrance of moisture. Its weather-resistant features will prevent it from looking worn and faded after a year or two, and these lights should be serviceable for a long time. It’s disappointing, therefore, that the warranty is only good for a year. This is especially true given its price. While Solar Bud lights aren’t as expensive as the other Luceplan lights in our lineup, the <a href=\"/luceplan-review\">Luceplan Sky Path</a>, they are still pricey. The <a href=\"/kenroy-home-review\">Kenroy Home KEH-60503</a> is a much more affordable option that installs in a similar manner."]},"id":"01ace5bd-fdb3-4b4f-a66c-43c95d9630fa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29c263dd-ba6f-4fc0-83cd-c250effd8b44","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Solar Bud comes is mushroom-shaped light with personality that will provide a fun, fantastical atmosphere to your yard at night.
