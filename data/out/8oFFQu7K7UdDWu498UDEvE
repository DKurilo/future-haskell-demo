Marketing plans give a business direction and a set of goals to work toward, plus a way to measure progress. However, when it comes to eCommerce, few companies invest the time it takes to develop a clear marketing strategy for their online store. While it might seem as simple as purchasing <a href=\"/money/small-business\">shopping cart software</a>, loading your products and making some Facebook posts, marketing to an online audience takes knowledge and focus to be successful. This is increasingly important as more shoppers start depending on the internet for product research and purchase.","Market plans don&#39;t have to be extremely complex. In essence, you want to know who your target audience is, how to reach it, who your competition is, how you can set yourself apart, what challenges you face and how you will market."]},"id":"87b965dc-42cd-4167-90e5-21f2347f79ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>1. Identify your target audience.</strong> Knowing your target audience can help you with everything from what words you use for search engine optimization, which helps increase your ratings on Google searches, to how you word your tweets or pay-per-click ads. No one&#39;s prospective clientele is everyone; even huge bargain store chains have a clear idea of their customer demographics and needs. Walmart, for example, serves people of modest income who choose value over brand. As a result, its marketing tactics for clothing differ greatly from those of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, which is all about the brand and its perceived status.","You want to know the demographics of your audience   general income, gender, marital and family status, interests that apply to your products   but don&#39;t stop there. What do your potential customers need? For instance, if you sell instruments, do you offer professional violins for the symphony or student models for middle school orchestras?","Consider segmenting your audience as well. If you sell books, your romance readers have different demographics and needs than those who enjoy science fiction. You might have some crossover, but in general, these readers cruise different websites, join different groups, and key into different words and images.","Another segment to consider is your existing customers. Who are they and what do they need? Keeping a loyal customer base helps your store not only because loyal customers come back, but also because they are likely to recommend your store to friends and family. In the world of social media, that can mean a lot. According to Razorfish, 55 percent of internet users say they look at other people&#39;s reviews online, and Marketing Sherpa reports that 83.8 percent of internet users trust customer reviews more than expert reviews.","As you study your audience, always keep in mind the big questions: Why do they need your products, and what will make them buy?","<strong>2. Know how to reach your audience.</strong> Where does your audience hang out online? Knowing your audience can help you discover this. For example, Facebook has a different audience from Tumblr; Facebook&#39;s audience is older, and Tumblr&#39;s audience is more personal and image oriented. Do your potential customers read specific online magazines or blogs? Don&#39;t discount blogs: Although free, some have just as big an audience as a magazine, and bloggers promote on social media. Some monetize their blogs, so you can consider ads, but it&#39;s also possible that they will review a product for you.","Engage your marketing allies. These could be affiliates who share a percentage of sales, Amazon or eBay stores that could serve as a gateway, or satisfied customers or even interested potentials who may promote your products in return for a gift. A popular marketing idea on Twitter is to offer a raffle people can enter by tweeting about your product or company.","Finally, know what influences your customers. Do they want more factual information about the product or more stories about its creation? Would they click a link to your site to get a free eBook, or should you post a meme that they can read in seconds? Would they laugh at a silly video of your workplace, or do they expect a more serious approach from your company?","<strong>3. Identify the competition. </strong>Knowing whom you compete against online not only helps you develop a strategy, but can also give you hints for your target audience as well as campaign ideas. If you are new to online businesses, check out the competition. Where does it hang out, how does it word its online ads, and how do they work? What style and colors does it use on its website? Why do customers go to it and not you?","As you research, take notes on how you can make your business different as well as better. Online marketing is about standing out as well as providing useful products or services. ThinkGeek, for example, sells gift items, from pizza cutters to laptop bags, but everything is geared toward the computer, sci-fi and gaming culture interested in fun and novelty, and its online marketing efforts reflect that, right down to the April Fools&#39; Day product catalog.","<strong>4. Note your challenges. </strong>List your weaknesses as they apply to your online marketing strategy   not knowing how to tweet when your audience is big into Twitter, for example. Perhaps you need some training on your shopping cart software in order to take advantage of its marketing features. Budget limitations may determine whether you invest in paid ads online and how you purchase those ads. For instance, you can often pay per view or pay per click; pay per click is a little more expensive, but you only pay for customers who have expressed at least a passing interest.","Pinpoint what the competition does better than you and how you can work around that. For example, say your big competitor has a larger product line and thus can offer the same kinds of items you sell for cheaper. You could make up for this with more personal customer service, warranties or even a kind of club culture that makes people feel they are part of something special.","<strong>5. Determine your tactics.</strong> Once you have a good idea about your audience, competition and the online venues that will best help you promote your store, you can determine exactly how you will market. The great thing about the internet is that it offers a multitude of free venues, but keep in mind that these do have an associated cost in time. For example, having a blog connected to your eCommerce website can help boost your search ratings because search engines favor sites with new content; however, coming up with a new topic and writing thoughtfully on it week to week takes time.","How you put this information together depends on your company. Some corporations prefer a fully developed plan with executive summaries, charts and option-by-option analysis, but a small home business might suffice with a simple calendar of marketing tasks and goals, with a paragraph defining each audience segment and the approach to take. The important thing to remember is that the plan must be useful. It needs clear tasks and goals that are reachable in the time you set and adaptable to the changing world of the internet.","So much marketing on the internet seems free and easy, but don&#39;t fall into the trap of thinking you can do it successfully without a plan, or that your brick-and-mortar store&#39;s marketing plan will work just as well. Attracting customers and selling products online differs from in person, and your marketing strategy needs to reflect that in order for it   and you   to succeed in eCommerce."]},"id":"e016fc13-70f3-4d3c-aecd-5114f1bd0bdb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8602","url":"/how-to-make-a-marketing-plan-for-your-online-store","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-29T22:18:15Z","datePublished":"2014-07-29T22:18:15Z","name":"How to Make a Marketing Plan for Your Online Store","synopsis":"Businesses with a marketing plan are more likely to succeed than those without one.
