The Micca MB42X bookshelf speakers defy the notion that inexpensive <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1274-best-bookshelf-speakers.html\">small bookshelf speakers</a> can&#39;t perform at high quality levels, even if they can&#39;t compare to our top-rated bookshelf speakers.","The 4-inch woven carbon fiber woofers don&#39;t provide the bass extension to stand alone in your home entertainment center, but the MB42X displays a sharp and clear enough high tone response to be a solid complement to your tower speakers and subwoofer. Silk is one of the highest-quality materials found in tweeters. The MB42X silk dome tweeter lets the sound breathe while providing clean tonal clarity.","The Micca MB42X sports an 85dB sensitivity rating and can only handle 75 watts of peak power. Though these speakers have good tonal quality, you can&#39;t push the volume on them far before they begin to break up. Due to their low sensitivity rating, we recommend pairing these bookshelf speakers with a high-quality amplifier or receiver to get optimum performance. Speakers with lower sensitivity ratings generally don&#39;t perform as well with low-quality receivers as speakers with high sensitivity ratings do.","There are five-way binding posts on the back of each speaker. Two-way connectors are typically found on less expensive speakers. Connection types such as banana plugs and spades give you a better, cleaner connection from your receiver to your speakers.","This is one of the smallest bookshelf speaker sets that we reviewed. The small size gives you additional placement options within your home. You can place them between narrow spaces or on countertops without them looking overbearing. The MB42X is only available in black."]},"id":"92fc194a-db1c-4d9a-8128-d876e9637626","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f8da5059-9d33-4e21-8236-4e616e9b126d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Micca MB42X is worth owning for its clear tonal quality and compact design.
