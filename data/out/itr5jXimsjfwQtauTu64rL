To be considered for our guide, the system must offer tools beyond simply managing documents. It must be able to manage a variety of file types and documents throughout your entire organization. The best enterprise CMS solutions integrate with other business processes and back-end systems, such as HR management, accounts payable and procurement.","Enterprise CMS software differs significantly from standard CMS. Enterprise CMS is intended to manage files and documents within a large organization, whereas a CMS is primarily used to publish content to the web. If you are looking for a content management system, check out our <a href=\"/money/small-business\">CMS buying guide</a>. You can also read our <a href=\"/money\">articles about business software</a>.","<strong>What to Look for in an Enterprise CMS</strong>","The decision of which enterprise content management (ECM) system to use is not a light one. This is a significant undertaking for your organization, and you will need to find an ECM that fits the needs of your particular business. Here are some factors to consider when selecting an ECM system:"]},"id":"5b37d640-484d-42d5-80da-c8f27c71816f","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Integration:</strong> An enterprise CMS needs to fit seamlessly into your company&#39;s existing infrastructure. How well it integrates has ramifications on how well you can continue using your current assets and add new supporting systems. If you can find an ECM that allows you the flexibility to use multiple databases, file systems, and servers, you will save yourself from substantial troubles down the line. An enterprise CMS needs to also integrate with the essential applications your business uses, including management, collaboration and creation programs. This will allow you to easily store the content and information created by programs such as Salesforce, AutoCAD, Microsoft Office and other programs that are essential to your business&#39;s day-to-day operations.","<strong>Core Functionality:</strong> At the most basic level, you need an ECM system that allows you to manage documents through the entirety of their lifecycle. How this is accomplished and the types of content you need to manage varies depending on your business, but all ECMs allow you to manage, store, and distribute the various types of content on your site. Look for ECMs that have a flexible taxonomy system that allows you to customize the metadata of the content you store. This makes it easier for employees to search and find content in case it&#39;s needed later.","<strong>Compliance:</strong> Ensuring your documents comply with various regulations is one of the most important things an ECM can help you with. Not only are you compliant with rules and regulations, but it can be a big help if your business is subject to an audit or is named in a lawsuit. An ECM allows you to keep all documents related to a certain project, like a loan, for example, in the same place, which makes it easier to access if there is a need to review them. Other compliance tools include multiple levels of administrative access and password controls.","<strong>Support:</strong> Because an ECM is an integral facet of your business, one that intersects with many different operations, finding a vendor that offers reliable support is critical. You want an ECM that offers global tech support, a wide range of educational and training documents (preferably in person and online) and quick troubleshooting of technical issues.","<strong>Pricing:</strong> Since ECMs are large-scale solutions, they tend to be pricy. There&#39;s not a one-size-fits-all solution and generally an ECM can be customized to fit your particular business. You&#39;ll need to contact the vendor to receive a quote, since pricing information isn&#39;t often posted."],"type":"ul"},"id":"bde9af01-dd96-43c2-8d48-607714e0af80","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Best Overall Enterprise CMS"},"id":"60f75d03-f729-4b56-9988-57e5740b26d5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["OnBase, developed by Hyland Software, is one of the most complete ECMs on the market.

Many ECMs are scalable, but as you increase the storage capacity, price also rises.","<strong>Collaboration:</strong> An effective ECM can reduce information from missing and make it accessible across the entire organization. If you work with contractors or freelancers, you want an ECM that allows for external collaboration.","<strong>Ease of Use:</strong> If a program is confusing and unintuitive, it makes its adoption within your organization slow and difficult. Look for an ECM that offers the functionality you need in a simple interface. Most ECM providers offer free demos, so you can evaluate the software before you purchase it.","<strong>IT Infrastructure: </strong>Because ECMs store a large amount of data and become a critical part of your business&#39;s data management, the question of where and how to store that data must be considered. Most ECMs offer on-premises, cloud or hybrid options. An on-premises option is stored on your own network and servers. If you scan a lot of documents, that may be a good choice. A cloud-based system, which resides on off-site servers and usually accompanies a SaaS-based ECM, doesn&#39;t require as much setup, and the hardware costs aren&#39;t as expensive as an on-premises system. A hybrid system, a combination of cloud and on-premises hosting, is a good option if you want to host the ECM yourself but have clients and partners who use the SaaS model.","<strong>Training: </strong>Because these are complicated programs that intersect with many different departments in your business, you&#39;ll need to train your employees on how best to use the ECM.
