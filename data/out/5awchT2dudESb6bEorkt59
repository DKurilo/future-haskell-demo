Be it at home or work, these devices don&#39;t typically do a lot of traveling. For this reason, they aren&#39;t typically designed for it. The HAVIT HV-F2056 is a high-quality cooling pad without much bulk or weight, which makes it easy to pack away with your laptop.","At just 1.5 pounds, the HAVIT is one of the lightest laptop cooling pads we reviewed. To maintain its small size and light weight, it sacrifices some of the features found on stationary models. Still, if portability is your main concern, the HV-F2056 may well be the best laptop cooler for you. Even though it sacrifices a few features here and there, it isn&#39;t lacking in cooling performance. It uses three powerful fans for a maximum airflow of 65 CFM, which places it firmly among the most powerful laptop coolers available.","However, with the exception of an extra USB port, it’s missing most of the features found on other models. Its feet are reminiscent of those found on desktop keyboards and can be unfolded to give the cooler a slight tilt. Unlike other models we reviewed, the HAVIT can&#39;t elevate your laptop to eye level or be comfortably used in your lap. The cooler’s simplicity adds to its portability and durability. Because it&#39;s so simple, there aren&#39;t many protruding pieces or weak points to worry about. Plus, its fans are protected by a tough metal mesh that covers the entire top panel.","HAVIT covers the HV-F2056 with a one-year warranty, though customer support can be little tricky. HAVIT is based in Hong Kong, so to contact a representative by phone, you have to reach out in its time zone. Fortunately, it also has continent-specific email addresses."]},"id":"9372d71e-babf-4c3b-960a-5b5e7d88705f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e25daabb-cecb-45f1-9944-658df366e9e3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HAVIT HV-F2056 is an excellent cooling pad for its designed purpose.
