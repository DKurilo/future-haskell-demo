However, this also means the video fills the frame better than Ring&#39;s other doorbells, all of which produce vignette-like circular video with black areas near the edge of the frame. Ring is the only video doorbell company with video like this, which gives it a certain kind of charm, but may be a drawback for people wanting more traditional video that fills a screen. The audio quality of the Ring Video Doorbell 2 passed our simple tests, so you shouldn&#39;t have any problems understanding visitors during a call.","Using the Ring Video Doorbell 2 is a pleasant experience that&#39;s identical in form to that of the Ring Video Doorbell. The only difference we could find is that Ring Video Doorbell 2 reacts faster to visitors pressing the button on your doorbell. You can adjust motion detection controls, view recordings and link your Ring account to other <a href=\"https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001109863-Smart-Home-Integration\">smart home platforms</a> such as Amazon Alexa, IFTTT, SmartThings, Wink, wemo and others.","This doorbell also works with a variety of smart locks, including <a href=\"/kwikset-kevo-review\">Kwikset Kevo</a>, RemoteLock and <a href=\"/lockitron-bolt-review\">Lockitron</a>. The Ring app can&#39;t control these locks directly, but provides shortcuts to the appropriate apps, which you access during a call.
