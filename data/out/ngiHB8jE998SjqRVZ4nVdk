That’s because the DMR-EZ48VK features a built in VCR combined with a progressive scan upscaling DVD player/recorder.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>"]},"id":"13dbbf75-f8e5-4476-90db-de21e9801b36","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["1920 x 1080p upscaling resolution","Built in digital tuner","VIERALink","SD card and USB port"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d60bb3ce-4836-4765-bc12-d05b92edea41","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Features</strong>","Now all your DVDs can have the same resolution as your Blu-ray player. The Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK will convert any standard definition signal into a high resolution 1920 x 1080 signal. This means that your standard definition DVDs will look better than ever.","With the built in digital tuner, you can record all your favorite off air digital programs onto DVD. Make your own box sets of the Simpsons before the official box set even comes out. The Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK also has an analog tuner built in, so if you wanted, you could still record analog signals, but why would you?","Using Panasonic’s VIERALink you can connect your DVD recorder to a compatible Panasonic TV and use one remote to control both components. Even better, it will also control compatible Panasonic home theater systems. This also has useful features such as automatically switching inputs and turning on the appropriate device with the push of only one button.","The Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK can also function as a media terminal with its SD card slot and USB port. Using either of these connections you can view your images on your screen and share them much more easily than ever. The reader even allows you to play music stored on your device while you watch your photo slide show.","The Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK records to DVD-RAM, DVD-R, DVD-R (DL), DVD-RW, +R, +R(DL), and +RW discs allowing for maximum flexibility when choosing a disc medium. It can also playback just about any format under the sun including MP3s stored on a disc.","<strong>Summary of Reviews</strong>","The expert reviewers were impressed with the upscaling video quality of standard definition videos, although it should be mentioned that these images will never look as good as a Blu-ray discs. The stealthy black design matches most other components that the player will be paired with. The menu system is easy to navigate and doesn’t have the steep learning curve that some other systems require.","The users liked the ease of use. The remote control was also comfortable and easy to use, even in dimly lit rooms. The Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK easily burns VHS movies to DVD with simple dubbing. The software occasionally locked up which was solved by simply turning the machine off and then back on.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK is an easy to use recorder that also has decent picture quality. It is would be ideal for someone who has old VHS tapes and needs to transfer them to DVD without much fuss. It is a solid machine at a reasonable price."]},"id":"e5738d42-0cf0-4933-89e0-1e925ef33257","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_25320","url":"/panasonic-diga-dmr-ez48vk-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-12-17T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-12-17T07:00:00Z","name":"Panasonic Diga DMR-EZ48VK DMR-EZ48VK","synopsis":"Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK\nPanasonic is bridging the gap between those that are still stuck with VHS and those who want nothing that isn’t digital.","review":{"rating":77,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Panasonic DMR-EZ48VK\nPanasonic is bridging the gap between those that are still stuck with VHS and those who want nothing that isn’t digital.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-12-17T22:49:58Z","id":"ngiHB8jE998SjqRVZ4nVdk","meta":{"title":"Panasonic Diga DMR-EZ48VK DVD/VCR Combo Player Review - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
