We consider the most popular and highest-rated machines, taking into account their features, positive attributes and drawbacks. After gathering this information, we created a diverse list of the best models on the market.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We’ve spent more than 100 hours scouring the internet, reading consumer reviews and poring over user manuals to find the best cotton candy machines.","During our research, we noted each machine’s features and checked its speed, durability, overall performance and price. We used this information and a proprietary formula to decide which models to recommend. Ultimately, we found excellent options that range from budget-friendly to expensive and can be used for home entertainment or business.","<strong>How Much is a Cotton Candy Machine? </strong>","Our favorite household machines for making cotton candy at home cost between $35 and $90. Commercial cotton candy machines are more expensive, starting at $250 or $450 for professional-grade features and reliability.","<strong>Can I Really Use Hard Candy to Make Cotton Candy?</strong>","Why, yes you can - at least with certain models like the <a href=\"/bella-review\">Bella Cotton Candy Maker</a> and the <a href=\"/nostalgia-review\">Nostalgia Electrics Carniva</a>l. Commercial cotton candy makers aren&#39;t made for novelties like this and require floss sugars. With hard candies, you need to follow the instructions that come with your machine to get the best results. But having the option to make unique and powerful flavors from Jolly Ranchers, Lifesavers, root beer barrels or even cough drops (why would you?) is a fun novelty to try out and impress your family and friends. You can also substitute sugar-free candy to save some calories, but you will likely have to experiment until you find your favorites that work the best. All hard candy compatible cotton candy makers highly suggest avoiding gummy or ball-shaped candies.","<strong>How Long Will Cotton Candy Keep?</strong>","If you live in a dry, mild climate, cotton candy will stay fluffy in an airtight container for up to four days. However, if it is humid or hot where you live, don’t count on your cotton candy sticking around for more than a few hours. Heat and moisture cause cotton candy to shrink and clump, and it won’t keep this way.","<strong>Can You Refrigerate Cotton Candy?</strong>","You can refrigerate cotton candy in an airtight container for about three days, as long as you don’t open it. Once it’s opened, the air and humidity around you will cause the candy to shrink and clump, and you shouldn&#39;t try to store it in this state.","You can keep cotton candy for up to two months in the freezer. Just double-seal fresh cotton candy in a freezer bag with as much air squeezed out as you can, then place it in a second airtight container before popping it into your freezer. As with refrigerated cotton candy, once it’s open don’t try to store it again.","<strong>Did You Know?</strong>","According to The National Confectioners Association (NCA), December 7 is National Cotton Candy Day!","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a Cotton Candy Machine </strong>","Construction<br/>If you are buying a machine for family events and parties, a small, mostly plastic unit will do just fine, but if you plan to make cotton candy on a larger scale, it is worth looking for sturdier machines. You can find all-metal construction and strong motors that are designed to stay separate from the sugar. That will extend the life of the machine.","Accessories<br/>Look for the bubble top that helps form a rim around the top of the machine. That keeps the cotton candy from flying out of the machine and makes it easier to shape it around the included cones. The small beginner machines should also include raw materials, cones and recipes to help get you started.","Warranty &amp; Support<br/>All products are best when they come with support that is easy to access through telephone, email and live chat. It is also worth looking for the cotton candy machines with relatively long warranties.
