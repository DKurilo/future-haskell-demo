Its airframe is made from carbon fiber rather than the plastic you’ll find on many other drones. It has a full GPS navigation system, and if you want to have eight rotors instead of four, you simply add them.","The QU4D also has a folding feature that is unusual among large unmanned drone. At a little over 25 inches across, a drone of this size would not normally fit into your backpack. However, with folding airframe arms that telescope down to a slim 18 x 8 x 4 inches, you can make your QU4D do exactly that. This quadcopter weighs about 3 pounds before you add the separately purchased camera of your choice, so if you put it in your backpack, weight is not going to be an issue either.","The QU4D machine flies for about 18 minutes if you use a standard battery, and it can fly for up to 30 minutes if you decide to buy a heavier-duty one. You can fly it for over a mile before your transmitter will not reach it, and if it does wander out of range or get low on power, it will simply return to the location you launched it from and land there gently.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"af6588ee-93da-46d2-b688-8db1eb4fda40","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If customer service from a South African company concerns you, know that email support is offered along with downloads of software, FAQs, technical support guides and manuals.

Plus, the manufacturer offers good support and service.
