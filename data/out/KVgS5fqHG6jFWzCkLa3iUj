The panel itself (screen) is thin – in fact, it&#39;s thinner than an iPhone 6.  The thinness doesn&#39;t do anything in particular for the quality of the picture – it&#39;s really more of a talking point – but it is cool to see a TV thinner than a phone.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68208-lg-oled55b6p1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GXVB34q2GHzx4bhatT6gCF.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"GXVB34q2GHzx4bhatT6gCF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GXVB34q2GHzx4bhatT6gCF.jpg","alt":""},"id":"16e974d6-f39a-4c53-bbf7-31c64790d41d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We watched a handful of movies and shows on the LG 4K TV including the &#34;The Martian,&#34; &#34;Skyfall&#34; and &#34;Gravity.&#34; We also streamed UHD 4K content to the TVs using our Sony 4K media player. We viewed the same content on each TV and compared the picture quality side by side.","We watched the LED TV from straight on and left and right of center, with the lights both on and off. With the LG OLED55B6P, it doesn’t matter where you are seated – center or off axis – the picture looks good from every angle. With many TVs, when you watch off of center the picture begins to either darken on the sides of the TV or wash out (become overly gray or bright). This was not an issue with the LG OLED TV.","It is almost harder to describe an LED TV&#39;s picture quality when there is nothing to nit-pic. The picture quality is outstanding. The quality makes it seem as if you are looking through a clear glass window into where the movie is actually happening. The color saturation is top notch. Colors look vibrant and true, and the contrast between the darkest images and the brightest images makes the picture look vivid.","To back up our visual testing claims, we tested all of the TVs using Calman software and an image sensor and test pattern to determine the contrast ratio and color accuracy of each set. As we expected, the contrast ratio and color accuracy of the OLED sets were untouched by other displays. The contrast ratio is as close to infinite as it can get. The B6P&#39;s color accuracy was also the second most accurate, falling barely behind the other LG OLED we reviewed. For outstanding picture, the OLEDs can&#39;t be beat.","This set does have HDR settings. You can turn on the HDR settings to low, medium and high. This adds more dynamic range to the picture, but we found that the best viewing mode for picture quality was the cinema mode.","Unlike the other OLED TV we reviewed, the LG B6P does not have 3D capabilities. However, this isn&#39;t a very popular feature among consumers. In fact, only one TV in our lineup boasts 3D viewing abilities."]},"id":"59e8137f-2376-40f6-8292-d357eee99b11","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"ae4d8c94-fd0a-4c4b-a8cf-fa7286a719d8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/VkLQ7PhPaGZjrFR5KNMhNn.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"We evaluated each TV&#39;s remote control to determine the most comfortable and the easiest to use. The remote that comes with the LG OLED55B6P is at the top of our list for usefulness and comfort. LG calls it a magic remote for two main reasons – it has gesture and voice controls. Pressing down on the scroll button activates the on-screen cursor. It moves wherever you point the control – much like a mouse on a keyboard. Very few remotes have gesture control. This feature makes it easy to navigate the menu options and quickly select streaming services. The voice search is also a great option to navigate the TV.
