To evaluate the displays, we read reviews written by experts and consumers, pored over manufacturer specifications, and performed hands-on tests to evaluate performance and build quality. We had multiple users interact with each display, and we also tested each computer’s default display settings in our lab.","<strong>What Do Touchscreen Monitors Cost?</strong>","Touchscreens are pricier than their standard counterparts, and you also need to account for the cost of the computer, which you purchase separately. Creating projective capacitive technology, the stuff that allows monitors to register touch, is expensive. Only high-end gaming monitors with 4k and curved displays are more expensive. On average, a desktop touchscreen monitors cost just over $300, compared to between $50 and $200 for an everyday, non-touchscreen monitor.","<strong>How We Tested  </strong>","During our research phase, we looked at each monitor&#39;s dimensions and build quality and noted which have notable or rare features, like discreet on-screen display options or speakers. We also evaluated each monitor’s connectivity options and counted the number of ports it has, since more is better. After we researched these products, we brought them into our lab for testing.","We tested each monitor’s ability to accurately depict color and display depth and dimension in videos and games by measuring the gamma and color averages. To get the most accurate display measurements possible, we performed these tests by connecting a laptop to a high-quality spectrophotometer, specifically the X-rite i1Pro. A device called a pattern generator transmitted color-accurate images directly to the monitor, and CalMAN software prompted the spectrophotometer to take images of the screen and plot the information onto charts and graphs. We used the results to help us determine which monitors have the best visual display.","Along with the above tests, we compared response time, which is the time it takes for the pixels in the display to change color. We also considered the distance between pixels, called the pixel pitch, and the time it takes the monitor to respond to input from an outside source, called input lag. The former impacts how sharp the display looks, while the latter is a measure of how quickly your input is processed by the display, which can sometimes impact gameplay.","We used the monitors for long periods of the time during the business day under normal office lighting to test how comfortable they are to use. We also did some typing tests to see how much the interface might impact job performance.","<strong>Important Features to Consider When Choosing a Touchscreen Monitor </strong>","Ergonomic<br/>We recommend looking for a monitor with an A-frame stand and wide tilt range. These features make touchscreen displays easier to use all day long as well as easier to adjust from one position to another.","Touch Surface<br/>When touchscreen monitors first became available, most couldn’t handle more than one or two points of touch, and most of them were difficult to use. Now, many  have 10-point multi-touch screens, which means they can register up to 10 simultaneous touches at a time, making a variety of tasks much easier.","Touchscreen monitors with glass surfaces are the best because they are the most durable and comfortable to use. They also more closely mimic the shiny, glossy screens we are accustomed to on smartphones and tablets.","The only downside to a glass touchscreen is its reflective surface; it’s a bit distracting to see yourself and your surroundings reflected in the screen when you sit down to work. These highly reflective surfaces can also cause eyestrain. Some of the monitors we looked at have a matte surface, which eliminates glare but is not as smooth.","Design<br/>A lightweight monitor is typically easier to move around or hang, though it should also be sturdy. It’s also important for the monitor to have a large display because touchscreens have on-screen keyboards. Keep your eye on the dimensions versus the screen’s total viewing area; some manufacturers don’t account for the size of the bezels in their listed screen size.","Another design element that makes a big difference is the bezels – the plastic edge around the screen. The bezels shouldn’t interfere with touch capability. For example, you don’t want to spend your entire work day bumping your finger against the edges of the display. The best touchscreen monitors have edge-to-edge glass, and we find that these seamless displays also make monitors look sleeker and more attractive.","Finally, on most standard monitors, the display controls, which you use to change the screen’s brightness, color and contrast, are physical buttons located on the bezel. However, when these buttons are in the same place on a touchscreen, you constantly bump them while typing and using touch functions. While most displays have a feature that locks the buttons when they’re not in use, a few house the controls in more practical places. We recommend looking a monitor with display controls located somewhere other than the bezel.","<strong>Challenges With Touchscreens </strong>","One of the major problems that kept people from buying earlier touchscreen monitors was the fear of something called gorilla arm – the painful result of repeatedly lifting your arm to reach the touch display. Most manufacturers addressed this issue by sitting the monitors on A-frame stands that tip back, so they’re easier to use all day long. The best touchscreen displays have wide tilt ranges and are easy to adjust from one position to another. However, even with this improvement, we found ourselves tiring quickly.","Our day-to-day office tests revealed other issues that keep these monitors from replacing standard displays. For example, it’s difficult to type on their keyboards. Our testers compared their typical typing speeds on a hardware keyboard to the results of typing tests taken on the touchscreen monitors. The scores were always drastically lower on the touchscreen displays. While the scores would likely get better over time and with practice, other problems have no easy solutions, such as how much space the on-screen keyboards take up on the displays.","While touch technology on a desktop display is exciting in theory, we caution you to think carefully before committing to one of these monitors. Make sure you have a specific application in mind before buying.","<strong>Styli for Touchscreen Monitors </strong>","If you prefer the tactile feel of a pen for taking notes and drawing on a touchscreen monitor, a capacitive stylus is the best option. Not all styli are compatible with the touchscreen monitors we tested; some work only on certain tablets and touchscreen laptops. Here are some capacitive styli that work with every monitor we reviewed:","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Adonit-Magnetic-Samsung-Touchscreen-Devices/dp/B0763THS2Z/\">Adonit Pro 3</a><br/>Adonit is well-known for making high-quality accessories for creative electronic devices, like tablets and touchscreen monitors. The Pro 3 stylus is not the most cost-effective solution for writing and drawing on touchscreens, but the smart and durable design makes it easy to toss in a laptop bag or briefcase without it breaking. The disc that surrounds the stylus tip makes it easy to create precision marks while allowing your hand to grip the pen at a comfortable angle. It has a textured grip for greater control and a magnetic cap to protect the tip.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Musemee-Notier-V2-Black-Precision/dp/B00ELPSUD4/\">Musemee Notier V2</a><br/>If you are looking for a more budget-friendly stylus for a touchscreen monitor, the Musemee Notier is the best option. It costs less than $15 and comes with an extra replacement tip. The Notier V2 is available in four colors and is compatible with all of the monitors we tested, as well as with Android and iOS tablets and phones.
