Because of how they are designed, slow cookers aren’t great at retaining heat and often take several hours to reach a safe cooking temperature.","You might want to consider investing in a <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">meat thermometer to</a> make sure the meats you cook reach safe temperatures. To be safe, brown meat a little before placing it in the pot. If it’s a thick, hearty meat, it’s better to use a pressure cooker, oven or other cooking method, since it will cook the meat faster and more thoroughly.","<strong>Key Things to Note About Slow Cookers<br/></strong>","Safety","Recently slow cookers, pressure cookers, multicookers and similar appliances have been called into question due to a haunting portrayal on the show &#34;This is Us,&#34; where an appliance causes a house fire. But don&#39;t throw out your slow cooker just yet. When we asked about the safety of Crock-Pot&#39;s slow cookers, Friedman from Newell told us, &#34;Crock-Pot slow cookers exceed all internal testing protocols and all applicable industry safety standards and regulations as verified by independent third-party testing labs. For nearly 50 years, with over 100 million Crock-Pots sold, we have never received any consumer complaints similar to the fictional events portrayed in &#39;This Is Us.&#39; In fact, the safety and design of our product renders this type of event nearly impossible.&#34;","It&#39;s easy to get caught up in the emotions of a fictional story, but rest assured that these slow cookers have undergone plenty of tests and adhere to safety regulations to keep you and your loved ones protected. Friedman went on to explain that the company&#39;s slow cookers are all low current, low wattage and are made of flame resistant materials so they cannot catch fire. You can feel safe leaving these products unattended; just be aware that they can be very hot to the touch.","Here are some extra precautions you should take to keep your household safe and to ensure the long life of your appliance:"]},"id":"5e93af95-8529-4e38-b221-674c321329b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Keep these devices out of the reach of children and pets.
