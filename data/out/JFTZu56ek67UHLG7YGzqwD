While USB 3.0 thumb drives are backwards compatible with earlier technology, USB 2.0 drives are not forward compatible, so you&#39;ll need a computer with a USB 2.0 port or earlier. The Cruzer Switch is available in 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB storage capacities.","Despite its slower USB 2.0 read and write speeds, this memory stick is a user favorite because of its value and ease of use. It requires no additional drivers or software â€“ you simply plug it in, then drag and drop you photos, music or other files onto the drive&#39;s folders.","Another benefit of the Cruzer Switch is the included SecureAccess software, which provides 128-bit AES encryption. SecureAccess is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8, as well as with Mac OS X version 10.5 and up. Mac users will have to download a compatible version of the software, however. This security software can create a storage vault on the flash drive. The files saved inside the vault are password protected. You can easily drag and drop folders into the vault to protect them instantly.","This USB 2.0 flash drive has a practical compact design with a distinctive flip-top that protects the USB connector. This small yet capable drive is less than 2 inches long and weighs less than 4 grams. The plastic outer casing includes a loop that you can use to attach the flash drive easily and safely to your key chain.","SanDisk provides sufficient and responsive support. You can contact technical support by email, telephone or live chat if you have questions. If you would like to follow SanDisk via social media, you can find the company on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube. SanDisk backs this flash drive with a two-year limited warranty."]},"id":"61f5e521-709c-4488-b76e-704ffbfa0f03","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1202098-e37d-4601-9ed4-cd2b9c77ce0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SanDisk is a major player in the memory card arena, as the company makes high-quality memory devices for cameras and cell phones.
