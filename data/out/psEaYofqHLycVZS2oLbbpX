First, we identified the best handheld vacuums on the market through extensive research, both online and consulting with professionals. We continued our online research, comparing product pages for specific features of all the vacuums in our lineup. In our labs we put the vacuums through their paces and tested them on different surfaces, including carpets, hard floors and car seats, to see which vacuum performed best overall and which excelled at specific tasks. Our findings are presented in our side-by-side comparison chart and our reviews.","We found some great products as we tested, but some of the final decision comes down to your specific situation and the reason you are buying a handheld vacuum cleaner.","Erin Reed, Associate Director of Marketing for Stick and Hand Vacuums at BISSELL, said the key to finding the right handheld vacuum cleaner is organizing your priorities.","&#34;You&#39;ll want to focus your decision criteria on both the length of time you need to clean, considering the run-time and battery power, and the accessories you&#39;ll need for what you&#39;re cleaning,&#34; said Reed.","Full-sized vacuum cleaners have their place, but a handheld unit can be great for stairs, cars, furniture and other small tasks. &#34;They&#39;re great for in-between cleans or specific tasks,&#34; said Reed.","Reed explained there have been some advancements in terms of battery technologies that make handheld vacuum cleaners last longer and recharge faster so you can get back to cleaning when you have a longer job.","<strong>How Much Does a Handheld Vacuum Cost?</strong>","Handheld vacuum cleaners are designed to tackle smaller messes and usually come with a small cost -- less than $100. We tested products ranging from $30 to $175. In this category it is not necessarily worth it to invest more money. Our favorite product was almost the least expensive one. You do not need a ton of suction for most of the small messes you will be targeting with this type of vacuum – cleaning up a bit of breakfast cereal the kids spilled or freshening up car mats. Also, portability is another major factor and there are plenty of smaller units that come at a reasonable price and do a fine job of cleaning.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","The two most important components of the best handheld vacuums are performance and portability. Suction power is important, especially if you are trying to pull up stubborn dirt in crevices and corners, or pet hair that tends to stick to upholstery. Portability focuses on how easy it is to carry around a small vacuum while using it. It also looks at convenience factors, such as the battery life and how heavy the machine is.","In addition to the obvious functions of pick-up and maneuverability, we also considered design features that give some handheld vacuum cleaners a leg up on the competition. For example, some products use a HEPA filtration system that enables them to meet air quality standards set by the U.S. Department of Energy and remove 99.97 percent of dust particles and keep them from blowing back into the air during vacuuming.","Vacuuming Performance<br/>We performed many tests to determine how well each hand vacuum picks up a variety of common items, including cereal and wood shavings. We rubbed dog hair into carpeting and went into volunteer pet owner homes to test how well portable vacuums were able to pick up both cat and dog hair from upholstered furniture such as couches and chairs to help us determine which models had better suction.","To further test suction capabilities of small hand vacuum cleaners, we put screws in a flat-topped container and recorded how many screws each unit could hold for five seconds. Those capable of holding more weight received higher marks for suction.","Portability<br/>As part of the portability tests we timed how long the battery lasted when fully charged. This is important if you need to tackle more than one mess or have an unusually big mess, such as dried leaves or cookie crumbs in your car, that may require some extra cleaning time.","We weighed each portable vacuum cleaner to give you a good idea how cumbersome and tiring it may become while using the vacuum. We also considered how long it takes to charge all of the battery-powered units. The ones that charge more quickly scored better. ","Cordless vs. Corded<br/>While cordless models are more portable, they are also generally less powerful. One of the main reasons for buying a handheld vacuum is to get to the messes you can&#39;t easily reach with your full-size vacuum cleaner. But having less suction once you get to those messes is also a major drawback. David Stern, part-owner of Metrovac, highly recommends a corded model because of the increased suction.","&#34;If you&#39;ve got electricity your best bet is to go with one of our 110-volt units,&#34; said Stern. Indeed, the unit with the best score in our suction tests is one that plugs into the wall. It is also the heaviest model we tested, though. The extra weight and being tethered to a wall limits portability.","The best way to decide between a corded and a cordless handheld vacuum is to determine what you need more: portability or power. ","Design<br/>Most of the hand vacuums we tested come with attachments for getting into folds in furniture or corners in staircases more easily. The crevice tool is long and narrow so it fits more easily around the base of car seats that are bolted to the car floor and more difficult to vacuum around. The Black &amp; Decker Dustbuster has a crevice tool as part of the main body design rather than as a separate attachment. It also extends to give you a longer spout, adding to the maneuverability of the vacuum.","A wide-mouth tool, such as the one included with the <a href=\"/metrovac-review\">MetroVac Vac N Go</a>, gives you the ability to vacuum a larger area with one pass rather than having to continually repeat smaller passes to get up the same amount of mess.","<strong>Handheld Vacuum Cleaner Maintenance</strong>","The best advice for maintaining vacuum cleaners, even small ones, is pretty universal. That is because all vacuum cleaners have a lot of the same components. Here are some things that will keep your handheld vacuum cleaner in good condition for a long time to come:"]},"id":"0a13cc3c-675f-4fc7-86db-f370b3cf772f","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Empty Bag or Dustbin – When the unit gets too full it can lead to loss of suction. To be even more safe, we recommend emptying bags and dustbins when they are 3/4 full. Handheld vacuums are unlikely to have a full bin indicator light, and even when they do they are often inaccurate. Check things out yourself on a regular basis.","Clean or Replace Filters – Whether it is the foam filters that you find in the less expensive models or the HEPA filters that you will find on the best handheld vacuums, clean them or replace them on a regular basis. You lose suction by not doing so.","Clean Out Brushes – There are fewer brushes on a handheld vacuum than on a full-sized unit but check the ones you have and comb them out from time to time. They will spin more freely and the non-spinning ones will pick up more hair if they are clean."],"type":"ul"},"id":"a7e4c48d-b359-47b8-85fa-ed3254ffc7c7","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What is the Most Powerful Handheld Vacuum?</strong>","The most powerful handheld vacuum cleaner we tested was the <a href=\"/eureka-easy-clean-review\">Eureka Easy Clean</a>. It got the only perfect scores on our carpet and hardwood cleaning tests. Among handheld vacuum cleaners, there are lots of factors that matter beyond sheer cleaning power so the Easy Clean did not qualify for the best overall in our ranking. It is a corded model so you are tethered to the wall, which cuts down on portability. The Easy Clean also struggled to rank higher because it is relatively heavy and the suction when using the crevice tool was not as strong as the main cleaning head&#39;s suction, making it less useful for car cleaning, a popular use for handheld vacuums. But in terms of pure suction using the full cleaning head, the Eureka Easy Clean was incredibly powerful. It cleared away the sawdust on our test carpeting in only two passes, half of what it took the next best vacuum cleaner.","<strong>How Long Can You Expect Your Vacuum Cleaner to Last?</strong>","According to Consumer Reports, the answer is generally about eight years, but that is just a median number across all vacuum cleaner types. The real answer to that question for most vacuum cleaners, including handheld units, will depend on maintenance. Every vacuum cleaner will have its own quirks, but you can definitely extend the life of your handheld vacuum with proper maintenance. Be especially vigilant about cleaning filters and emptying the dustbin or dust bag regularly.","Handheld vacuum cleaners vary quite a bit on the position and type of filters, but on most common models there is a filter in the middle of the machine. You unsnap the body from the cleaning head and the filter is right there. You can either tap it on a ledge to free debris or wash it, or both. Be sure to check your owner&#39;s manual for specific instructions. In the case of the Dyson model we reviewed, and really most Dysons, the filter looks very different. It is a cylindrical shape as opposed to the disk-shaped filters on most handheld vacuum cleaners. It still needs to be cleaned, dried and replaced on a regular basis. Some models also recommend replacing instead of washing filters. Check your manual for details. <br/>","<strong>Environmentally Friendly Cleaning </strong>","Any product that&#39;s made of plastic and contains a battery can have a negative impact on the environment. If you&#39;re looking for an environmentally friendly handheld vacuum cleaner, consider these factors:"]},"id":"368abe99-3782-4acf-8161-d86a937ca437","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Batteries: The batteries in cordless vacuums can have a negative effect on the environment. Hoover is one company working to mitigate that problem; the company has partnered with the <a href=\"https://www.call2recycle.org/\">Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation</a> to make it easier to find a battery drop-off location so that the batteries don&#39;t end up in landfills.","Durability: Look for a product that will last a long time. A long warranty can give you some confidence about that, but also ask a local vacuum dealer and read lots of reviews. That way, you won&#39;t put a handheld vacuum in a landfill every few years.","Repair: Handheld vacuum cleaners are pretty inexpensive, so it may seem silly to repair them. However, repairs are worth looking into if you want to make the greener choice.","Air quality: Indoor air quality is routinely reported to be worse than outdoor air quality in some areas. Both the <a href=\"https://carpet-rug.org/testing/green-label-plus/\">Carpet and Rug Institute</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/USA/vacuum-cleaners\">Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America</a> certify the products that are best for indoor air quality.","Upcoming designs: Companies such as Vax may offer a look at what&#39;s on the horizon; the company is developing a <a href=\"http://www.cardboardvax.com/a-closer-look\">vacuum</a> made only of recyclable and recycled materials."],"type":"ol"},"id":"57c50219-8c6a-4f97-b28f-09029774310f","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What Is the Best Handheld Dustbuster?</strong>","Made by Black &amp; Decker, the Dustbuster is basically synonymous with handheld vacuum cleaners for lots of folks, like Crockpot is to slow cookers or Kleenex is to tissue. That&#39;s not too surprising when you consider its lofty roots. The Dustbuster evolved after Black &amp; Decker was tasked with creating battery-operated hand tools for <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/40-years-of-nasa-spinoff/dustbuster\">NASA</a> to collect samples on the moon. There are hundreds of handheld vacuum varieties now and Dustbusters still compare well.  ","The best handheld Dustbuster is also our best handheld vacuum overall. In our latest round of testing, the <a href=\"/black-and-decker-review\">Dustbuster HHVI320</a> was practically perfect. While battery-powered models are never quite as strong as corded ones, this Dustbuster did a good job of cleaning. Also, not having a cord gives it the advantage of being portable. This is one of the few handheld vacuum cleaners we tested that stores all its tools on its body. That way, you have easy access to the crevice tool for cleaning between car seats and other small jobs. It is one of the best Black &amp; Decker Dustbusters and the best handheld vacuum cleaner overall.","<strong>What Is the Best Handheld Vacuum for the Car?</strong>","We tested quite a few handheld vacuum cleaners that did a good job cleaning car seats. However, the <a href=\"/shark-cordless-pet-perfect-ii-review\">Shark Cordless Pet Perfect II</a> scored the very highest in our car tests. It also outperformed all but one vacuum in our suction tests, including the test where we had it suspend a container of screws, adding weight until it could no longer hold the container. Aside from performing well in the car seat and other suction tests, the vacuum has quite a few other features that make it great for keeping your vehicle tidy. For one, it is cordless. As such, you can really get into every corner, without worry about whether the cord can reach far enough. It also has accessories to help it get into tight spots, including a crevice tool. A hose would make it even more useful for cars, but because it is cordless, its reach extends pretty far as is.","<strong>What Is the Best Handheld Vacuum for Stairs?</strong><br/>","One of the most common uses for a handheld vacuum is cleaning stairs. Even the best uprights and canisters sometimes make it hard to reach all the way up a stairwell. You can either take the body of the vacuum cleaner with you and try and balance it on individual stairs as you go, or you can hope the hose reaches far enough that you don&#39;t have to move the whole vacuum cleaner much. Either way, it is kind of a pain. A good handheld vacuum makes stairs easier. We recommend the <a href=\"/eureka-easy-clean-review\">Eureka Easy Clean</a>. Since stairs are an inside job, it doesn&#39;t matter that you have to plug it in. Also, the cord is long and can easily get you through a set of stairs. Corded models also generally have more suction, and this particular vacuum had the highest carpet cleaning scores of all the handheld vacuums we tested.  ","<strong>What Is a Good Wattage for a Vacuum Cleaner?</strong>","It is difficult to quantify suction power in a vacuum. The numbers on the box are not really any help. Wattage is good to know in terms of energy conservation because it lets you know how much electricity the vacuum cleaner will be consuming. Higher wattage does not mean more suction, though. Amps can seem like a good indicator but they really just represent the power it takes to push the voltage. More amperage can lead to higher rotations per minute but that does not necessarily lead to cleaning power on a machine that is poorly constructed. More amps also generates more heat, which can wear down a motor.","Air wattage is one number that can give you an idea at least. The air wattage (AW) is the wattage it takes to move a unit of air through the vacuum cleaner&#39;s nozzle or cleaning head. The AW can be pretty hard to find, though.","Manufacturers will sometimes list motor wattage but not air wattage. Suction claims can also give you an idea because they are generally based on air wattage. We use hands-on testing to update our vacuum cleaner comparisons regularly so check our reviews to find the products with the best cleaning power.","<strong>Cleaning Recommendations for Those With Allergies</strong><br/>","Handheld vacuum cleaners are generally used for quick pick-ups, so you might not feel like they warrant a ton of research. A little research can go a long way toward maintaining a healthy home, though, especially for those with asthma and allergies. Any time you are vacuuming or cleaning, you can stir up dust.","&#34;If you don&#39;t have a quality vacuum it can actually put dust and allergens back into the air,&#34; said AAFA Director of Marketing Michele Ann Cassalia. Her organization tests machines to see which ones are the best at containing dust, and that includes handheld vacuum cleaners. The AAFA recommends just one of the handheld vacuum cleaners we tested – the <a href=\"/dyson-v6-review\">Dyson Trigger</a> – and it recommends a newer version than we reviewed. We weren&#39;t overly impressed by its suction in our testing, and the relatively high price is off-putting, but it is definitely worth a look if you have allergies or asthma. For more information, go to <a href=\"https://www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/USA/\">www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/USA/</a>.  ","<strong>One Vacuum For All Tasks</strong><br/><br/>The line between different vacuuming categories is blurring as time goes by. The latest cord-free vacuums from <a href=\"/dyson-cyclone-v10-review\">Dyson</a> and <a href=\"/shark-ionflex-review\">Shark</a> are a cross between a stick vacuum, upright vacuum and handheld vacuum, all in one unit. We know that&#39;s on purpose, at least in the case of Dyson. Josh Mutlow, Senior Design Engineer at Dyson, said his company is hoping people&#39;s cleaning habits will evolve to become more frequent, shorter sessions throughout the week with a stick vacuum. Those more frequent, shorter cleaning sessions would replace the traditional weekly ritual of dragging the old upright out of the closet to deeply clean the whole house. Dyson isn&#39;t even investing in the upright design anymore, Mutlow said. Their attention is focused on vacuums like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Cyclone-Absolute-Lightweight-Cordless/dp/B0798FVV6V?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Cyclone v10 Absolute</a>, which also doubles as a handheld vacuum when you remove the extension tube. The latest stick vacuums from Shark also double as hand vacuums for cleaning the stairs or your car.","<strong>Car Cleaning Tips</strong>","If you spend a lot of time in your car, keeping them clean takes a little bit of effort.
