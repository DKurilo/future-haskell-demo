This DIY smart home system is a simple, ingenious way to add some smart features to your home. Samsung SmartThings also provides responsive technical support at the touch of a button.","With much of the same functionality as other DIY home automation systems, SmartThings gives you several ways to take control of your home. The user interface is easy to use and works on Android, iOS and Windows Phone smartphones. The app keeps the system simple, but there is no PC or Mac support; luckily, smartphones are a better medium for control.","Using Samsung SmartThings you can set routines that work with many types of sensors and devices. For example, when the system detects a presence sensor by the front door, it unlocks a compatible deadbolt without the need for you to use a key. You can also activate routines manually or on a schedule.","Samsung SmartThings is compatible with a variety of security system components such as cameras and alarms. It also supports home audio functionality via Bose and Samsung wireless speakers, and it is one of few DIY home automation hubs to do so. SmartThings supports voice control through Amazon Echo and <a href=\"/best-home-security-monitoring\">home security monitoring</a> via Scout Alarm.<br/>The SmartThings Hub is compatible with both Z-Wave and ZigBee wireless smart home products. If you choose to purchase a SmartThings DIY home automation starter kit, every device in the box is ZigBee-compatible. The system gains Wi-Fi capability and internet connectivity when you connect it to a wireless router with an Ethernet cable. Much like many other DIY systems, SmartThings doesn&#39;t support Bluetooth.","SmartThingsâ€™ strong technical support includes helpful user manuals, FAQs, email support, live chat, tutorials and a user forum. The live chat support is particularly good, as you can access it directly through the smartphone app, almost like a text message. Samsung offers telephone support Monday through Saturday. Installing SmartThings in your home is easy, and it takes less than an hour to set up the hub and a couple components. Installation takes longer if you choose to install dozens of devices at once."]},"id":"aa062118-c9c8-41c4-99f2-fe899415a37f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68191","url":"/samsung-smartthings-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-05T18:42:39Z","datePublished":"2016-08-05T18:42:39Z","name":"Samsung SmartThings Hub","synopsis":"The SmartThings DIY home automation system originally found its place in the market thanks to a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign and ultimately, an acquisition by Samsung.
