The non-stick cooking surface ensures easy removal with minimal mess and very little cleanup time. It also comes with useful accessories to help you get started baking right away.","When it comes to consistency and non-stick performance, the Betty Crocker BC-2938CO is one of the best donut makers, consistently producing evenly-baked donuts. Donuts baked on the outer edges of the baking tray were consistent with those cooked on the inner tray. During testing, we encountered no difficulties removing the finished donuts from the cooking surface. Heating time for the donut maker is two minutes, and cooking time for a full batch of donuts was timed at one minute 30 seconds.","This donut maker is equipped with cool touch handles to prevent accidental burns. Non-skid rubber feet keep it from sliding around your kitchen countertop, and it also comes with convenient cord storage when the donut maker is not in use. Only the addition of a locking lid latch, which ensures the lid stays closed during cooking, would have served to rank it higher on our list of safety features. A one-year warranty is also included, and support is offered via email and telephone.","In addition to a mixing spatula and a decorative icing kit for creating fancy donuts, the included owner’s manual offers five unique Betty Crocker recipes for various types of homemade donuts. The donut maker’s overall value would be improved by the inclusion of additional accessories, such as a fork removal tool for extracting donuts from the cooking surface and a cooling rack to prevent donuts from becoming soggy as they cool."]},"id":"d0b9b532-ef37-40b5-afef-329059373753","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"243b1f49-0193-4e54-8c44-f8285b353b07","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Betty Crocker BC-2938CO electric donut maker scores high in performance and baking consistency.
