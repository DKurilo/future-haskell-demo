However, the rugged texture across the back of the device makes the power button difficult to press. This same button is used to turn on the battery's bright LED flashlight panel, which has three modes: stead light, strobe and SOS.   <br />\n   <br />\nOne of the solar panels is on the front of the battery itself, and the other three are housed in leather leaves, so they're easy to fold for storage.

We spoke with Angela Hawks, a self-proclaimed trekker and avid traveler about her experiences shopping for solar chargers. “I basically needed a huge battery,” she told us. “I needed something to last the 7-day trek up Kilimanjaro. The cold kills batteries very quickly, so I also wanted something with a solar panel I could just hang on my pack to recharge during the day.” The first time around, she tried a 12,000 mAh single-panel charger, which didn’t quite do the trick. “I had some troubles, but I figured it was just a quality thing. I ended up trying a higher end 24,000 mAh one, and I love it.” Her advice: get the lightest, highest capacity solar power bank you can find and keep it out whenever there’s sunlight.","Price<br/>We reviewed solar power banks within a price range of $20 to $50. Surprisingly, we didn’t find a correlation between number of solar panels and price, as our top-performing, 4-panel products cost about the same as other single-panel chargers. Prices did increase with larger power bank capacity, however. The two most expensive products both hold 24,000 mAh.","Types of Solar Chargers<br/>There are a few types of solar phone chargers. While we focused specifically on solar power banks for our evaluations, other products may work just as well for you. Folding portable solar panels are another popular solar charger configuration. Because these have larger solar panels, they collect more energy at a time and charge your devices faster. They tend to be bulkier and cannot store energy, so if you need to charge at night, you&#39;re out of luck. We previously tested panel chargers from <a href=\"/nekteck-review\">Nekteck</a> and <a href=\"/ravpower-review\">RAVPower</a> both of which charge well on sunny days.","We chose to feature solar power banks in this round of evaluations because they charge by sunlight or by plugging into a wall outlet, and they&#39;re a little more compact. Many have the added bonus of a built-in flashlight as well. Most of the power banks cannot simultaneously solar charge their own batteries and charge your device, or they do so very slowly. Also, because the batteries on these devices have large capacities, it can take a while to charge them to full, up to 40 hours of strong sun exposure in some cases. They&#39;re meant to charge primarily from an outlet, using solar as a backup for emergencies. Even so, the top performers in our tests indicate that you could get a full phone charge from a day in the sun.","Solar Panels<br/>The amount of sunlight a device can convert into usable energy depends on a few factors. One of the most important is the surface area of the solar panels. The more surface area, the more energy. In our test results, every solar power bank with four panels outperformed products with fewer panels. The products we tested all have similarly-sized panels, but larger panels collect more energy.","Best Solar Charging Practices<br/>Every product we evaluated is meant to be charged primarily from a wall outlet or computer. The solar power banks have high-capacity batteries and would take a long time to fully charge from sunlight alone. Of course, you can use them primarily as solar devices, but the batteries won’t fill up in one day. When charging via solar, the panels should be placed outside, tilted toward the sun. Though some products can gather a little energy inside from window-filtered sunlight or even fluorescent lights, they work best in direct sunlight.","Each of the panels on the devices we tested can convert 1-1.5W per hour of sunlight into storable energy. A 10,000mAh battery takes about 21W to fill, so a single solar panel would need 14 or more hours of direct sunlight to get a full charge. A typical smartphone can get at least two charges out of a power bank.","Environmental Impact<br/>Besides being convenient when you don’t have access to an outlet, using solar power to charge your devices can be good for the environment as well. Charging one smartphone doesn’t take up much energy – according to multiple sources (<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_green_lantern/2009/10/you_charged_me_all_night_long.html\">Slate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2013/09/07/how-much-energy-does-your-iphone-and-other-devices-use-and-what-to-do-about-it/#54eb2cda2f70\">Forbes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-charge-a-smartphone-for-a-year/\">ZDnet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/gadget/how-much-does-it-cost-charge-phone-tablet-or-laptop-3632210/\">Tech Advisor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a7566/is-charging-a-smartphone-inflating-your-power-bill/\">Popular Mechanics</a>), charging your phone can use anywhere from two to seven kilowatt hours a year, depending on your charging habits. Depending on your energy company, each kWh from the grid creates up to 1.63 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> (according to <a href=\"http://blueskymodel.org/kilowatt-hour\">BlueSkyModel</a>), so if you’re using 7 kWh a year just for your smartphone, that’s 11.41 lbs of CO<sub>2</sub> for a single smartphone. If all of the two billion smartphone users worldwide made this small switch to solar, we’d decrease man-made CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 10 million tonnes annually."]},"id":"d6c34e87-a41b-4556-860a-da7d2a4f3374","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"495ef69c-c619-446d-8f26-71faa97e1af2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/x-dragon-review\">X-Dragon</a>","<a href=\"/allpower-review\">ALLPOWERS</a>","<a href=\"/sunjack-review\">SunJack</a>","<a href=\"/hiluckey-review\">Hiluckey</a>","<a href=\"/ravpower-review\">RAVPower 15000mAh</a>","<a href=\"/nekteck-review\">Nekteck</a>","<a href=\"/plochy-review\">PLOCHY</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3077f751-d65b-492d-92ea-f456e35565a4","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_327","url":"/best-solar-phone-chargers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-28T18:15:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-28T18:15:00Z","name":"Best Solar Phone Chargers of 2019","synopsis":"Which is the best solar phone charger for you?
