Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Dell 1350cnw <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> gives you all the features you are looking for in a basic printer. This device is small, sturdy and energy-efficient. It offers a variety of features but nothing too advanced or unique. With only the basic features offered, this printer is easy to use and is an ideal device for use in a home environment.","You will find average print quality when you use this dell laser printer. The Dell 1350cnw offers 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch) resolution. This print resolution provides you with clear images – they just aren’t as sharp and crisp as they possibly could be. A 30,000 monthly duty cycle is also available, which allows you to print up to 30,000 pages in a month without causing any lasting harm to the laser printer. The printing speeds are a drawback to this device. You can print black and white documents at a speed of 15 pages per minute and color documents at a speed of 12 pages per minute. However, duplex printing is available on this device and makes it possible for you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper.","The feature set available on the Dell 1350cnw is basic. You can print on a variety of paper types and sizes with this device. You can print on cardstock, envelopes, standard-size paper and legal-size paper. The paper tray located on the device will store up to 150 sheets of paper. This is an ideal size for home use, but you may find yourself restocking it quite frequently in an office environment. This laser printer offers 128MB of installed memory, which is the same amount you will find on several similar devices. It also offers a one-year warranty, which is an added benefit.","The Dell 1350cnw is an energy-efficient device. It consumes only 310 watts of power, which is a low amount compared to several similar devices. It is ENERGY STAR qualified, meaning it has met a list of required specifications showing that it contains energy-saving features.","One of the advantages to using the Dell 1350cnw is the small, portable size of this laser printer. This device is only 15.5 inches wide, 8.85 inches tall and 11.81 inches deep. It is small enough that it will fit nicely on your desk without taking up too much space. It also weighs a measly 23.3 lbs, which is light enough you can move it from one place to another without too much hassle.","This laser printer features a very simplistic control pad. The pad is located on the left-hand side of the device and features a few buttons for controlling and telling the printer what to do. A small display screen is also located on the device to help you know exactly what the device is doing."]},"id":"beb1d4be-9338-4669-b640-74127ad30cc3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4bd2595f-e34b-4c67-bce0-afbbc7eb1da9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dell 1350cnw is your basic laser printer.

Overall, the Dell 1350cnw is a high performing device; it just lacks the large selection of advanced features to make it a top laser printer."]},"id":"5107bae8-6d68-43fc-babb-f2b57dcec125","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53162","url":"/dell-1350cnw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brian-westover","url":"/author/brian-westover","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Brian Westover","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"TBtnELo8v5XHxqU9uBG9c7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-29T16:39:24Z","datePublished":"2011-06-29T16:39:24Z","name":"Dell 1350cnw","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"verdict":"The Dell1350cnw is a basic laser printer and lacks the advanced features found in similar devices.","pros":["The Dell 1350cnw is an ENERGY STAR qualified product and consumes only 310 watts while in use."],"cons":["This laser printer&#8217;s maximum resolution is 600 x 600 dpi."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-06-29T16:39:24Z","id":"qiAWaEdsapYpHin5C2h5zn","meta":{"title":"Dell 1350cnw Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
