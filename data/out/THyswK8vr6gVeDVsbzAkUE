In that time, we’ve examined dozens of applications and spent hundreds of hours performing hands-on tests. We’ve combed through the applications’ features and tools, capturing hundreds of images and recording hours of video. We inspected and compared the results to see which products are the easiest to use and most useful as well as which provide the most value for your dollar.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We evaluated and ranked screen capture software by testing each program ourselves. Based on the results, we found that the best programs create small files, are easy to install and don&#39;t use a lot of your computer&#39;s processor power.","One way the best screen capture programs stand above the rest is the size of the files they create; in this case, smaller is better. This is because small, less impactful images and video files take up less space on your hard drive. During testing, we created several types of files using each program and averaged their resulting sizes. We then compared these averages to determine which applications create the smallest files.","We also recorded how much impact each program had on our test computer’s system as we created videos and images. These tests showed us how system intensive each application is, which can affect your computer’s overall performance – screen capture programs that use a lot of your computer’s resources can cause lag in other software.","The average file size and system impact data were compiled into an overall system performance grade. Screen capture programs with high system performance grades take up less space on your hard drive and have minimal or no impact on your computer&#39;s performance.","<strong>Important Things to Consider When Choosing a Screen Capture Software</strong>","As you search for the right screen recording software for your needs, there are a few things to keep in mind, namely each program’s price, capture and editing tools, ease of use, compatible file formats, and available help and support.<br/><br/>How Much Does Screen Capture Software Cost?<br/>There are some screen capture programs that you can download online for free. However, they don’t have the functionality of the paid programs we reviewed. When we tested, we took a price range from $20 to $80. However, we feel that $50 is the absolute maximum you should spend.    ","Capturing &amp; Editing Tools<br/>Some of the top features to look for include menu, scroll, video game and scheduled captures. Menu and scroll capturing are great for creating software tutorial documents because you can capture an entire page, even if most of the content is off screen and requires scrolling to view. If you plan to capture some video game footage, but don’t want to use this software primarily for gaming, choose software that can record games or DirectX applications in general. Finally, scheduled capturing allows you to record your screen at set moments in time, so you don’t have to be at your computer to capture images and video.","One of the biggest differences between for-purchase screen capture software and freeware is the former lets you edit your captured images and videos. Consider programs that allow you to add comments and bubble captions and draw shapes. These tools help you create step-by-step instructions, notes or highlights, which can be incredibly helpful.","Ease of Use<br/>Look for a program that includes a quick-to-access toolbar. This feature allows you to record what’s on your screen without opening the screen capture software separately. Rather, you can simply click a record button on a small toolbar on the side of the screen.","You should also consider whether you can share your captured images or videos on social media sites, like Facebook and Photobucket, directly from the program. This is a great way to reach family, friends, coworkers or followers quickly. Software with this function allows you to share your content at the push of a button.","File Formats<br/>If you want to create videos and share them online, you need a program that can create files in formats that are optimal for the web, such as MP4s. It’s also important to choose software that can create high-quality small images if you plan to post them online. You may also want a program that can support scanner or camera imports, allowing you to pull images directly from these devices.","Help &amp; Support<br/>If you&#39;re on the fence about purchasing a program, you can often download a free trial or demo version to check it out. Although every screen capture application we tested offers a trial or demo version, the trial time varies significantly. Look for products you can test out for at least a couple weeks before making a final decision.","The best programs have tutorial sections or FAQs pages to guide you through each step of the process. Also, look for software that offers customer support through email or over the phone should you need help.","<strong>Can You Legally Monetize Gameplay Videos?</strong>","With the lucrative popularity of video game streamers like <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ninja/clips?filter=clips\">Ninja</a>, you might be thinking about capturing your own gaming sessions and posting them online. But what are the rules regarding gameplay monetization?","First, if you want to make money on YouTube, you need to agree to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857?hl=en\">YouTube’s Partner Program</a>. If you plan to post on any other site, you need to make sure you follow and agree to its terms as well.","But copyright-wise, is it legal to post your gameplay videos online and earn money money from them? As stated on <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/youtube-gaming-pewdiepie-fair-use-1.4309312\">CBC News</a>, most video gaming companies &#34;tacitly permit YouTubers to violate their copyrights, with creators and publishers turning a blind eye out of consideration of the promotional value of being featured on high-audience channels.&#34; So, for the most part, video game publishers see video game streaming as free advertising for their creations and will not take action against you. While you’re probably safe to post and earn money off your gameplay, this is somewhat of a gray area, and companies can still take action if they really want. Since this is a newer way to consume media, the rules are still being hammered out, and gaming companies might want to change things in the future.","But perhaps it isn’t the gaming companies that will push for change on uploading gameplay. According to <a href=\"https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/esports-%E2%80%98let%E2%80%99s-play%E2%80%99-revenues-to-reach-$3-5-bill\">Juniper Research Report</a>, “a rapid rise in consumption of eSports and streamed games content will drive $3.5 billion in revenues by 2021, up from $1.8 billion in 2017.” With all this newfound attention to video game streaming, people’s eyes are being drawn away from video streaming services and sports. In fact, as stated on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/netflix-thinks-fortnite-is-a-bigger-threat-than-hbo/\">TechCrunch</a>, Netflix says games like Fortnite are a much bigger competitor for viewers’ eyes than HBO and other video streaming services. As an example, when YouTube went down a few minutes in October, Netflix’s viewing and signup numbers spiked. So if changes to video game streaming copyright are enforced, the push might just come from video streaming services who want attention brought back to their own media offerings."]},"id":"8784ad2a-c926-42e1-9b68-b89b9fc44697","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"b5df5ec3-e9a8-4cf1-b41e-35aacc845d27","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/snagit-review\">Snagit</a>","<a href=\"/ashampoo-snap-review\">Ashampoo Snap</a>","<a href=\"/faststone-capture-review\">FastStone Capture</a>","<a href=\"/screenhunter-pro-review\">ScreenHunter Pro</a>","<a href=\"/capturewiz-pro-review\">CaptureWiz Pro</a>","<a href=\"/easy-screen-capture-review\">Easy Screen Capture</a>","<a href=\"/hypersnap-dx-review\">Hypersnap 8</a>","<a href=\"/any-capture-review\">Any Screen Capture</a>","<a href=\"/spx-instant-screen-capture-review\">SPX - Instant Screen Capture</a>","<a href=\"/fullshot-review\">FullShot Screen Capture</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0e5eb3f9-5428-4499-9f7a-0afbb1d74ea6","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_204","url":"/best-screen-capture-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
