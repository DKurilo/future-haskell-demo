Weighing in at 7.5 oz, this <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-multi-tools\">multi-tool</a> provides a full breadth of functions, including sawing, cutting, driving and opening. Active Junky testers found the ferro fire-starting rod to be a handy backup while traveling through South America.","Leatherman describes this tool as essential for users from day hikers to expeditioners on multi-day trips and offers all the basic tools you&#39;d expect to see as well as some bonuses, like the diamond-coated blade sharpener. Another standout feature of this little arsenal is the hammer surface, which comes in useful when direct impact or a little tap is needed.","This Leatherman multi-tool measure 4.5 in when closed and houses a 2.73 in blade. Its cutting power was exceptional in use cases, and the slot-head screwdriver provided enough torque to bore deep into tight-grained wood.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Versatility","<strong>Best For:</strong> A great choice in full-function multi-tools for all types of adventuring when straightforward tools are need, though not for technical activities that would require specialized tools","<strong>Tester Comments:</strong> “Signal is more about solving a wide range of problems rather than specializing in one function or tool. For example, cutting wire is much more challenging than bending it given the jaws’ strength. Sawing is only average because the tool’s slender profile doesn’t allow inclusion of a beefier blade. Many times, okay on the road (because it’s small) is better than a better, heavier tool that needed to be left at home.”","<strong>Trial Results</strong>"]},"id":"30cf7947-8fa9-4329-98d8-23c32467ab80","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Point Break: </strong>This tool underperformed in this trial, as cutting through the wire required not only over three attempts but also adjusting the angle. Further, both hands were needed.","<strong>Around the Bend: </strong>Stable operation with solid contact, but less jaw deflection than others, with much effort required to fully bend the wire into the &#34;S.&#34;","<strong>Rope &#39;Em In: </strong>Stellar stability and control with moderate slicing power and clean cutting that felt secure and steady through the motion cutting nylon rope.","<strong>No Turning Back: </strong>When using the driver heads, two-handed torque capabilities are excellent in this compact tool, all with solid connection where tool meets body.","<strong>Eyes on the Pries:</strong> When needed for small prying jobs, the short blade on this multi-tool is a good choice. It is strong and provides quality penetration between the two surfaces.","<strong>Lumberjack Olympics: </strong>When sawing through wood, the combo blade cut deep, but the design of the multi-tool made getting a solid grip difficult. The finer teeth, while a slower process, were well suited for cutting cordage."],"type":"ul"},"id":"b4ab3757-9908-4d0a-a2e2-02b2e517c3ea","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67959","url":"/leatherman-signal-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-10T18:27:18Z","datePublished":"2016-06-10T18:27:18Z","name":"Leatherman Signal","synopsis":"The Leatherman Signal showcases a full 19 functions all in a little package.
