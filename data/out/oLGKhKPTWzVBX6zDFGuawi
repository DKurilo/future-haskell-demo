Residential

Friedrich Chill CP06G10B <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioner</a> is powerful – it generates up to 6,000 British thermal units (Btu) and can cool up to 250 square feet of space. This model includes multiple fan speed settings and a strong, four-way airflow. It’s also Energy Star qualified and has a competitive Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER). However, this AC is much heavier than other units we reviewed.","With the Chill CP06G10B’s four-way airflow feature, the unit can evenly distribute cold air throughout your room. Its maximum airflow is 200 cubic feet per minute, which is one of the strongest of the window AC units we reviewed. Several similar products have maximum airflows between 130 and 170 cubic feet per minute.","This Friedrich AC model doesn’t cost much to run and is efficient. It has an EER of 11.2, which is above Energy Star’s requirements but below average compared to other units we reviewed. It’s estimated this AC only costs about $44 to run each year, which is competitive with the other units we looked at. This estimate is based on using the unit eight hours a day for a three-month period, and your exact cost may be different.","When you run the Friedrich Chill CP06G10B on its cool setting, the compressor and fan work together to cool the room. You can also run it on one of three fan-only settings – high, medium and low – to circulate air without cooling it.","The unit also has a dry mode that pulls excess moisture out of the air. In addition, there is an energy saving mode, which turns the fan on every three minutes to determine if the room requires cooling. Further, this window air conditioner has a timer that lets you choose when the unit turns on, and you can set the timer up to 24 hours in advance. However, there isn’t a sleep mode.","The Chill CP06G10B comes with a remote control you can use to change all its setting. This unit also has an auto-restart feature, so if its power supply is interrupted, the AC automatically restarts with its previous settings once it has power again.","This unit is large compared to others we reviewed. It is approximately 14 x 18.6 x 20.9 inches and weighs 60 pounds, which also makes it the heaviest model we considered. For comparison, the lightest window AC we reviewed is the <a href=\"/keystone-kstaw05b-review\">Keystone KSTAW05B</a>, which weighs only 40 pounds. The Friedrich Chill CP06G10B’s size makes it difficult to lift into the window as well as hard to move for winter storage. Even with its size, it has a minimum window height requirement of 14.12 inches, which is similar to many of the best products we reviewed.","Friedrich includes a one-year appliance manufacturer warranty, and the compressor is covered under warranty for up to five years. This is one of the best warranties we saw. Several similar window air conditioners have warranties that cover all parts, including the compressor, for one year.","If you have any questions or concerns about this product, you can contact the company by email or telephone. There is also a FAQs section and an online manual on the company’s website.","The Friedrich Chill CP06G10B is powerful enough to cool up to 250 square feet of space, features four-way airflow and includes an energy saving mode that helps cut energy costs. It is a large, heavy window AC unit, which can be a drawback for some, but it’s still a good option overall."]},"id":"f32632f1-2fd0-4c40-a195-82dc7d6ea9fa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64967","url":"/friedrich-residential-chill-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-19T23:12:35Z","datePublished":"2015-05-19T23:12:35Z","name":"Friedrich Residential Chill CP06G10B","synopsis":"The Friedrich Chill CP06G10B window air conditioner is powerful – it generates up to 6,000 British thermal units (Btu) and can cool up to 250 square feet of space.","review":{"rating":87,"verdict":"The Friedrich Chill CP06G10B is a good AC unit to consider.
