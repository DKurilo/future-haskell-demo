When it comes to justifying the implementation of a <a href=\"/money/small-business\">project management solution</a>, the numbers can get tricky to calculate. However, it is still relatively simple to determine whether your company is at the breaking point and could benefit from improving its project management processes.","In most studies, you will see a range of about 15 30% ROI for implementing a new project management system. For this article, we chose to be conservative in our cost analysis and use 15 percent as the assumed ROI and 25 percent as the assumed profit margin. There are two ways to recoup costs   by an increase in revenue or a decrease in expenses (although in real-world scenarios, it&#39;s a combination of both). Many studies also report an increase of ROI potential over time.","<strong>Determining Estimated ROI:</strong>","Assumptions: One project manager and nine team members, with an average yearly cost of $3,598 for the PM solution, an assumed 25-percent profit margin and a 15-percent assumed ROI.","Increase in profit: (Revenue * revenue + 15% increase)*.25 (to reduce to profit margin) = increase in profit<br/>At the bare minimum, you would have to experience a $23,986 increase in revenue to cover the cost of the PM service.","Decrease in expenses: Projected expenses - 15% in decreased expenses = $3,598<br/>In this scenario, you would have to experience a minimum 15 percent decrease in $23,986 of expenses to break even.","When determining actual ROI, there are some additional things to consider, including quantifiable improvements and possible benefits, which are real but more difficult to quantify.","<strong>Quantifiable Improvements</strong>"]},"id":"7d647c3d-e038-422b-be16-471b213cfffc","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Capture more billable time","Decrease in non-strategic project acceptance","Improved allocation of resources","Increased budget accuracy","Reduction on cost overruns","Reduction in project failure rate","Reduction in project delivery time"],"type":"ul"},"id":"bae972e2-9643-4cdc-a78b-f04886e85f05","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Possible Benefits</strong>"]},"id":"a5e00e08-a6fd-4292-912e-497fe33ab442","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Increased chance of winning bids","Decreased time required to create reports","Decreased time spent updating statuses","Improved handling of change requests","Increased accuracy in expense reporting","Improved morale","Increased accountability","More-accurate expense reporting"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a4e8ea51-9d39-43ee-b4b6-21a67a8b41e9","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It is impossible to determine the actual ROI, but the numbers and considerations above can help you create a more-accurate estimated ROI projection. Numbers can be adjusted based on the actual profit margin of your company, which may be above or below the average.","Another major consideration when choosing a PM solution is integration. If you already have systems in place, such as a CRM or ERP system or accounting software such as NetSuite or Microsoft Dynamics, you will need to determine the level of integration you require to keep processes running smoothly. If yours is a smaller company, you will need to consider what software you may need to add to work with the project management solution, such as Outlook or SharePoint. Overall, most studies   even those conducted by third-party research teams   show that implementing a good project management solution will show quantifiable improvements and is well worth consideration.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "," "," "]},"id":"f8e5c73f-e5d3-42b0-99f3-2712dafbdb12","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7526","url":"/cost-analysis-determining-the-roi-of-project-management-solutions","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"pamela-s-stevens","url":"/author/pamela-s-stevens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Pamela S Stevens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"e9bBMEAQ9LLhA3c2cSq39Z","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-08-23T19:39:44Z","datePublished":"2012-08-23T19:39:44Z","name":"Cost Analysis: Determining the ROI of Project Management Solutions","synopsis":"Whenever you implement a new system, an estimate of the quantifiable justification for purchasing that new system is usually requested.","review":{},"strapline":"Whenever you implement a new system, an estimate of the quantifiable justification for purchasing that new system is usually requested.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-08-23T19:45:39Z","id":"XjKcCr23vMDPJGaVK8Yf2V","meta":{"title":"Cost Analysis: Determining the ROI of Project Management Solutions","description":"Do you need help determining the ROI for implementing project management software ROI?
