You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Samsung CLP-365W is your basic <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a>. This color printer provides you with the necessities to get your printing job accomplished. It offers small dimensions, allowing it to fit perfectly on any desk without taking up too much space. It is also an energy-efficient device, consuming a small amount of power, and it is ENERGY STAR qualified. The Samsung CLP-365W may not be powerful enough to handle a business environment, but this laser printer has what it takes to be a solid choice for a home printing device.","This Samsung printer can print with a maximum resolution of 2400 x 600 dpi (dots per inch). With this maximum resolution, the printed documents are not as crisp and sharp as they could be, but we didn’t notice any blurry or extremely low-quality images. In addition, the CLP-365W provides duplex printing features. This allows you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper. Using this feature, you can save both time and money.","The CLP-365W prints black and white documents at a speed of 19 pages per minute. This is fast for a laser printer with such basic printing features. However, a big drawback to this device is its color printing speed. This printing device prints color documents at a pace of only four pages per minute. We are surprised by the large difference between black and white and color printing and are disappointed the color printing time is so slow.","The energy-saving features of the CLP-365W are worth noting. This laser printer uses approximately 350 watts of power. This is a small amount compared to several similar devices. It is also ENERGY STAR qualified. To become qualified, the product must meet a number of specifications proving it uses less energy but still contains a large selection of features.","Even though this printer doesn’t offer a vast selection of advanced features, it provides you with an assortment of printing options. This laser printer can print on a variety of paper types, including card stock, transparencies, labels and envelopes. It can also print on all different paper sizes, including paper up to 8.5 x 14 inches. This laser printer’s paper tray can hold up to 150 sheets of paper, which is an adequate number if the printer is not in constant use. However, if you print more than the average consumer does, you may find yourself restocking the paper on a frequent basis. We were disappointed the CLP-365W only offers 32MB of installed memory. This is one of the lowest amounts of memory we found on a laser printer.","When using the CLP-365W, you won’t have to worry about the printer taking up too much space. This laser printer is only 15 inches wide, 12.2 inches tall and 8.3 inches deep. It also is lightweight, weighing only 24.3 pounds. Even with the small size, the device feels sturdy and tough. There is no LCD screen to control the printer, and only a few controls are located on the device."]},"id":"e15a0a57-6d4d-4659-8874-df771a9696fd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5a357f66-b9ba-4e24-9144-f552dfd98519","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung CLP-365W doesn’t offer a large selection of features.
