While this enables you to listen to your music without having to turn up the volume, the sound range and noise reduction of this headset is not as impressive as other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-3.html\">noise-canceling headphones</a> we reviewed.","They have a frequency response of 14Hz to 22kHz. While this is wider than the normal range of human hearing, which is 20Hz to 20kHz, it is still a smaller range than the higher-ranked products on this site. These headphones won&#39;t be able to play rich, low bass tones or the supersonic high tones that products with a wider frequency range can reproduce.","The monitor function of this headset allows you to hear what is going on around you, if needed. By pressing a button, you can use the built-in microphone to pick up sounds around you, instead of blocking them out. When active, this headset can block out up to 93 percent of ambient noise, which is around 12 decibels at 200Hz.","Unlike the Sony MDR-NC500D, the MDR-NC60 can play in passive mode. This means that you can use them without the active noise-cancelation function. When it is active, these earphones have a sensitivity of 102 decibels. When they are passive, they still have a sensitivity of 100 decibels. Either way, you will be able to enjoy your music at higher volumes without much static or distortion.","One AAA battery powers the active noise cancelation of this headset. If you use an alkaline battery, you will have approximately 30 hours of playback time. However, if you use a regular lithium battery, you will only have around 15 hours of active operation time. Nonetheless, if the batteries do run out, the MDR-NC60  still work as a nice pair of sound-isolating earphones.","The 5-foot cable is detachable, so you can actively cancel out noise without listening to anything. These headphones also come with one AAA (lithium) battery, a uni-match plug adapter, an in-flight plug adapter and a carrying case. These accessories are very helpful for transporting the headset and utilizing it in various ways.","Sony offers a wide variety of help options for its products. The Sony MDR-NC60 noise-canceling headphones are covered by a one-year warranty. Email support, telephone support and online chat are all available if you have any specific questions. If you need to know more about these headphones, you can find an online user manual on Sony&#39;s site, along with a FAQs page."]},"id":"a5763c4f-fdd7-41d7-a274-79b8995df5d5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"741b7826-a9dc-4f37-af99-d5426ff21f1c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In case you want to isolate yourself from the roar of the airplane engine, or the background noise at work, these Sony earphones are a viable option.
