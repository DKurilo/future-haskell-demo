One of those weaknesses is basement windows: Thieves look for entry close to the ground. To discourage them from gaining that access and compromising the safety of your whole house, install a <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security system</a>, or take the following measures to secure your basement windows.","<strong>1. Increase Window Visibility </strong>","One common mistake homeowners make is to let overgrown shrubs and flowers block basement windows from view. Burglars take advantage of this to infiltrate the windows without being noticed.","Keep a clear line of sight to your exterior windows, especially from your neighbors. That can help deter potential thieves.","<strong>2. Block the Path to the Windows </strong>","A loud, unexpected noise is helpful for startling a thief. Place a toy that squeaks when stepped on along the path to the window. Alternatively, plant cacti or place potted plants nearby to deter and delay a burglar s attempt to enter through a basement window."," ","<strong>3. Use a Home Security Monitoring System </strong>","A good home security system can deter a would-be burglar or alert neighbors and authorities in case of a break-in. Place glass-shatter sensors near the basement windows and have cameras around the basement windows area   or install an entry sensor on the window.","<strong>4. Lock the Windows </strong>","Prevent break-ins using a good lock accessible from inside the house. Shop at a local store to find the right lock. Ensure that at least one window opens from within, and without use of a key. This is important in case you need to get out during an emergency.","<strong>5. Use Stronger Glass </strong>","Nowadays, there are many types of safety glass that can provide a modicum of security. Replace your ordinary glass with stronger stuff. Examples include tempered glass, wired glass and laminated glass.","<strong>6. Install a Window Film </strong>","Attach a window film to the inside of a glass pane. The film offers a strong deterrent to entry if the glass shatters.","<strong>7. Keep Your Valuables out of View</strong>","As you look around for stronger glass, also consider buying glass that blocks the view into your basement. When a burglar can easily see your valuables, the motivation to steal increases.","<strong>8. Install Window Bars </strong>","<a href=\"/4-reasons-to-install-window-security-bars\">Using window bars</a> is one of the most effective ways to secure your basement windows. A burglar usually passes up the chance to break into a basement window that has bars. For the best security, use permanent bars. Alternatively you can install temporary ones or those that can swing open in case of an emergency.","<strong>9. Light Up the Area Outside</strong>","Position a light near the basement window on the outside. Thieves are unlikely to breach a well-lighted window.","<strong>10. Replace Glass with Polycarbonate Sheets </strong>","Polycarbonate sheets are much stronger than glass and almost impossible to break.","<strong>11. Advertise Your Security </strong>","Place nonspecific signs and decals in visible areas showing potential burglars that you have your home well-secured.","<strong>12. Move Furniture Away </strong>","Do not provide a burglar with an easy way of climbing down from the window. Remove any chairs or tables to create a delay."]},"id":"3a5a113e-ce37-4a80-b106-24f3975bed60","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9332","url":"/12-easy-ways-to-secure-your-basement-windows","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-08T21:16:02Z","datePublished":"2015-04-08T21:16:02Z","name":"12 Easy Ways to Secure Your Basement Windows","synopsis":"Sometimes, burglars take advantage of the weaknesses to which we pay the least attention in our homes.
