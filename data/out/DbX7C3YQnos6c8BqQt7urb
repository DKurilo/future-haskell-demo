Very few internet security programs come with only a single user license; most include between five and 10 licenses. This cost is for a one-year subscription that you will be required to renew annually to stay protected.","There are several <a href=\"/best-internet-security-suites-software\">internet security programs</a> that include many of the advanced protection tools you need to secure your computer, or the exact same features as its premium solution, but come with fewer licenses and cost $20 less. For example, both <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender’s</a> and <a href=\"/trend-micro-review\">Trend Micro&#39;s</a> basic internet security programs come with three licenses, while their premium suites come with five.","The biggest differences we’ve found between internet security and premium security programs are, first, the inclusion of mobile protection, or a program that is compatible with mobile devices so you can protect both your come computers and your cellphones. The second is access to secure online storage generally used for backing up your most critical programs and files. <a href=\"/best-internet-security-suites-softwarecomodo-review/\">Comodo Internet Security Complete</a> comes with an impressive 50GB of space. That’s enough to store 75 million raw photographs.","When we considered the overall value of each premium security software, we also considered whether the program included a virus protection guarantee. There are only three programs we tested that offer this. Both <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Security Premium</a> and <a href=\"/trend-micro-review\">McAfee Total</a> have a money back guarantee if your computer becomes infected while you’re using their program and their support team isn’t able to fully recover your device. Comodo also has a protection guarantee, a $500 payout for becoming infected.","<strong>What should a premium internet security program include?</strong>","The most important consideration when choosing a premium internet security suite is how well it can protect your computer from malware threats. This includes not only Top Ten Review’s real-life and other third-party lab test results, but also several features designed to keep malware at bay. These typically include a firewall, phishing and spam filters, safe browsing and vulnerability scans. After malware protections, privacy tools set premium security suites apart from basic antivirus programs.","Test Results<br/>Of the 14 programs we tested, 10 of them blocked 96 percent of threats from infecting our computers. Most of these programs scored higher than 98 percent, though only two, McAfee and Trend Micro, scored 100 percent in our malware protection tests. We also considered other third-party laboratories and their findings to calculate an overall protection score. Considering scores from <a href=\"https://www.av-comparatives.org/\">AV-Comparatives</a>, <a href=\"https://www.av-test.org/en/\">AV-Tests</a> and other test laboratories, most premium security suites earned an overall protection score of 99 percent. Bottom line, most security programs do well at keeping your computer and other devices secure.","Malware Protections<br/>We feel the most important malware protection any antivirus or internet security program can include is safe browsing. Some programs, like <a href=\"/best-internet-security-suites-softwarecomodo-review/\">Comodo Internet Security Complete</a>, include this feature without you having to install a web extension, but most, including our top pick, <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Security Premium</a>, require an extension. Safe browsing functions are efficient at stopping malware coming through your internet browser and infecting your computer. No one wants to deal with finding and removing threats from their computer, so it’s best to stop threats before they enter your computer.","Another important feature we looked for is a firewall. While your Windows operating system comes with a firewall, research has shown it isn&#39;t very effective at protecting your system. A third-party firewall, such as the one included with <a href=\"/bullguard-review\">BullGuard Premium Protection</a>, seals any holes in your operating system’s firewall and adds another layer of protection, making it more difficult for threats, including hackers, to break into your computer. Good firewall protection is especially important if you often connect to public Wi-Fi since it will help protect your personal information from internet snoops. It also monitors your internet connections at home to make sure someone outside of your home isn’t trying to piggyback on your system and cause it to slow down.","Privacy Tools<br/>Privacy tools are included with premium internet security programs to help shield your identity and block harmful content while you’re online. We prefer programs that include a password manager, secure login tools, parental controls and safe banking tools. A less common but important feature found in the best premium security suites is a virtual keyboard. This feature lets you enter your passwords into online fields for email, bank and credit card account access without using your actual computer keyboard. This makes it more difficult for hackers to swipe your passwords with keyloggers, which can provide them access to financial, email and other sensitive information they can use to steal your identity. <a href=\"/kaspersky-review\">Kaspersky Total Security</a> is one of the products that include a virtual keyboard.","More and more security programs are including a VPN and webcam monitoring. VPNs, like the one included with <a href=\"/webroot-internet-security-review\">Webroot Internet Security Complete</a>, make you invisible to adware, browser cookies and spybots so your online history can’t be logged, tracked or used to create ads based on the sites you visit or terms you search for.","Webcam monitoring keeps a close eye on your webcam and disables it if an unauthorized person attempts to access it. This is a new trick hackers are using to spy on you and your family in your own home.
