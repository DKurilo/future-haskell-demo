Low vibration levels are important because higher levels can be dangerous to your health. Prolonged exposure to vibration can lead to hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), which can eventually result in loss of feeling in your fingers and hands and reduced ability to firmly grasp items. Also, if you feel less vibration, you&#39;re less likely to tire easily while trimming your yard.","Hitachi’s gas string trimmer is one of the lightest tools we tested. It weighs 10.3 pounds, so in spite of its considerable length, it&#39;s very easy to handle. Sometimes weed whackers can feel heavier on one end or the other, which may lead to fatigue and muscle strain more quickly than lighter trimmers. Our testers liked how the Hitachi felt and considered it somewhat balanced.","As with any gas-powered engine, you can expect this trimmer to be loud enough to require hearing protection. In our tests, on average, Hitachi’s unit produced higher decibels than most of the other trimmers on our lineup. The weed whackers we tested averaged about 100 decibels (dB), and the Occupational Safety and Health Act recommends wearing hearing protection when a worker is exposed to sounds louder than 85 dB."]},"id":"4f2e42e7-76ea-4ba1-b915-515f51f1dd4d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"9d54d4c0-dba0-4865-a547-4e67e788e899","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/x9mqWeUNUyKi7z8hyM7wMB.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52765-hitachi-gas-line-trimmer8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x9mqWeUNUyKi7z8hyM7wMB.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"x9mqWeUNUyKi7z8hyM7wMB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x9mqWeUNUyKi7z8hyM7wMB.jpg","alt":""},"id":"15ee4551-b732-4f54-82ac-5037c6a0e1c1","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hitachi gas trimmer has a cutting path of 15 inches, which is smaller than other weed eaters.
