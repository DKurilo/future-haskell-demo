Gone are the days of Apple’s touch screen hegemony. The Samsung Saga brings a Microsoft-friendly contender to the table. This user-friendly, do-everything phone will be a welcome travelling companion in any handbag or pants pocket.","Standout Features<br/>•\t2.5-inch touchscreen<br/>•\tPhysical and virtual QWERTY keyboard with stylus<br/>•\t2 MP camera with flash<br/>•\tMicroSD memory card slot","Features","The Samsung Saga touchscreen smartphone uses the Windows Mobile 6.1 operating system and has global abilities. It even comes with multiple power adapters for the road warrior.","The Saga features a 2.5-inch touch screen with a 320x320 pixel resolution. The interface doesn’t have haptic feedback so there isn’t a vibration to let you know the phone recognized a touch. Text entry is accomplished using the physical or virtual QWERTY keyboards with or without the included stylus. The physical keyboard features an optical mouse button to assist in navigating within the interface.","The Saga has a standard 2 MP camera with flash and video capture. The NightShot mode improves images shot in low light situations. It also includes the Windows Media Player Mobile for music.","Other features include Bluetooth capability, battery talk time of up to 3 hours and a modest 128 MB of built-in memory with a MicroSD slot that takes up to a 16GB card. It’s a smartphone that excels, due to its physical keyboard, at texting, typing and Word and Excel document creation. You can also view PowerPoint and pdf documents on the phone.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"88f603da-d37f-4a72-8397-0d82b26bc1e4","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["No GPS which means no turn-by-turn directions.","Uses non-standard 2.5mm headphone jack so you’ll need an adapter for a standard size headphone jack.","The Saga is a no-nonsense business tool for the practical executive on the go."]},"id":"e13eddc7-acf3-454e-a2ca-f6b5e66e645d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_28116","url":"/samsung-saga-25068-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-02-06T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-02-06T07:00:00Z","name":"Samsung Saga saga","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":37,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-02-13T23:33:18Z","id":"kTVbze9RQv8yDoK8SeoSL","meta":{"title":"Samsung Saga Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
