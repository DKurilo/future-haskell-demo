Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","FitnessGenes gives you workouts and diet guidelines that are designed to help you lose weight and gain muscle based on testing your individual DNA. We compared FitnessGenes with <a href=\"/dna-fit-review\">DNA Fit</a>, the other fitness-related <a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA testing kit</a> we researched. Of the two, DNA Fit tests more genes and has a faster turnaround, but FitnessGenes sends workouts to your smartphone and has a plan that gives you fitness and diet recommendations for 20 weeks.","DNA fitness tests are a relatively new product designed to help you achieve breakthroughs in your fitness goals. After analyzing your DNA, FitnessGenes gives you work out and diet recommendations based on four categories: fitness, losing weight, getting lean and building muscle. Within each category, you can choose from several plans, each of which gives you access to the program’s recommendations for different amounts of time.  You can also choose to just have your DNA analyzed and not pay for the diet and fitness plans. The wide range options are nice if you’re looking for something to help you with a specific fitness goal.","Once you order a kit from FitnessGenes, the box containing your DNA collection materials arrives within three to five days. Unlike DNA Fit, this company requires you to fill a small plastic vial with saliva instead of just using a cheek swab. The DNA collected is inherently the same (cheek cells), but the cheek swab is much less of a hassle than filling a vial with spit.","Your kit comes with prepaid shipping if you’re in the U.S., Canada or the U.K., and after you register your kit and put it in the mail, you’ll receive your results in two to three weeks. Once the results are ready, you can log in to a secure online portal to review your results and get any diet and fitness guides that you ordered. If you&#39;re interested in more health and disease information, as opposed to fitness recommendations, we recommend you test with <a href=\"/color-review\">Color Genomics</a>.","FitnessGenes also partners with personal trainers in many locations across the world. These trainers can help you interpret and implement your fitness plan from the company. Working with a trainer will cost more but could get you additional results.","If you’re serious about using DNA to help you get better fitness and health results, FitnessGenes offers a wide selection fitness plans that can help you achieve your goals."]},"id":"34df7a44-60cd-48b0-a912-4a73ff26fdbd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69635","url":"/fitnessgenes-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-09-26T21:03:21Z","datePublished":"2017-09-26T21:03:21Z","name":"FitnessGenes Starter","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":24,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","id":"Gb6QfvcZ4zcUsf8mip92dZ","meta":{"title":"FitnessGenes Starter DNA Testing Kit Review - How It Works","description":"FitnessGenes gives you workouts and diet guidelines that are designed to help you lose weight and gain muscle based on your DNA."},"products":[{"slug":"fitnessgenes-starter","url":"/product/fitnessgenes-starter","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","name":"FitnessGenes Starter","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","id":"HCE3PLptQanBfnkYtDyV4V","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/qYGhHXFFKBeLr3WjggEE8Y.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"5e4860d63c59b6fa6bc5d2746973a038.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/5e4860d63c59b6fa6bc5d2746973a038.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","id":"qYGhHXFFKBeLr3WjggEE8Y","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qYGhHXFFKBeLr3WjggEE8Y.jpg","alt":""},"title":"FitnessGenes Starter DNA Testing Kit Review - How It Works","description":"FitnessGenes gives you workouts and diet guidelines that are designed to help you lose weight and gain muscle based on your DNA."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/qYGhHXFFKBeLr3WjggEE8Y.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"5e4860d63c59b6fa6bc5d2746973a038.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/5e4860d63c59b6fa6bc5d2746973a038.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","id":"qYGhHXFFKBeLr3WjggEE8Y","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qYGhHXFFKBeLr3WjggEE8Y.jpg","alt":""},"title":"FitnessGenes Starter DNA Testing Kit Review - How It Works","description":"FitnessGenes gives you workouts and diet guidelines that are designed to help you lose weight and gain muscle based on your DNA."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/fitnessgenes-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"genealogy","url":"/hobbies/genealogy","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","name":"Genealogy","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:04:06Z","id":"PuNCGX8PqZvk7d7PyEvJ9P","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
