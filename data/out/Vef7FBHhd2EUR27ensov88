It also has lights so you can see in the dark during a power outage or while you camp, a digital thermometer, and a humidity meter. All these features make the Voyager a good emergency radio. However, with its poor battery life and subpar hand crank, it doesn&#39;t compare to the best emergency radios.","In our tests, two minutes of turning the Voyager Pro’s dynamo crank generated an average of three and a half minutes of battery life when the radio played at full volume. This is below our test group’s five-minute average. For comparison, the best crank radio produced over 13 minutes of battery life in the same test.","The KA600&#39;s battery reached a full charge in one hour and 45 minutes, making it the fastest-charging radio we reviewed. That said, the battery only lasted one and a half hours when we played it at full volume. The biggest downside to its subpar battery life is that you have to charge it frequently. Fortunately, it also runs on disposable batteries, so you can use the rechargeable battery as a secondary power source.","You can also charge this emergency radio with its AC adapter, built-in rechargeable battery pack, USB port or solar panel. It&#39;s one of the few radios with a solar panel you can adjust to find the optimal position to capture the sun&#39;s energy. It takes longer to charge the radio with the solar panel than using the other charging methods, but it&#39;s the easiest way, especially while you&#39;re camping.","You can use the Voyager Pro KA600 to listen to regular AM and FM radio stations, and you can access all seven NOAA weather band channels. These are invaluable stations to have access to during a disaster because they provide weather information critical to your area.","The radio received a B+ in the AM reception tests and a B in the backcountry test. In addition, it scored an A in the FM reception tests. It&#39;s good AM and FM scores mean it’s a good fit for someone that wants to use it as a traditional radio to listen to music. Its NOAA weather band reception is comparable to that of the best crank radios.","Weighing in at 19.75 ounces, this is one of the biggest and heaviest crank radios available. It’s also missing most of the emergency preparedness features the best ones have. It isn’t water-resistant and doesn&#39;t have a Morse code beacon, siren or compass. However, it has a digital thermometer and a humidity meter, which provide important environmental information.","The maximum volume is only 76.7 dB at 1 meter from the speaker, which makes it one of the quietest radios we reviewed. Louder crank radios are better for backcountry hiking because making loud noises can help search and rescue find you. ","This crank radio comes with a one-year manufacturer warranty, which is average for the products we tested. You can contact Kaito by phone or email if you have questions about the radio’s features or need to file a warranty claim."]},"id":"922d389a-14b4-448f-8484-022ecf49df53","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51600","url":"/kaito-voyager-radio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-12-15T15:56:39Z","datePublished":"2010-12-15T15:56:39Z","name":"Kaito Voyager Pro KA600","synopsis":"The Kaito Voyager Pro is a crank radio that can receive AM and FM, NOAA and shortwave radio frequencies.
