It upscales your DVDs to Full 1080p HD but doesn&#39;t support 4K content.","During our tests, the BP350 took about nine seconds to boot up. The unit also has a quick-start mode, where the player shuts off into a low-power state for faster boot ups. Unfortunately, queuing up Netflix is quite slow. Sometimes it took over 30 seconds to start a movie using the service. Menus are easy to navigate, and the player is straightforward to use, though.","We liked that LG preloaded several other apps like YouTube, Pandora and Spotify. Other streaming boxes and smart TVs require you to create accounts, scroll through app stores and install apps individually. Pretty much everything you need is on this player by default. It should be noted that most of the services aren&#39;t free and require you to subscribe and pay a monthly fee. The BP350 is also DLNA certified, so you can share audio, video and photos across your wireless network with other DLNA devices.","There is a downloadable app that allows you to control this Blu-ray player with a smartphone or tablet. This is helpful if you don’t want to add another remote to your home theater setup.","We were disappointed to see that this Blu-ray player is missing several audio outputs. It has no optical digital audio, coaxial audio or HDMI audio outputs. It does have a USB port on its front though, so you can watch movies from a flash drive.","LG provides you with a one-year warranty.
