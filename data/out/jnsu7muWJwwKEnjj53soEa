You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Bachmann Thoroughbred is an HO-scaled model that features a locomotive, hopper, gondola and caboose. This <a href=\"/best-train-sets\">electric train set</a> comes with a 47-inch by 38-inch oval track. The track pieces snap together using Bachmann&#39;s E-Z track system.","The track includes 12 curved pieces of track and two straight pieces. One of the straight pieces is the terminal, where the power source plugs into the track. The track is powered by a gray box with a dial in the center that controls the speed of the train and the direction the train goes. It is connected to the track by two wires – it is not a remote control and does not require batteries to operate.","The E-Z snap track system is not mislabeled; it really snaps together with minimal effort. The pieces snap together when you push the ends together. Even though the recommended age for this train set is 14 and up, a five year old possesses the strength to connect the train pieces together.","We evaluated each train car individually to look for any flaws in detail, paint chips or paint smudges. Right out of the box, one of the wheels fell off the tender. The wheels have little pegs that fit into the base of the train and aren&#39;t securely fastened. They snap back in easily, but it is a nuisance that the wheels come off at all.","The locomotive we received has two cabin numbers on the front of the locomotive. The number on the left side of the locomotive had some glue on top of it right out of the box. There is a plastic horn on top of the locomotive that broke off too. It was a thin piece of plastic that was flimsy. All of the paint on the locomotive looks sharp – the gold writing on the black paint pops and looks highly detailed.","The hopper, flatcar and caboose all have good paint jobs without any smudging, paint chips or other detail flaws. However, the caboose handrails on both the front and back parts of the caboose are made from flimsy plastic and bend easily.","All the train cars connect to one another by knuckle couplers. Connecting the trains together is as easy as pushing the trains together, and the couplers latch onto each other without any effort. Unlike the <a href=\"/bachmann-chattanooga-review\">Bachmann Chattanooga</a>, this model train set does not come with any additional accessories or figurines."]},"id":"9a48a8ab-8b41-43e4-b753-cec08eb4d0b3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5601a87e-7595-4482-8d80-086a427fcf39","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bachmann Thoroughbred is a fun and simple train set that features an E-Z snap-together track that truly snaps together with ease.
