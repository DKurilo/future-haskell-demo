State Farm doesn’t offer as many extra features or discount opportunities as other insurers.","Many factors influence how much you pay for your auto insurance premiums. Some of these are based on the car you drive; how old it is and how much you drive. Other factors are based on where you live, how old you are, how long you’ve been driving and your driving record. An unexpected factor that has a large influence on premium rates is your credit score. Having a score that falls in the “Good” range of 650-700 can result in you having to pay several hundred dollars more on your premium.","We looked at quotes for a variety of scenarios, including for different cars that are cheap and expensive to insure. State Farm fell in the middle range for most policies, slightly below average, but not especially low. The best prices we got were for policies that met the state minimum coverage requirements. Policies with teen drivers were toward the low end. Once more, we need to add the caveat that these quotes don’t include information about credit scores, which can change how much you pay dramatically.","Insurers typically offer discount opportunities. Standard discounts State Farm offers are for students who maintain a B average and for drivers who keep a clean driving record. We didn’t see any opportunities to earn a discount for signing up for automatic payments, a common discount other insurers offered.","State Farm has a Drive Safe &amp; Save program that provides a discount for having smart and safe driving habits. To use this program, you’ll need to use a mobile app or your car’s OnStar system to monitor your driving habits. After a certain amount of time, you’ll get a discount on your policy, which can be as much as 50%.","Rental reimbursement is a common feature for insurance policies. You can adjust how much you need, for a small increase in premiums. State Farm’s basic level is $50 a day and a total of $1,200, which is one of the largest amounts we saw."]},"id":"4796be1b-d623-4ccc-8abb-4943646fbfd5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3496","url":"/state-farm-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-08-04T15:52:23Z","datePublished":"2009-08-04T15:52:23Z","name":"State Farm Auto Insurance","synopsis":"State Farm’s auto insurance has good rates, with many falling below the average premium cost of the insurers on our lineup.","review":{"rating":68,"verdict":"State Farm Auto Insurance has decent rates but doesn&#8217;t have as many features and discount opportunities as other insurers.","pros":["The Drive Safe &amp; Save program gives discounts based on your driving patterns."],"cons":["No accident forgiveness options."]},"strapline":"State Farm’s auto insurance has good rates, with many falling below the average premium cost of the insurers on our lineup.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","id":"XosWLSieHKmbXhSvihm2VH","meta":{"title":"State Farm Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"State Farm Auto Insurance has decent rates but doesn&#8217;t have as many features and discount opportunities as other insurers."},"products":[{"slug":"state-farm-auto-insurance","url":"/product/state-farm-auto-insurance","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","name":"State Farm Auto Insurance","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","id":"j9Mc6hzDqtx3YbPucV4YYM","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/EUZYqCE65aGW65eXD6DqET.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","mimeType":"","name":"17eb2371ab50a2e527053192039a864d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/17eb2371ab50a2e527053192039a864d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","id":"EUZYqCE65aGW65eXD6DqET","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EUZYqCE65aGW65eXD6DqET.jpg","alt":""},"title":"State Farm Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"State Farm Auto Insurance has decent rates but doesn&#8217;t have as many features and discount opportunities as other insurers."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/EUZYqCE65aGW65eXD6DqET.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","mimeType":"","name":"17eb2371ab50a2e527053192039a864d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/17eb2371ab50a2e527053192039a864d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","id":"EUZYqCE65aGW65eXD6DqET","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EUZYqCE65aGW65eXD6DqET.jpg","alt":""},"title":"State Farm Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"State Farm Auto Insurance has decent rates but doesn&#8217;t have as many features and discount opportunities as other insurers."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/state-farm-review","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:28Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
