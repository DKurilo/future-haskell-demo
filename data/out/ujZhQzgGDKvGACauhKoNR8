With more than half a century of experience creating outdoor heaters, Sunglow makes the Sunglo line of heaters that are well designed, smartly constructed and highly efficient. At the time of this writing, there are four Sunglo heaters available – three freestanding and one mounted model. You can get the freestanding heaters that use either propane or natural gas fuel; the mounted model is electric and requires no outside fuel source. There are no tabletop or hanging patio heaters available from Sunglow.","The two natural gas Sunglo heaters (models A242 and PSA265) are similar in many ways. They both stand about 7 feet, 9 inches high. The two models put out the same amount of warming power – about 50,000 Btu. The big difference between these two models is that the A242 is moveable and the PSA265 is held in place with an in-ground post. The moveable models are convenient because you can rearrange them depending on your particular needs, and the in-post models are great if you want a permanent look and feel to your patio.","The other Sunglo freestanding patio heater (the A270) is very similar to the A242. The main difference between the two models is that the A270 is fueled by propane instead of natural gas. It also puts out slightly less warming power at 40,000 Btu. But that’s still enough to warm most patios. Sunglow recommends that you place these heaters about 12 feet away from each other to maximize the warming effect. It doesn’t come with a propane tank, so you’ll have to get that at your local hardware store.","The Sunglo A244 outdoor heater looks quite different from the other mounted heaters we encountered in our review. Rather than a bar design with heating coils, like that of <a href=\"/infratech-review\">Infratech</a>, this model uses the same design as the freestanding heaters. It’s meant to be mounted overhead, so you’ll need to attach it to a ceiling or awning. It works well on covered patios and gazebos. It’s just as powerful as the freestanding models, putting out about 50,000 Btu of warming energy. This outdoor heater is electrical, so you’ll need to either attach it to an extension cord or wire it into your home’s power grid. If you’re unfamiliar with electrical work, you may want to consider having a professional install it.","Unfortunately, there are no tabletop or hanging patio heaters available from Sunglow. These would be a great addition to the line because they provide more flexibility and can be positioned in more places than the freestanding and mounted models.","Sunglo&#39;s models are some of the best outdoor patio heaters you can buy. With more than 50 years to refine and improve its designs, Sunglow makes patio heaters you can expect to be a cut above the rest."]},"id":"c3613131-bf46-4ccc-a978-0e0c16f8151c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61434","url":"/sunglo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-12T16:48:24Z","name":"J.D.
