Along with its small size, we found a lot to like about it. The MP-CD1’s build quality is excellent. With dimensions of only 3.4 x 0.66 x 6 inches and a weight of 0.62 pounds, this Sony can easily fit in a pocket or suitcase without any issue. The mini projector also benefits from a sleek black metal body that gives it a clean and professional appearance.","Unlike many of the other small projectors, this one lacks a tripod, instead including automatic keystone adjustment built into its software, which automatically adjusts the display angle regardless of the projector’s physical position. Since mini projectors are designed for portability, extra accessories generally feel like clutter and not having a tripod can be a plus.","On its side, the projector sports a limited selection of connection options. The projector has an HDMI port (which is compatible with MHL inputs) for source connectivity, a USB 2.0 port and a USB Type-C port meant for charging. However, no Wi-Fi or microSD card slot limits your media source options. The device’s built-in battery can allow it to play for up to 120 minutes – more than most of the other projectors in our comparison.","One of the weaknesses of Sony’s MP-CD1 is its audio. It has a 1-watt speaker, which is less powerful than nearly all of the other projectors in our comparison. There is no physical volume button on the device, which is a bother. You’re better off using the standard audio jack and connecting an external speaker or, if you’re getting your video content from a computer, using that device’s speakers. The small speakers of the MP-CD1 are best suited for small, quiet rooms; it would definitely struggle to fill a medium or large room. All in all, it’s a hassle to get sound with the MP-CD1. It’s better suited for image-only presentations unless you also want to lug around a separate, more powerful speaker.","Image quality was middling and dull on the MP-CD1 at best. With only 105 lumens and a 400:1 contrast ratio, colorful pictures consistently felt dark and blown out. Blue colors looked more violet, and yellows took on a neon green appearance. And despite its manual focus option, the picture never felt very sharp. Images, however, consistently looked better than video throughout our testing. The projector is best for darkened rooms, rather than ones with ambient or full light.","Despite its performance stumbles, there’s still plenty to like about the Sony MP-CD1. While it’s not necessarily the strongest mini projector, the MP-CD1’s strong battery life and build quality make it a good option for users who value ease of use in an office environment."]},"id":"9b9028b5-8e05-4726-9121-b78fd5a5ab28","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70094","url":"/sony-mp-cd1-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-09T17:59:17Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T17:59:17Z","name":"Sony MP-CD1","synopsis":"Even by the standards of compact projectors, the Sony MP-CD1 is noticeably thin and portable.
