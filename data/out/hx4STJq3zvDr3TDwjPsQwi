Its <a href=\"/diy-home-automation-systems\">DIY home automation system</a> has much to offer with robust technical support and a strong community of users around the globe.","Vera&#39;s best feature is its support for remote access. This DIY home automation system’s MiOS software connects with any web browser, as well as the Android, iOS and Windows Phone smartphone app, which has an intuitive interface. Whichever way you access the system, you have complete control and can improve your home’s energy efficiency, even while you&#39;re away. Vera allows you to program the system to react to the sunrise, sunset, doorbell and much more.","The system is compatible with many different security system components such as cameras and motion detectors. Vera supports local control, so there’s less lag between your command and the hub turning on the lights. The system’s energy management features track your energy usage over time to help you cut utility costs. Like many DIY home automation systems, Vera is not compatible with home theater systems and does not support voice control technology.","This DIY system is compatible with products that use Wi-Fi, ZigBee and Z-Wave home control technologies. These control technologies are found on a variety of devices, including light bulbs, smoke detectors, door sensors and much more. This smart home system works with most smart thermostats and HVAC systems to improve heating and cooling efficiency in your home.","With Vera, you have the choice between three native hardware controllers: VeraEdge, VeraPlus and VeraLite. The VeraEdge and VeraPlus are designed for large DIY home automation systems up to 100 and 200 devices respectively. Similarly, the VeraLite series performs the same functions in a simplified capacity, supporting a maximum of 50 devices without built-in Wi-Fi. VeraPlus is the only hub with Bluetooth connectivity.","Technical support for this DIY home automation product is very good. You can contact Vera support by email, telephone and live chat if you want a direct response to your question. If you prefer to troubleshoot the system on your own, Vera has extensive options available such as a user manual, FAQs, a lively forum and tutorials."]},"id":"7f43c672-bc82-4231-a805-b10dbbd5206e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68187","url":"/veraedge-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-05T18:22:00Z","datePublished":"2016-08-05T18:22:00Z","name":"VeraEdge","synopsis":"Vera Control Ltd. offers DIY smart home controllers with good device and software compatibility.
