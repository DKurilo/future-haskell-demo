You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The EvoClear Salt Free <a href=\"/best-water-softeners\">Water Softener</a> includes a prefilter in its whole-home water softening system. The prefilter removes sediment from your water supply, while the softener neutralizes the minerals that cause hard water.","This water softener is available in two sizes: one for homes with one to four bathrooms, and one for larger homes. The smaller of these water softeners has a peak flow rate of 12 gpm; the larger unit&#39;s peak flow is 15 gpm. The manufacturer does not provide service flow rates. Both units include a sediment prefilter that removes particulates from your water supply. You need to change the cartridge in the prefilter every six to nine months, depending on the heaviness of use. Both water softener systems come with four replacement filter cartridges.","This saltless water softener is designed for use with municipal water supplies. If your home has a well, you will need to test your water to see whether iron, hydrogen sulfide and hydrocarbons are present. If they are in your water, you need to pretreat it to eliminate these compounds before it reaches the water softener system.","This saltless water softener treats water with a hardness of up to 50 grains per gallon, which is very hard water. It does not remove the calcium and magnesium that causes hardness from your water supply. Instead, it crystallizes these minerals into stable forms that do not inhibit the effectiveness of soap or bind to pipes, dishes or other surfaces. Water treated in this way does not give you the slippery feeling on your skin that salt softeners create.","This softener prevents scale deposits from forming in your pipes and removes existing hard water buildup in your plumbing fixtures. However, it does not remove chlorine or other chemicals that can affect the taste of your water. As it does not require an electrical connection or wastewater drain, you can install it almost anywhere, even outdoors. It includes the valves and fittings needed to set up the system, though additional plumbing may be required to complete the connection to your water supply.","EvoClear offers a 90-day satisfaction guarantee on its water softeners. The company also provides a lifetime warranty against manufacturer defects on all tanks, valves and parts.","If your house receives city water that is very hard, the EvoClear Salt Free Water Softener could be the best water softener for neutralizing all those unwelcome minerals. It filters out sediment, conditions hard water, reduces scale buildup in pipes, eliminates hard water stains and boosts the effectiveness of your household cleaning products."]},"id":"d5f225b7-b618-403d-9b83-f8af950b8c84","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63255","url":"/evoclear-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:22:02Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:22:02Z","name":"EvoClear Salt Free Water Softener","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-05T19:22:02Z","id":"TR9Ej3L3r9rAWUaFnzSFsi","meta":{"title":"EvoClear Salt Free Water Softener Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The EvoClear Salt Free Water Softener neutralizes hard water minerals.
