From maps to communication to RSS synchronization, Google&#39;s products are almost always head and shoulders above its competitors. Nowhere is this truer than with the <strong>Gmail Antivirus Scanner</strong>, which is an addition to every Gmail account that helps keep users&#39; computers and email accounts secure and protected.","<strong>History</strong>","The Gmail Antivirus Scanner was added to Gmail in the latter part of 2005. It has never been made public whether Google developed the software in-house or whether the company contracted with a third-party corporation to develop it. The most likely candidate is a virus- and malware-scanning application called Sophos, but Google has never confirmed whether Sophos handled the original design. Prior to the advent of the Gmail Antivirus Scanner, Gmail would not permit end users to access executable files attached to messages.","<strong>How it Works</strong>","The Gmail Antivirus Scanner works in multiple stages. It begins by scanning any attachments for hazardous code stored in a Google database. This includes not only viruses, but also some spyware and Trojans that could cause untold harm to a computer system or allow illicit access to a Gmail account.","Once the Gmail Antivirus Scanner has scanned an attachment, it will alert you if it has detected any problems. It will then attempt to remove the dangerous code from the attachment so that you can still access the file. If the problem cannot be fixed, the scanner will not allow you to download the attachment.","The Gmail Antivirus Scanner cannot read all files. It will warn you that it is unable to determine if a file is hazardous. You will then have the option to download the attachment at your own risk. If the file is contaminated, you could still suffer.","If you send an attached file that is infected with some form of dangerous software, the Gmail Antivirus Scanner will not allow recipients to access the file, preventing the spread of contamination.","<strong>Advantages and Disadvantages</strong>","Unlike most <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus software</a> that comes with online email accounts, the Gmail Antivirus Scanner is exclusive to Gmail and is not an offshoot of a third party. This is both a blessing and a curse. The scanner is intended to work exclusively with Gmail and its unique structure. The benefits are that it works as a first line of defense exclusively within the Gmail infrastructure, rather than as a blanket program added to the system that might not cover all the loopholes.","The other main advantage to the Gmail Antivirus Scanner is its coverage of outgoing mail. This prevents the spread of infection to other parties who could unwittingly be sent dangerous software that appears to come from a friendly source.","It also covers people who uses Gmail on their mobile devices, where they may not necessarily have other protective software installed. It helps to keep smartphones safe from harm. It also will not assist those who download the contents of their Gmail inboxes to independent email clients such as Outlook or Thunderbird.","The detriments are that the antivirus scanner for Gmail does not have the immense support that you would get with full, retail antivirus software from companies such as BitDefender, Kaspersky, Webroot or Norton.","While the Gmail Antivirus Scanner is a good first line of defense, it is not comprehensive enough for every user. It cannot replace security software loaded onto individual computers for additional defense against potential threats. You should use it in conjunction with fully functional security software to ensure the full safety of your computer.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "," "]},"id":"2359d190-35f5-4d3c-87f1-81c67c198be2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6224","url":"/the-gmail-antivirus-scanner","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"m-w-byrne","url":"/author/m-w-byrne","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"M.W.Byrne","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"Pe8rKrbceBgJMHtj3iRxST","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-01T19:39:32Z","datePublished":"2011-07-01T19:39:32Z","name":"The Gmail Antivirus Scanner","synopsis":"Google, and by extension the email service Gmail, is largely considered the gold standard when it comes to online lifestyles, convenience and internet security.","review":{},"strapline":"Google, and by extension the email service Gmail, is largely considered the gold standard when it comes to online lifestyles, convenience and internet security.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-07-01T19:41:39Z","id":"2V9M3ckewx4KvhPH633nca","meta":{"title":"The Gmail Antivirus Scanner","description":"An overview of the history, use, advantages and disadvantages of the Gmail Antivirus Scanner."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:57:40Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/gDgFDqzBFtQozbYrdrdvdd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"6224-the-gmail-antivirus-scanner.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6224-the-gmail-antivirus-scanner.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:40Z","id":"gDgFDqzBFtQozbYrdrdvdd","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDgFDqzBFtQozbYrdrdvdd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Gmail Antivirus Scanner","description":"An overview of the history, use, advantages and disadvantages of the Gmail Antivirus Scanner."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/gDgFDqzBFtQozbYrdrdvdd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"6224-the-gmail-antivirus-scanner.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6224-the-gmail-antivirus-scanner.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:40Z","id":"gDgFDqzBFtQozbYrdrdvdd","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDgFDqzBFtQozbYrdrdvdd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Gmail Antivirus Scanner","description":"An overview of the history, use, advantages and disadvantages of the Gmail Antivirus Scanner."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/the-gmail-antivirus-scanner","label":"","tags":[]}
