We contacted a 26-year veteran electrical engineer in Arizona and a 4-year veteran mechanical engineer in Utah. They gave us tips and told us about CAD usage in their fields, which helped us better understand what to look for and how to evaluate each program. Top Ten Reviews seeks to create unbiased and helpful reviews by researching and comparing the best affordable products on the market.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We compared the programs against each other to see which ones provided the most creative freedoms. Programs with more tools scored higher. Of course, just because software offers a tool, doesn’t mean the tool works well, so we also evaluated the power and function of specific tools to determine which ones worked the best. To do this, we scoured the internet, looking at forums and user reviews. This helped us learn what users liked and disliked most about each software and which disciplines used specific tools most.","Any features or tools that made a program more helpful earned the program a higher grade than its competitors. For instance, some programs had the ability to run simulations to discover any weak points before making physical prototypes. These programs scored higher in our comparison.","We evaluated the 3D capabilities of each software by comparing photorealistic rendering results. Software that was more realistic looking, rather than looking like an old video game, scored higher in our comparison. We also downloaded each program’s trial version to see how easy the interface was to navigate. Most CAD programs today provide large icons and easily navigable menus so you can find the tools you need quickly. But some have maintained a dated interface and are harder to use. We gave more points to programs that offer a more navigable layout. We also looked at the file and operating system compatibility of each software program. Programs that worked for both Mac and PC scored higher. Similarly, software that offered more importing and exporting options was rewarded with higher scores.","To test the responsiveness of each software’s support, we sent an email to each company. We evaluated how quickly they responded and how helpful they were at answering our questions. Each of the companies responded quickly to our emails, and they were equally helpful and courteous in their replies.","When we asked an electrical engineer of 26 years what tips he had for new CAD users, he simply stated, &#34;Get training.&#34; He elaborated by saying, &#34;Almost every CAD tool has some idiosyncrasy where you can design something completely wrong, so you need to get training. Whether that&#39;s online or taking a class – whatever it is, just get the training. Don&#39;t think that without any knowledge in the subject matter you&#39;ll be able to intuitively use the tools.&#34; ","Since CAD is such complex software, it would benefit you to attend a training course for any program you use, especially since most programs tend to have quirks that make using each program different from every other program. Fortunately, many of the software programs we evaluated provided at least basic training on their websites or YouTube channels. You can also find additional training on learning websites like <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/\">Lynda.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/\">Udemy</a>, although these courses aren&#39;t free.","<strong>How Much Does CAD Software Cost?</strong>","The answer to this question really depends on the level of computer aided design you are planning on doing. The most basic programs only cost between $100 and $1,000, and many manufacturers offer student edition licenses that last a year, either at discounted prices or for free; however, professional programs – the kind used by large corporations and design professionals – will cost thousands of dollars a year in subscriptions. Many programs also only come with a limited amount of free technical support before you’re required to pay for a subscription. These costs can add up over time, so keep that in mind when choosing your software. ","You will need to contact a sales representative to initiate the purchasing process for professional-level software and to check your eligibility for student discounts.","<strong>What Are the Different Types of CAD?</strong>","As you look at various CAD software programs, you’ll quickly realize that some programs specialize in a specific type of CAD. You want to make sure the program you buy matches the type of work you want to do. There are two basic types of CAD: 2D CAD and 3D CAD.","As the name suggests, 2D CAD mainly works with two-dimensional drawings using basic geometry like lines and shapes. According to <a href=\"https://www.designtechcadacademy.com/knowledge-base/cad-software-types\">DesignTech Systems</a>, 2D CAD was first developed in the 1970s for engineering companies. This type of software is helpful when drafting architectural blueprints, product schematics and other 2D engineering layouts.","3D CAD introduces the z-axis, so you can create more realistic models of your plans. It can be broken into three categories: wire-frame models, surface models and solid models.","<strong>Wire-frame models </strong>are best explained by picturing the 3D look of the original Tron movie. Elements of your designs are displayed as lines, and the background is visible through the design. This style isn’t as popular as it used to be, but it still has its uses, such as for artistic effect.","<strong>Surface models</strong> allow you to add textures and surfaces, such as shiny, metal car bodies, to your designs. <a href=\"https://www.indovance.com/knowledge-center/info/solid-modeling-versus-surface-modeling/\">Indovance</a> states “it lacks the &#39;watertight&#39; feature of solid modeling because if you were to cut into the design, it would be hollow.” Surface modeling is mainly used for aesthetic purposes and visualization.","<strong>Solid models</strong> apply the same attributes as surface models but also take into account weight, volume and density. This helps engineers understand how their designs work in the real world, taking into account things like gravity. This type of CAD is necessary when calculating any weaknesses or errors in your designs. For this reason, solid models are usually considered the most important and helpful category of 3D CAD.","<strong>CAD Software: What to Look For</strong>","When shopping for computer-aided design software, a few features and tools stand out as key indicators of good software. During our research, we found that tools like a command line and the house wizard were included with the best CAD software. They also often had comprehensive video tutorials and a few others.tools that helped make them more useful.","You should look for CAD tools that facilitate your specific interests. If you want to create architectural designs, for instance, you will want the best 3D modeling tools you can find. You should have the ability to create textures for different floor plans, as well as a high-functioning wall tool that makes creating walls simpler. If you don’t have a lot of experience, the house wizard is an invaluable tool that walks you through the process of building a virtual structure.","CAD programs often cater to a specific field, whether that be architectural, electrical, mechanical or technical, so you need to make sure you choose a program that best fits your needs.","Since each CAD software program has its own strengths and weaknesses, it isn’t uncommon for engineers and designers to work in multiple programs during the course of a project. You’ll just need to decide which ones work best for you. Here are some things to look for when deciding on the right program:<br/>","Warning<br/>The professional engineers we spoke to both warned us that free CAD software – and sometimes even purchased CAD software – sends data back to the manufacturer, which allows them to steal your technology and designs. You should check into any company before using their programs, especially if you want to protect your work.","Design Tools<br/>Designing 2D and 3D models is the essence of any good CAD program, so you&#39;ll want to be sure your choice has all the right tools. Some programs are only for 2D drawings or 3D modeling, but the best software has plenty of features for both.","For architectural designs, look for a wall tool and house wizard that do some of the work for you. The wizard will guide you through a step-by-step process to design a house by taking the information you provide and creating a preliminary design that you can then revise to your liking.","Photorealistic rendering is another important feature. It enables you to see what your finished designs will look like. Some programs have more realistic and powerful rendering than others and can help your designs look more professional. ","All of these tools come with a learning curve, however. The engineers we spoke to told us that since CAD programs offer so many tools and have so many features, you can expect it to take one to two years to learn how to use advanced programs like CATIA or PTC Creo. Simpler programs might take less time, but it will depend on how often you use the software and how much training you receive.","Editing Tools<br/>CAD packages should come with many different editing tools. Point markers and layer managers can help you keep your designs organized, and text and color editing allow you to keep notes and differentiate between various elements and pieces of your project. Another editing tool is the snap tool, which allows the shapes and lines that you draw to be snapped to a specific point on your drawing.","Some programs also come with 2D and 3D symbols and include models, so you can use the model as your base rather than creating each small element from scratch.","Some programs also come with an editing tool that allows you to virtually test models for weaknesses. The electrical engineer we interviewed informed us that the best programs allow you to &#34;simulate the living daylights&#34; out of your designs to find and fix any weaknesses before physical production begins, and the mechanical engineer we spoke with said that <a href=\"/solidworks-review\">SolidWorks&#39;</a> powerful error finding tools are one of the reasons why he uses that program.","Compatibility<br/>Whether you&#39;re working with a team or by yourself, you&#39;ll need to be able to present and utilize your designs. File compatibility is one aspect of CAD drawing software you don&#39;t want to overlook. DWG (a file format used in 2D and 3D drawings), DXF (Drawing Interchange Format), DWF (Design Web Format) and DGN (used for large scale projects and similar to DWG) are the most important formats to look for if you&#39;re working with AutoCAD.","Additionally, an STL export feature is handy for 3D printing. And for printing or emailing read-only files, look for PDF and various image file formats.","User Interface<br/>Many programs have resources and features to make the learning process easier. The best programs have customizable tool palettes, a command line – where you type in a command like “symbol” and the program will pull the appropriate menu or dialogue box – and the ability to import existing designs from another location.","The best programs will also have a setup manager, which lets you change the settings on your document, and macro recordings, which let you consolidate and easily access frequently used command strings.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Both 3D and 2D CAD software programs can be hard to learn, so it’s nice to have a support network to walk you through the process. Email is the main source of direct contact with many CAD software manufacturers, but the some companies offer phone support as well. Also, some technical support is only included for free for a limited time, so be sure to read the fine print before you install your software.","Video tutorials, an in-program manual and community forums are also convenient sources for additional help. Many of the websites have video tutorials and PDF manuals you can download. You can also find a wealth of helpful instructional videos on YouTube.","id:815"]},"id":"5120f972-e4cd-428d-9e27-75427bdbbeef","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_317","url":"/best-cad-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-08T22:42:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-08T22:42:00Z","name":"Best CAD Software of 2019","synopsis":"The best CAD software has lots of features, including custom tool palettes, 2D and 3D template models, and an easy-to-use interface.","review":{},"strapline":"The best CAD software has lots of features, including custom tool palettes, 2D and 3D template models, and an easy-to-use interface.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-19T20:56:38Z","id":"uXCfcnE7odHBeeJGRPNHn4","meta":{"title":"Best CAD Software of 2019","description":"The best CAD software has lots of features, including custom tool palettes, 2D and 3D template models, and an easy-to-use interface."},"products":[{"slug":"autocad-2019","url":"/product/autocad-2019","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","name":"AutoCAD 2019","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"Y7qPiLmPhWK6VFVQaa6aRd","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"turbocad-deluxe-2018","url":"/product/turbocad-deluxe-2018","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","name":"TurboCAD Deluxe 2018","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"DRS5YXrzXnToCvgfgqRV5K","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"sketchup-pro-2018","url":"/product/sketchup-pro-2018","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","name":"SketchUp Pro 2018","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"Ng3LvbJHZgAE2pVMVqJmqP","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"solidworks-2018","url":"/product/solidworks-2018","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","name":"SolidWorks 2018","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"WjKsJntXsNChKd8qgi9w7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"catia-v5","url":"/product/catia-v5","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","name":"CATIA V5","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"Pvs8ZQ9kiT7jGQWehRqSbL","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/sWNfy5CRjcJ3yzjn67Gun8.png","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-CAD-Softwarea1.png","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/P/V/775939/original/Hero-CAD-Softwarea1.png","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"sWNfy5CRjcJ3yzjn67Gun8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWNfy5CRjcJ3yzjn67Gun8.png","alt":""},"title":"Best CAD Software of 2019","description":"The best CAD software has lots of features, including custom tool palettes, 2D and 3D template models, and an easy-to-use interface."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/sWNfy5CRjcJ3yzjn67Gun8.png","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-CAD-Softwarea1.png","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/P/V/775939/original/Hero-CAD-Softwarea1.png","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"sWNfy5CRjcJ3yzjn67Gun8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWNfy5CRjcJ3yzjn67Gun8.png","alt":""},"title":"Best CAD Software of 2019","description":"The best CAD software has lots of features, including custom tool palettes, 2D and 3D template models, and an easy-to-use interface."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"home-design","url":"/home-and-garden/home-design","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","name":"Home Design","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:37Z","id":"Fqwxi7D5EypgtpdbcqvawV","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
