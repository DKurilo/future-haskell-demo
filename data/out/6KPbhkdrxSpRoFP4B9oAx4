The camera is also waterproof and has a durable exterior, making it suitable for sports and adventure filming. While not easy to mount onto harnesses, the wearable camera fits onto helmets, shoulder straps and other gear.","The full HD camera can record video in three different formats: 1080p at 60 frames per second, 720p at 120 fps or in WVGA format at 480p and 240 frames per second. This means you can choose the quality and frame rate of your video, depending on the activity you are recording. The camera also has a built-in 2-inch LCD viewfinder that makes it easy to use the zoom for photos or videos. This screen allows you to watch live action from the wearable camera without streaming to an app.","With its built-in Wi-Fi, you also have the option to stream your videos through your smartphone. You can also use the ISAW app to take remote photos, stream and control the setting on the camera.","The Sony Exmor sensor in the camera produces high-quality color and has an automatic light adjustment for taking quality photo and videos. The 4x digital zoom allows you to take close-up photos and to zoom in while recording. It has other functions, including a burst mode that takes 12 photos in rapid succession and a time lapse mode. It also has an image quality selection, adjustable resolution and a user interface for viewing photos and playing back video as you shoot.","Full waterproofing to 196 feet means that you can take the ISAW wearable camera swimming. It also features an underwater mode for taking high-quality photos when submerged. The waterproof exterior housing is also interchangeable with a backdoor casing for regular use.","The rechargeable lithium-ion battery runs for approximately two hours per charge, which is not long enough for lengthy activities but does offer enough battery life to record most sports, events and parties. You can also purchase an extra battery to extend the life of the wearable camera. A microSD card slot allows you to extend the storage up to 64GB.","With its high-quality video and photo capabilities, the ISAW Extreme is a good option for sports, cycling and event filming. However, its large design is not suitable for a chest strap, making it uncomfortable to wear except with a helmet."]},"id":"e896ad53-c4da-4b8b-a6bc-03c64e84458c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64261","url":"/isaw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T19:35:17Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T19:35:17Z","name":"ISAW Extreme","synopsis":"The ISAW Extreme's wearable camera has a Sony Exmor CMOS sensor that allows it to take quality photos and HD video.
