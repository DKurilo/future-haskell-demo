You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frigidaire FFRA0611Q1 is a basic and budget-friendly option for keeping cool during the summer. Although it falls short on a few of the energy efficiency measures we value, this <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioner</a> will still cool down a room and keep you from summertime meltdowns.","The energy efficiency ratio (EER) is 9.7, which is comparatively low when you look at the other products in our window air conditioner reviews, but it will still be impressive if you are replacing an old unit. The maximum airflow is 176 cubic feet per minute, and that is pretty good – fourth best in our lineup. Getting the air moving is one way to quickly feel the difference in a room&#39;s temperature. Reducing humidity is another. This unit does a decent job of that, removing 1.3 pints of water per hour. There is no dehumidify-only mode though. ","There are a few other operating modes that are missing on this window AC unit, too, like automatic, sleep and energy saving modes. Those are features we found in most comparable products, such as the <a href=\"/keystone-kstaw05b-review\">Keystone KSTAW05B</a>, features that can save you money on energy bills. This one also lacks a remote control. That&#39;s not the end of the world, but on a sticky hot day the distance from your chair to the console seems longer.","This unit&#39;s performance claims have been certified by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, which uses an independent laboratory to verify. That inspires confidence in the product. It lacks an Energy Star certification, though, which would put it in an elite class of products that are specifically recognized as more efficient than average.","Design elements are good but not great with this Frigidaire. It is relatively lightweight at 50 pounds. That will help make life easier when it is time to install or to take it down for the winter. It falls in the middle of the pack for noisiness, generating 52 dB. Sound levels can matter if you are adding a window air conditioner to a nursery or other bedroom.","Frigidaire backs this unit with a five-year warranty on the compressor and a one-year warranty on everything else. That&#39;s better than most. This is a manufacturer that also offers good support in other ways as well, with an informative website and lots of ways to get in contact if you have questions."]},"id":"68f2abca-f2a9-4f9d-b386-cbc0385e8d73","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4bcb63d8-3466-48fa-994d-6e5a995271f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" This unit lacks almost all of the operating modes we like for convenience and energy savings in a window air conditioner.
