We also review traditional internet providers and other web-related services, so we’ve learned the lingo and know the minimum requirements for a good user experience. Many Top Ten Reviews testers have offered their knowledge, expertise and personal experiences with satellite internet to help us understand the mechanics of how it works, what to expect from providers and when satellite internet is the best option.","In addition to relying on our own expertise, we read about other people’s experiences in blogs, product feedback and online reviews to learn about quirks of the industry and gauge what consumers can realistically expect from a satellite internet provider. We stay on top of news releases and articles about the changing market to ensure the information we provide is relevant and useful to you.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","There isn’t an easy way to test satellite internet because providers require a two-year contract, plus the installation of special equipment. Also, because speeds vary based on the plan you have, where you live, what time you are online and several other variables, it isn’t very likely we’d be able to recreate an optimal test environment. So, we pored over each provider’s website, reading terms and conditions, footnotes, and legal contracts and documents to understand exactly what you’re charged for (equipment leases, installation and activation fees) and if there are special conditions for existing versus new customers.","To get an idea of each provider’s plans, prices and coverage, we armed ourselves with eight residential addresses in popular areas, such as Tampa, Florida; Castro Valley, CA; and Springfield, VA, as well as places in Alaska, Hawaii, and British Columbia, Canada. We learned it’s tricky to get coverage outside of the continental U.S., and you need to contact providers for most information.","<strong>How Much Does Satellite Internet Cost?</strong>","Basic satellite internet packages start at $50 and gradually increase as you choose faster download speeds or more bandwidth. You can also expect to pay between $100 and $150 for installation, $15 per month to rent hardware and a one-time activation fee of $100.","<strong>Is Satellite Internet as Fast as Cable?</strong>","As with any internet connection, the speed of your connection depends on what is available in your area, the package you’ve signed up for and how many people are connected at once, both in your home and on the service provider’s network. Both cable and satellite internet connections provide packages with the optimal download speeds of 25Mbps, which is the speed experts suggest for online gaming, TV streaming services and connective multiple devices at a time. Cable internet services, however, often have packages that have higher connection speeds, some as much as 2 Gbps, while only one satellite internet service company, <a href=\"/wildblue-review\">Viasat</a>, has a package with 30 Mbps downstream speeds.","The biggest difference between most cable internet service companies and satellite ISPs is satellite internet services tend to place a monthly data use cap. Once you reach this cap your internet speeds dramatically decrease until your next monthly billing cycle begins. The biggest data package we’ve seen is 50GB, which is enough bandwidth to stream TV services, like Netflix, for about 75 hours each month, or browse social media pages for about five hours each day during your billing cycle. You can purchase more bandwidth on a month-by-month basis, but it tends to be much more expensive if you consistently need more data each month than if you invest in a cable internet service.","<strong>How to Choose a Satellite Internet Provider</strong>","Satellite internet is ideal for people living in rural areas who don’t have access to standard cable or fiber optic internet services. The best satellite internet providers offer coverage in virtually the entire continental U.S. and keep you connected to fast internet regardless of where you live.","How Does Satellite Internet Work?<br/>Though it depends on your connection and the plan you subscribe to, downstream speeds are generally faster than upstream speeds and can range from about 0.5Mbps to roughly 30Mbps – typically, they’re about 12Mbps. The downstream, or download, speed affects how long it takes to buffer movies or download music or photos, as it’s essentially how fast you can get a signal from the satellite and provider. Upload speeds range from 1Mbps to 3Mbps and affect how long it takes to share videos, pictures or music on social media sites. Typically, you have much more downstream allowance than upstream.","Each company we reviewed offers plans that differ based on speed, data or both. Low-data plans are cheaper than high-data plans, and most providers have a tool on their website to help you assess how much data you need. Truly unlimited data plans for streaming lots of movies or playing online video games don’t really exist for satellite internet because of the limited amount of satellite resources given to internet providers and the need to keep bandwidth open for other customers.","Bandwidth Threshold: More Means Multitasking<br/>Similar to a cell phone plan, each satellite internet plan allots you a certain amount of data to use per month, usually somewhere between 10GB and 50GB. With most service providers, if you go over your allotted data, your speeds are throttled – you can still access the internet but at much slower speeds until the next month, when your data limit refreshes. However, some companies allow you to pay for a small amount of additional data once your go over your original limit, though usually no more than a couple of gigabytes.","Another thing to consider when looking at satellite internet providers is whether a company offers unlimited, unmetered or extra internet access during off-peak or early-bird hours, usually between midnight and 8 a.m. Depending on the provider, during those hours you can download large files without it counting against your allotted data for the month. This feature helps balance the monthly data caps and gives you a little more enjoyment for your money.","Account &amp; Contracts: Know Your Options<br/>When you purchase satellite internet you usually have to sign a contract with the provider, typically for two years. Talk with the provider you choose to see whether it can lock you in at its introductory price for your entire contract term or find out if that cost rises after a few months.","In case you travel and are away from home for long periods of time, most providers offer hibernation plans. They stop your service but maintain your contract, though the company may still charge you the same or a reduced cost each month.","You can cancel your service before your contract term is up, but you will most likely have to deal with early termination fees. Many companies charge a large lump sum plus an additional fee for each remaining month in your contract, but this varies by provider.","Equipment &amp; Installation: What’s Included<br/>It takes roughly three to four hours to install a satellite dish, and it must be done by a licensed professional using company-provided equipment. There are no options to install any part of the system yourself or to use cheaper equipment. Some companies provide a 90-day warranty on the installation, but not all do. After this small window closes, most satellite internet providers charge you to have someone come out to reposition your dish or troubleshoot your system.","You can purchase the necessary equipment up front or make a monthly lease payment. While it may be cheaper to buy the equipment outright, you don’t get the same warranties and equipment upgrades that come with leasing. Some providers offer free installation if you choose to lease. Make sure the installer checks that your router and other equipment work before leaving, and most can help you connect your internet-enabled devices during the installation visit."]},"id":"3ee0db08-cb80-40c2-a0ad-d9034696e6fa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_178","url":"/best-satellite-internet-providers","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T22:08:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T22:08:00Z","name":"Best Satellite Internet Providers of 2019","synopsis":"We judged satellite internet providers on their optimal speeds, data allowance, technical support options, and whether they throttle bandwidth.","review":{},"strapline":"We judged satellite internet providers on their optimal speeds, data allowance, technical support options, and whether they throttle bandwidth.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-20T15:00:11Z","id":"HybesbUJ5ozLjEbxDTCMN9","meta":{"title":"Best Satellite Internet 2019 - Rural High-Speed Internet Providers","description":"We judged satellite internet providers on their optimal speeds, data allowance, technical support options, and whether they throttle bandwidth.\t"},"products":[{"slug":"hughesnet-gen5","url":"/product/hughesnet-gen5","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","name":"HughesNet Gen5","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"uYNY4ni8FWKUTiWTukJ26g","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"dish","url":"/product/dish","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","name":"DISH","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"VDy9HKYtuGKS6D8aJ4kuMR","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"viasat","url":"/product/viasat","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","name":"Viasat","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"oxyJXk8YkxVAaBaLsHjPwM","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"earthlink","url":"/product/earthlink","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","name":"EarthLink","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"rnbYVTwHXu98baFNgmf9yM","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:07:28Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/nD55Pfjn6MN2qu3SucRij4.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Satellite-Internet-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/I/B/795107/original/Hero-Satellite-Internet-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"nD55Pfjn6MN2qu3SucRij4","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nD55Pfjn6MN2qu3SucRij4.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Satellite Internet Providers of 2019","description":"We judged satellite internet providers on their optimal speeds, data allowance, technical support options, and whether they throttle bandwidth.\t"},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/nD55Pfjn6MN2qu3SucRij4.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Satellite-Internet-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/I/B/795107/original/Hero-Satellite-Internet-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"nD55Pfjn6MN2qu3SucRij4","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nD55Pfjn6MN2qu3SucRij4.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Satellite Internet Providers of 2019","description":"We judged satellite internet providers on their optimal speeds, data allowance, technical support options, and whether they throttle bandwidth.\t"}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"internet","url":"/electronics/internet","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","name":"Internet","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:27Z","id":"LCUKUvCZbgdUfBxKowMKeK","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
