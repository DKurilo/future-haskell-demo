Though it has no power manager setting or upscaling capability, it lets you optimize picture and audio quality for both Windows and Mac.","The movie player is compatible with any Windows or Mac machine. Since Windows 8 and 10 no longer have native media players, this is a decent, low-cost option. It is also compatible with any digital file type, including 4K, and can play it losslessly in HD. While it played Blu-rays effortlessly, we could not get it to read standard or rewritable DVDs in our testing.","You don&#39;t have to wait long to watch your favorite movies, thanks to the digital video player&#39;s capacity to load files and discs rapidly. However, once it starts playing, it is a CPU hog, taking up an average of 44 percent with no other programs running. For comparison, <a href=\"/leawo-blu-ray-player-review\">Leawo Blu-ray Player</a> only uses four percent of your processing power.","It has Dolby and DTS support, and all audio has lossless playback for a crystal-clear listening experience. You can stretch the player to fit your screen dimensions and even stretch the time. Unlike other players, it lacks HD and 3D upscaling capacity.","With the customizable skins option, you can make the player really look yours. You can even post to social media and share what movie you&#39;re currently watching along with a comment about it. However, the program is missing some smaller features found in other video player software, such as BD-Live support, environmental settings and the capacity for a virtual remote control. While none of these omissions will negatively affect your movie marathon, they reduce the software&#39;s ease of use.","Despite missing a few features, the program does give you the standard features, such as auto-resume playback, which remembers where you leave off in a movie and starts playing it from there next time you play it. It also lets you modify the hue, brightness and saturation of the picture quality and stretch the time to be slower or faster in the video.","This Blu-ray player software offers many customer service options. You can contact Aiseesoft&#39;s technical support team via email if you can&#39;t find the answer to your question in the extensive FAQs or tutorials portion of its site. However, unlike some other software options, this one does not have a user forum on the manufacturer&#39;s website, which would allow you to connect and talk with fellow users.","If you have an extensive movie library of digital video files, the Aiseesoft Blu-ray Player is an acceptable option for you, since it can play any digital file type losslessly. You can tweak picture and audio settings for a better viewing experience, and it is compatible with the latest Windows and Mac operating systems. However, it lacks upscaling abilities, any power-saving functionality and various smaller features."]},"id":"0f2d0c27-fd3f-45ea-a4c2-f8140f19c4be","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57703","url":"/aiseesoft-blu-ray-player-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
