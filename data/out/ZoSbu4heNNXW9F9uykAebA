This evaporative humidifier differs quite a bit from the others that we reviewed because it is designed to keep whole-house areas – up to 3,200 square feet – fully humidified and comfortable, even on the driest days.","At 22 inches long and 17 inches high, the Lasko 1128 is a little bigger than the other models we reviewed. This larger size accommodates a water tank that holds 4.5 gallons. You’ll still find yourself filling it up once or twice a day as the average output is around 9 gallons of water in a 24-hour period -- about three times the output of typical large-room humidifiers. Too much moisture in the air can promote mold and mildew, so this unit works best in an open-plan living area, perhaps with high vaulted ceilings, where doors and walls do not cut off the free flow of air.","The design and function of this unit has many worthwhile features. The mist, for instance, blows upwards, forcing the hot air at the ceiling to fall and help keep the room warm. The unit’s humidistat is another useful addition. You can buy your own, but it’s nice to have it right there telling you how much moisture is in the air at any given time. With instant access to such information, you can easily make different choices about output levels.","This humidifier is designed to humidify a lot of air, and it does very well, even on the lowest speed. However, when you’re sitting right next to the unit and have it on high speed, it’s too noisy for normal conversation.","The Lasko 1128 is an evaporative humidifier that operates by using a fan to blow air across a moist filter.","It does not offer warm mist. However, for whole-house humidification, the cool mist function is much safer for small children or pets anyway. It also does not offer features to combat microbial growth. Regular maintenance and cleaning can control the growth of bacteria and molds and is a requirement for keeping any humidifier running at its best. But with this unit in particular, because of the sheer volume of moisture it puts out, you will want to keep to an up-to-date cleaning and disinfecting schedule."]},"id":"a7f09e7e-7036-41fa-ba84-c3c92ff06f35","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"35bed719-b9c8-4fe2-a69c-653b165d4b29","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This appliance is missing some of the features found in other humidifiers, but the quantity of moisture it produces is exceptional.
