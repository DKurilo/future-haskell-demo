We spent more than 60 hours testing and researching the best slide to digital image converters, learning about how to handle older media formats, evaluating alternative options and keeping up with the industry. We know that your classic photos and film are precious, so we want to make it as safe as possible to preserve your memories in an updated format.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","In order to fully evaluate a product lineup, we first research every facet of the category. For slide to digital image converters, we gathered information about older media formats, including the most popular sizes and how to properly clean and store old slides. In addition to this general knowledge, we researched converter-specific information to narrow down our options to only the best image converters. Then, we conducted hands-on testing with the best products on the market to find out the things you can’t learn from a specs sheet. We ran various formats of media through the machines to test their user-friendliness, features, performance, efficacy and end results.","<strong><strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying Digital Image Converters</strong></strong>","<u>Format Compatibility</u><br/>When choosing a converter, it’s best to start with a good idea of the kinds of media you need to digitize. Every slide to digital converter in our comparison can convert 35mm slides and negatives, so in addition to that, we specifically looked for slide scanners that could accommodate other types of media, such as 110 slides and negatives, 126 slides and negatives, Super 8 film and even physical photo prints. We found that the capabilities of these converters tend to fall into one of two categories: able to convert all slide and film formats but not Super 8 or physical prints, or able to convert 35mm slides and film, along with physical prints, but nothing else.","The best slide to digital image converters come with plastic frame holders for each media size they are compatible with. These secure each slide or piece of film and keep it flat while the converter scans and digitizes it. High-quality plastic frames should allow you to gently maneuver the film or slides without bending, damaging or smudging them. ","<u>Speed</u><br/>These inexpensive slide and negative scanners work slowly, loading either one strip of film at a time or up to three slides at a time. While this isn’t horrible if you only have a small number of slides to convert, it can be unbearably time consuming if you have boxes upon boxes of classic media that needs to be digitized. Plan on it taking upwards of one minute per slide. If you have a high quantity of slides to convert, you may want to consider a professional scanner service.","<u>Image Resolution</u><br/>The output resolution of a slide to digital image converter indicates how clear the digital images will be in megapixels (MP). A larger output resolution usually means a clearer and more detailed digitized image. This also  means you can enlarge the image while still retaining quality, and higher-resolution images can be easier to edit.","Keep in mind that these converters aren’t magic and, as such, can’t make a low-quality image suddenly clearer. If you have a fuzzy old photo, you won’t end up with a high-resolution image. A small, low-resolution slide or print won’t necessarily look better digitized, nor will it hold up if you’re hoping to blow it up to an enormous size. The software within these machines can’t work that level of miracle. Given this, we mildly favored converters that claim a 22GB output resolution, but we didn’t heavily penalize those that don’t in our rankings.","What you can expect are slight improvements thanks to the image-editing options built into these devices. Many include exposure and color balance options, which let you brighten a dark image or adjust the coloring. Some scanners include a companion CD with even more image editing software compatible with both PC and Mac systems. Even with the accompanying disc, none of the converters have extensive editing abilities, especially compared to powerhouse programs like Adobe Photoshop. All you can really do is slightly brighten or darken a photo or tweak the red-blue-green composition.","Most models let you save images to an SD card to view on a compatible device, and many also have a TV-out jack so you can display images on your TV. If you don’t need to see a large, high-definition version of your images, any unit with an onboard screen will let you preview all the images that you have saved.","<u>Physical Design</u><br/>Slide scanners generally fall under one of two build designs: a small unit the size of a grapefruit meant solely for slides and negatives, or a larger unit roughly twice as big and capable of handling slides, negatives and multiple sizes of physical prints. No unit weighs more than 5 pounds, so they’re easy to move around. Most converters we reviewed have standalone operation and don’t need to be connected to a computer to function. Some units also have rechargeable batteries so you’re not tethered to an outlet.","Most converters require an SD card to work, so the best models include one in the package. Some devices are also accompanied by the necessary cables and a user manual. We found converters with cables and ports located in the rear of the device are easiest to use because they keep the wires out of your way. We also favored devices with SD card ports located on or near the front of the device because they’re easy to access.","Models with built-in color screens give you a preview of your images before and after converting. Most measure around 2.5 inches, so while they give you an idea of how your photos will look once converted, the preview is small. Screens that were angled upward slightly were easier to view on a table than those that faced straight forward.","In addition to displaying an image preview, some screens let you select a format, adjust color and exposure, or view all the images you’ve converted so far. Most of the devices we tested have similar menus with the same set of choices, though a few are particularly easy to navigate.","<u>Color &amp; Exposure Adjustment</u><br/>Sometimes classic media, like film negatives and slides, can fade or become discolored over time if not properly stored. Thankfully, most slide to digital image converters let you adjust color and exposure for each image right on the device.","What kinds of editing features are availability vary by device. Some allow you to make digital edits before converting, so you can see what the final product looks like before conversion, whereas others only let you make edits after digitizing the image. We recommend a converter that lets you edit the image before conversion; that way you don’t end up with multiple copies of each picture.","We found that the best devices give you granular control over how much red, green and blue you can apply to each picture, rather than preset amounts. The same goes for adjusting the brightness for your image.","If you don’t feel like you have a knack for doing these kinds of edits, or would rather not fuss with them directly on these devices, you have other options. You can use external software like Adobe Photoshop to clean up and adjust your newly digitized images, or you can send them off to a professional photo editing service.","<u>Standalone vs. Computer-Dependent Converters</u><br/>There are two main types of digital converters - ones with standalone functionality and ones that must be connected to a computer to work. Standalone converters are the smaller of the two and have small display screens built into them, which you can use to preview and edit your images or navigate the menu to find other settings. This style of converter is easy to move around and woke take up much space when in storage.","The other option is converters that require a hard connection to a computer to run. These converters are much larger than standalone converters and are most commonly flatbed scanners. They do not have a built-in screen and their bulky design makes them somewhat difficult to move around, so we recommend leaving them out on your desk. Consider what you’d prefer before just buying one.","<u>Help &amp; Support</u><br/>For the most part, these devices are designed to be user-friendly, with simple interfaces and handy user manuals that accompany the scanner in the box. Many manufacturers also provide you with multiple resources as a means for you to troubleshoot problems or learn how to use a specific feature. Most companies also host informational resources on their websites, from walkthroughs and video tutorials to digital user manuals, a hearty FAQs section and an active community user forum. The best companies should also provide you with at least one method of contacting their customer support representatives, should you ever need to discuss a question with them directly.","<strong>Cleaning Your Media Before Scanning It</strong>","For many people, their old slides, negatives and printed photos are stored in a closet, basement or attic, where they are susceptible to dust, mold, water damage or even fire. As a result, these slides can be coated in grime and particles that make it difficult for a slide to digital image converter to do its job. If you digitize your classic media without first cleaning it, any gunk on them will also appear in your converted image.","Few slide to digital image converters have a built-in scratch removal feature, or come with basic photo editing software, so it’s important to try and remove as much debris as possible from each of your slides or negatives beforehand. All the converters in our comparison do come with simple soft brushes for your media, which generally do a good job of removing most debris. However, you can also try using a soft cloth, compressed air or anything else along those lines.","Even after using a brush or cloth, you may still see imperfections in your newly digitized photos. If that is the case, Photoshop or another photo editing software may remove unwanted scratches or dirt or revitalize color. You can also trust your classic media to a professional conversion service, both of which we’ll talk about in the next section. ","<strong>Using Photo Editing Software to Touch Up Your Converted Photos</strong>","Once you’ve digitized your old photos, you may still want or need to touch them up a bit before saving or sharing them. And although many of the slide to digital image converters in our comparison have basic exposure and color adjustment options built into them, those basic options may not be enough. Some of the converters come with a CD containing simple photo editing software whose tools and capabilities are more than sufficient for the majority of users.","However, for users who want to polish their digitized image collection beyond what these converters can offer, we recommend using Adobe Photoshop or a comparable program after digitizing your files to get the best results. With this type of program, you have much more control over colorization, exposure and spot correction, as well as other tools to edit and enhance your cherished memories. Those experienced in using these kinds of applications can even perform much more advanced edits, such as removing unsightly background objects in the photo, as well as spots and other blemishes.","If your images need extensive editing and you don’t own or know how to use photo editing software, there are a variety of services online that you can use. Typically, these services can clean up your images and even apply artistic touches if desired. You can also opt for a professional service or find a willing freelancer through a site like <a href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design/buy-photos-online-photoshopping\">Fiverr</a>.","<strong>Professional Photo Scanning Services</strong>","Whether you’re hesitant about buying an image converter you’ll only use for a day or two, or you simply don’t want the hassle of manually digitizing your classic media, you can send them off to a professional photo scanning service, like <a href=\"https://www.memoriesrenewed.com/\">Memories Renewed</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digmypics.com/\">DigMyPics</a> or <a href=\"https://www.scancafe.com/\">ScanCafe</a>. Many of these businesses offer editing, retouching and printing services as well, so it may be more worthwhile in the long run to send off your slides and film negatives rather than dealing with them yourself.","From our research, we found that the best photo scanning services are upfront with their pricing and other pertinent information. They should provide details regarding what image sizes and formats they can work with, their price per image, whether or not they work with damaged media, what digital and physical output options they have as well as what their turnaround time is. You should also be able to easily find information about shipping liability, minimum order requirements and how to submit your film and slides.","In addition to researching the logistics of a particular photo scanning service, you should also look at customer reviews and how others rate their services. Remember to read both good and bad reviews of a business, especially for services that match what you’re needing.","<strong><strong>How to Properly Store &amp; Handle Film Slides &amp; Negatives</strong></strong>","Few things are more fun than the rush of nostalgia that accompanies looking through old photos. But if you don’t store your physical media properly, they can become damaged or deteriorate over time and ultimately become difficult or impossible to see, let alone digitize. But with a few tips, you can learn how to safely store film slides, negatives and even physical prints so they can stay in pristine condition for years to come.","Many people store old media in basements, attics or garages, not knowing that these environments can actually be dangerous for physical print media due to a lack of climate control and other factors. Ideally, you want to store photos, negatives and slides somewhere that is consistently cool and dry. You want to avoid basements, garages and attics because temperatures are likely to flux, as are both humidity and light in these spaces.","In addition to providing a stable storage location for your physical media, there is still more you can do to ensure they are stored and handled safely. Due to the chemical nature of slides, negatives and prints, they are susceptible to damage when they touch each other and when you touch them. We recommend storing photos with sheets of acid-free paper between them to prevent color changes, fades or worse – photos that are stuck together. You can also store photos individually in archival-grade plastic sleeves and containers that are designed with high levels of alkalinity to slow or prevent disintegration.","When physically handling your media, we recommend washing your hands before doing so, or wearing cotton gloves so as to limit the amount of damaging dirt and natural oils touching your photos. Of course, another option is to digitize them with an image converter, like the ones we tested here. Converting your physical media allows you to keep a digital copy of your memories, which can be easily stored on a hard drive.","<strong>Best Ways to Store &amp; Share Your Digitized Photos</strong>","Once you get your classic media all polished and converted, you’ll need somewhere to store your digital photos. It’s also good practice to make a copy of your photos as a backup. Most slide to digital image converters initially save your digitized photos to an SD card, and from there you can transfer them to a computer. Keeping them on your computer works well enough, but we recommend storing them on an external hard drive in case your computer crashes. You can also display a few of your favorite images on a <a href=\"/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital photo frame</a>.","There is also the option to store your digitized images online. If you’re already a dedicated Google or Apple customer, both companies have photo storage services you can take advantage of. You can also opt for a third-party cloud service like <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a>, <a href=\"http://photobucket.com/\">Photobucket</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>, among others. These services provide low-cost or free hosting.","You can also store your images on social media. Sites like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a> are designed to showcase photos over other types of media, and are free to use. There are also social media sites dedicated to photographers - <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\">Behance</a> and <a href=\"https://500px.com/\">500px</a>, for example. Or if you’re wanting an online portfolio, you can create a website that can host your images for little to no cost through sites like <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\">Squarespace</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/\">Wix</a>."]},"id":"1275a109-efe4-4855-95c1-b8610e3fbc7e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"5702b7d1-91b3-44dd-ba2a-2209ee4ca66d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VVPPF7S/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Wolverine Titan</a>","<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6*ivFEQ&mid=38606&u1=TTRSlidetoDigitalConverter&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fkodak-scanza-digital-film-scanner%2F6228537.p\">Kodak Scanza</a>","<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6*ivFEQ&mid=38606&u1=TTRSlidetoDigitalConverter&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fkodak-mini-digital-film-scanner%2F6325584.p\">Kodak Mini</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DIGITNOW-Scanner-Converts-Negatives-Impressive/dp/B0781FWMGZ/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Digitnow</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8900250-10585347?sid=TTRSlidetoDigitalConverter&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hammacher.com%2Fproduct%2Fslide-and-negative-to-digital-picture-converter-1&cm_mmc=CJ-_-3486349-_-8900250-_-Special%20Values%20%26%20Hammacher%20Schlemmer\">Hammacher Schlemmer</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KKDL3N/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Veho Smartfix</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BJFE2OY/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">ClearClick</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Slide-Negative-Converter/dp/B073RFGSLF/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Sharper Image</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038WJXIM/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">ION Pics 2 SD</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCFD7MA/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Zonoz</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"9a79d275-b834-42b2-a228-4e971925184e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1057","url":"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-07T19:47:21Z","datePublished":"2017-09-05T17:59:22Z","name":"Best Slide to Digital Image Converters","synopsis":"Bring your old slides, negatives and other outdated film back to life with these slide to digital image converters.","review":{},"strapline":"Bring your old slides, negatives and other outdated film back to life with these slide to digital image converters.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","id":"sDjQA6MsQGPV4Fgfg5Dfo4","meta":{"title":"Best (Sub-$200) Film Scanners of 2019 - Convert Slides & Film to Digital","description":"We spent over 30 hours testing 12 slide-to-digital-image converters in our lab.
