You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Magnavox’s MDR868H is a good <a href=\"/best-dvrs\">DVR</a> option for those who like to watch a variety of content and need lots of storage and port options. However, it only has two tuners, which isn’t ideal for large households. It can access video and audio streaming services and is feature rich.","You can record up to 500 hours of HD content or 2,000 hours of standard-definition content on the 2TB internal hard drive. It also has two tuners, giving you the option to either record two shows simultaneously or record one while watching another at the same time. While this gives you some flexibility, it is somewhat limited compared to the best DVRs, which have at least four tuners. It isn’t the best option if you have multiple people in your household or there are scheduling conflicts.","The DVR recorder can access and record content from a variety of sources, including cable and any over-the-air shows via an antenna. It can’t record anything from a satellite, but it can capture from on-demand as well as audio and video streaming services. The device also doubles as a DVD player, and you can store digital copies of your DVDs on the DVR’s hard drive, making it easy to access TV content alongside your personal collection. You can skip commercials while watching recorded content, and simple parental controls let you block your children from viewing inappropriate content at any time. The device also has built-in Wi-Fi.","Since it has a wide variety of ports, you have control over what you connect the DVR. Its port selection includes a USB port to connect additional external storage, as well as ports for an HDMI cord, Ethernet cable, coax and composite video. However, it doesn’t support 4K connectivity.","You can contact Magnavox’s technical support team via phone or email if you have questions or issues with the product. The company also has a few informational sources available on its website. The digital video recorder is one of the largest on our lineup, measuring 16.5 inches wide, 12 inches deep and just under half an inch tall. It weighs 7.3 pounds, so make sure you have room to store the device in your entertainment center before purchasing."]},"id":"3b71cea1-f23c-4b96-a2ce-68074643725d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f9e1f73d-ef1a-4637-bcfb-6adf6dbf0896","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magnavox MDR868H is a solid DVR in most respects.
