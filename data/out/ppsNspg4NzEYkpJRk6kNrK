You can use this headset for up to seven hours of continuous use, and the standby battery life lasts up 11 days. If you want to use this all day at work, it will hold up better than other Bluetooth headsets. However, the DeepSleep mode shuts off the device whenever it hasn&#39;t been used for 90 minutes, requiring you to wake it up with the press of a button whenever you want to use it. This can extend the battery standby life  up to 180 days, making this a great headset for the casual user.  <br/><br/>"]},"id":"0b412726-0fcf-4916-a482-3e3cf22a2f70","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ffe2bc86-0554-40e4-8ed2-47291465af95","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With an excellent battery life and few buttons, the Plantronics Marque 2 is a great Bluetooth headset for new and casual users.
