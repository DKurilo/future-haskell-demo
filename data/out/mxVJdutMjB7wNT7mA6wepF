Without question, online dating has expanded the social circles of millions, making it possible to find people with common interests with a minimal of effort. Though most online daters have good intentions, some may not. <a href=\"/best-background-check-services\">background check</a> services can be used to verify the identity of potential friends and dates before you meet, saving you from disappointment or worse.","For those who are part of the online dating scene, it s important to keep in mind the risks that come along with the benefits. There are some people who use online dating services and social networking sites to deceive and take advantage of others. People have formed relationships with people through the internet only to find out later that their partner was lying about being single, hiding a criminal past or sex offender conviction or using the relationship to get money. That s why it s so important to find out as much as you can about potential friends and dates before committing to anything.","Most online dating sites offer a set of rules to help people avoid being hurt emotionally, physically or financially. The most important rule is to meet in public places for the first few dates to ensure safety if one of the people have bad intentions. Another good rule is not to give out personal information, especially financial information and addresses, early in the relationship. This kind of information shouldn t be shared until a couple is considering serious commitments.  ","But many problems with dishonest online daters and scam artists can be avoided with another recommendation from online dating sites. These sites recommend doing a background check on potential dates before the relationship progresses very far, even before meeting in person. An online dating background check is useful for finding out if a potential date has been honest about themselves in their profile and in conversation. The online dating background check can reveal important things like whether someone is married, has a criminal record, a sex offender conviction, declared bankruptcy or has some other significant financial problems.","By doing an online dating background check you can verify the person you have grown attached to is really who they say they are. One story we read about online dating, which can be found <u><a href=\"http://www.lovestory.com.au/Ugly/blinded-by-loves-story.htm\">here</a></u>, told the tale of a man who waited too long to conduct an online dating background check. He had already married his online sweetheart when he found out she had lied about several parts of her past and was still married to someone else.","These kind of catastrophes are devastating, but they can be avoided with a simple online dating background check. While they do cost money, they could end up saving you money and grief in the future by finding out if your online sweetheart is telling the truth about themselves.","Check out or reviews of the top services to find the online dating background check that s right for you."]},"id":"e73e888f-3612-4170-a142-cbf3ccd5d3d3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_371","url":"/why-do-an-online-dating-background-search","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"dan-hope","url":"/author/dan-hope","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"Dan Hope","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"ciX3esGRJxxonvFVhNC6p6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-04-15T16:39:21Z","datePublished":"2011-04-15T16:39:21Z","name":"Why Do An Online Dating Background Search?","synopsis":"There are thousands of success stories from online dating, thousands of couples that are enjoying the benefits of the Internet.","review":{},"strapline":"There are thousands of success stories from online dating, thousands of couples that are enjoying the benefits of the Internet.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-22T21:14:47Z","id":"mxVJdutMjB7wNT7mA6wepF","meta":{"title":"Why Do An Online Dating Background Search?","description":"There are thousands of success stories from online dating, thousands of couples that are enjoying the benefits of the Internet.
