The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">Infrared Grill</a> here. </em>","The final product in our infrared grill lineup is the Grill2Go Ice. Chari-Broil designed this grill and cooler combo for outings such as camping and tailgating parties. It’s put together much like a standup suitcase for convince and portability. The Grill2Go Ice doesn’t have many of the features we looked for in infrared grills, but we feel that it would make an excellent second grill for occasions such as tailgate parties or camping trips.","When we first saw the Grill2Go Ice, we assumed that, due to its size, it would come pre-assembled. Unfortunately, it only comes partially assembled. You still have to do a bit of assembly work yourself. However, that isn’t too much of a chore. The instructions are easy to follow, and it should not take you more than an hour.","Chari-Broil designed this infrared grill for use with a portable, one-pound propane tank. This is fine considering the grill’s size and form factor. However, these portable tanks only last for one or two grilling sessions at most. You can adapt the Grill2Go Ice to take a 20-pound tank if you have the expertise. If you don’t, we recommend keeping a few spare tanks in your car, just in case.","The grill portion of the Grill2Go Ice utilizes Chari-Broil’s patented infrared grilling technology so there is no exposed flame. No flames means you won’t have flare-ups and your meat retains more of the juice and flavor that caused you to bring your grill along with you in the first place.","Unlike most of the products on our infrared grill lineup, the Grill2Go Ice takes about fifteen minutes to heat up to proper grilling temperatures. Contrast that with the ultra-fast heat times between three and seven minutes clocked by our gold, silver and bronze award winners. While 15 minutes isn’t an eternity, it&#39;s definitely a wait that could be slashed by Char-Broil.","The grilling surface on the Grill2Go Ice measures 290 square inches. That is a good size; it&#39;s larger than several infrared grills that ranked higher on our lineup. This much space is enough to cook about eight burger patties or a couple of good-sized steaks.","The form factor of the Grill2Go Ice makes it great for camping and tailgating parties. If you’ve ever operated a standup suitcase, transporting this infrared grill will be second nature. When fully assembled, the Grill2Go Ice weighs a hair less than 45 pounds. However, once you load the coolers up with food and drinks, it can become quite heavy.","The portable nature of the Grill2Go Ice makes it a just-the-basics grill. There are no fun extras such as a rotisserie, side burner, warming rack, smoker box or anything else that could fine-tune your barbecue into an experience to remember. However, the Grill2Go Ice is quite conducive to grilling in a parking lot outside a stadium or in a cramped camping space."]},"id":"da3d6204-317b-4490-a324-15b50fe608da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f0f94932-d83a-45b0-b895-bd54ccbc6473","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Grill2Go Ice is not a bad infrared grill.
