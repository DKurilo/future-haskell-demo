At only 2.4 pounds, 9.9 inches wide and a depth of 5.3 inches this little printer can fit only any desk no matter how small. The average resolution of 4800 x 1200 is good enough for the average user out there however not as amazing as we would like to have seen from HP. The one big thing that makes this printer shine over many of the others is its ability to print in more than just one size. The HP Photosmart A646 provides a unique way of printing photos from the majority of devices and in a variety of sizes."]},"id":"420cc74f-0d3a-493c-a3a3-a9bcc0b4ed19","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output"},"id":"8f51b87e-79f4-486d-890e-b2ac36a5adaa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Photosmart A646 cost about the same as some of the other top photo printers on our site but offers a few extras that they don’t. One of the main features that makes the A646 different from any other is the fact that it can print more than just the typical 4 x 6 photo. Instead it can print 5 x 7 and also 4 x 12 inch photos in panoramic mode which is quite a big difference when talking about the small size and versatility of this printer. The 3.5 inch touch screen display makes it possible to navigate from picture to picture and even edit your pictures without the use of a computer or laptop. One of the complaints however is that the touch screen display can be a little confusing and doesn’t always respond the first time. That being said it is a very large screen compared to most and gives you a wide range of options for making each photo unique. The SD card slot, memory stick and XD-Picture card slots makes it possible to load almost any photo directly onto the printer without the need of a computer.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"0ebad530-aa18-4585-ad7f-babaf817eff6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ae88d2ee-20b6-405c-a7bc-07f0d0acc445","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are the kind of person looking to get a photo printer that can print photos in various sizes and still holds true on color than the HP Photosmart A646 may be the choice for you.
