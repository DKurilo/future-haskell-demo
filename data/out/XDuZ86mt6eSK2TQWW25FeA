Even if money isn’t a concern, it’s worth looking into this <a href=\"/best-diy-home-security\">DIY home security system</a>; it is highly intelligent, economical and reliable.","You can set up and control the iSmartAlarm system using its free app, which is available on both iOS and Android devices. Mobile accessibility is one of the biggest selling points of DIY alarm systems. iSmartAlarm is praised for its intuitiveness, navigational ease and complete customizability of the system.","Another positive feature of iSmartAlarm is the system’s design. Each device is sleek looking and has clean, unobtrusive lines. Much like its name, the glossy white of the system’s components mimics the design of Apple products. While the aesthetics of a local home security system should be secondary to its functionality, design is still an important element to consider, and iSmartAlarm satisfactorily delivers in this regard.","You can build this DIY security system a la carte, selecting the devices that best serve your needs. For example, a motion sensor can alert you to intruders, and the iCamera provides real-time monitoring that you can view on your mobile device. The iCube is the system’s “brain,” connecting all of the devices and bridging them with the app. The company claims the system is infinitely expandable, so theoretically you could connect as many peripherals as you want.","Installation of the system isn&#39;t too difficult, but you may encounter some hiccups when first installing the camera. These issues are minor and the system should work fine once these are addressed.","Although the iSmartAlarm system doesn’t support live monitoring, it doesn’t mean you’re on your own should you run into any issues with the system. The company offers a number of technical support resources including an online FAQs section, video tutorials and a support ticket system. The company is extremely helpful and responsive to all inquiries.","iSmartAlarm allows you to control your security system in the palm of your hand. Despite a few installation issues, this DIY home alarm and security system offers comprehensive protection that you will find easy to customize and control. "]},"id":"61360bc9-4816-4952-be42-48aed8d54f29","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58903","url":"/ismartalarm-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-24T21:00:55Z","datePublished":"2014-02-24T21:00:55Z","name":"iSmartAlarm","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
