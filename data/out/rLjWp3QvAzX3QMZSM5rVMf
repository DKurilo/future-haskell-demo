I found myself fascinated by the science involved in both the production of audio and the recording of audio. Since then, I&#39;ve spent a summer as the sound guy at a local venue, my bands have recorded five albums, and I&#39;ve personally recorded an additional six solo albums with my own equipment. In other words, I bring over twenty years of experience with recording, mixing and analyzing audio frequencies to my reviews of car speakers and car audio.","My car audio experience began when I purchased my first car in 2002. The car, a 1987 Honda Civic CRX, cost me just $1,200 and had over 250,000 miles. The suspension was shot and the gas mileage wasn&#39;t great, but the sound system was amazing. It came with four high-end component speakers, an external power amp and a 15-inch subwoofer. In fact, the sound system was the reason I purchased the car. It was a stereo on wheels. This is how I&#39;ve viewed my cars ever since.","<strong>How Much Do Car Speakers Cost? </strong>","Most aftermarket car speakers are coaxial: the speaker consists of the woofer and the tweeter and produces the full frequency of the audio signal. The cost of a coaxial car speaker is closely tied to its size, quality of construction and power handling specifications. So, while you can find car speakers on Amazon for as low as $5, the best car coaxial speakers start at around $60 for a pair and can cost as high as $300. However, if you&#39;re really serious about upgrading your car audio speakers, look into component speakers. These don&#39;t include tweeters and run up to $600 for a pair, but a component system provides far greater control over the quality of the mix.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","The best car speakers have two things in common: great sound and great volume potential. You want a speaker that sounds better than your car’s factory-installed ones and doesn&#39;t require an external amp to reach ear-splitting volumes.","Here is how I tested these characteristics:","Frequency Accuracy <br/>There is no such thing as a perfectly accurate speaker because there are too many variables that affect a woofer’s ability to produce sound, such as humidity, altitude and air pressure, to name a few. Still, a good sounding speaker is one that produces the audio signal it receives as accurately as possible. And if you compare all the speakers in the same environment, you can find the ones that perform more accurately. This is exactly what I did.<br/> "]},"id":"b621b5e9-ca3f-4367-9ca6-68ec36b966be","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/NYZGs7HskQkQAtpkSLRQ3A.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/car-speakers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9DLzMvNzU2MDAzL29yaWdpbmFsL0Nhci1TcGVha2Vycy1JbmZpbml0eS1SZWZlcmVuY2UtWC05NjIzaXgtVGVzdGluZy0wMDEuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NYZGs7HskQkQAtpkSLRQ3A.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"NYZGs7HskQkQAtpkSLRQ3A","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NYZGs7HskQkQAtpkSLRQ3A.jpg","alt":""},"id":"baa7dfeb-ebff-4969-abb0-83b3fb1ff7ca","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["To test performance, I created a 10-second sine tone that transitions from 20Hz to 20kHz, which is the optimal range of human hearing. I set up a microphone exactly 12 inches from the center of the woofer and had the speaker play the sine tone repeatedly for five minutes as I recorded the results. Then, I used a frequency analyzing plugin to create the average frequency signature of the speaker. Since the audio signal of the sine tone has no variations, I compared this average frequency signature to the original audio signal. By counting the peaks and valleys and considering the degree of decibel fluctuation in these variations, I could determine how accurate a speaker was at reproducing an audio signal compared to other speakers producing the same frequency.","To account for personal preferences, I graded each frequency range separately. Some people prefer punchy bass, clean highs or detailed mids. These audio preferences are largely dependent on the recording, mixing techniques and music style, not the speaker performance. That said, a high grade suggests that the speaker is more likely to produce the intended audio signal. So, if you listen to music with a lot of bass, then a speaker with a high low-frequency grade is your best option.","Comparative Loudness<br/>Sensitivity is a specification audio experts, and speaker marketing departments, point to as one of the most important to consider when buying a speaker. This is because it tells you how efficient the speaker is at converting power to volume, and sensitivity can make a big difference in your listening experience. However, there is a lot of debate within the audio community over whether these sensitivity ratings are as accurate as the manufacturers claim. This was confirmed when I talked to car audio experts at the Sound Warehouse in Ogden, Utah. They warned me to take the speakers’ sensitivity ratings with a grain of salt because there isn&#39;t an industry standard for measuring it and manufacturers publish the rating that looks the best."]},"id":"c476623e-470c-4e6b-8e99-c33bcc8a4e09","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/yyhZRKLuetSNbY3cj6V6jS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"So, with the same car stereo to powering each speaker, I used a decibel meter to gauge the highest volume each speaker produced when the stereo’s volume was set at levels 10, 20, 30 and 40.

Others were not even close.<br/><strong><br/>How To Test the Quality of Your Sound System</strong>","Evaluating audio speakers comes down to a simple question – are the speakers reproducing the audio signal? When musicians record an album, they record and mix the music to sound a specific way. If your speaker system is great, it reproduces exactly what the musicians intended.","Of course, this is easier said than done. Since stereos often boost or diminish frequencies and speakers vary in quality, it’s not easy to know how a song is intended to sound unless you were the one who recorded and mixed the audio yourself. Even if you have a bunch of songs you’ve listened to for years, if you’ve never listened to the songs on a great audio system, you may not have yet heard the truest version.","To evaluate your speaker system, you need to start by understanding what to listen for. Critically evaluating audio requires practice and patience. You also need a varied playlist of songs chosen specifically to demonstrate each facet of audio performance. Using your favorite hip-hop tracks or heavy metal tracks to evaluate speakers won’t do because songs of the same genre tend to be mixed and mastered similarly.","Fortunately, our colleagues at <a href=\"https://www.whathifi.com/features/10-best-songs-to-test-your-speakers\">What Hi-Fi?</a> put together an excellent playlist of songs with explanations of what to listen for. Each song was chosen by expert audio reviewers based on the song&#39;s production and mix quality.

He started off by stating that the most important consideration when upgrading your car speakers is to make sure your new ones are compatible with your existing equipment and your future A/V system plans. But, he also warned that you get what you pay for and argued that a professional installation is the best way to get the most out of your car audio. He suggests that &#34;a tight install can work to bring out the best in even the most basic, inexpensive equipment. A weak install can bring unacceptable, compromised results with the most expensive and highly lauded speaker.&#34;","Here&#39;s some tips on making sure your new car speakers are compatible with your current system:"]},"id":"a2f3ee9a-2c79-464b-98d1-8a9853bb4ccc","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/fXEt5z64hd6tXomLctKzGc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":" Impedance is the speaker’s electrical resistance. It doesn&#39;t make a difference to audio quality or performance, so long as it&#39;s matched to the impedance rating of your car stereo or amplifier. The lower the impedance, the more the speaker draws power from the source. As a result, an amplifier with a high impedance could burn out trying to power a speaker with a low impedance. Conversely, a speaker with a high impedance isn&#39;t designed to handle the power of an amplifier with a low impedance.  ","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/car-speakers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9DLzYvNzU2MDA2L29yaWdpbmFsL0Nhci1TcGVha2Vycy1QaW9uZWVyLVBSTy1UUy02OTAwUFJPLVRlc3RpbmctMDAxLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXEt5z64hd6tXomLctKzGc.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"fXEt5z64hd6tXomLctKzGc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXEt5z64hd6tXomLctKzGc.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e7ac8356-82e0-4b71-932c-2d1dae2d0c27","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Speaker Size<br/>Speaker&#39;s range in sizes between 3.5 inches and 6 x 9 inches. Every speaker series we reviewed has multiple sizes but few have all the sizes. As such, it&#39;s always important to check your car&#39;s speaker sizes before purchasing replacements.","If you&#39;re installing the speakers yourself, it&#39;s a good idea to purchase a speaker bracket. Unfortunately, car manufacturers don&#39;t have a standard cutout for speakers, which means the holes for the screws might not match up with the after-market speakers. Universal speaker brackets, which come with many car speakers, are an easy fix for this problem. They can even allow you to fit a smaller speaker into a larger cutout.","Component vs. Coaxial<br/>We reviewed coaxial speakers, but if you want the absolute best car audio experience, then you should look into component speakers. Coaxial models consist of a woofer and at least one tweeter built into the speaker, usually on a bridge or cone. With this design, the woofer creates the low and midrange frequencies while the tweeter creates the high frequencies. With component speakers, the tweeter is built into a completely different speaker, which is installed in a separate location.","Component speakers are more accurate because the woofer and tweeter aren&#39;t competing to vibrate the same air. They also allow you to customize the audio to fit the acoustics of your car. However, component speakers cost a lot more than coaxial speakers, and they usually require professional installations. There is a great deal more wiring required, and you may even have to create new installation areas for component speakers unless your car has spaces for tweeters.","More Car Audio Guides:"]},"id":"2155bb8f-4c07-470a-a96d-6d3547055575","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-car-subwoofers\">The Best Car Subwoofers</a>","<a href=\"/best-car-audio-systems\">The Best Car Stereo Systems</a>","<a href=\"/best-bluetooth-car-kits\">The Best Bluetooth Car Kits</a>","<a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">The Best In-Dash GPS Head Units</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4157f069-1652-4d39-9854-b7662f7bc982","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_105","url":"/best-car-speakers","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T19:35:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T19:35:00Z","name":"Best Car Speakers of 2019","synopsis":"When I review car speakers, my goal is always to answer two common questions that shoppers have: Does it sound good?
