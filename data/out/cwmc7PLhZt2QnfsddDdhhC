You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The compact size of the Pleasant Hearth Hawthorne makes this <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplace</a> ideal for small spaces. It measures 37 inches tall, 34 inches wide and 13 inches deep. The narrow profile allows this small electric fireplace to fit comfortably in any size room. The firebox itself is 23 inches wide.","The Hawthorne&#39;s design is a mix between contemporary and traditional, complete with pillars and molding. Its base is made from solid wood while the mantel is made of MDF. The firebox is covered by tempered safety glass, allowing this electric fireplace heater to remain cool to the touch. The ember bed glows randomly for a realistic feel and the LED flames can be used with or without the accompanying heater.","An electronic timer is included that allows you to set the Hawthorne to run from 30 minutes to nine hours; the freestanding electric fireplace automatically turns off when the time is up. In addition to the LED technology in the flames themselves, this electric fireplace has an LED backlit display that digitally notes the temperature and timer settings. The unit is also vent-free and plugs into a standard electrical outlet.","There are three separate flame settings and 10 temperature controls for this electric fireplace heater. The included remote control has multiple functions, allowing you to turn the electric fireplace on and off as well as regulate the flame, temperature and timer settings. Despite the smaller size of Pleasant Hearth&#39;s Hawthorne, this electric fireplace puts out a substantial amount of heat, enough to warm 400 square feet using 4,600 BTUs. A fan forces the hot air out of the unit.","This small electric fireplace does not come pre-assembled, but it is easy to put together – only a screwdriver is required. The one-year limited warranty covers problems with workmanship and defective materials. It weighs about 50 pounds.","While there are several models of electric fireplaces on the market, the Pleasant Hearth Heritage is compact and narrow enough for smaller rooms. The transitional design can fit well with other décor in your home. The three flame and ten temperature controls allow you to customize the experience for your space."]},"id":"610a29e0-8ecc-4826-9d8b-d3c6483aa4cb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59385","url":"/pleasant-hearth-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-18T16:04:41Z","datePublished":"2014-04-18T16:04:41Z","name":"Pleasant Hearth Hawthorne","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
