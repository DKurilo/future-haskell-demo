You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kef KHT2005.3 is a high quality <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker</a> system. The unique egg-shaped speakers can be adjusted to stand upright or lie horizontal. Since the sound comes from multiple directions around the speakers, either way you place them the sound will be the same, so you know will get quality surround sound.","These surround sound speakers have a very disappointing frequency range. So much bass tones are lost because the minimum frequency response is a whopping 80Hz. This is four times the minimum frequency response of the best surround sound speakers, which means you’ll miss the low bass tone necessary to create deep or rumbling sounds.","High sounds will be picked up easily since the maximum frequency response is 27kHz, much higher than the upper range of human hearing, which is 20kHz . While you will not be able to hear those higher frequencies, the higher tones you do hear will sound amazingly clear. However, this doesn’t really make up for the amount of bass tone lost with these surround sound speakers, especially since special effects are generally bass tone heavy.","You will get five home theater speakers with the KHT2005.3. It doesn’t have a designated center speaker, but it does have a decent subwoofer. The subwoofer is a bass reflex, so the bass it booms will sound impressive. It’s unfortunate that a lot of the bass tones will be missed because of the unimpressive frequency response. This system is not THX certified like the best home theater speakers are. However, the speakers do have good timbre, so the sound coming from each speaker will be uniform and in sync with each other.","These speakers are not wall mountable, but they have a nice wide base, so they can be placed on a bookshelf or on a floor stand. Since each speaker is magnetically shielded, you can place them anywhere in your room, including close to your electronic devices, without worrying about any interference.","Kef offers a five-year warranty for the KHT2005.3 surround sound speakers, so you can expect these whole system to last several years. If you need any help with setting up or using your home theater speaker system, Kef can easily be contacted through email or by telephone. You can also get troubleshooting tips through the Kef Facebook page."]},"id":"26400606-1e99-4697-a152-510b221b8e7a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6c3250ed-0d99-43fa-862e-230329aefb11","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kef KHT2005.3 home theater speakers look nice and will deliver uniform, quality surround sound.
