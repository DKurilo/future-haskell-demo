You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","My Buddy Tag is a unique <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS tracker</a> in that it doesn’t require a monthly subscription plan. It lacks premium features and certain alerts, though it is capable of basic tracking and has basic monitoring options.","This is one of two trackers we tested that’s worn like a watch. The watch has a rubber strap with plenty of holes that allow kids of most sizes to wear it. It looks like a colorful rubber band, so nothing gives it away as a tracker. There are a lot of color combinations to choose from on the manufacturer’s website, so your children can pick out the trackers they like best. The variety of color options also means you can easily distinguish between each of your kids’ bands.","The free companion app is available for both Android and iOS users, and it shows you the tracker’s current location. You can also view its recent location history. The geofencing function allows you to set up a small digital perimeter, then receive a notification if your child enters or leaves the zone. You can also receive an alert when the battery is low.","However, the one downside is that the tracker relies mainly on Bluetooth and therefore only works up to 120 feet away from whoever is monitoring your child. That person must also have their phone on and the app open. This short-range tracking works when you’re in a crowd or doing a family activity like visiting Disneyland, but it isn’t ideal for kids at school or away at summer camp. If you want a more powerful device, or even one that works internationally, consider the <a href=\"/spot-gen3-review\">Spot Gen3</a>.","When first setting up the device, it may be difficult for some to get the tracker tag securely into the rubber band. Aside from that, it is fairly easy to use and has a clean, simple interface, with only a small panic button. The app is decently intuitive and fairly easy to use – you can easily track multiple children and toggle settings for each.","One of the device’s best features is that it is water-resistant and can notify you when the band is submerged in water. This feature can help prevent your child from drowning, and it is unique to this product – not even the best GPS trackers can alert you when the band is underwater.","The GPS watch has a low initial purchase price, and unlike every other tracker on our lineup, it doesn’t require a costly monthly subscription. However, the one caveat is that you have to repurchase the tracker tag annually, though at a fraction of the original device cost. My Buddy Tag ships with a one-year warranty from the manufacturer."]},"id":"5527725a-8806-4177-b763-3edaf801194c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a65b4b5-e56a-4fd5-9f68-1f4df584ab10","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The My Buddy Tag is the best value on the tracker market, although it has the least functionality of the products we tested.
