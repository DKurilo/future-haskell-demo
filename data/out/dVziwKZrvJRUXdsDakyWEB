You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Loca8tor Pet GPS for Dogs operates on A-GPS (Assisted Global Positioning System), which means that you also need to be connected to a cellular network. This particular GPS <a href=\"/best-pet-tracking-devices\">pet tracker</a> for dogs only works outdoors.","The pet GPS tracker weighs just over two ounces, and it fits onto your dog&#39;s collar with a splashproof pouch that protects it from knocks and scratches.","The device has a 16-foot accuracy, and you can choose your own update rate, which is handy because the less times the pet tracker updates, the longer the battery will last. Update rates can be set at every 10, 30 or 60 seconds, or even every hour.","When you utilize Loc8tor, you&#39;re not locked into any particular cell phone provider, and all you need is an internet-enabled cell phone, tablet or laptop. Although you do need to be within range of a cellular network, this GPS tracking device gives you the option to travel to various parts of the country and still be connected.","A detailed map, with an optional satellite or road map view, tracks your dog. It&#39;s possible to see the direction your dog is traveling in, and the device also features a lost-and-found button that, when pressed, shows the address where your dog is.","One of the great features about this pet tracking device is that you can set up a safety zone so that if your dog leaves the zone, you get a text or email alert. The system allows for more than one dog to be tracked at a time, but you have to buy an additional kit for each dog; there is no multipet discount.","When used on daily walks, the battery in the pet tracker lasts for seven to 10 days. Battery life depends on the weather, because when it&#39;s cloudy or raining, the device takes longer to search and find satellites; in this case, the battery may only last four days. The device does have a low battery warning, and the kit comes with a battery charger.","The Loca8tor GPS for dogs comes with a SIM card. The cost of the device is in the medium price range, and you have to sign up for one of the company&#39;s plans; choosing between a plan for one, three or 12 months. You can buy top-up credits if needed.","Loc8tor began operations in 2004, so it&#39;s not a fly-by-night company. The company offers a two-year manufacturer warranty, and its products are ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001 compliant. This GPS pet tracking system operates efficiently and is a good choice for a pet tracker."]},"id":"413654e4-7cd4-41e0-a4f9-3b53f5b50a94","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62784","url":"/loc8tor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T00:10:21Z","datePublished":"2015-02-18T00:10:21Z","name":"Loc8tor Pet GPS for Dogs","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-18T00:10:21Z","id":"dVziwKZrvJRUXdsDakyWEB","meta":{"title":"Loc8tor Pet GPS for Dogs Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Check up on your dog with the Loc8tor Pet GPS for Dogs, and see what your dog is up to all day.
