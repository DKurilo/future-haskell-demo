Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The 4G network is about to become fully fledged, and it&#39;s bringing America’s first 4G phone, the HTC EVO 4G with it. This fourth-generation network has spread to only a few dozen cities in the U.S, and until it expands, the EVO is just another Android out on the market. However, it isn’t just a phone to be set aside and ignored. This HTC phone has many advanced features, such as the 8MP (mega-pixel) camera, ability to connect to an HDTV and the latest version of the HTC Sense User Interface making it a strong player on the Android team.  For a side-by-side comparison and objective reviews visit the <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> review page.","The EVO not only has increased speed and power compared to other Droids, but also increased size. This HTC is a big and thick phone. With the generous screen-size of 4.3-inches, this phone needs to be bulky and firm to deal with the demand media it likes. Sharp colors and vibrancy are also important with such a grand display, and the EVO will not disappoint with a screen resolution of 480 x 800 pixels, which is the same sharp resolution you will find on both the Nexus One and Droid Incredible.","The EVO 4G is not shy when it comes to multimedia features. This HTC phone features both an 8MP primary camera and a 1.3MP front-facing camera, supported by two white LED flashes. However, a drawback to the photo setup is that the lenses are flush-mounted on the back of the phone and not recessed into the metal case, which could make it a target for scratches--an easy way to ruin a prized feature on the phone.","A top feature of the EVO is the ability to download, view, edit and share High Definition (HD) content directly from the phone. The HTC device features an HD video capture which then easily lets the user watch the video on an HDTV using an HDMI cable. It also features the option of outputting pictures and slides into an HD format and live video sharing with Qik.","As previously stated, the 4G coverage is great for those who live in select areas and are able to bask in its glory. But even for those who don’t use it on a regular basis, this phone includes a mandatory ten dollars per month “Premium Data add-on” for using WiMAX when in the 4G market. An extra ten dollars per month can add up for rarely using a network. Well, at least until it expands drastically. New metropolitan areas are being added to the 4G network each month, so chances are you&#39;ll be near one of them soon enough.","Running on the 1GHz Snapdragon processor and using Android 2.1, the EVO is similar to the Droid Incredible’s processing features. However, only 1GB of internal memory is stored on the phone, making it a poor comparison to the Incredible’s 8GB. But similar to other HTC phones, there is provided a microSD card slot that will support up to 32GB of additional storage.","A new feature that will make all the other Droids jealous is the kickstand found on the back of the phone. This is a great tool for allowing easy media or web viewing. And of course the EVO 4G includes the Google mobile services such as YouTube, Gmail, Google Talk, Google Voice, Google Maps and more.","The award-winning user interface, HTC Sense, is also found on the EVO. The HTC Sense includes a “leap” thumbnail to switch between home and other screen panels, which improves multi-tasking, and also Friend Stream, which takes the contacts from Facebook, Twitter and Flickr and brings you updates in one place. This user interface also includes interactive widgets and a polite ringer.","The EVO 4G is similar to all other Droids with features such as GPS Navigation, Bluetooth technology, digital compass, proximity and motion sensors and a loud speakerphone. It also has a pinch-to-zoom feature and automatic text reflowing which provides easy web page views."]},"id":"3f16959a-edf5-4085-ab6f-ba8abeeda4e2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6cf4fbcb-f33a-4603-bdf1-5c62a9365e93","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though the 4G network is getting all the hype, until it expands to a broader area, it is hard to get too excited.
