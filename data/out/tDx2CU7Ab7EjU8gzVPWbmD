Pedometers measure your steps and help you keep track of how much you move on an average day. Whether you&#39;re an athlete or a bit of a couch potato, keeping data on your personal activity is a great way to motivate you and boost your physical and mental health. The New Lifestyles NL2000i pedometer tracks much more than just steps.","The New Lifestyles NL2000i tracks active steps, calories burned and distance traveled, and features a clock. The pedometer gives you the power of options. You can view your history from seven to 14 days in the form of averages and snapshots of your activity. The tri-axis accelerometer captures an accurate picture of your movement from all angles when you&#39;re wearing this activity monitor."]},"id":"163dae58-7218-4383-a0ea-e103be6b8e97","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/4HifNCWVmMBPteyrqzGoaH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"For a basic pedometer, the NL2000i is full of great features. We love the key locking feature freezes the device so you won&#39;t accidently lose precious step counts. Check your memory loops so you can look for patterns or lock your data to check the most recent count. The lack of a reset button is no issue, though. Every night when the clock on the NL2000i hits 12 AM, your stats reset to a new day. This automatic reset feature allows you to start every day with fresh stats. This pedometer also records your low- or high-intensity activity so you can see how much high-impact activity you actually accrue over the day. The NL2000i calculates stride based on your weight, height and age. The pedometer then uses the same information to calculate your activity and total calories.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58470-new-lifestyles-nl2000i3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4HifNCWVmMBPteyrqzGoaH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4HifNCWVmMBPteyrqzGoaH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4HifNCWVmMBPteyrqzGoaH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"38d13b11-c093-4913-9f58-9cfb7de91c8c","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The New Lifestyles NL2000i pedometer does have some disadvantages to its design. The thin security strap with a bulldog clip at the end is the only way to secure this pedometer to your body. Attachments like this are best for daily use while wearing casual clothing with pockets. Tuck the pedometer into your pocket and clamp the strap your belt loop. But if you&#39;re wearing active wear without pockets for workouts, the strap will be a bit awkward. You&#39;ll also find this device doesn&#39;t register slow walking as active time, so you have to walk briskly at all times for your steps to count.","We like the look of the NL2000i because of the centralized buttons and giant screen.
