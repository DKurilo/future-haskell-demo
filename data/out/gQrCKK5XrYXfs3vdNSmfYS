However, with no remote or microphone and no ear loop, the sport earbuds only offer basic audio, rather than full function and audio control during sports.","A 3.9-foot cable offers enough room for most to easily put their phone or music player in their pocket. The cable includes an adjustable Y-split for either wearing in front of the neck or around the back of the neck to prevent tangles.","The rubber coated cord and sweat-resistant earbuds are water resistant, allowing you to take them out in the rain, around water and wear them when sweating heavily. The water-resistant seal is not submersible, so you cannot go swimming or use the sport earbuds for snorkeling. Cable clips help keep the cable from bouncing around by allowing you to clip the cord to your shirt or jacket. The cable is reinforced with Kevlar for additional durability, allowing you to get a lot of wear out of it.","Three sizes of soft silicone caps allow you to adjust the fit of the headphones to your ear. The soft silicone also helps to seal the earbuds to your ears for better sound quality and a better fit. The tips offer some noise blocking capacity but do not block enough to interfere with basic hearing, making them suitable for running outdoors and around roads.","With no ear loop, the Philips SHQ1200/28 sport earbuds rely on a nonslip rubber grip on the exterior of the earbuds to keep them in place. This works for some types of sports but is not as secure as wear wires and loops. If you have small ears, the large rubber earbud may be too big.","The large 13.6-millimeter drivers on the sport earbuds offer high-power sound with loud bass and quality acoustics. However, despite the size of the drivers, the audio is not top of the line.","Philips also offers a compatible app, which allows you to create playlists based on your workout and then share your results with social media. Because they are not Bluetooth sport earbuds, the app is merely a companion rather than a syncing function.","Nonslip grips on these sport earbuds offer an alternative to ear hooks and loops but do not offer the same security. The Phillips SHQ1200/28 ActionFit Sports In-Ear Headphones are a good option for basic sports audio, but without a remote and with no secure fastening, they are better suited to light to medium workouts where you can take your phone out to change music."]},"id":"62f42119-5d1a-41e1-8740-c5417704dba3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63402","url":"/phillips-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T21:49:13Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T21:49:13Z","name":"Phillips ActionFit Sports","synopsis":"The Philips SHQ1200/28 ActionFit Sports In-Ear Headphones offers powerful sound with a 13.6 millimeter driver, a sweat-resistant exterior and a nonslip rubber coating on the earbuds to keep them in your ears.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Philips SHQ1200/28 ActionFit Sports In-Ear Headphones offers powerful sound with a 13.6 millimeter driver, a sweat-resistant exterior and a nonslip rubber coating on the earbuds to keep them in your ears.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-10T21:49:13Z","id":"gQrCKK5XrYXfs3vdNSmfYS","meta":{"title":"Phillips ActionFit Sports Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Philips SHQ1200/28 ActionFit Sports In-Ear Headphones are sports earbuds made of nonslip rubber.
