This driver update scanner came up with a list of 16 needed drivers of 21, or 76 percent of our dated drivers. The scan results listed relevant dated drivers and not a random list of drivers that supposedly needed updating. However, DriverWhiz did not relate the driver version or date of the suggested drivers. With DriverWhiz you have to register before you can see the details of the driver list. So you cannot verify until after purchase that the suggested drivers are the right drivers for your system.","In terms of the software interface, this driver updater has a similar layout and feature set to most update software. DriverWhiz can be used to save backups of driver files, and these backup files can be saved to a disc, network drivers or a USB-attached device. These backup files can be used to migrate drivers to another PC or to reinstall drivers when a new operating system is installed. The software can also create restore points when you upload in case a driver is incompatible.","DriverWhiz has a driver database of over 11 million drivers that you can search by operating system and by manufacturer. This software supports Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7. The device manufacturers it can provide drivers for include Acer, Asus, HP, Nvidia, Dell, Logitech and more. Most software of this type scans for system devices, and so does DriverWhiz, but it can also scan for some attached devices such as monitors, keyboards, printers, scanners and webcams. Our scan results returned all system drivers and one Dell monitor suggested update.","In terms of support, you can contact DriverWhiz by email, telephone or mail. We sent them an email query and after 30 days did not receive a response. They also do not post support information online. We found a product features list and some driver information but no FAQs or searchable knowledgebase.","With just a little research online we found that people are leery of free driver scanners, including DriverWhiz.  So, we looked at DriverWhizÂ s security policy, asked them what they do to keep drivers safe and went ahead and installed (and subsequently uninstalled) this software. When we initiated a scan it didn&#39;t download unwanted items like toolbars and adware. We sent them an email asking how they keep scans and downloads safe, but they did not respond. They do post a privacy policy online and report that they don&#39;t share personally identifiable information, but we could not see details on how they provide safe downloads of driver files. Most reputable driver update companies only acquire drivers from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), but we could not verify where DriverWhiz obtains its driver files.","Though DriverWhiz produced adequate scan results, we would recommend finding a driver update company that is more upfront about their pricing and security policies. To find a driver updater that can provide safe downloads and responsive customer support, see our PC driver update software reviews."]},"id":"15def9c2-b252-40e0-a0af-2a3cac8eef71","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5694","url":"/driverwhiz-a-brief-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"pamela-s-stevens","url":"/author/pamela-s-stevens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Pamela S Stevens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"e9bBMEAQ9LLhA3c2cSq39Z","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-31T21:34:48Z","datePublished":"2011-03-31T21:34:48Z","name":"DriverWhiz: A Brief Review","synopsis":"DriverWhiz is driver updater software that gets a bit of search traffic, not just for the product name but also for serial and registration keys, so we decided to check it out.","review":{},"strapline":"DriverWhiz is driver updater software that gets a bit of search traffic, not just for the product name but also for serial and registration keys, so we decided to check it out.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-05-23T18:27:36Z","id":"rkX93sLJb9phzGAHYiGJzi","meta":{"title":"DriverWhiz: A Brief Review","description":"We took a look at DriverWhiz, PC driver update software, see our review for details and our recommendations."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:56:24Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6f8wPyWKZevbmhqs4JaqfH.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:24Z","mimeType":"","name":"5694-driverwhiz-a-brief-review.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5694-driverwhiz-a-brief-review.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:24Z","id":"6f8wPyWKZevbmhqs4JaqfH","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6f8wPyWKZevbmhqs4JaqfH.jpg","alt":""},"title":"DriverWhiz: A Brief Review","description":"We took a look at DriverWhiz, PC driver update software, see our review for details and our recommendations."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6f8wPyWKZevbmhqs4JaqfH.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:24Z","mimeType":"","name":"5694-driverwhiz-a-brief-review.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5694-driverwhiz-a-brief-review.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:24Z","id":"6f8wPyWKZevbmhqs4JaqfH","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6f8wPyWKZevbmhqs4JaqfH.jpg","alt":""},"title":"DriverWhiz: A Brief Review","description":"We took a look at DriverWhiz, PC driver update software, see our review for details and our recommendations."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/driverwhiz-a-brief-review","label":"","tags":[]}
