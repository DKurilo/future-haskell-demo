Students should recognize that “those lowest of advertised rates are available for people with the pinnacle of credit histories, according to the lender&#39;s terms,” she said. “It’s very unusual to get those lowest rates. People should understand that their APR is going to be mainly based on their credit history – not just their score, but the history – of both the student and their co-signer.”","Speaking of co-signers, the majority of the providers we included let co-signers drop their responsibilities once certain terms are met, which is positive for both the student borrower and the co-signer. Again, you’ll want to read your individual contract carefully to ensure you understand just what needs to be done in order for co-signers to be released.","<strong>Location Matters</strong>","Knowing how much loan debt students in your area have can be helpful as you plan for your financial future. The Institute for College Access and Success looked at public four-year colleges across the United States and found members of the class of 2016 graduated with more than $30,000 in debt in 17 states. Utah graduates had the lowest average debt amount at $19,975, while New Mexico, California, Arizona and Nevada also had lower student loan debt averages. Students in New Hampshire had the most student loan debt, averaging $36,367. ","Most public colleges and universities have breakdowns of the required tuition and fees online you can use to figure out how much your education will cost. This resource is usually available in the admissions portions of the website. While this won’t include any interest you’ll pay on a loan, it does give you a better idea of the tab you’ll need to pay.","<strong>Timing</strong>","If you’re wondering when you should start looking at what student loan options are best for you, the answer is now. It’s almost never too early to start considering your options and figuring out how you’ll pay for your education. You should also start looking for money through grants and scholarships.

More than 44.7 million people owed money on student loans at the end of 2017 according to the <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/Student-Loan-Borrowers-by-Age/244077\">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. You and millions of other people will be paying student loans off for years, but how long is that actually going to take? Sadly, there is no one answer to this question. It depends on how much you owe and the payment program you set up with the federal or private loan provider. If you&#39;d like to pay them off faster, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends contacting the company you got your loan through and asking how you can do so. You can also use an online <a href=\"https://www.makelemonade.co/calculators/student-loan-prepayment-calculator/\">student loan debt calculator</a> to see how much sooner you’ll pay off your debt if you increase your monthly payment.","Private student loans generally take about 10 years to pay off, though depending on the terms and conditions, it can take up to 25 years. Most private companies offer graduated repayment where the monthly payment you make starts out small and gets bigger over the years as you presumably make more money. You&#39;ll also most likely have the option of an extended repayment plan where you pay less each month but have to pay over a longer period of time.","If you have a federal student loan, standard repayment usually takes about 10 years. Graduated repayment can take anywhere from 10 to 30 years, and extended payment for borrowers with less than $30,000 in debt can take up to 25 years. There is also an income-driven repayment plan option, which might qualify you for some loan forgiveness, but this is something you need to work out directly with your federal loan provider. Private loans, including those from the companies we reviewed, don&#39;t offer this option.","<strong>Co-Signers</strong>","Most young folks fresh out of high school have very little credit history, so they&#39;ll need someone to co-sign on the paperwork for their loans. The co-signer is equally responsible for making sure the loan and interest are paid off. Even if you do qualify for a loan and don’t necessarily need a co-signer, having one can sometimes mean you’ll get a lower interest rate. Some private loan companies let co-signers off the hook after a certain period of time, but before you get that far, who should you ask to co-sign in the first place? First and foremost, ask your parents. They’re most likely going to be trustworthy and want to support you in your educational endeavors. If this isn’t an option for you, a co-signer can really be anyone who meets the private loan company’s requirements. These vary, but the co-signer doesn’t need to be related to you in order to volunteer. Asking another relative like an aunt or uncle or even a good friend is a great option if your parents are unable or have particularly bad credit history themselves. One thing to keep in mind is that if you, the student, default on the loan or miss payments, it will damage both your credit history and the history of the person who co-signed on the loan. It’s a big responsibility.","<strong>How to Get the Best Student Loan</strong>","Step 1: Know Your Options<br/>When it comes to student loans, there are essentially two types of options: federal and private. As the name implies, federal student loans come directly from the federal government, and they tend to offer borrowers lower interest rates, more flexible repayment options and more protections than options from private lenders. Most experts suggest students look to maximize their federal student loan borrowing options before tapping into private loans, but the problem with federal loans is that the maximum amount a student can take out tends to be relatively low, and won’t often cover the entire cost of college for most students.","Students who have tapped out their federal loan options have a couple of options, says student loan expertHeather Jarvis. The first is the federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students program, called PLUS. These loans have some of the same advantages of federal loans, like flexible repayment and consumer protections, but they aren’t quite as flexible as loans issued directly to students, and the interest rates are somewhat higher.","Step 2: Understand the Terms<br/>Whether you go with private or federal loan – or a combination of both – there are some important terms to keep in mind. The first would be the annual percentage rate, or APR, on the loan. This will be how much additional money you’ll owe based on the original amount you borrow. Rates can be either fixed or variable, and understanding the difference between the two is essential. Government loans are all fixed, meaning the amount of interest you’ll pay on them is set and won’t change over time. Private loans can be either variable or fixed. “Variable rates can often be appealing at the beginning of a loan,” said Jarvis, “and in times like now when interest rates are at historic lows. But variable rate loans will almost certainly go up over time.&#34;","Government loans can also be subsidized or unsubsidized. If you qualify, taking out subsidized loans tends to be a better option, says money coach <a href=\"https://whitneyhansen.com/\">Whitney Hansen</a>. With subsidized loans, the government covers interest on the loan while students are in school at least half time, as well as for the first six months after leaving school (often referred to as a grace period) and during a period of deferment.","Private loans almost always require a co-signer, and the interest rate a student receives on a loan is usually dependent on both the student’s and the co-signer’s credit history and other financial requirements. “That’s one reason why, if parents and students are talking together about options, parents can sometimes qualify for better lending terms on their own merit, rather than co-signing,” said Jarvis. If you do go in on a loan with a co-signer, keep in mind that the co-signer is just as responsible for the loan as the student borrower. Alternatively, the student borrower could also be adversely affected by any financial wrongdoing of the co-signer.","When it comes time to sign a contract for a student loan, Jarvis recommends asking to review the promissory note before doing so. “This is the contract that controls the deal, not the language on the loan provider’s website or words from their salespeople,” she explained. “Many big banks won’t let you look at this, but a lot of the newer options are willing to allow people to look and analyze those.”","Borrowers should also be aware of loans that employ interest capitalization, says Jay S. Fleischman, a <a href=\"https://www.consumerhelpcentral.com/student-loan-lawyer/\">student loan lawyer</a> and managing attorney at Shaev &amp; Fleischman, P.C. “Many people don’t know how interest capitalization works, and the specific events that trigger accrued interest to capitalize,” he said. “Capitalization is when the lender adds the interest to the principal balance of the loan. When the interest is capitalized, it becomes principal.&#34;","Step 3: Minimize Your Debt<br/>Once you’ve researched your loan options and are up-to-date on the important terms to know, consider some ways in which it will be possible to borrow the least amount of money before you go any further. “Overall, it’s important for students to not over-borrow,” said Hansen. “Working a part-time job to cover living expenses instead of borrowing additional debt to pay for them is almost always a better option.”","Other common ways that Hansen recommends students help offset the costs of college include scholarships directly through their choice of university and working jobs that provide tuition reimbursement. “Working directly for a university also comes with additional perks like discounted tuition,” she added. Remember to also return any student loans you don’t end up using to avoid paying additional interest on them.","Step 4: Consider Your Alternatives<br/>Unfortunately, higher education has become very expensive, says Jarvis, and it’s important for families to sit down and figure out how much they can really afford. Hansen also offers this rule of thumb for avoiding debt you can’t pay off quickly after college: keep your overall student debt lower than the amount of salary you expect to bring in your first year out of college.","Along those same lines, Fleischman recommends weighing the employment prospects for graduates against the cost of attendance – including administrative fees, room, board, and other charges – when choosing a school. This will ultimately help when it comes to making the most financially responsible choice.","Avoiding Student Loan Debt With FAFSA<br/>One way to avoid student loan debt is to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, more commonly known as FAFSA. Enrolled and soon-to-be college students can fill out the form as early as Oct. 1. Prior to 2016, the forms didn’t open until January, and the extra time can help make sure you file the form correctly and on time. Information to have on hand includes the following:"]},"id":"3c48efe2-5e06-4f79-8645-6814d55429cf","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Recent federal tax returns","1099s","Current bank statements","Social security numbers for both student and parents","Child support records","The student&#39;s driver&#39;s license"],"type":"ul"},"id":"422aee13-663e-4cc9-b34b-d2102436cd6a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Parents and the student enrolling all need to provide information to complete the FAFSA. This might sound overwhelming, but the forms are available online for free. It&#39;s important to go through the FAFSA process to see if you’re eligible for grant money. Unlike loans, you don&#39;t have to pay back grants. This can help alleviate your overall student loan debt load.","<strong>How Much Is Too Much?</strong>","While federal student loans have caps depending on the type of loan and whether you&#39;re an undergraduate or graduate student, private student loan limits vary by company. According to Edvisors, undergraduate students can get as much as $120,000 annually from private lenders. While federal loans might seem safer, private loans are a way to supplement the cost of college if you max out how much you can get through the government.","Even though it might seem like you should get a larger loan than you really need, that&#39;s not the case. Only get a loan for what you absolutely need, and try to use other financial aid, such as scholarships, grants and work study income, to pay for your education. If it&#39;s at all possible to work while you&#39;re in college, you should. That income can go toward your classes whereas if you take out a loan, you have to pay it back later with interest. Speaking of interest, the faster you pay off your loan, the less you put toward interest.","Federal student loans are standardized by the government and therefore charge a lower interest rate. Private student loan companies tend to have a much wider range of interest rates, so it&#39;s important to shop around and find the lowest one. Some companies, like Ascent, offer interest rate reductions as a reward. With Ascent, your interest rate is lower if you set up auto-pay with a debit card.","<strong>Paying Off Your Debt Quickly</strong>","One way to pay off your student loan debt quickly is to go into a career where you’ll earn a substantial amount of money right after college. In 2017, the employment and salary analysis website <a href=\"https://www.payscale.com/about/payscale-2017-college-roi-report\">PayScale</a> found the average return on investment for engineering degrees is substantially higher than a degree from a liberal arts, religious or arts school. The average engineer can make roughly $65,000 annually right out of school, according to <a href=\"http://time.com/money/collection-post/3829776/heres-what-the-average-grad-makes-right-out-of-college/\">Time</a>. If you go into education, you&#39;ll make half that and consequently take longer to pay off your student loan debt.","Another thing you can do takes more advance planning. You can attend a college with a historically high return on investment. In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.payscale.com/college-roi\">PayScale</a> found the university with the highest return on investment is the United States Merchant Marine Academy. Excluding any private universities or military academies, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology has the highest return on investment for in-state students. Others at the top of the list include Brigham Young University in both Idaho and Utah, Missouri University of Science and Technology, The California Maritime Academy and Montana Tech of the University of Montana. Attending colleges with a high return on investment and going into a high-earning field are both ways you can get out of debt quickly after graduation.","<strong>Tips</strong>"]},"id":"5c8cd2dd-39bb-4b2d-8c52-ff95c5013347","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Don&#39;t ignore your debt.","Always read the fine print.","Make more than the minimum payment when you can.","Set achievable goals.","Some companies offer grace periods, but skip that and start paying immediately.","Budget and stick to it.","Live below your means.","Don&#39;t buy things you don&#39;t need.","Pay off loans with high interest rates first."],"type":"ul"},"id":"3d6afd49-9b02-40c0-a3bd-cfbfaabf1c54","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/><strong>Avoiding Scams</strong>","Fraudulent student loan forgiveness programs are advertised on the internet as well as through telemarketing phone calls. Many of these programs advertise in a very aggressive way, and you should avoid them. The <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/avoiding-loan-scams\">U.S. Department of Education</a> says fraudulent companies make claims such as &#34;Your student loan is flagged for forgiveness pending verification. Call now!” or “Act immediately to qualify for student loan forgiveness before the program is discontinued.” These claims are never true. Also, some student loan debt relief companies claim to reduce your monthly payment but could then change your payment plan in a way that negatively impacts you in the long run. Further some companies claim they are affiliated with the DOE when they aren&#39;t. A list of trusted companies that provide student loan services is posted by the <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/avoiding-loan-scams#legitimate-private-companies\">DOE</a> on its website.","Another scam to avoid is the advanced fee scam. A private loan company may tell you it can get you the best interest rate and loan terms but will ask for a fee first, which is a percentage of your loan amount or a flat rate. You should never pay a fee to get a loan, so don’t work with companies that offer this option.","If you think you were scammed, contact your private loan company and ask about your options. If you have a federal student loan, change your FSA ID, contact the loan service and file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.","<strong>Student Loan Forgiveness Programs</strong>","If you took out federal loans as well as private ones, the <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher#teacher-loan-forgiveness\">Teacher Forgiveness Program</a> is one way to get help paying them off. The program pays off thousands of dollars of your federal Stafford loans or all of your Perkins loans if you teach at certain low-income elementary or secondary schools for five consecutive years. The full list of schools is available through <a href=\"https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/tcli.action?_ga=2.134018951.823784678.1545154913-574267740.1540409309\">StudentLoans.gov</a> and includes locations in Idaho, New Jersey, South Carolina and a multitude of other states. Take note though, this program doesn’t apply to private loans. There are also student loan forgiveness programs available to those who enlist in the <a href=\"https://www.military.com/money/personal-finance/credit-debt-management/military-student-loan-forgiveness-and-discharge-programs.html\">military</a> or a public service job, but those also only apply to federal loans. In general, if a company tells you your private loans can be forgiven, it&#39;s most likely a scam.","<strong>Student Loan Refinance</strong>","While you can’t get your private loans totally wiped from your record, you can refinance. This means working with your loan provider to reduce the amount of money you pay each month. This can be useful in the short term if a large expense arises, but you should always try to pay off as much of your loan as possible as quickly as possible. There are a multitude of companies that offer student loan refinancing programs, but we recommend working with the loan provider you already have to avoid any extraneous fees or fine print. If you choose to refinance, always get all the information you need in writing before agreeing to the changes.","<strong>Getting Help</strong>","If you find yourself in a situation you can&#39;t resolve with a private loan provider, the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/cfpb-ombudsman/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> can help. The CFPB Ombudsman&#39;s Office is an &#34;independent, impartial and confidential&#34; resource you can turn to, according to its website. And you aren&#39;t alone in needing this help: 1,190 of the 1,385 inquiries the office received in fiscal year 2018 were from individuals, according to the office’s <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_ombudsman_annual-report_fy-2018.PDF\">annual report.</a> While most inquiries were related to mortgages, 26 percent had to do with student loans.
