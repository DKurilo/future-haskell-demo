You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","As consumers we have demanded that our camcorders be smaller, faster, and lighter weight. Canon has heard our demands and introduced the VIXIA HF S10. Although it somewhat resembles a thermos, the Canon VIXIA HF S10 packs quite a punch into a small frame.","The VIXIA HF S10 is dressed in black and has all the typical camcorder arrangements such as a flip out LCD screen. The most used controls are mounted on the LCD screen and the menu is navigated via a joystick control mounted by the screen.","<strong>Features</strong>","Canon’s flagship VIXIA HF S10 features a built-in 32 GB flash memory drive. At full resolution you should be able to record just under 3 hours of full HD video on the internal memory. If the memory becomes full the camera also allows you to insert a memory card and continue recording. Also, the contents from the built-in memory can be copied to the SDHC card which can then be inserted into a computer or TV for immediate viewing. Since the HF S10 uses a flash drive instead of a hard drive, there are no moving parts. This means increased longevity and quicker start up times. The lack of moving parts also makes the camera more shock resistant over similar hard drive models.","Full 1920 x 1080 video recording is nothing new. Not all camcorders will record at 1080p and 24Mbps. The higher bit rate ensures that the HF S10 reduces artifacting and pixelization that come with compressing an image and slower bit rates.","In addition to the full 1080p HD recording, the HF S10 will also record high resolution 8 MP still images. The camera will even allow the user to record still images while shooting video, although at a slightly lower resolution of 6 MP. The image quality is very good as it uses a CMOS sensor similar to Canon’s own digital SLR cameras.","The 2.7 inch LCD screen has a hard coat anti-reflection surface to help reduce glare and increase visibility in harsh sunlight. The LCD screen also has improved color reproduction which more accurately displays the image you are actually filming.","The VIXIA HF S10 can detect and focus on up to 35 faces, and 9 detection frames can be displayed at one time. The face detection is so advanced that it can allow you to search for clips that feature a subject’s face.","<strong>Summary of Reviews</strong>","Experts liked the superb image quality provided by the Canon VIXIA HF S10. The controls were well laid out and easy to use. The size is very compact which makes it easier to pack around. Start-up time for the HF S10 was also outstanding, among the best on any camcorder.","Users found the image quality of the VIXIA HF S10 outstanding. It is the perfect complement to anyone’s 1080p HD television. The camera was small and compact which increases the likelihood of it actually being used. It fits into purses quite easily, and even large pockets.","Cannon’s VIXIA HF S10 is a top of the line, full HD camcorder that makes no compromises. The ease of use and superior image quality make this one of the better consumer HD camcorders on the market today.<br/> "]},"id":"1d03259b-1b1d-4fc4-880e-19349ad87cda","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_27143","url":"/canon-hf10-23877-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-03-13T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-03-13T06:00:00Z","name":"Canon HF S10 VIXIA HF S10","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":87,"verdict":"The superior image quality  and large internal memory make this one of the better camcorders on the market today.
