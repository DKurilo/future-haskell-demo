Besides viewing and printing photos, you also can present a slideshow using one of 12 different slideshow modes.","You can see what your photos look like before you print them and make any changes. You also can store photos to the internal memory. This device works with PictBridge devices, USB flash drives and Bluetooth camera phones. You also can simply plug in a memory card. You can use the handy remote control to edit and print pictures, operate other commands and run a slideshow.","The color photo resolution is a robust 5760 x 1440 dpi (dots per inch), and black and white photo resolution is 2400 x 1200 dpi, which means the pictures are clean, clear and vibrant. The printing speed is not lightning fast, but it is still respectably speedy at 1.6 ppm (pages per minute).","Unfortunately, the maximum print size you can get is 4 x 6 inches. However, this printer comes equipped with different layouts and templates so you can arrange wallet-size and mini-wallet photos on the 4 x 6 page. You can custom size smaller pictures to put in lockets, key chains or other small or unusually shaped frames.","Using this photo printer, you can get four photos per page, eight photos per page or 16 photos on a proof sheet. You also can play with your images to produce black and white photos or those with an appealing sepia-tone. The paper tray holds 20 sheets of photo paper.","A USB connection can link the printer and a PC. Or you can use thumb drives or Bluetooth (but you will need to get a separate Bluetooth adaptor). The printer is also compatible with digital cameras that use PictBridge and USB Direct Print technology. This printer can handle a variety of memory cards and sticks.","The Epson PictureMate  Show Digital Frame and Photo Printer PM 300 comes equipped with a carrying handle, so you can take it with you to the park, the bridal shop, the family reunion or the beach to capture special moments to treasure yourself and to share with others. It weighs an easily manageable 5.7 pounds. It is 6.3 inches high, 7.5 inches wide and 9 inches deep.","Epson offers several types of customer support. If you have questions, you can seek answers through email and phone support. There also is a user manual and FAQs section on the company&#39;s website. We are a bit disappointed that the site lacks any forum discussions or blogs, as well as the highly useful option of live chat.<em><br/></em>"]},"id":"5c05bcc8-3b41-4c62-8a24-ef4d3d72fd84","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c86bca17-dba9-438d-ae8f-16c95d0d496b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Epson PictureMate Show Digital Frame and Photo Printer PM 300  does not have every bell and whistle that the bigger models possess, but it can clearly serve your needs if you want fine picture resolution, decent printing speed and the fun of photo slideshows.

The customer support is not all-inclusive, and you can only print pictures as big as 4 x 6 inches.
