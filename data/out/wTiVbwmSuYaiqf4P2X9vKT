This floor steamer uses vibration to help loosen dirt and allows you to adjust steam levels to clean up different types of messes. This unit comes with a host of tools to make it helpful for cleaning more than just floors, too, which can make it an even better investment if you would like to use steam on countertops, windows and other surfaces.","The best steam mops are those that clean even the stuck-on spills with ease. The Sienna Luna did a great job on the mustard, soda, spaghetti sauce and orange juice we let dry on our test kitchen floors, clearing them with the third-fewest passes overall.","This mop has an average run time when compared with similar units. We got it to clean for 24 minutes continuously. The tank size is average too. One drawback with this one is the integrated tank, which means you have to grab a pitcher or go over to the sink when it is time to refill. Run times are decent so this will not be a huge problem, except on really big projects.","The Sienna Luna Plus is decent in terms of maneuverability, though the mop head has a rather tall profile, which makes it a little harder to get under really low ledges. Also, it does not rotate fully to be sideways as it goes under certain obstacles like some other floor steamers do. This mop ties for the widest cleaning path in our lineup, which means it can cover more ground, more quickly, but the larger head can cut into maneuverability, too, if you need to get into a narrow passage.","This mop is great for multitasking. It has tools for cleaning mirrors, stovetops, grout and even draperies. The manufacturer even suggested using it on your carâ€™s wheels and upholstery. The shoulder strap makes it easier to maneuver on surfaces that are above the ground."]},"id":"1382b1dd-955d-4ad2-8215-3a9cbc29a6fa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fffcb093-a735-4e0e-94ea-9b0b81185e2d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sienna Luna Plus is above average at cleaning different types of messes on floors and about average in most other ways.
