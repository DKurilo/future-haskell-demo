Recover Media Edition, you can recover your photos without the headache of a complicated interface. In our tests, this image recovery software recouped every JPG and nearly every other raster file. It also recovered a high rate of vector, production and digital raw images, making it one of the best photo recovery programs on the market.","The most common scenario for data loss is a lost file. This occurs when the operating system can no longer find the file, either through accidental deletion, virus or corruption to the file registry. We simulated this scenario on multiple hard drives to compare the success rates of the best <a href=\"/best-photo-recovery-software\">picture recovery software</a>. In these tests, Remo Recover rescued every JPG, TIFF, BMP, GIF and PNG. Only one other product in our review recovered all the raster images. This is critical because JPG is the most commonly used photo format, which makes it the most important benchmark for image recovery.","This program recovered 68 percent of the vector images, which is the second-highest success rate in the lost file test. The average recovery rate for vector images in our tests was only 28.6 percent, so this success rate is exception. It also rescued 63 percent of the production images and camera raw images. Both of those recovery rates were among the highest for those image formats.","For the reformatted drive portion of our tests, we simulated the data loss that occurs when you change the format of your hard drive or SD card. We performed this test on multiple reformatted drives, and Remo Recover proved to be one of the best at recovering raster images. It recovered every JPG in every test and 99.5 percent of other raster images. While other image recovery software rescued all of the JPGs, only one other application was more successful in recovering raster images – <a href=\"/stellar-phoenix-photo-recovery-review\">Stellar Phoenix Photo Recovery</a>.","In these tests, Remo Recover saved an impressive 73 percent of the vector images, which was the second-highest recovery rate for vector images in our tests. This image recovery software also recovered 63 percent of the production images, which was among the best recovery rates for this image format. When you consider the recovery rates of the vector images and production images, which are layered images in photo editing software, then this is the best photo recovery software for graphic artists.","Remo Recover failed to recover any camera raw files during any of the reformatted drive tests. This is bad news if you’re a serious photographer looking to recover images from a reformatted SD card for your DSLR camera.","It’s important to choose photo recovery software that leads you through the recovery process with little to no learning curve. Throughout our tests, we graded the installation, scan and recover stages of the recovery process. Remo Recover Media Edition received an A+ for the installation, an A+ for the scan and a B+ for the recovery processes during our testing. The installation and scan went as smoothly as any other product we tested did. The scanning options are clearly labeled and defined, and there are very few mouse clicks between selecting a drive and initiating a scan. The recover stage received a B+ because it lacks a clearly labeled recover button and failed to recover any of the original filenames. Otherwise, the recover process is effective and has a small learning curve.","One minor downside to the program’s ease of use is its scan and recovery speeds. Although they don’t affect the quality or outcome of the process, slow speeds can be frustrating. Remo’s average scan speed across our tests was 17GB per hour, and the average recovery speed was just 26GB per hour, whereas the average scan speed across our entire comparison was 114.3GB per hour and the average recovery speed was 75.1GB per hour. This won’t make much difference if you’re recovering photos from an SD card or a flash drive, but if you’re recovering photos stored on a 1TB hard drive, be prepared to wait. At these rates, it’d take roughly two-and-a-half days to complete a scan and one-and-a-half days to fully recover all of your photos.","In every test we ran, we recorded the types of digital camera raw formats Remo recognized. Raw images are uncompressed photos, and are each proprietary formats used by specific camera brands, which makes them less common. In these tests, Remo Recover recognized every raw image format except for Samsung’s SRW and Epson’s ERF. Fortunately, these are two of the least common formats.","With Remo Recover, you get exceptional technical support. The only downside to the support is that the product manual isn’t available in a PDF format. We prefer a PDF format because it’s easier to access, especially offline, than an HTML manual. However, you also have access to articles and tutorials, and you contact support staff via phone, email and live chat. So, if you have any problems, there’s no shortage of resources to help you.","Remo Recover Media Edition is one of the best photo recovery applications because of the exceptional recovery success rates and the extremely intuitive design. Few other applications were better at recovering JPGs and other raster images. For the other images formats, it either recorded the highest recovery rate or one of the highest. The only significant black mark was the slow scan and recovery and the lack of camera raw images recovered from the reformatted drive."]},"id":"dd264ff6-b823-4762-a0cf-b1889776db4b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53051","url":"/remo-photo-recovery-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-21T17:48:03Z","datePublished":"2011-06-21T17:48:03Z","name":"Remo Photo Media Edition","synopsis":"With Remo Recover Media Edition, you can recover your photos without the headache of a complicated interface.
