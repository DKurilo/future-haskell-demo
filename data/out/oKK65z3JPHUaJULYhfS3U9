This appliance ends up costing $5.20 a year in average costs per cubic foot, which is not an exceptionally large sum considering the savings on food that you can enjoy with a good chest freezer.","This small chest freezer offers 5 cubic feet of storage space, which can hold a healthy amount of frozen veggies straight from your garden, sale-priced meats and a good deal more. To illustrate its size, it can easily store 308 pints of ice cream.","One selling point for the Idylis small deep freezer is that its temperature can drop to -17.8 degrees. This is the lowest temperature of any chest freezer we found in our product lineup.","You will not need an exceptional amount of space to store this handy small deep freezer. It is 33.5 inches tall, about 28.375 inches wide and 21.62 inches deep. When you open the lid, the entire appliance is 54.87 inches high. It weighs 77.2 pounds.","When you install it, you&#39;ll need to give it a fair amount of space for the air to circulate around it: 4 inches on either side and 4 inches at the back.","This freezer comes with a storage basket that you can organize with things you use often. This basket is removable, which helps with cleaning. Another cleaning benefit is a drain that lets you remove water easily when you manually defrost this chest freezer. Unfortunately, this freezer does not include a power-on light to indicate the appliance is working, nor does it come with adjustable legs or a safety lock."]},"id":"c2267f7f-5df3-43f3-9af1-37f6e11bdd31","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"95e6f77d-57a4-44b8-a235-d933da080066","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The lack of a power indicator light, door lock and adjustable legs are drawbacks for this chest freezer.
