One of the most important values you&#39;ll come across during your research is the CADR, which refers to the clean air delivery rate. This value gives you insight on how effective a particular model is in delivering clean air to your home. Learning more about a purifier&#39;s CADR can help you make an educated buying decision as you search for cleaner air.<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>What&#39;s a CADR?</strong>","The clean air delivery rate is a numerical representation of how effectively a purifier filters out known allergens, from dust and pollen, to pet dander and cigarette smoke. In general, the higher the CADR, the better the air purifier, as the CADR indicates the volume of air processed by the filtration system. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers runs independent testing on air purifiers and assigns a number based on the results of those tests. That number is used in the purifier s specifications and is readily available for consumers.<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>Why is the CADR Important?</strong>","While that little number might not seem like a big deal, it actually gives you a better idea at just how efficient and effective a particular model is. Since all air purifiers are fundamentally the same, the CADR helps you discern which ones do their job the best, protecting you from making a poor purchase. After all, if an air purifier doesn&#39;t actually purify the air, you&#39;re paying for nothing more than a fancy, non-effective appliance in your home.","<strong>Does the CADR Have Limitations?</strong>","Before you make an air purifier purchase based on CADR value alone, you should know that it&#39;s not the definitive way to define the best air filters for your home. Some types of air pollution cannot be quantified and thus measured by CADR testing   namely gas particles and small particles. What&#39;s more, the CADR cannot tell you how a model may decrease in effectiveness over time. While one model could have a high CADR rating initially, one with a slightly lower rating might be able to retain efficacy longer over time. Therefore, you should take a variety of factors into consideration before you make your final decision.","<strong>Choosing an Air Purifier</strong>","Before you bring an air purifier into your home, read the labels clearly marked on the outside of the packaging. This can give you a better idea as to how conducive a purifier is for a certain space. The label will display the CADR rating, along with the suggested area for which the purifier should be used in. Electric purifiers are the most common type of purifier, and come in a variety of styles and colors to suit your home&#39;s interior. Another great way to find the best purifier is to check online reviews from happy   and not-so-happy   customers.","An air purifier can help you breathe a little easier at home, particularly if you suffer from allergies, asthma or COPD. Armed with the right information, you can use CADR ratings to help you make a more educated choice to purify the air in your home."]},"id":"73fec75f-56f8-46d6-906f-04a4cde441cf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8357","url":"/what-air-purifier-cadr-numbers-mean","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-curtis","url":"/author/j-curtis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.
