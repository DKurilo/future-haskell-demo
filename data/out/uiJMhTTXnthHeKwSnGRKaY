There are currently several cordless keyboards with a range of options to choose from on the market. If you&#39;re looking for one that appeals to your sophisticated sensibilities and at the same time puts you in harmony with efforts to be kind to the earth, Logitech offers a keyboard that fits the bill. With its slim profile, light-touch keys and solar-powered operability, the Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 rises to the top of the wireless keyboard lineup. Although it may seem expensive when compared to more basic wireless computer keyboards, we&#39;re convinced that the thought and technology that went into the superior features and design of this keyboard justify the price tag.","Special Note for Mac Users: In addition to the Windows-compatible K750, Logitech has also manufactured the Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 for Mac. It&#39;s compatible with Apple products and Mac OS X 10.4 or higher. It has the familiar Mac keyboard layout along with all the unique features and design aspects found in its Windows counterpart. In keeping with Apple chic, the Mac version is available not only in black, but also white/silver, white/pink, white/green and white/blue."]},"id":"75182aa2-aaf9-41a4-b8fc-036c6e6bd716","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"34f1dd14-2e82-4ea2-a74b-7e0172f1bdfd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/LBsPpbtTRgmaSjDSdys98W.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"When comparing available wireless keyboards, one feature you should take into consideration is how the keyboard is powered. You&#39;ll find that most keyboards require two or three AA or AAA batteries to operate. A few of them are even able to charge rechargeable batteries with the help of a USB cord. But Logitech&#39;s Solar Wireless Keyboard K750 takes powering up to the next level with its energy-efficient solar-powered battery. Two barely noticeable solar panels integrated at the top of the keyboard take advantage of sunlight or artificial light and perpetually charge a single lithium manganese button-cell rechargeable battery. We found it reassuring to know that as long as the keyboard has access to a light source, it will have a charged battery. Logitech estimates that the battery would last up to three months on a single two-hour charge if the keyboard happened to be left in total darkness. In an endeavor to avoid that scenario, the keyboard also has an on/off switch to help conserve the battery when not in use for an extended period of time.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/54147-logitech-solar-k7501.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LBsPpbtTRgmaSjDSdys98W.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"LBsPpbtTRgmaSjDSdys98W","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LBsPpbtTRgmaSjDSdys98W.jpg","alt":""},"id":"cdd36521-c46c-42d7-b15f-24ee54979967","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aside from the obviously green solar-powered rechargeable battery, Logitech is minimizing its footprint on the earth with the construction and packaging of this keyboard as well. Upon opening the K750 box, you&#39;ll find the PVC-free keyboard, its device-networking receiver and a wireless extender cord. The box itself is made of recyclable cardboard and is printed both inside and out with all the information you need to get up and running, eliminating the need for any additional documentation. Once the keyboard is safely nestled near your PC or laptop, you can feel good about dropping the entire box in the recycle bin.","Next, we address connectivity. As was already mentioned, the K750 is packaged with its own network-receiving device, the Logitech Unifying receiver. This tiny dongle plugs into a USB port on your computer and allows you to connect up to six compatible input devices with the one receiver. This makes it possible to mix and match peripherals and frees up your USB ports for even more functionality within your system. It operates via 2.4 GHz RF connectivity, which ensures a wireless range of at least 30 feet with 128-bit AES encryption for secure information transfer. This means you can interactively control your multimedia presentation from across the boardroom or plop yourself down on your comfy couch at home and fearlessly communicate with your laptop while it is connected to your TV.","Setup takes just a few seconds. After an initial sync with your computer, the keyboard is fully functional – basically plug and play. If necessary, you can use the USB wireless extender to position the dongle more out in the open so it is unobstructed.","If you&#39;d like to monitor the performance of your keyboard, you can go online and easily download Logitech&#39;s Solar App. With a push of the light-check button on your keyboard, this clever widget displays on your computer&#39;s desktop and shows with its lux meter the percent of energy in reserve as well as how much power your light source is generating.","Finally, the K750 gives you instant access to media and internet functions. With a combination of one of the F keys and the function key located at the bottom of the keyboard, you can access your email, calendar, calculator and media volume controls right from the keyboard. If you want to customize the built-in F keys, simply download Logitech&#39;s SetPoint software. With SetPoint you can assign new tasks to F-key functions, disable keys you don&#39;t use, and facilitate the pairing of devices with the Unifying receiver. SetPoint will also provide you with on-screen notifications when your caps lock and num lock are off or on."]},"id":"63e3f7b3-89eb-42bd-9ecc-5842b30d33f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"a92f007b-e032-45a5-8273-8c82650477ad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/VPtsMQbADV2ERtwkCPKBW8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The best wireless keyboards offer a good combination of form, function and comfort.

It&#39;s a smart-looking piece of equipment that&#39;s bound to impress your tech-savvy friends and colleagues. Though it is a magnet for fingerprints, users have been able to keep smudges at bay by simply keeping the protective film on the keyboard.","The K750 isn&#39;t specifically ergonomic in design and doesn&#39;t have a built-in palm rest. However, due to the amazing fact that this keyboard is only 1/3 inch thick – the lowest profile in our lineup – your hands will likely rest naturally on the work surface without straining the tendons in your wrists. If you&#39;re more comfortable typing with your keyboard at an incline, the K750 also has legs that extend to adjust the height.","Additionally, the K750 employs Logitech&#39;s PerfectStroke typing system, which distributes typing force evenly across the key surfaces by way of its concave keycap design and scissor switch-style typing mechanism. The scissor switch mechanism makes for shorter distance key travel and results in smooth, whisper-quiet typing. We found the feel of it comparable to typing on a laptop or Apple keyboard.
