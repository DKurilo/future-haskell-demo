Restored factory settings, a failed upgrade, virus attacks, or even user error could all potentially cause the untimely erasure of vital data. The Tenorshare <a href=\"/best-iphone-data-recovery-software\">iPhone Data Recovery</a> system can recover 16 types of data directly from a malfunctioning device, even without the use of backup files.","If your device is lost or stolen, you have a few options when it comes to iOS data recovery. If the device was synced with your computer’s iTunes program, embedded backup files can be extracted from it. From these you can recover iPhone photos, text messages, WhatsApp and Tango messages, contacts, notes, and Safari bookmarks and browser history. These embedded files can be stored on your local computer for later use or as a future backup.","Retrieving backups from a synced iCloud account is another option. This method is beneficial because it will not overwrite existing files or settings on the device. However, as with iTunes, the device must have been previously synced with the iCloud account in order to be of use.","The preview feature of this iPhone data recovery software allows you to sort through lost files by name, timestamp, or message content, and presents the relevant metadata when you click on the file to preview. Once the iPhone recovery tool restores all the data, it is exports and safely stores the files on your home computer, Tenorshare makes it easy to reinstall data back onto your device using companion software offered on its website. The interface design is well executed, making it easy to find and export desired files.","Tenorshare is explicit about the hardware it supports. It supports both GSM and CDMA phone types, as demonstrated on their website. Starting with the iPhone 3, support continues all the way up through iPhone 6 Plus. You can access free trials for all iterations of the software so you can be sure it will thoroughly serve your recovery needs. For those with any doubts, the manufacturer offers technical support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.","Tenorshare’s access to technical support, combined with its ability to accommodate most iOS device models, works to offset its price. The old adage about getting what you pay for may very well apply in regards to this iPhone data recovery tool."]},"id":"0c150ee9-b838-471f-abe6-317485a7c0cb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62035","url":"/iphone-data-recovery-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-31T18:25:49Z","datePublished":"2014-12-31T18:25:49Z","name":"Tenorshare iPhone Data Recovery","synopsis":"There are any number of reasons why data on your iPhone or other iOS device might be lost.
