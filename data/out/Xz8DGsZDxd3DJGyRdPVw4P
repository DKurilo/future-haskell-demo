The seat has an impressive weight range and three different modes for your child. Unfortunately, it is extremely large as a rear-facing infant car seat, but it will stay with your child until he no longer has to sit in a car seat. However, while the promise of a full-usage car seat may appeal to your wallet, the All-in-One earned the lowest safety rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.","If you&#39;re looking for a rear-facing car seat for your infant, the Safety 1st All-in-One will support a child between 5 and 35 pounds or from 19 to 36 inches. The convertible car seat includes LATCH connectors for simple installation, but you can also install it with a seatbelt. The seat has three reclining positions, but the fully reclined position does not lean as far as we&#39;d like. Also, when it is in its fully reclined position, the All-in-One is far too large for most small vehicles.","When your child is between 22 and 50 pounds, you can switch the convertible car seat to its front-facing position, which takes up less space. This version still utilizes the five-point harness and allows your child to use the seat&#39;s detachable cup holder. The front-facing position also has hooks on the upper sides, so when your child is between 40 and 80 pounds, he can use a normal seatbelt and use the seat like a booster.","Unfortunately, the Safety 1st All-in-One lacks many of the safety features we look for. In fact, this car seat has the lowest safety rating of all of the seats we reviewed. Although it meets federal safety standards, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the All-in-One its lowest rating: Not Recommended. Because this seat tries to be every seat that your child will use, it does a poor job in each of its positions."]},"id":"454072aa-1605-45e4-b0f4-ec976f86bb70","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ae84c824-b91b-45ac-a978-1b4e8ca38498","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Safety 1st All-in-One is a full-usage baby car seat that will stay with your child from birth until he is ready to use a normal seat.
