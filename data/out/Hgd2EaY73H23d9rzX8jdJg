However, there are numerous Kindle models to choose from. Should you get a Kindle Fire and enjoy the computing power that comes with tablets, or should you get a Kindle eReader and enjoy the best advancement in literary technology since movable type?","We created the <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/amazon-tablet-guide\">best Kindle comparison</a> to help you see the differences between the Fire tablets and the eReaders. However, if you still don&#39;t know what Kindle is best for you, this article will dive into the primary differences between tablets and eReaders.","As we know them today, all tablets are eBook readers, but not all eBook readers are tablets. What&#39;s more, while some people want the functionality of tablets, other people prefer eReaders&#39; e-ink displays. After you know the main differences between these two technologies, you&#39;ll be ready to compare Kindles and find the best one for you.","<strong>Display</strong>","Kindle Fire tablets tend to use glass displays. While these are great for movies and games, where you want a crisp display, it can be reflective in bright environments. The Fire HDX and HDX 8.9 reduce glare a little, but if you are using your tablet outdoors, you&#39;ll find it difficult to see what&#39;s going on.","On the other hand, Kindle eReaders use matte screens with an e-ink display. This means that they&#39;ll have much lower resolutions than tablets, but it looks much closer to a printed page, especially the Kindle Paperwhite. You can read eBooks for hours without any eyestrain or screen glare.","<strong>Lighting</strong>","Like all tablets, the Kindle Fires are backlit, which means that the display is created by shining lights at you. The colors are far crisper, and you can use the device at night without any problem. However, when reading books, the direct lights can strain and dry out your eyes.","Meanwhile, only a few eBook readers offer lighting. The Paperwhite is one of those few eReaders, and thanks to its white matte screen, the lighting is incredible. There are LED lights around the edge of the screen, reflecting light from the screen to you. This is called front lighting, and since the lights aren&#39;t shining directly in your eyes, you can read for longer, even in the dark. Again, few eBook readers offer front lighting, so you won&#39;t be able to use a device like the original Kindle in the dark.","<strong>Media</strong>","The Kindle Fire sets itself apart by allowing you to access virtually any file type. Whether you want to read a book or a comic, listen to a new album or watch your favorite movie, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 will deliver. Amazon&#39;s X-Ray feature takes your Fire further by displaying trivia or lyrics at the push of a button.","The Kindle eReaders are only able to read text. While you have access to millions of eBooks, magazines and newspapers, you won&#39;t be able to listen to music or audiobooks and you won&#39;t have access to photos or videos.","<strong>Apps</strong>","The final advantage to a Kindle Fire is access to thousands of Android-based apps. Whether you want to use Facebook and Twitter, watch videos on Netflix or Amazon Prime, or play Angry Birds, every Fire tablet has the power to run any Android app.","However, the Kindle eBook readers do not have any additional apps. While they do have a built-in dictionary, you won&#39;t be able to run any social or media apps from the device. Some people prefer the fact that eReaders do not have any distracting apps. Like the above list of differences, at the end of the day, you have to decide what is more important to you."]},"id":"e6ea26ce-1161-4e1d-9233-c413fb64cdfa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8796","url":"/compare-kindles-the-difference-between-the-fire-and-the-ebook-reader","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ben-davis","url":"/author/ben-davis","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"Ben Davis","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"L52JmDizAnNgRQPUr9kch6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-25T23:01:27Z","datePublished":"2014-09-25T23:01:27Z","name":"Compare Kindles: The Difference Between the Fire and the eBook Reader","synopsis":"Kindle devices offer excellent quality for a fraction of the price that their competitors charge for their devices.
