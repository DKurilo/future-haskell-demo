We stay on top of changes in the industry and keep an eye on the evolving threats online by subscribing to news outlets and online blogs that focus on internet security. We test, evaluate and review monitoring software several times a year, so we know the programs very well and understand how they work with new technologies.","Also, I am the mother of 10 children and grandmother to four. Keeping my children safe is my top priority, especially while they are online where so much information, both good and bad, is easily accessible. I use internet monitoring software at home, installing it on computers, laptops, cell phones and tablets. It creates opportunities to have good conversations with my kids about personal boundaries, cyberbullying and why restricting screen time is so important.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","I downloaded each monitoring program on several test computers, both in our on-site lab and on my personal devices at home. This gave me a good idea of how each program works in real-life settings. I also installed programs on my children’s devices, then sat back and waited for the sounds of frustration as they attempted to access sites such as Facebook and Steam, that I purposely blocked. This let me see how well each software’s filters work.","Through the testing, I learned that the more categories a program has, such as the 47 included with <a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Family</a>, the easier it is to block or allow more specific content. For example, programs with more categories let us specify that we wanted to block mature games, not all online games.","As the children came upon popular sites that were blocked, I tested the programs’ whitelists and quick access features. Sometimes the kids sent a quick message through the monitoring program asking me to allow access to a specific website. I received this message through email or text alert and could then grant temporary or permanent access. As a mother, I was careful to test how well the programs filtered content in particularly unsavory categories such as porn, violence, gambling and suicide.","Most of the programs we tested let you block access to the web during specific times of the day, such as bedtime or when homework and chores need to get done. <a href=\"/mspy-review\">mSpy</a> also lets you decide how long your child can be online. For example, you can set an access time from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m. but also limit your child to an hour of online activity within that time frame. We tested all these time control features to make sure they worked properly.","Finally, we looked at the activity reports and evaluated how detailed they are. Some monitoring programs simply list the websites your child visited and the search terms they used. Others provide much more detail and include screenshots of the sites your kids visit, lists of blocked search terms entered, and both sides of chat conversations.","<strong>Am I Spying on My Children With Parental Controls?</strong>","There’s a difference between spying on your children and filtering the content they see. Nick Wingfield addresses these concerns in his New York Times article, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/style/family-digital-surveillance-tracking-smartphones.html\">Should You Spy on Your Kids?</a> He mentions that parents who abuse and overuse this software will stifle the independence a child needs to develop into an adult. However, if your mindset is to keep your children safe and not about abusing power, you’ll be far from performing the role of Big Brother.","There are plenty of websites and apps out there that are dangerous and harmful to a growing mind. Protecting your children from these influences can be a good thing. If you notice that your child is searching for questionable content, it’s probably a good time to sit down and have a talk with them. They are growing and learning. The best way to process and understand their development is through open discussion.","<strong>How do I limit internet access at home?</strong>","Limiting the amount of time your child spends online is a good way to cut back on cyberbullying and encourage your child to engage in other activities like reading, sports and in-person interaction with friends and family members. It is also a good way to keep your child focused on homework, completing chores and getting enough sleep.","One way you can block your child’s internet access is through using an internet router filtering device, like <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/circle-with-disney-router,review-3621.html\">Circle with Disney</a>. This device connects to your router or modem and is directed to all the internet connected devices. It lets you turn off internet access to your child’s computers, cellphones, tablets, gaming consoles and other devices. However, these filters are not easy to set up, and some of them may require you to cut off access to all devices rather than just one.","Another way to limit online use is with a monitoring program like Qustodio. <a href=\"/qustodio-review\">Qustodio</a> includes time controls with its software that lets you set specific times your child can be online. And because you can create a different user account for each member of your family, each child and adult can have different time constraints without blocking others. These time controls also have timers so you can see how long your child is online each time they log on.","<strong>Use monitoring programs to combat cyberbullying and prevent teen suicide</strong>","According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), suicide is the third leading cause of death among children ages 10 through 14, and second for youth age 15 and older. While there are several factors that contribute to teen suicide, bullying in any form, including cyberbullying, is a large and growing contributing issue. Others include depression, exposure to pornography, drug addiction including prescription drug abuse, and extended periods on electronic devices.<br/>","We spoke to Lauran Warburton, a suicide prevention advocate and the founder of <a href=\"http://livehannahshope.org/\">Live Hannah’s Hope</a>, a non-profit organization that offers support and resources to help empower youth and support families left behind after suicide, and an advocate for the <a href=\"https://healthcare.utah.edu/uni/programs/safe-ut-smartphone-app/\">SafeUT</a> app. Warburton, who lost her own daughter to suicide, offers several ways parents can help their children stay safe, connected and engaged, and some of the signs to look for that your child may be contemplating harming themselves. We at Top Ten Reviews encourage you to use these tips in addition to monitoring software as a way to keep tabs on your children, intervene when there is a problem and start healthy conversations with your children about self harm.","<strong>What to look for: Signs your child is thinking of self harm</strong>","Warburton shared with us that her daughter’s struggles began after an accident left her daughter with a concussion, which led to a change in mood, depression and isolating herself from friends. Other parents, especially those with children who play sports, sometimes see their children become addicted to prescription pain killers. As parents, you know your child best, and any major changes in their behavior may be a sign they are struggling. Additional signs include:","Grades slipping","Hanging out with different friends, or no friends at all","Saying things like “nobody likes me” or “I don’t have any friends”","Spending lots of time online rather than interacting with people face to face","Sudden or extreme mood changes","Depression (doesn’t want to do anything)","Anxiety (afraid of doing anything)","It is common for children, especially teenagers, to have struggles and moodiness, but Warburton said it becomes a problem when the child doesn’t bounce back after a setback. Still, it is a challenge for parents to differentiate when their child is depressed or just sad. “I think the parent that is in tune with their child, they will know,” says Warburton.","<strong>How parents can help</strong>","Though it is terrifying to think of your child in trouble, it is important for parents to show love and support rather than anger or disappointment. Warburton’s biggest advice to parents is “don’t get mad. [And] don’t be ashamed to talk about” what’s going on with your child. Suicide, depression, bullying – these are all hard topics to talk about, but children feel better when they can share their feelings with their parents.","If you think your child is seriously thinking of hurting themselves, it is important to not dismiss your feelings and seek help from professionals who will provide guidance, support and resources to help you and your child.","More information on signs to look for and resources, including references for professionals available in your area, can be found on the <a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\">National Suicide Prevention</a> website, or by calling the National Suicide Prevention hotline: 1-800-273-8255.","<strong>How much does monitoring software cost?</strong>","While there are free programs, the best monitoring software comes with better protection, including multiple filter categories, text and chat transcripts and screenshot reports. You can expect to pay around $50 for a good, secure program that also includes between three and five licenses to monitor multiple devices.","id:69"]},"id":"56df2ed8-fb05-4d6a-8d26-2fef0ed8d63a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0933b74c-729e-4c31-86df-9e7ceb28ac3c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/qustodio-review\">Qustodio</a>","<a href=\"/surfie-review\">Surfie</a>","<a href=\"/norton-review\">Norton Family</a>","<a href=\"/webwatcher-review\">WebWatcher</a>","<a href=\"/kidlogger-review\">Kidlogger</a>","<a href=\"/mobicip-review\">Mobicip</a>","<a href=\"/net-nanny-review\">Net Nanny Family</a>","<a href=\"/intego-review\">ContentBarrier X9</a>","<a href=\"/mspy-review\">mSpy</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"776496a2-9901-46b2-a909-c4caf4cc5d70","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_290","url":"/best-monitoring-software","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T21:54:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T21:54:00Z","name":"Best Monitoring Software of 2019","synopsis":"Monitoring software can silently log searches, websites visited and keystrokes (even passwords);
