The key is to choose the best.","<a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-microsoft-office-alternatives\">Microsoft Word</a> sets the standard for word processing software, and the iPad app is no different. It is highly ranked in the iTunes store for good reason.","<strong>Plenty of Layout and Design Options<br/></strong>Layout and design options are some of the most important features in this app. Many word processing apps don’t allow you to add much more than text to your documents.","The Word app lets you add tables, charts, equations, special fonts, shapes, images, SmartArt and footnotes. You can also choose from a wide variety of templates to jump-start your project.","There are also two choices of how you view your document. You can choose the real document layout, which lets you see how the document would look if it were printed. This can be hard on the eyes, though. The easy-to-read layout is much more iPad-friendly.","<strong>Connectivity <br/></strong>Another important feature is connectivity. You want to able to access documents you have on other devices, as well as share the documents you create on your iPad.","With this word processing app, you can access Word documents from iCloud, OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, Dropbox or SharePoint. You can also view email attachments and print Word documents to an AirPrint printer. No matter what you do, your content will sync between all of your devices.","If you are collaborating, you can easily track changes and add comments to documents, too. You can even share your document and work on it with a friend or colleague in real-time.","<strong>The Downside<br/></strong>The only real downside to Microsoft Word is that to create new documents or to edit existing documents on your iPad Pro, you need an Office 365 subscription. This may not be much of a barrier, though, since the monthly fee is very low cost. However, basic features (including creating and editing documents) are available without a subscription for the iPhone, iPad Air and iPad mini.","Microsoft Word is a good iPad word processing app for anyone that needs a lot of features and flexibility. The only downside is that you need an Office 365 subscription to use the full features of the app on an iPad Pro. If you need a dependable iPad word processing app, the nominal monthly fee may be worth it."]},"id":"a2d80709-832f-4337-91ef-282515d366d7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10014","url":"/best-word-processing-app-for-the-ipad","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alina-bradford","url":"/author/alina-bradford","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alina Bradford","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"B3tPrF8sxRUy8i2s9RVdDe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T15:42:17Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T15:42:17Z","name":"Best Word Processing App for the iPad","synopsis":"If you want to write while you are on the move or don’t have a computer, an app downloaded from the iTunes Store can still offer a lot of the same features that you will find with standard word","review":{},"strapline":"If you want to write while you are on the move or don’t have a computer, an app downloaded from the iTunes Store can still offer a lot of the same features that you will find with standard word","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-02T15:46:02Z","id":"RdMRgeWEwPSJs7hrxRsV8H","meta":{"title":"Best Word Processing App for the iPad","description":"This feature-filled iPad word processing app will let you write on-the-go.
