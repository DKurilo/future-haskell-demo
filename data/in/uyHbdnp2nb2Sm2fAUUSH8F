Sennheiser MM 450-X headset is one of the lightest, well-designed set of our <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Bluetooth headphone</a> comparison. The compact size, noise-cancelling features and long wireless range make these Bluetooth headphones the perfect choice for traveling.","A few features make these Sennheiser Bluetooth stereo headphones stand out among the competition. The MM 450-X headphones feature NoiseGard technology that removes up to 90 percent of ambient noise outside of the headphones.","Another feature we like about these headphones is the TalkThrough function. If you&#39;re using the active noise cancellation and someone needs to talk to you, just switch on TalkThrough. Y; your music will pause, the noise reducer will shut off and the microphones on the outside of the ear cups will pick up what they&#39;re saying. When the conversation is over, switch on the noise cancellation and your music will start again.","For small headphones, it&#39;s hard to achieve superior sound quality. The MM 450-X headset has a solid soundscape but the audio is a bit muffled and tinny. For phone calls and general listening however, the MM 450-Xs are still a good Bluetooth choice.","Many on-ear Bluetooth headphones are lighter than their over-ear comrades. The MM 450-X headset however goes a step further and the entire construction is extremely lightweight. At 3.7 ounces, these were the lightest headphones in our comparison. This small but mighty set folds for compact storage, and the battery lasts from eight to 20 hours on a single charge. Similar to other Sennheiser headsets, the remote controls on the ear cup are easy to use.","Like many of the top Bluetooth headphones, the Sennheiser MM-450X headphones have a wireless range of 33 feet. This allows you to leave your phone or connected device in another room without losing connection. This headset also supports aptX for increased sound quality, but does not support NFC for quicker pairing. A detachable cable is included should you want to listen passively after your battery runs out as well.","Sennheiser offers a two-year warranty on the MM 450-X headphones. You can download the user manual from the website, visit the forums to see what people are saying about the headphones or join the social media community to let others know about your experience. Live chat, email and phone contact information is also available on the website for your technical support queries."]},"id":"060755c5-0102-4c50-975b-46824060604b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bb97d440-789b-496b-9eb9-b34d057db7c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sennheiser MM 450-X headphones offer an excellent way to listen to music and watch videos.
