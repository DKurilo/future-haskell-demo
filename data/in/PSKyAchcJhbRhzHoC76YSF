You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you want to save money when buying a brand-new <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TV</a>, you can go with an off brand and still get good quality. Vizio has seen its popularity increase in the last couple of years as more people praise the performance of its TVs. These aren&#39;t run-of-the-mill off-brand LED TVs; these affordable devices have a decent picture quality and offer smart TV features you can&#39;t find with lower-end products. The best part is you won’t be paying for advertising costs like you do with other name brand LED TVs.","Vizio proves its value with the E-Series LED TVs. They come in a variety of sizes, but the best ones combine well with name brand devices. Also, there isn’t a huge gap between the picture quality of the best LED TVs and the Vizio E-Series. One of the areas we test is color accuracy and black levels. High picture quality scores mean your TV will separate colors well without much washing out. The color accuracy and black level scores are much better than most other budget products.","Not only does the Vizio 55-inch TV have a decent picture, but it has smart TV features like internet-streaming apps, Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video. You can also watch older seasons of TV shows or see last week’s episode of your favorite series at your leisure by using the apps. The built-in Wi-Fi allows you to sit down and connect to the web wirelessly.","The design of the Vizio is average though. While the TVs have slim bezels, the frame around the screen, other manufacturers have slimmer bezels that look sleeker. This is not a dealbreaker; however, in a side-by-side comparison with the best LED TVs, you can see the difference in the high-end ones.","One of the fears you may have with buying a Vizio TV is the reliability factor. A cheaper TV may not be a better deal if it breaks down more often than top-brand LED TVs. Vizio has been around long enough though and is making a name for itself in the LED TV business. The customer support team is on par with other manufacturers as well. If you have questions or need problems addressed, you can contact a Vizio associate through the support email, or for a faster response, you can use the live-chat option."]},"id":"cc8fd9a0-f663-4615-b278-22b4710dd8d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7353ade2-e056-440a-b00b-58a32b28ba57","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Vizio is showing the world that you don’t have to be a major name brand to make a great LED TV.
