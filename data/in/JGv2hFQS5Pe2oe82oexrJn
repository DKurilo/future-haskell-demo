You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Polk TSx 330T <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">floor standing speakers</a> are an incredible value, priced at less than $300 per pair. If you want to add floor standing speakers to improve your home theater but don’t want to spend more than $500, the TSx 330T are your best bet.","Because of the speakers’ front-ported cabinet design, you can place them close to a wall without causing wall reflection. This is important because, with dimensions of 37.5 x 11.4 x 13.4 inches, the cabinets are deeper than most – they will be less obtrusive next to a wall when used in a small- to medium-size entertainment room.","We asked a diverse panel of testers to rate the bass clarity in the music and movies we played, and this set of speakers earned a wide range of scores. In general, people found the speakers’ bass response to be a bit muddy in our music tests. On the other hand, they were one of the top contenders for low-frequency content in our movie test. When you watch action movies, you should feel the low-frequency content, such as explosions, kick you in the chest. The TSx 330T produced these bass frequencies at high volumes without causing distortion. Based on our results, this speaker set is a good fit for someone who enjoys in-your-face bass while watching movies.","We listened to music from a variety of genres for our music test. The Polk TSx 330T did better with vocal content when the music didn’t have low-end thump. We listened to selections from Beck’s album “The Information,” and the towers seemed to lose vocal clarity in portions of the song that contained lower synth bass. That album is particularly bass heavy, but these speakers delivered a disproportionate amount of bass compared to other models we tested, like the <a href=\"/polk-s55-review\">Polk Audio S55</a>.","Polk Audio offers a five-year manufacturer warranty, which is average for floor standing speakers. If you have questions, you can contact customer support by phone and email. You can also download the user manual from the manufacturer’s website if you lose the one supplied in the retail packaging."]},"id":"788f77b9-bc37-4883-b67d-bbc0ad43b059","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"28565b74-d929-4582-9239-9a8dc535d95c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Polk Audio TSx 330T towers delivered accurate vocals and dialogue in our tests.
