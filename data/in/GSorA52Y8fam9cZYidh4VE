You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","All-in-One PCs act as a great family computer with their easy setup and computing power. While the HP Omni 27-1210xt stands out with its stunning design and impressive 27-inch HD display, the mediocre computing power and lack of touchscreen controls make it a hard sell for most families.","The HP Omni 27-1210xt runs Windows 8, and while the dashboard is easy enough to use with a mouse, the operating system is clumsy and difficult to manage without a touchscreen. One of the better features of Windows 8 is its multitasking, but the Omni&#39;s 2.7GHz processor speed keeps it from utilizing this potential. Fortunately, the 8GB of memory will allow you to surf the web while downloading programs in the background without slowdown. Additionally, the 1TB of storage space means that you&#39;ll be able to download a lot of files before filling the hard drive.","All of these specs translate to a great internet-surfing all-in-one PC for your family. If you want a good computer for family usage and for your children to do homework, the HP Omni 27-1210xt offers enough processing power to get work done while offering little potential for gaming or other resource-intensive tasks. If you&#39;re looking for a gaming machine or something to act as the central media hub of your house, you&#39;ll have to buy the optional features and drive the price up. Instead, consider this a 27-inch internet machine.","At its base model, the HP Omni 27-1210xt comes with nice standard features, including a DVD writer and HD webcam. The Beats Audio speakers produce a surprising amount of power and quality. The wireless mouse and keyboard are great inclusions to the price, but the keyboard will take some getting used to, as it is a small and the keys are hard to press. The Omni offers seven USB 2.0 ports, which allows you plenty of opportunity to plug in any device you need without micro-managing your ports. Unfortunately, there are no USB 3.0 ports, which is odd for any computer at this price range.","HP includes a digital customer support program on this computer, so if you have any issues while installing or operating the computer, help is a click away. Additionally, customer support representatives are available through email or telephone, and they&#39;ll patiently work you through any problems. You&#39;ll also get a two-year warranty with this Omni, so any issues you have will be covered through customer care or service calls."]},"id":"532d3c43-afad-49c9-b59e-d01794cd7017","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2860082b-7ec6-447b-910e-2bfe145f9902","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Omni 27-1210xt is a good all-in-one PC for families who only need an internet-ready computer for everyone to use.
