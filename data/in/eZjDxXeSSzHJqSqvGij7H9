The Auto Warranty Agency is an extended car warranty provider that offers a variety of plans, ranging from full coverage to component and powertrain plans, to help you survive the costs of unexpected part failures and mechanic bills.","The full-coverage plans are an extension of the carâ€™s original warranty and provide comprehensive coverage to all major systems of the car. Full-coverage plans offer an extended auto warranty for vehicles&#39; major systems, including the engine and transmission, air conditioning, brakes and steering, the fuel system and more. As with all warranties, normal maintenance such as replacing the oil and lubricants, tires and brake pads are still your responsibility.","To qualify for one of the four full coverage plans your car must have less than 85,000 miles on the odometer. The majority of the full-coverage plans require that your vehicle is no older than five or six years. The one exception allows that your car be up to 15 years old, but to qualify for that full-coverage plan the car must have less than 60,000 miles on the odometer.","The midrange component plans will cover the powertrain components and most of the mechanical and electrical systems of your car. The more basic powertrain plans cover just the powertrain components, which include the important high-cost parts like engine, transmission and drivetrain components. You can get a quick quote at any time on the company&#39;s homepage, and contracts are available for you to read as well. This service lets you research the options to see what is excluded from each plan.","Like many extended auto warranty companies, The Auto Warranty Agency does not carry any of the warranties itself, but instead sells warranties covered by partner agencies. This lets the company offer multiple plans and makes it so you can shop around for the best price and coverage. The downside to this approach is that The Auto Warranty Agency has no direct control over what the warranty holders will honor when your vehicle needs a repair. The degree of difficulty for getting repairs approved and covered will depend on how the secondary company does business.","One great feature with each car warranty purchased through The Auto Warranty Agency is 24/7 roadside assistance that includes towing and rental car reimbursement. This is a reassuring feature. Knowing that you just have to make a phone call to get help on the way is just one of the benefits of an extended car warranty."]},"id":"41003b2e-352e-47e6-8f4b-39c822c01acb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e92016de-5aeb-4d1e-9199-96d8b1ab3baf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Auto Warranty Agency has a variety of plans, from comprehensive full-coverage plans to basic powertrain plans.
