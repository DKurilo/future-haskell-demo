These systems are regularly upgraded, and this is included in the subscription price, so you get new features as soon as they&#39;re released for no additional cost. However, to run this type of system you need reliable internet; if this isn&#39;t available in your area, a downloadable program that runs offline may better suit your needs.","<strong>Work with unlocked hardware.</strong> If you already own POS equipment, or if you want to be able to continue using your hardware even if you switch systems, you want to choose a POS system that works with unlocked, third-party hardware. Some POS systems only work with proprietary or specially programmed equipment that you won&#39;t be able to use if you switch systems.","<strong>Grow with your business.</strong> A system that allows you to add more checkout stations, integrations and even locations to your account can save you the headache of switching systems as your business expands."],"type":"ul"},"id":"5ff5257c-1f84-445c-886a-7d0da3343de1","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What Can an iPad Point-of-Sale System Do?</strong>","These are tablet-based systems that run on Apple&#39;s iOS platform. Each system has apps that you download to your iPad, and some work on iPhones as well. The iPad either connects to or is used alongside the credit card terminal provided by your payment processing company. The POS app records your transactions and generates a variety of sales reports that you can use to analyze your business&#39;s performance. Many iPad POS systems also include inventory and customer management tools. You can create a countertop checkout station by connecting the iPad to a tablet stand, receipt printer and cash drawer. Additional peripherals such as barcode scanners can also be connected to the system.","Many POS companies offer systems for either retail businesses or restaurants, though some offer solutions for both and can also be used by service-based businesses. All of the iPad POS systems we reviewed are suitable for retailers, and many can be used by counter-serve restaurants as well. Four of the systems also can be used by full-service restaurants. You can see more options for <a href=\"/business/payment-processing/best-restaurant-pos-systems\">restaurant POS systems</a> in our review. Most iPad POS systems give you a choice of processor; you can learn more about these companies in our <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> review. Our <a href=\"/money\">articles about POS systems and payment processing</a> can also help you learn more about these topics.","<strong>Why Is Choosing an iPad POS System Complex?</strong>","Every iPad POS company offers a different combination of features, equipment and processing. Many also offer ancillary features such as accounting, employee management and marketing in the attempt to create a one-stop solution. This variance between systems means that you can&#39;t simply compare pricing to determine overall value. Rather, you need to calculate the costs for all three components as you evaluate systems.","Additionally, you want to decide which ancillary services you need so you can figure out whether it&#39;s more cost-effective to choose an advanced POS system that has these features built in or a more basic system that offers these features in a higher service tier or as add-ons or integrations that would cost extra.","<strong>iPad vs. Android: Which POS Platform Is Better?</strong>","While some POS systems are compatible with either iPad or <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-pos-systems/\">Android tablets</a>, many only work on one platform. If you prefer iPads, chances are you won&#39;t be satisfied with a system that only works with Android tablets. If you want to use the iPads and iPhones you already own, platform is an important consideration as you evaluate systems.","iPads are well known for their user-friendly interface and stability, as Apple designs both the hardware and the operating software. iPads also have superior security because iOS is a closed platform, making it a less attractive target for hackers (though it isn&#39;t immune to malware attacks and it&#39;s important to keep your devices updated). However, iPads tend to be more expensive than Android tablets because they&#39;re produced by a single company rather than multiple manufacturers.","<strong>iPad POS Contract Terms &amp; Conditions: What to Watch For</strong>","Although most iPad POS companies offer service on a month-to-month basis, some have multi-year contracts. Before you sign a contract with any POS service, you want to read the contract in full and make sure you understand what terms and obligations you&#39;re agreeing to. Pay particular attention to term length, all costs and fees, and the cancellation procedure, including any penalties, such as liquidated damages, for early cancellation. If the POS company will also provide your credit card processing service, you want to verify that you have the full contract (this is typically a three-part document: application, terms of service and program guide).","<strong>Leasing Contracts &amp; &#34;Free&#34; POS Hardware</strong>","Whenever possible, you want to purchase your POS equipment upfront, as it can be significantly less expensive than leasing. It&#39;s also better to buy than to accept &#34;free&#34; POS hardware or participate in a &#34;free placement program&#34; provided by your payment processing service so you can avoid being locked into the noncancelable contract that often accompanies such deals. These contracts are problematic because if your business closes, you&#39;re personally responsible to fulfill all obligations.","Contracts can be as short as one year or as long as five, though most are for three years and automatically renew for additional one- or two-year terms. If you wish to cancel your account, you usually only have a 30-day window at the end of the term to submit written notice.","If you accept &#34;free&#34; POS hardware in exchange for signing a lengthy contract, you want to find out if you&#39;ll own the equipment when the term ends, if you&#39;re required to return it or if you must to pay more if you want to keep it. If you&#39;re required to return it, you want to ask about wear-and-tear penalties and restocking fees.","<strong>iPad POS Systems: More Recommendations</strong>","Our top recommendations – Revel Systems, Vend and SalesVu – are great iPad POS systems.
