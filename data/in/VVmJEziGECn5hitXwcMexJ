The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-audio-editing-software\"><em>Audio Editing Software</em></a><em> here.</em>","There are many reasons why Sound Forge Pro is a top choice for an audio editor. The entire layout of the interface is customizable. You can add and remove workspaces as you please, and the toolbar is fully customizable. There is also a great editing tool set to back it all up.","You can customize this Mac audio editor to work the way you want. The workflow and flexibility that Sound Forge Pro provides is top-notch. The top right corner has buttons to add and remove certain elements in your work window. You can strip your work window all the way down to just the audio editor, or you can have the plugin manager and two editors up at the same time. It&#39;s all up to you.","The toolbar that sits atop your wave editor is fully customizable as well. You can add as many icons and buttons as you wish, or keep it bare and cluster-free. Sound Forge lets you dictate the workflow.","This audio editing software for Mac boasts strong audio editing and restoration tools. We uploaded a noisy single-voice recording with noticeable hum in the background and used the iZotope denoiser to remove the hum. This plugin did so with great success. The denoiser samples the noise that you want removed and then removes any instance of it throughout the audio. This left us with a great-sounding audio recording with no hum in the background.","To restore old LPs or bad analog recordings, there are tools such as the declicker and declipper, which remove those unwanted noises. The declipper is helpful when you have an audio recording that is too loud and you want to bring the levels back down within normal decibel range.","Within this Mac sound software is a robust selection of effects to apply to your audio. Outside of the effects we looked for, there are plugins to help you master your audio once you are done editing. These mastering effects include a master limiter, compression, reverb and EQs. You can also combine your plugins in the plugin chain.","Sound Forge Pro allows you to record through multiple channels. You can add up to 32 channels to your recording project. The software excels at recording line-in audio. Many of the audio editors we reviewed donâ€™t even provide the capabilities to record multiple audio sources simultaneously. This allows you to tackle larger recording projects than most Mac audio editors can handle.","When you are importing audio files, you won&#39;t come across many audio files that aren&#39;t compatible with this sound editing software for Mac. Sound Forge can import and convert the files to a wide variety of formats. We were able to import and convert the files for almost every format we tested, except for WMA.","The downside to this audio editor for Mac is that it doesn&#39;t recognize many video file formats. Out of the seven that we tried to import during our testing, the only video file format that Sound Forge successfully extracted the audio data from was MP4.","If you need any help using Sound Forge, you can download the manual from the manufacturer&#39;s website or email the company with any questions. There is also a user forum you can visit on the site, which can be useful for quick help.","Sound Forge is one of the most user-friendly Mac audio editing programs we reviewed. You can customize the workspace to be exactly the way you want it. It also contains many editing and audio restoration tools that help you take on a handful of editing jobs. This audio software is worth its high price tag."]},"id":"f4febc7c-b2a2-40c1-ab9a-6798888a681c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69323","url":"/sound-forge-pro-mac-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-23T13:59:12Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T13:59:12Z","name":"Sound Forge Pro Mac 2.5","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
