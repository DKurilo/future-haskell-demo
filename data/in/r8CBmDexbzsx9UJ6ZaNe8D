A pre-filter enhanced with Arm &amp; Hammer technology captures large particles and odors, and regular carbon filters are also included. Once the air is free from odors- and large particles, it travels through a true HEPA filter for final purification before it is released back into your air. The HAP726-U can filter a room up to 256 square feet at a rate of 168 cubic feet per minute.","To be considered a true HEPA filter, an air purifier must be able to filter 99.97 percent of airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. Anything different can still be called a HEPA filter, but it isn’t a true HEPA. The Holmes HAP726-U is indeed a true HEPA filter, meeting all of the filtration requirements. It is also Energy Star rated for its compliance to energy efficiency guidelines and acceptable Clean Air Delivery Rate.","The Holmes HAP726-U CADR are as follows:"]},"id":"1c76d74e-44cf-49fd-a370-b91a1305c338","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Tobacco Smoke- 168","Dust- 168","Pollen- 168"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2779a5bd-c0d4-4625-9d2a-df756912c347","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The CADR is based on a clean and efficient filtration, so to obtain air purification at these levels, be sure to change the carbon pre-filter every three to six months and the true HEPA filter at least every year.
