It may simply be in order to make more money or even to prove yourself to management, but make sure you understand what you’re sacrificing for the added time in the office.. If you feel compelled to spend overtime at work, here are some pros and cons to such a behavior.","<strong>Staying Caught Up</strong>","Simply put, spending additional time in the office can help you keep on top of your workload. Falling behind can happen even if you simply take a day off. And even the best <a href=\"/money/small-business\">employee scheduling software</a> won&#39;t always help you and your team get everything done in 40 hours a week. Sometimes overtime becomes necessary, and you may even find that putting in overtime during the off hours can oftentimes result in reduced distractions and heightened efficiency when everyone else has gone home for the night.","<strong>Paving a Future</strong>","Overtime is often the best way to impress management and show your dedication to ensuring a project is delivered in a timely fashion. This type of dedication can result in a wealth of benefits in the long run, ranging from promotions to increased wages. Occasional overtime can be necessary for ensuring you have a long-term career that will evolve into something high paying and low stress.","<strong>Making Extra Money</strong>","Non-salaried employees stand to gain a lot financially from overtime. Considering how hourly pay increases after the first 40 hours of a week, the additional overtime pay can really add up. If you’re trying to meet financial obligations, save up for upcoming expenditures or simply cushion your bank account a little, working overtime into your work schedules is a good way for hourly employees to make a little extra. Salaried employees, however, get paid a flat rate for their work whether they spend 40 or 60 hours to accomplish it in a given week.","<strong>Limiting Family Time</strong>","Putting an increased number of hours in at the office can have a detrimental effect on your social life. Your family and friends will see less of you, which can negatively influence relationships. Even if the additional hours are necessary, make sure you&#39;re conscious of maintaining a proper work-home balance. Neglecting the home because of work can create more problems than the added income would solve. You may miss family events, important social occasions at your children’s school or significant relationship milestones.","<strong>Risking Burnout</strong>","You may simply be putting in overtime at work because you’re passionate about the projects you work on. If it’s something you love, then by all means you should continue to do what makes you happy. At the same time, spending too much time in the office can risk an eventual burnout. At this point, going to work will no longer be appealing and you risk a decrease in performance. A proper work-home balance is needed to ensure your work remains enjoyable.","Working overtime has many benefits and drawbacks beyond these. While work may ultimately be quite time consuming, it will pay off in the end. The end result simply depends on your individual personality and how far you want to advance within a company or industry. Overtime opportunities are generally optional, depending on your company&#39;s employee scheduling policies, but they can oftentimes help you secure your job in this challenging and diverse job market.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don’t Have To.™<br/> "]},"id":"377b8f60-c849-4c6d-a993-3a289714d70e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7772","url":"/overtime-work-the-pros-and-cons-of-extra-hours","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-goodrich","url":"/author/ryan-goodrich","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ryan Goodrich","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"JiyjX3p6rgLpyZFxn2y77n","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-14T13:54:21Z","datePublished":"2013-02-14T13:54:21Z","name":"Is Overtime Actually Worth It?
