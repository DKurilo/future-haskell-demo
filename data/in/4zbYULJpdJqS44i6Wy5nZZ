Instead of using intimidating, overwhelming tools, you create your cards mostly by dragging and dropping design elements onto your project. You can choose from hundreds of thousands of images and more than 50,000 templates.","Canva is the best place to design greeting cards if you have a Mac, but you can also use it to create hundreds of other projects, including business cards, flyers, book covers and infographics.  <br />\n  <br />\nIn addition to being stylish, Canva’s images are high quality – you can move them around and resize them to fit your design without causing pixilation or creating jagged edges. And if you can’t find the right graphic in its huge library or you want to share a personal photo, you can upload your own.   <br />\n  <br />\nHowever, Canva is missing some basic photo editing tools, including a cropping tool and a red-eye remover, so you need to edit your images before you upload them. Also, it doesn’t have templates for traditional multi-fold cards like those you find in stores. Instead, it has templates to create flat, postcard-style cards.   <br />\n  <br />\nAnother potential drawback is Canva is a subscription service. However, it’s easy to cancel your membership, so depending on the scope of your projects, it can end up costing less than some of the other programs we tested. There is also a decent free version, though it includes limited access to graphics. The service’s excellent support pages make it easy to figure out which membership is right for you or your business – its support information is searchable and detailed.","<a href=\"/canva-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"c633b09a-d059-4794-b05c-29f4e1882751","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"db2d2dea-035b-47cf-89bd-86e774be9a82","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/Wd3yssBVWTqNvsFfuTt8cc.jpg","link":{"href":"/software/home/best-mac-greeting-card-software/greeting-box-for-mac-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/U/I/773514/original/Mac-Greeting-Card-Software-Greeting-Box-for-Mac.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wd3yssBVWTqNvsFfuTt8cc.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Wd3yssBVWTqNvsFfuTt8cc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wd3yssBVWTqNvsFfuTt8cc.jpg","alt":"Greeting Box for Mac"},"id":"593278d1-7f64-47fb-b057-28edccae37c7","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Greeting Box for Mac\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/greeting-box-for-mac-review\">Greeting Box for Mac</a>","pros":["Inexpensive","Easy to use","Can upload your own photos and graphics"],"cons":["No photo editing tools","Few graphics and templates","Few sharing options"]},"id":"e65ec38f-6b1d-49e7-bb7b-41992837b465","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Greeting Box comes with so few templates, backgrounds and graphics compared to other greeting card design software, that using it is almost like working with a blank canvas.

Once the images are in the software, you can only drag, layer, rotate and reverse them. There’s also a transparency option, but compared to Hallmark Card Studio’s design suite, which includes more effects and filters, Greeting Box’s tools are very basic.   <br />\n  <br />\nThis program’s biggest benefit is its price – it only costs $9.99. Other greeting cards programs cost between $40.00 and $50.00. Our best pick, Canva, is a subscription service with a fee that, over time, can make it cost even more. While Canva has a limited free version, it can be frustrating to only have access to some of the features and graphics, and Greeting Box gives you full access with your initial download. Also, you can order more clip art directly from Greeting Box for a few extra dollars.","<a href=\"/greeting-box-for-mac-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"656f14a4-4dec-4717-93e4-919d1c520de1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best For Traditional Greeting Cards"},"id":"39dd715e-1d15-4a5a-8006-4013b94c7f11","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/LujVgkxfQjBsTZKtV5YLrB.jpg","link":{"href":"/software/home/best-mac-greeting-card-software/hallmark-card-studio-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/O/C/773292/original/Mac-Greeting-Card-Software-Hallmark-Card-Studio-for-Mac.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LujVgkxfQjBsTZKtV5YLrB.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"LujVgkxfQjBsTZKtV5YLrB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LujVgkxfQjBsTZKtV5YLrB.jpg","alt":"Hallmark Card Studio"},"id":"d731cb77-7438-449a-9e5b-92d62ff2f95e","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Hallmark Card Studio\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/hallmark-card-studio-review\">Hallmark Card Studio</a>","pros":["Multi-fold cards","High-quality graphics","More filters and tools than other software"],"cons":["Fewer graphics and templates","Some photo editing tools are missing","Interface is less intuitive than others"]},"id":"d793b6f5-1f62-444f-b4b2-47532a4a918a","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We were initially a little disappointed with Hallmark Card Studio for Mac because we’d already tested the PC version and liked it better.

Our testers have graphic art backgrounds and their familiarity with these kinds of programs enables them to effectively evaluate and compare the variety of convenient features and helpful tools of each program.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We downloaded the available Mac greeting card programs – there are only six we could find that keep their software up to date and seemed safe to download – and tested them over the course of several weeks. In total, we spent about 40 hours designing cards and playing with the programs’ features so we could make well-informed comparisons between them. We created some event and holiday cards from scratch and with the provided templates. In each program, we also made invitations to a summer ice cream party to see if the software could help us make the designs we had in our heads a reality.","As we tested each program, we evaluated the quantity and quality of the graphics and templates it includes. To check clip art quality, we flipped, rotated, resized and recolored images. Both during the design process and after we printed our final designs, we made sure the graphics retained their shape and that they didn’t pixelate or have jagged edges. We also uploaded our own pictures to create personalized designs and to make sure the programs didn’t distort or corrupt our files.","After we finished our designs, we checked what file formats each program can export as. We also evaluated whether the software makes it easy to share projects on social media, make at-home or in-store prints, and create folded cards.","Programs with lots of training materials make it easy to use all their cool features to their fullest extent. We visited each software’s webpage to search for phone and live chat support information. We also visited each application’s help and support page and walked through tutorials to see how useful they are.","<strong>How Much Does Greeting Card Software for Mac Cost? </strong>","The programs we tested range in price from $10 to $50. Our favorite greeting card software for Mac landed near the bottom of that price range at $13 and has the best selection of templates and graphics. Some of the $40 programs have better sharing options and editing tools, but if you don’t need thousands of templates, we suggest checking out the low-cost software we tested.","<strong>Features To Look For In Mac Greeting Card Software</strong> ","Templates &amp; Graphics<br/>The number of included templates and graphics varies widely from program to program. We suggest avoiding programs with fewer than 5,000 templates and fewer than 10,000 graphics. However, this is less of an issue if you plan to upload your own graphics and designs and just want a program for its tools and blank templates.","While having enough graphics and templates to choose from is important, you should also consider their quality. Before you buy, find out what resolution the software’s graphics are and if the program includes scalable vector graphics, the latter of which can be resized without quality loss.","As we tested greeting card software, we found that some of the programs have outdated, unstylish images and backgrounds. We recommend browsing the program’s library, or using a free trial if the application offers one, to see if its designs align with your tastes.","Editing Tools<br/>Because Apple includes applications for photo editing and creative projects in its macOS, we found most of the Mac greeting card design programs we tested have fewer editing tools than their PC-compatible counterparts. This means you may need to edit photos in another application before you upload them to your greeting card software. A few of the programs we tested have some basic editing tools, such as those for cropping and fixing red-eye, but those same programs have lower quality graphics.","While it’s convenient to be able to find, upload, edit and incorporate images into your designs all in one space, none of the programs we reviewed have the full package of tools we looked for. As such, if you’re a dedicated Mac user, we recommend choosing greeting card design software based on the quality and style of its graphics rather than on its photo editing tools. If you also have a PC, you can check out our reviews of the best Windows-compatible greeting card programs, which have a better balance of editing tools and graphics.","Sharing Options<br/>After you’ve spent hours choosing and customizing greeting cards, you probably want to share them with someone. Be it through email, a link to a photo hosting site or through social media, there are myriad ways to share your creations.","As with editing tools, Macs have built-in sharing features you can access through your Apple account. When you save a file to your computer, you can use Finder to connect to social media or iCloud and share your projects from there. Because of this, most Mac greeting card applications don’t include features that let you share your finished cards to social media directly from the software.","There are also plenty of photo hosting sites you can use to store your image files online, including <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/\">Google Photos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smugmug.com/\">SmugMug</a> and <a href=\"http://photobucket.com/\">Photobucket</a>. Most of these sites offer basic free storage for a small quantity of files, and they make it easy to label and organize your images as you see fit.
