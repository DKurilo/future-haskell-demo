It&#39;s even harder to watch other people enjoy ice cream that you can&#39;t have. The Hamilton Beach Half Pint Ice Cream Maker makes single servings so you can enjoy your favorite flavors without the guilt.","Ice cream makers, including the Half Pint, use a mixing bowl you pre-freeze to help the ice cream mixture &#34;set up&#34; as it&#39;s being churned by the dasher. Even with prolonged storage, the Half Pint freezer bowl thaws quickly, causing the ice cream to take on less of a store-bought quality and more of a thick milkshake texture. With many ice cream makers, you can simply freeze the ice cream and remix it to thicken the consistency. If you do this, you have to cover the freezer bowl to prevent ice crystals.","This Hamilton Beach model churns ice cream using only a few parts, including a freezer bowl that doubles as an ice cream bowl. This model might look like an electric ice cream maker, but all you need is two AA batteries and a little bit of patience. Standing only 9 inches tall when fully assembled, the Hamilton Beach Half Pint is smaller than many items in your freezer. Storage is an important factor for ice cream makers because they are typically only used a few times each year. The freezer bowl is compact, so you can easily store it in your freezer until you&#39;re ready to use it.","Keeping the mixing bowl stored in the freezer cuts preparation time in half and allows you to make a personal portion ice cream on a whim. The size also means you won&#39;t need huge quantities of milk, cream, sugar or flavors. You already have enough ingredients on hand to make a small batch now. Just add chocolate syrup and coffee to make sweet mocha ice cream or some chopped pecans and brown sugar to make butter pecan ice cream. The appeal of a tiny, personal serving ice cream maker earns this model a place on the list of best ice cream makers we reviewed.","Because this ice cream maker is so small, cleaning is a snap. The smooth-coated metal mixing bowl doesn&#39;t trap ice cream and rinses quickly with warm, soapy water. You may have to scrub the lid and dasher more than the other parts, but these also clean up quickly."]},"id":"1a069606-94f7-4255-b798-dd8c5d1c9581","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3300a9e7-0c7b-44c0-8e55-6f56386512ea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re vegan, lactose intolerant or have any other dietary restrictions that stand between you and a bowl of ice cream, the Hamilton Beach Half Pint is a great balance between serving size, storage and easy cleaning.
