You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Eureka CompleteClean is a canister <a href=\"/best-deep-vacuum-cleaners\">deep vacuum cleaner</a> that can clean your home from floor to ceiling. There are tools included which specifically address different cleaning needs, conveniently housed on the canister body. A triple filter system eliminates allergens and irritants from the exhaust air while you vacuum. A large control panel on the canister allows you to control the vacuum in various ways and alerts you to empty the dust bin when it’s full.","The CompleteClean’s electric power head vacuums carpets and rugs with a 12-amp cyclonic motor. Your uncarpeted flooring, like linoleum and hardwood, can get cleaned with a special motor-less attachment. The soft wheels won’t scratch hardwood flooring, and help the canister roll smoothly. Reaching into corners and high on your ceiling is simple with a telescoping wand. You also have the option of using a crevice tool, upholstery tool and dusting tool to help rid your home of dust.","Three separate filter systems help eliminate 99.97 percent of the allergens and dust that get pulled up while you vacuum. The cyclonic filter, a micron cyclone chamber filter, and a HEPA exhaust filter ensure that the air coming out of your vacuum contains almost no irritating dust or dander particles. These filters do require some maintenance and will need to be replaced. However, because this is a bagless vacuum, the filters are the only part of this vacuum that will need regular attention.","The dust bin on the CompleteClean is not see-through, so a handy indicator light glows red on the control panel when the dust bin needs to be emptied. Also on the control panel, a foot-controlled power button allows you to turn the vacuum on and off without bending over. Adjusting the motor speed is simple with another large foot-controlled button. By reducing the suction power, you can vacuum delicate items like drapes or blinds. Another easy-to-access button on the control panel automatically rewinds the power cord to hide it neatly inside the canister.","The Eureka CompleteClean has a one-year warranty, which is shorter than most deep vacuums. The manufacturer website has instructions for getting the most out of your Eureka vacuum, with maintenance tips, guides and manuals. By contacting customer service through the listed phone number or email address, you can get your questions and concerns addressed. There is also a search director for finding the nearest Eureka repair and service facility.","For a versatile and affordable deep vacuum, consider the Eureka CompleteClean canister vacuum cleaner. This vacuum has an assortment of useful tools, good filtering ability and easy-to-use canister body, which help you to get your home as clean as possible."]},"id":"a26807ca-7bf1-4d69-8f05-393ae0d9af65","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60003","url":"/eureka-completeclean-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-18T19:48:31Z","datePublished":"2014-07-18T19:48:31Z","name":"Eureka CompleteClean 955A","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-07-18T19:48:31Z","id":"nyADvAH4E6Y6JpDXFckZk8","meta":{"title":"Eureka CompleteClean 955A Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Eureka CompleteClean is an affordable canister deep vacuum cleaner with a three-stage filter to get your house as clean as possible.
