Unfortunately, the Bluetooth technology of the JBL Synchros Reflect BT doesn&#39;t allow you to experience the high-end audio quality of a wired JBL in-ear headphone. What you sacrifice in audio quality, though, you gain in convenience and durability. While the drivers have one of the best frequency ranges available, capable of reproducing 10Hz to 22kHz, the audio quality doesn&#39;t reflect it. It&#39;s good for workouts and running, but it isn&#39;t very good for leisure listening.","With a highly reflective cord, the JBL Synchros Reflect BT is a good <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">wireless earbud set</a> for running at night or the early morning. When a car approaches you from behind, the headlights reflect off the band, making you visible to the driver. In addition, the earbuds have a built-in magnet that allows you to wear the earbuds as a necklace when you&#39;re not using them. The magnets, when connected, automatically activate the standby mode, which preserves the battery life.","The Synchros Reflect BT are sweat-proof and impact resistant, making them ideal for sports and workouts. You can run, jump, fall down and sweat profusely with these on your ears. They are durable enough to handle your active lifestyle. However, they aren&#39;t sand or dust resistant, which means you won&#39;t want to drop them in the sand at the beach. You also don&#39;t get a carrying case, which is common among the best wireless earbuds.","The biggest flaw with the JBL Synchros Reflect BT is the short battery life. With just five hours for streaming music and taking phone calls, it has the shortest battery life available. For comparison, the longest battery life is eight hours. The battery life is even shorter if you have the volume above 50 percent. The higher the volume, the shorter the battery life.","The ear tips are comfortable and create a good seal in your ear canal, which isolates the sound so that the world around you doesn&#39;t infringe on your music. An ear fin fits into the concha of your ear – the bowl-shaped area outside your ear canal. This ensures that it doesn&#39;t fall out while you&#39;re running, playing basketball or lifting weights. Unfortunately, the flat cord design doesn&#39;t allow you to wrap the cord over your ear for added support."]},"id":"6893f7b4-f442-4ee6-8ca5-9388e4a7b369","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f938c707-d101-4860-a7cc-f6a061a00604","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you enjoy running at night or in the early morning before the sun&#39;s up, the JBL Synchros Reflect BT wireless earphones are an excellent choice, because the reflective cord makes you visible to drivers on the road and the sweat-proof design means you don&#39;t have to worry about shorting out the components.
