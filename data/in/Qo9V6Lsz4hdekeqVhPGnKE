Its specifications include a 1448 x 1072 display with a pixel density mark of 300 ppi. The screen performed phenomenally during our hands-on testing, rendering sharp blacks and greys. Onscreen text is similarly smooth with virtually no pixelation on individual letters. For comparison, the best eReaders rely on displays that reach the 300 ppi mark.
