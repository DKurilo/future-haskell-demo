The pre-filter captures large particles and helps eliminate odors. Next, the HEPA filter traps smaller particles like dust, pollen and other allergens. Finally, the ionizer charges small particles as they leave the filter, making them attract other particles so the filters will capture them on the second pass. Using all three stages of the filtration system will effectively clean small rooms.","However, it&#39;s important to note that the EPA warns against prolonged exposure to ionized particles. Electromagnetically charged air can damage healthy lungs. Fortunately, you can turn off the ionizer if you are concerned about breathing potentially harmful particles. However, without the use of the ionizer, the OptiMax loses much of its ability to filter pollutants from indoor air. You can also opt to use the operation timer to limit your exposure to charged particles. This timer lets you set the air purifier to run for two, four or eight hours while you are out of the room.","The filter monitor lights up when it is time to change the air filters. Both filters should last about six months. However, the filter-change light is based on the amount of time the air filter has been in use, rather than the amount of pollution it has captured. The Oreck OptiMax lacks an air-quality sensor and auto mode. In other models, these features determine the level of pollution in the air and automatically adjust the fan speed accordingly.","On Oreck&#39;s website, you can download a new user manual. Unfortunately, the site lacks helpful resources like a FAQs section or even links to purchase replacement filters from the OptiMax page. If you need to speak to a customer service representative, Oreck offers a telephone number, email address and live chat service. Finally, the OptiMax comes with a three-year warranty."]},"id":"3586016a-4233-46e2-b98b-1fd75838918f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0f0f91b3-f5be-4eb5-ae68-107ec05ddbc6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Oreck OptiMax is a good home air purifier for small rooms.
