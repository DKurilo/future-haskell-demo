You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Italy is known for making some of the best bikes in the world. Based in Italy, Elite makes a wide variety of bikes and accessories, and they have also created a line of <a href=\"/best-bike-trainers-review\">bike trainers</a>. The Elite Qubo Pro is a magnetic trainer that measures 27 x 8.2 x 22.6 inches and weighs 26.3 pounds, making it one of the heaviest trainers on our list. This might make it harder to carry, but the weight should also help keep your ride sturdy as you train. There are also rubber grips that line the bottom of the bike trainer to keep it in place while you ride.","The nice thing about this cycling trainer is that it can be used with a wide variety of bikes. Clamping and releasing your bike can be accomplished with one swift motion thanks to the Qubo&#39;s fast-fixing lock designed for quick-release bikes. If you want to use a thru-axle bike on this trainer, you will need to purchase an adapter separately from Elite. The cylinder accommodates 20-inch to 29-inch wheels.  It&#39;s preferable to have a dedicated rear-wheel training tire while using this trainer, as the trainer tends to wear out the rear-wheel faster than the road will.","The Qubo Mag comes with eight levels of resistance, which you control with a mountable handlebar toggle. This can be easily installed and removed, so it won’t take up permanent space on your handlebars.","This trainer folds down to a decent size making it possible for you to place this in your car for a pre-race warm up or to store in a limited-space environment. Elite offers a two-year warranty for this indoor bicycle trainer. This is one of Elite&#39;s most basic trainers.","There is a lot going for the Elite Qubo Mag. It&#39;s made by a trusted biking company, it&#39;s easy to store, it&#39;s sturdy and it’s decently priced. You&#39;ll be able to get a good workout during the winter with this trainer&#39;s eight resistance levels.  All-in-all, the Elite Qubo Mag is a great magnetic trainer for the average biker."]},"id":"fa18f838-d2e1-463c-a29f-c7fb7c955c0d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68566","url":"/elite-qubo-power-mag-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T15:50:08Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T15:50:08Z","name":"Elite Qubo Power Mag","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-17T15:50:08Z","id":"oM9JLdJ4xyzEBvZZVu8gyc","meta":{"title":"Elite Qubo Power Mag Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Italian made and sturdy, the Elite Qubo Mag is a competitive magnetic bike trainer that accommodates most bike types.
