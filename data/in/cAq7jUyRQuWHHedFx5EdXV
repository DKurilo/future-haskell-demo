It will allow you to control a 1.5A ceiling fan with a smartphone as well as with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice controls. In addition to the wall controls, the company announced the Lutron Fan Pico Remote, which lets you control the fan controller from up to 30 feet away. When we tested Caseta switches for lighting, we were impressed by how easy they were to install and use, so we’re excited to see dedicated ceiling fan controls come to Caseta. The fan speed control and fan Pico remote will be released in March 2019 for $80 and $42, respectively.","<strong>Why Trust Us</strong>","Since 2014, we&#39;ve tested a variety of <a href=\"/best-tower-fans\">fans</a>, <a href=\"/best-air-purifiers\">air purifiers</a> and <a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">humidifiers</a> in-house at Top Ten Reviews. While we haven’t tested ceiling fans in our lab, we thoroughly researched available manufacturer information and consumer reviews from online retailers, applying the same diligence as our physical product testing. And the expertise we gained in testing other types of cooling products also informed our recommendations. We also researched information provided by industry organizations such as the Air Movement and Control Association, Energy Star and the American Lighting Association for this guide, in order to help you know what to look for in a ceiling fan.","<strong>How We Evaluated </strong>","We spent 50 hours researching ceiling fans, collecting information from manufacturers and reading consumer reviews. In the end, we narrowed our list to 14 models from 12 manufacturers and picked our favorites in terms of the best ceiling fan for most rooms, the best value option and the best large fan. To help us find our best picks, we looked at airflow ratings, blade span, energy efficiency and motor warranty. Although our observations balance the objective and subjective, they are informed by years of experience testing similar products.","<strong>How Much do Ceiling Fans Cost?</strong>","You can spend as little as $50 or well over $1,000 on a ceiling fan. However, you can expect to spend around $100 to $200 for the most popular models. As with most lighting or HVAC equipment, the cost of a fan generally goes up as its energy efficiency increases. Premium blade materials, such as machined metal or natural wood, can also make a fan more expensive. There isn&#39;t a strong link between a fan&#39;s price and its blade size, blade shape, number of blades, airflow rating or motor warranty, which means you can generally choose a design that fits your personal tastes and budget.","<strong>Things to Consider When Buying a Ceiling Fan</strong>","Airflow &amp; Blade Span<br/>Airflow is one of the biggest factors to consider when choosing a ceiling fan. The best fans have an airflow over 3,000 CFM. The airflow also limits the size of room the fan can cover and whether a room needs multiple fans. Fans with higher airflow can generally handle larger rooms.","It&#39;s also important to consider the fan&#39;s blade span, because that can affect the fan&#39;s airflow and efficiency as fans with longer blades circulate more air and are best in larger rooms. For example, Lumens, an online ceiling fan seller, has a helpful <a href=\"https://www.lumens.com/fan-buyers-guide/ceiling-fan-size.html\">guide on ceiling fan sizes</a> that suggests ceiling fans with a span of 36 inches or less for bathrooms, whereas a 52-inch fan is a good choice for master bedrooms or family rooms.","Energy Efficiency<br/>Using your ceiling fan to enhance your air conditioning and heating reduces your energy use through improved air circulation. You can also choose an energy-efficient fan for increased savings. The most efficient ceiling fans use less than 60 watts on average and have high airflow.","To qualify for <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/products/lighting_fans/ceiling_fans/ceiling_fans_key_product_criteria\">Energy Star certification</a>, a fan must produce at least 155 CFM, 100 CFM and 75 CFM of airflow per watt on the low, medium and high speeds respectively. When planning your energy use, count built-in light fixtures separately, since manufacturers don&#39;t combine the fan and lighting wattage.","Motor Warranty<br/>Because ceiling fans are used long term, their motor warranties should also reflect a long service life, at least 15 years. To earn Energy Star Certification a motor needs at least 30 years of warranty coverage in addition to excellent energy efficiency. However, the best protection for a fan’s motor is a lifetime warranty. When it comes to other parts, a one-year warranty is standard among ceiling fan manufacturers. Add-on light kits often have separate warranties.","Mounting Options &amp; Style<br/>Different ceiling heights may require different fan mounts. If you have a low ceiling, choose a low-profile ceiling fan without a downrod so you don’t bump your head against the fan. Rooms with high or vaulted ceilings often require a downrod kit to lower the fan for better air circulation and access to the controls.","Whether it&#39;s modern, traditional, transitional or mid-century, the fan should blend in with the style of your home. For example, polished metal fans with straight blades will likely fit in with modern décor, while traditional homes look best with elegant or rustic ceiling fans that have wood finishes and weathered bronze accents. Lastly, the number of blades can imbue your space with a certain energy, relaxed or lively, even when the fan&#39;s not turning.","Convenience Features<br/>The cheapest ceiling fans often lack handheld remotes and dedicated wall controls, so it might be worth choosing a more expensive model for better control. A fan with a reversible motor lets you optimize the airflow direction for different seasons: counterclockwise during the summer to create a gentle breeze and clockwise during the winter to move heat near the ceiling throughout the room. Choosing a fan with at least three speed settings allows you to fine-tune it to your comfort level.","<br/><strong>Related Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"b37499dd-7c0b-4f60-b34c-7cbcf7d8e5ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-tower-fans\">The Best Tower Fans<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-air-purifiers\">The Best HEPA Air Filters<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-portable-evaporative-coolers\">The Best Portable Coolers<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">The Best Window Air Conditioners<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">The Best In-Wall Air Conditioners<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">The Best Portable Air Conditioners<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-air-conditioners-review\">The Best Air Conditioners Overall</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1e51eb42-6729-4db2-8c04-b5d64dd31fa2","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["id:1083"]},"id":"db980ebc-bb7d-473e-8900-b7bf0bd399b3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_57","url":"/best-ceiling-fans","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-08T21:05:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-08T21:05:00Z","name":"Best Ceiling Fans of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best ceiling fans for most rooms, including large fans and value options.
