You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LogiPen Notes <a href=\"/best-digital-pens\">digital pen</a> uses an external positional receiver that clips to any piece of paper. The receiver communicates with infrared and ultrasound waves from a sensor in the pen&#39;s tip. This creates a digital page over the physical paper that captures every pen stroke and converts it to an image file that you can upload to your computer for easy editing, archiving and sharing. This makes searching through your notes quick and easy. You no longer have to re-type your notes from lectures or business meetings.","The positional receiver is the most common form of technology used for digital pens because it doesn’t require special paper, which translates to fewer long-term costs for you. It&#39;s also comparatively accurate when compared to other technologies that use cameras and special paper.","However, like other electronic pens that use a positional receiver to create a digital page, you risk distorting the digital page if the receiver moves from its original position or if your hand blocks the signal from the pen to the receiver. This extra sensitivity means that you have to be more careful with the LogiPen Notes digital pen, making it difficult for on-the-go note taking.","The pen is slender, light and easy to write with, despite a cheap plastic body. The grip has a slight flare near the tip to keep your index finger from resting on the sensor, which keeps you from blocking the signal to the receiver. In addition, there are two buttons on the pen that work as right- and left-click for when you use this digital pen in mouse mode with your computer.","With a battery that lasts up to 15 hours, you have plenty of juice for taking notes. Unfortunately, the receiver only holds 50 full pages. While this should be plenty of internal storage for your notes and sketches, especially if you sync with your computer often, the LogiPen rates among the lowest in our review for storage capacity. If you write or draw a lot, you&#39;ll want to consider a pen with more storage."]},"id":"353f6d6b-5859-43b1-8886-4c607cb59996","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/EKYDxjeHRgF2eAKK23GrdK.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"mes with the LogiPen File Manager software to archive, edit and share your notes and sketches.

Oftentimes the program fails to recognize that the pen is connected to the computer, making syncing your notes difficult. Also, when connected the pen immediately goes into mouse mode and switching it back to pen mode is more frustrating than it should be. In addition, writing in real- time within the program suffers from a lot of lag. We recommend that you write all your notes offline and then upload them to your computer because writing within the program will leave you frustrated.","The positional receiver has a small screen that indicates pages stored, battery status and the computer connection. A single button turns the device on and transitions to the next page after you&#39;ve finished. This is similar to other electronic pens, but failed to transition several times for us, resulting in several pages of physical notes written to one digital page, which makes those digital notes useless. You also have a place on the receiver that holds the pen. However, because only the tip of the pen fits into the receiver, the pen falls out quite easily."]},"id":"a9131029-5a90-4de1-8308-c6493d088923","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5d801210-a8a4-4905-9d2d-a2057ffde3be","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LogiPen Notes is the most cost-effective digital pen and it shows in both the construction and the software.
