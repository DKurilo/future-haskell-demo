It provides effective security features and is great for someone looking for a secure email service without the bells and whistles. As FastMail states in there FAQ section, “We’re much more concerned with adding more features, than making everything pretty.”","FastMail has a spam filter, phishing protector and virus scanner; and if spam happens to slip through you can easily report it. FastMail includes an HTML and plain text composer. Additionally, it has IMAP access. Although FastMail does not have black/white lists you can easily customize up to 100 filters to keep unwanted mail out of your inbox.","You can choose from a very small list of domain names if you don’t like @fastmail.fm; however, their choices aren’t nearly as fancy as Mail.com’s or Care2.","FastMail only allows 10 MB of inbox storage, which is considerably less than most email providers. Although FastMail includes online storage, they only allow you about 1 MB of space. This is the equivalent to a few emails and maybe an attachment.","FastMail is great if you are looking for a no–frills email service with strong security; however, if you would like a similar service with additional inbox and online storage see the <a href=\"/msn-hotmail-review\">#2 provider, Windows Live</a>."]},"id":"e613e82c-0512-462a-afb7-0fee400b78a0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2046","url":"/fastmail-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-04-01T17:41:26Z","name":"FastMail","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":74,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-04-01T17:41:26Z","id":"Sv8Urs7UySvCcFS6MwTskd","meta":{"title":"FastMail Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Despite its obscurity, Opera FastMail has a secure, utilitarian free email service."},"products":[{"slug":"fastmail","url":"/product/fastmail","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","name":"FastMail","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","id":"Ja9oiGQgYePCccFksijjmS","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:00:57Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Mwd8NxXvD4TWD5REqBfJuK.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","mimeType":"","name":"2021-fastmail-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/2021-fastmail-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","id":"Mwd8NxXvD4TWD5REqBfJuK","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mwd8NxXvD4TWD5REqBfJuK.jpg","alt":""},"title":"FastMail Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Despite its obscurity, Opera FastMail has a secure, utilitarian free email service."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Mwd8NxXvD4TWD5REqBfJuK.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","mimeType":"","name":"2021-fastmail-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/2021-fastmail-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","id":"Mwd8NxXvD4TWD5REqBfJuK","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mwd8NxXvD4TWD5REqBfJuK.jpg","alt":""},"title":"FastMail Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Despite its obscurity, Opera FastMail has a secure, utilitarian free email service."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/internet/best-free-email-services/fastmail-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"internet","url":"/electronics/internet","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","name":"Internet","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:00:56Z","id":"LCUKUvCZbgdUfBxKowMKeK","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
