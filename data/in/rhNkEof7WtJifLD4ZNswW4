This attractive package consists of a vacuum bag interior and a stylish box for the exterior, so you get convenience, practicality and something good-looking to store soft goods at home. Although this is sold as an under-the-bed storage container, it fits nicely on shelves and works well in a closet, too.","This space saver duo bag/box gives you two items instead of just one, so itâ€™s a bit pricier than basic plastic vacuum seal bags. In addition, this item is made for just one purpose, which is long-term storage. The Underbed Compactor storage box is not designed for vacuum packing clothing for travel, so its usefulness is limited to inside the home, but it does that particular job well.","Using the Underbed Compactor Storage Box is easy. You simply fill it with soft goods, such as seasonal clothing, bedding, pillows, linens and household decor, and then vacuum out the air using your home vacuum cleaner&#39;s hose attachment. An LED light on the front of the box lets you know when the bag is fully compressed, so there is no guesswork involved. The vacuum process reduces the total volume of your items by about 75 percent, maximizing room in your closet or storage space.","The hard sides of the storage box hold their shape while you fill it, during the vacuum process and once the items are in storage. The exterior box also protects the plastic vacuum sealer bag from accidental tears and punctures because it keeps the bag from directly touching anything. While this box is designed specifically for sliding under a bed, you can also put it on a wide shelf or stack multiple filled boxes in a closet, storeroom or other place. It looks nice even sitting out in the open in a guest bedroom.","The lid on this storage box is hinged for easy access, but it isn&#39;t particularly sturdy. The box has a sewn handle that makes it easy to pull out from under a bed. The attractive striped pattern on the box hides away unsightly packed items and keeps your room or storage area looking organized and tidy. However, because the sides are opaque, you cannot see what is in the box. A small identification card holder on the front gives you room to write a list of contents.","When it comes to long-term or seasonal storage, this Underbed Compactor Storage Box is a convenient and reliable option, and it looks great as well. It isn&#39;t as versatile as other vacuum sealer bags, but it excels for in-home soft goods storage."]},"id":"c5b3a516-6849-4b60-9ccc-f1627923028c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69605","url":"/compactor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-09-06T20:59:36Z","datePublished":"2017-09-06T20:59:36Z","name":"Underbed Compactor Storage Box 10059603","synopsis":"If you want excellent vacuum seal storage plus some fashion flair, the Underbed Compactor Storage Box 10059603 could work.","review":{"rating":47,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you want excellent vacuum seal storage plus some fashion flair, the Underbed Compactor Storage Box 10059603 could work.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-09-06T20:59:36Z","id":"rhNkEof7WtJifLD4ZNswW4","meta":{"title":"Underbed Compactor Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Underbed Compactor Storage Box 10059603 gives you a storage box with a vacuum sealer plastic interior so you get two storage containers in one."},"products":[{"slug":"underbed-compactor-storage-box-10059603","url":"/product/underbed-compactor-storage-box-10059603","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","name":"Underbed Compactor Storage Box 10059603","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","id":"8b4ogfehNXmkXQ4ppZwdsi","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5YRTcqb54eQWi4gMq9MWBo.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"11392fc1f5e76ec57ce8f2160afc0bbe.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/11392fc1f5e76ec57ce8f2160afc0bbe.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","id":"5YRTcqb54eQWi4gMq9MWBo","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5YRTcqb54eQWi4gMq9MWBo.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Underbed Compactor Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Underbed Compactor Storage Box 10059603 gives you a storage box with a vacuum sealer plastic interior so you get two storage containers in one."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5YRTcqb54eQWi4gMq9MWBo.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"11392fc1f5e76ec57ce8f2160afc0bbe.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/11392fc1f5e76ec57ce8f2160afc0bbe.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","id":"5YRTcqb54eQWi4gMq9MWBo","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5YRTcqb54eQWi4gMq9MWBo.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Underbed Compactor Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Underbed Compactor Storage Box 10059603 gives you a storage box with a vacuum sealer plastic interior so you get two storage containers in one."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/kitchen/best-vacuum-sealer-bags/compactor-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gadgets","url":"/kitchen/gadgets","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","name":"Gadgets","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:03:06Z","id":"hw664pAQ3ic5obm4EFCZjh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
