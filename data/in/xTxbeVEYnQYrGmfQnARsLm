You are required to return rental trucks to the same location. Ryder rents two large moving trucks, one is 16 feet long and the other 26 feet, so there are fewer options through Ryder than with other companies. Ryder has more than 500 locations, but again, these are round-trip rentals, so you must return the truck to the same location. If you want more rental options, our top choice, <a href=\"/u-haul-review\">U-Haul</a>, has five different size moving trucks and offers one-way truck rentals.","If you’re moving landscaping materials or other weather-resistant objects, we recommend one of Ryder’s stake trucks. It’s also the only company we reviewed that offers refrigerated truck rentals. You can reserve a moving truck from Ryder by calling a local office, or through a form on Ryder&#39;s website. If you have questions about rates or policies, talk to a customer support representative via live chat on the website. However, Ryder does not rent trucks in 24-hour periods, so if you pick up a truck at noon on a Monday and return it at noon the next day, you&#39;re still charged for two full days. This unique daily rate policy makes Ryder one of the most expensive options.","Ryder requires a credit card for a deposit and a valid driver&#39;s license to rent a truck. This truck service doesn’t offer the plethora of additional equipment and services normal with the best truck rental providers we reviewed. Only a small number of locations rent hand trucks and furniture pads. Ryder doesn’t rent car carriers or dollies either. The trucks also don’t have towing packages, so even if you have your own trailer or dolly, a Ryder box truck won’t tow it. Ryder doesn’t offer loading and unloading assistance, and you can’t get additional insurance coverage for the truck or your household possessions, which is unfortunate if you’re nervous about driving a large box truck.","Ryder is a good option for a specialized truck for moving landscaping materials or temperature sensitive items. Ryder doesn’t offer one-way moves, and the unique daily rate charge is expensive if you need a truck for more than a few hours. Make sure to get all your moving supplies before you rent a truck from Ryder, because most locations don’t offer boxes, furniture pads or hand trucks."]},"id":"edf650bb-4a54-4c96-981b-6c62d6684a96","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68078","url":"/ryder-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-07-01T16:43:46Z","datePublished":"2016-07-01T16:43:46Z","name":"Ryder","synopsis":"Ryder is one of the few truck rental companies that's available nationwide and in Canada, but it only offers local truck rental services.
