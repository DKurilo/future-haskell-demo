Although it is only one pound lighter than the average car seat, that one pound is noticeable when you are carrying around a 10-pound baby. The carrier is compatible with several Quinny strollers, and its European styles make it attractive and fashionable. Unfortunately, its maximum weight capacity is 22 pounds, so the average child will outgrow the seat after a year. Also, the canopy tends to close itself, exposing your baby to the sun or weather.","The Maxi-Cosi Mico AP meets federal crash safety requirements. It has energy-absorbing foam and side-impact protection. Its five-point harness is adjustable, and the level indicators make installation simple. Unfortunately, it has poor weight limits. It supports a minimum weight of 5 pounds, which is fine for most newborn babies, but not for preemies. Also, it cannot secure a child heavier than 22 pounds or taller than 29 inches. The average child reaches these limits around his first year, so you&#39;ll have to buy a new car seat sooner than you&#39;d like.","At least while you are still able to use the Maxi-Cosi Mico AP, it has some excellent convenience features. It is compatible with a few Maxi-Cosi and Quinny strollers, and you can buy an adapter to install the carrier in Bugaboo, UPPAbaby and Valco Baby strollers. The car seat comes with an adjustable stay-in-car base and a stylish canopy. Unfortunately, this European-styled canopy emphasizes aesthetics over functionality. At times, the canopy will fold in on itself, exposing your child to the weather from which you are trying to protect her. Also, the fabrics are not machine washable, so if your baby makes a mess, you&#39;ll have to clean the seat by hand."]},"id":"767cc8cb-9648-40b5-bf78-ec7f931ef39b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d7e963ba-c805-4c03-9c4d-7f2782dcfba7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maxi-Cosi Mico AP is a light baby car seat with stylish designs and good convenience features.
