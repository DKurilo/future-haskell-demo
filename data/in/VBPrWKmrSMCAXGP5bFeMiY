While it lacks live GPS tracking and turn-by-turn navigation, it offers ANT+ sensor compatibility, which allows it to be paired with heart rate, pedal cadence and pedal power sensors for advanced metric monitoring. It can also perform a variety of navigational and metric-tracking stats.","Its GPS receiver enables it to display your current, average and max speed, as well as the distance you’ve traveled so far in your ride and your current altitude. It has a large 2.8-inch color touchscreen display with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. Overall the interface is quite easy to use. You can manually adjust the screen’s brightness as needed.","This bike computer is water resistant to IPX7 standards, which means it can withstand submersion in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. Its battery life is rated for 10 hours, which is among the lowest battery life ratings that we’ve seen in a bike GPS unit. If you’re a cyclist who goes on short rides, this won’t be an issue for you, but if you enjoy all-day rides, you might want a device with a better battery. Like all cycling computers, the Polar V650’s battery is built in, so you can’t bring along a replacement.","The main benefit of this cycle computer is it can store up to 10,000 hours of your ride history data and other metrics, letting you review your past training sessions and even compete against yourself in future sessions. Its storage capacity beats other devices by a long shot, so if you regularly have lengthy training sessions or want to keep an expansive history of your training, this is your device.","The V650 ships with an industry-leading two-year manufacturer warranty. If you ever have questions or concerns regarding the cycling computer, you can contact technical customer support via phone or email. However, there is no live chat option. If you just want to learn more about the product, or simply troubleshoot a problem on your own, you can check out the FAQs section, tutorials and other informational resources available online."]},"id":"b2463c77-f698-471d-893d-53999e77e3aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"06e89406-df6b-4e46-8e27-06fbadacd03e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For its high price point, the Polar V650 lacks certain important navigational features and has short battery life.
