With its clean interface and easily accessible tools, you can find everything quickly. While it lacks some advanced features, the software adapts to your skill level as it grows.","NCH Software sells this software for $34.00 on its website. We were unable to find it selling on Amazon so you&#39;ll need to purchase it from the manufacturer. As far as we could tell, the trial period seems to be unlimited as long as you are planning to use the software at home. This means you&#39;ll be able to test it for as long as you want before determining if you want to buy it.","This <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac photo editor</a> has a diverse selection of basic and advanced editing tools. With standard tools, such as crop, zoom, select, paint and draw, you can subtly alter the appearance of your photos. With layers, you can make several changes to a photo before making them permanent.","PhotoPad allows you to add text to your photos, and with 252 font styles, you can find one that complements any image. On top of that, the software includes 15 preset creative filters you can apply to your photos. Otherwise, you can use color management tools and adjust the highlights and shadows of your images to create cool effects.","In addition to the basics, this picture editor for Mac also has some advanced photo editing tools. The program’s auto edit options automatically adjust your photos with the click of a button. It also has batch processing, which you can use to apply the same edit to multiple photos. The editor comes equipped with touch-up tools you can use to fix blemishes on your subjects’ faces, and it can create panoramic images by stitching together multiple photos.","While the program has a selection of basic and advanced photo editing tools, it lacks the advanced features many photo editing software provide. For example, it doesn’t have a lens distortion corrector. It also lacks vector tools and several layer features.","The program’s photo organizer offers few features. It displays thumbnails of your photos, so you can switch quickly between them. However, you cannot search for a photo, create albums and ratings, or view EXIF information. If you want photo organizing features, check out <a href=\"/acdsee-mac-pro-review\">ACDSee for Mac</a>. PhotoPad supports 20 different file types, including JPG, PSD, TIFF, PNG and GIF. You can either import or export using these file types. You also can directly post your images to social media sites, like Facebook or Flickr, or attach them to an email instead.","PhotoPad can be downloaded and run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Android and Kindle. Being able to access the software from a variety of platforms makes it convenient and easy to edit your photos from anywhere.","This photo editor for Mac offers several support options with its software. You can access video tutorials, FAQs and user forums on PhotoPad’s website. If you have further questions, you can call or email support representatives.","PhotoPad Photo Editor serves as a good option for those with little experience editing photos. While the application lacks some advanced features, its clean interface and readily available support help you quickly learn how to edit photos."]},"id":"e620622c-4c19-430f-a1cf-bcdd94687b02","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9eee7bba-41bd-4d30-af30-526557791720","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["PhotoPad Photo Editor serves as a good option for those with little experience editing photos.
