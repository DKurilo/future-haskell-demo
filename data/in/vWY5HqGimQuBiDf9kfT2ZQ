Among the razors we tested, the top-ranking <a href=\"/wahl-shaver-review\">Wahl LifeProof 7061-100</a> provides 90 minutes of run time on a 1.5-hour charge. By contrast, the lower ranked <a href=\"/remington-hyperflex-verso-5-review\">Remington HyperFlex Verso 5 (XR1410)</a> gives you 45 minutes of use on a four-hour charge. If you forget to charge a depleted battery and need a single shave before you plug in, both razors have a five-minute quick charge feature.","Razor Design<br/>Choosing between a foil razor and a rotary shaver is one of the first decisions you’ll have to make. There are advantages and disadvantages of each type. Typically, foil shavers work best for sensitive skin, and they usually provide a closer shave. Rotary shavers, on the other hand, are most useful on coarse, thick hair.","Most of the products we reviewed here have pop-up trimmers to detail your sideburns and facial hair; some are full-size, and others are smaller. We also only considered only waterproof razors in our review. Additional design features to consider include whether a razor has a corded option for use while the battery recharges and if it has a travel lock to prevent accidental activation.","Warranty &amp; Accessories<br/>Most of the razors we reviewed have manufacturer warranties of two years. The <a href=\"/wahl-shaver-review\">Wahl LifeProof</a>, however, has an impressive five-year warranty. It’s common among lower-end razors to have much less consumer protection –  one-year or even just 90-day warranties are common. "]},"id":"8b144c29-8523-4940-ad99-e73f6193d35f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/tw3cNKHoaf23jnxewLaVPd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"  ","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electric-razors-testing-eric-verso-5/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9ML1ovNzk5MTI3L29yaWdpbmFsL0VsZWN0cmljLVNoYXZlcnMtUmVtaW5ndG9uLUh5cGVyRmxleC1WZXJzby0xNDEwLVRlc3RpbmctMDAyLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tw3cNKHoaf23jnxewLaVPd.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"tw3cNKHoaf23jnxewLaVPd","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tw3cNKHoaf23jnxewLaVPd.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b8286d87-a391-42af-9739-c66147ab8849","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Not Just for Your Face</strong>","Electric razors are primarily marketed toward men who want a clean-shaven face. And don&#39;t get us wrong, they&#39;re a great tool for shaving your face. But that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use them elsewhere! Electric razors work wonders if you want to shave your legs. Simply follow the razor&#39;s instructions for using it either dry or with water and shave your legs. An electric razor will give you smoother, better results than most disposable razors if used correctly. But be careful: Always test out a new electric razor on a small area of skin to make sure it won&#39;t cause irritation. We also recommend exfoliating your legs before you shave them for smoother results in the end.","While we’re on the subject, we didn’t test any electric razors marketed to women, but we did research them. We found they usually cost around $30, which is much less than most razors aimed at men, but they also seem to be made of more plastic parts and have smaller blades. There are also small electric razors available for both men and women if you’re looking for a small personal trimmer. On the surface though, women’s electric razors look like they’re lacking in quality even though they do usually come in fun colors. We recommend sticking to some of the highly ranked razors we tested.","<strong>Bottom Line</strong>","Because you’ll shave with your electric razor so often, it’s important to find one that is comfortable and convenient to use. It’s a good idea to think ahead about your budget, make a list of the features and accessories that matter most to you, and choose a durable product that will meet your shaving needs for years to come.","Reviews of other popular grooming tools:"]},"id":"46030b6b-79e4-42ae-87a6-7575e61e4c5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-electric-head-shavers\">Best Electric Head Shavers<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-electric-hair-clippers\">Best Electric Hair Clippers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d1e01ce1-285c-40d2-8533-67eaef97e9dd","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"69d07ded-f19e-46c0-87da-923c0846c054","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/wahl-shaver-review\">Wahl LifeProof 7061-100</a>","<a href=\"/panasonic-arc4-review-review\">Panasonic Arc4 ES-LA93-K</a>","<a href=\"/braun-series-3-review\">Braun Series 3 3050cc</a>","<a href=\"/braun-review\">Braun Series 7 790cc-4</a>","<a href=\"/braun-series-5-review\">Braun Series 5 5190 cc</a>","<a href=\"/remington-f8-wetech-review\">Remington F8 WETech</a>","<a href=\"/philips-norelco-7500-review\">Philips Norelco 7500</a>","<a href=\"/panasonic-arc5-review\">Panasonic Arc5 ES-LV65-S</a>","<a href=\"/remington-hyperflex-review\">Remington HyperFlex XR1470</a>","<a href=\"/remington-hyperflex-verso-5-review\">Remington HyperFlex Verso 5 (XR1410)</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0b93b429-f1cc-404d-b9da-2d8473642c22","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_136","url":"/best-electric-razors","authors":[{"email":"jchristensen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-07T18:09:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-07T18:09:00Z","name":"Best Electric Razors of 2019","synopsis":"We tested 10 of the most popular electric razors and ranked them based on their closeness of shave, comfort and overall quality.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested 10 of the most popular electric razors and ranked them based on their closeness of shave, comfort and overall quality.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-08T16:15:09Z","id":"vWY5HqGimQuBiDf9kfT2ZQ","meta":{"title":"Best Electric Shaver 2019 -
