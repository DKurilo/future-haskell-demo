You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Baby Trend Inertia is one of the safest <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seats</a> that we reviewed. With a simple design and some excellent features, it will keep your infant safe all the way to 32 pounds or 32 inches. Its base has one of the easiest LATCH systems we used, and the space between the carry handle and covering is bountiful. However, most of its safety features are built into the base, so if you need to use this car seat in another car without its base, it is no safer than any other car seat. Also, the seatbelt fastening is incredibly difficult, and the harness buckle forces parents to use both hands. Despite its flaws, the Baby Trend Inertia is a solid and safe choice for parents with average-sized newborns.","The Baby Trend Inertia gets its name from its spring-loaded shock absorber. Most rear-facing car seats keep your infant in a somewhat upright position. This sitting position can be difficult for newborn infants who do not have much neck support yet. The Inertia&#39;s shock absorber allows you to recline the seat so your baby is  nearly lying flat. In the event of a crash, the Inertia&#39;s base will rock the baby to a more upright position, allowing for a better distribution of force.","While this design is absolutely brilliant in an infant car seat, the reclining feature is limited to the base. You can install the Inertia without its base, but you lose the force distribution and full reclining elements that make this car seat stand apart. As far as installing the car seat, the LATCH connectors are among the easiest that we used. However, if you do not have a car with a LATCH system, the seatbelt installation is complicated and requires extra parts. It&#39;s clear that Baby Trend has a specific usage in mind for this model, and if you have to use the car seat in a different way, you lose much of what makes the car seat special.","The Inertia is compatible with several Baby Trend strollers, including the Crosstown and Stride Sport series. While many car seats don&#39;t offer much space between the canopy and the carry handle, this car seat has enough space for a parent to rest the seat at her elbow. The canopy extends further than most other car seats to offer better protection against the elements, and the Inertia comes with a detachable foot cover.","For as excellent as all of this is, it has one of the most difficult buckling systems we&#39;ve used. You have to place the harness buckles on top of each other before attaching them to the groin buckle. Thankfully the harness is simple to adjust, only requiring the turn of a red knob. The cushions are not machine washable, and Baby Trend only offers a 180-day warranty."]},"id":"a01d93e9-4888-4334-8435-8f2da9763d58","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5b5fbe26-6de4-4829-aade-8137878e614f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Baby Trend Inertia is the safest baby car seat that we reviewed, but most of the safety elements are built into the car seat&#39;s base.
