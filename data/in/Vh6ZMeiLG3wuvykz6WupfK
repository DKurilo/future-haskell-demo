Sonic toothbrushes rotate even faster than conventional electric toothbrushes, up to 40,000 strokes per minute. Many people say sonic ones are among the best electric toothbrushes because they clean areas other toothbrushes cannot. Whether or not this is true, there is no denying the popularity of this bestselling <a href=\"/best-electric-toothbrushes\">rechargeable toothbrush</a>.","The fast-paced motion of a sonic electric toothbrush creates a high level of energy and motion, which moves toothpaste and water in between teeth and under the gum line. As a result, many users of this brush claim it leaves their mouth feeling cleaner than other types of toothbrushes.","The Sonicare EasyClean is attractively priced with pragmatic features, which means you won’t overpay for technology you aren’t likely to use. It has a timer that helps you make sure you brush for the recommended two minutes. Furthermore, the toothbrush beeps every 30 seconds to ensure even and thorough brushing throughout your entire mouth.","Beyond the timer, the most useful feature of this Philips toothbrush is its brushing power. As you brush, the device increases its power level and intensity. This may not be ideal if you have sensitive gums, but it aims to remove plaque and food bits effectively.","To ensure your electric toothbrush never runs out of juice when you need it, the brush has a recharging indicator. When the battery is low, the light blinks, indicating it is time to place the rechargeable handle in the charging station.","A number of people who have reviewed this electric toothbrush online praise the brush’s size and slim design. It is small enough to easily travel with, and most users say it is comfortable to hold for the full two minutes of recommended brushing. Additionally, many users say it is quieter than other comparable power toothbrushes. One minor drawback is it does not come with a travel case, though this hardly seems like a deal breaker of any significance.","Although it is true that the effectiveness of a sonic electronic toothbrush primarily relies on how in-depth your oral hygiene routine is, the Philips Sonicare EasyClean is likely to make your routine easier, convenient and more productive."]},"id":"e833c62c-f979-4dff-a43a-d8a4270c96a2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59538","url":"/philips-sonicare-easyclean-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-16T14:52:39Z","datePublished":"2014-05-16T14:52:39Z","name":"Philips Sonicare EasyClean","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
