This cool alarm clock falls off your nightstand at your alarm time and moves away across your floor. As an alarm clock, it gives up some features like dual alarms and a radio in exchange for a working and different type of alarm.","This alarm clock runs on 4 AAA batteries that don&#39;t come included with the unit. The battery slot is on the bottom of the Clocky and secured by a small screw. That way, you don&#39;t have to worry about the batteries popping out or dislodging when it jumps off the nightstand.","The alarm clock comes in several color schemes, like aqua and chrome. Some of this unit&#39;s other basic features include a blue backlight on the display that flashes when it moves. You can choose to view the time in either 12- or 24-hour format. The off button for the alarm is on the front of the clock. When the Clocky rolls off the table, it might accidentally hit something on the ground that turns off the alarm.","The snooze bar takes up a lot of space on the top of the unit. Even though it&#39;s flush with the case, it&#39;s not too difficult to find. You can either disable the snooze time or set it for up to 10 minutes.","After you&#39;ve hit the snooze button once, the Clocky rolls off your nightstand. It then randomly travels around your floor while it sounds its alarm. Eventually, it will stop and keep sounding the alarm until you get out of bed and go get it. The unit is built to handle a fall of about three feet from to the floor. You can disable the Clocky&#39;s wheels in case you want it to function like a non-moving alarm clock.","Besides the movement, the alarm sound is also unique. Instead of a standard single tone, the Clocky&#39;s alarm is a series of loud beeps at random tones. You can&#39;t control the volume on the alarm, but it&#39;s loud enough to wake most sleepers. The randomized tones mean that you won&#39;t grow used to the alarm and sleep through it.","Nanda Home, the company that makes Clocky, offers a three-month warranty. You can find Nanda Home&#39;s telephone and email information on the main website, as well as a download link for Clocky&#39;s manual in case you misplace it."]},"id":"a1ff3edf-8b31-4b98-839a-4f9810064785","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cf0c2817-e106-4623-a1d8-f6fd0b3bdb19","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Clocky is one of the best alarm clocks if you like to hit the snooze button too many times.
