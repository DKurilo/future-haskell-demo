You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With so many features, the Brother CE7070PRW Project Runway <a href=\"/best-sewing-machines\">sewing machine</a> makes it easy to learn how to sew and to progress in your skills. You can choose from 70 different stitch patterns, as well as seven single-step buttonhole styles, with the option to adjust the stitch length and width to fit your project. You also can attach a twin needle to the machine, which is particularly useful for hemming clothing. The sewing machine also has an adjustable speed that can sew up to 850 stitches per minute. That is the second fastest in our sewing machine reviews and the speed can come in handy on bigger projects.","The automatic features make this a good beginner sewing machine. With an automatic needle threader and bobbin winder, the machine completes common tasks for you. Unfortunately, the sewing machine does not include an automatic thread cutter or tension control. Instead, you have to adjust the tension using a dial, which can be challenging for beginning sewers. It also lacks a start and stop button, which makes a nice alternative to the foot control. If you&#39;d prefer a machine with automatic tension control, a start and stop button, and an automatic thread cutter, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/singer-7258-review\">Singer 7258</a>.","The Brother CE7070PRW&#39;s intuitive design includes standard features such as a sewing light, free arm, extension table and a built-in thread cutter. It also includes a drop-in bobbin that is easy to load and adjustable feed dogs. This electronic sewing machine also includes an LCD computer display that shows the stitch patterns and error messages.","Weighing only 13 pounds, this is a lightweight sewing machine. However, it does not include a transportation case, and it only runs with a foot controller, making it harder to transport. The sewing machine includes an assortment of accessories. It comes with seven presser feet, a needle set, seam ripper, spool caps, screwdrivers and a cleaning brush.","Brother offers a limited warranty on this machine. For parts, labor and accessory items, it has a two-year warranty from the original purchase date. The electronic components and printed circuit boards are covered for six years, and the chassis casting is covered for 25 years from the original purchase date. Additionally, Brother has a specific product FAQs page for the machine, as well as a telephone number and email address for support."]},"id":"16395cfb-ab1b-44ff-975b-e2232a848c6f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1a319429-425c-46d2-bc6d-bee1d84517d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Brother CE7070PRW is a sewing machine you can learn on, but it still has the advanced features you will want as an intermediate sewer.
