You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are the type of person to grab an Egg McMuffin from McDonalds on the way to work, the West Bend 78822 <a href=\"/best-toasters\">toaster</a> is a healthy solution to feed your cravings and keep costs down. In just five minutes, you can cruise out the door with a homemade, delicious breakfast sandwich in hand.","The two large toaster slots located on the top of the unit are wide enough to fit most types of bread. And while there aren’t specific settings for anything other than toast, cooking bagels, waffles, English muffins and other types of bread is possible. On the front of the toaster is the egg cooking attachment. When you remove the West Bend toaster from its box the first thing you’ll probably notice are all of the accessories that go with the egg attachment. Each kind of egg you would like to cook requires a different tray. This toaster can scramble, poach and cook up to four hard- or soft-boiled eggs in about four minutes.","There is also a heating tray where you can warm pre-cooked meats to compliment your eggs and toast. Pop some English muffins in the toaster slots, set the egg tray to scramble, place a piece of ham or sausage on the warming tray and you can finish getting ready. You’ll be chomping on a delicious breakfast in five minutes, tops. Talk about an easy way to make breakfast in the morning!","You can cook quite a few things with the West Bend toaster, but the only controls available are for eggs and toast. Competing toasters allow you to select a special setting for bagels, and that option is missing. This toaster is also missing a control function to reheat or defrost breads. You can adjust the shade of your bread with the browning control slider. At any time during the toast cycle, you can choose to cancel the cycle by pressing the cancel button located on the left hand side of the bread toaster.","To clean the toaster, simply remove the crumb tray located on the bottom of the appliance. You will also want to clean the egg attachment and trays thoroughly after each use. For more information on how to properly clean the toaster, the included user manual goes into great depth on how to clean the unit. For further support, West Bend has a contact phone number and a FAQs section on their website. If the toaster doesn’t work properly, a one-year warranty is in place to protect against manufacturer defects."]},"id":"ed2ab4cf-a3b4-49c7-8641-bd096b91923c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"460448e2-53b0-4ce4-bef6-92699db70c83","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Start your morning off right with the West Bend 78822.
