With CreditReport.com, you can get a full credit report and score from data drawn from Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, the three major credit reporting agencies, when you first sign up for a seven-day trial period. After that, you can access your Experian report daily and get a three-bureau report every 30 days.","Unfortunately, the alerts you receive regarding your credit involve only data reported to Experian and not to the other two credit reporting agencies.","The credit score model that CreditReport.com uses to calculate your creditworthiness is the Experian PLUS score. While this is not an unknown scoring model, lenders do not use it as frequently as other models. For this reason, your lender might calculate a different credit score for you than the one you receive in this report.","The monthly credit reports you receive through this credit monitoring service list your personal information, such as your address and Social Security number. They also have data about all your open accounts, new accounts, credit inquiries, collection information, closed accounts and more. In addition to the basic items you would expect to find on a credit report, it also provides content that can help you understand how your financial decisions affect your credit profile.","Monitoring your credit is easy with this credit report service. It watches for changes to your personal information, such as your address and public records. It also takes notice of credit inquiries and new accounts opening in your name.","CreditReport.com sends alerts via email if anything changes on your report, depending on the settings you establish on your account.","CreditReport.com posts helpful articles that teach you how to dispute claims, implement a fraud alert, freeze your credit and protect yourself from identity theft. It is useful to know how to conduct a thorough credit check because errors on the data reported to the credit bureaus can damage your credit rating. Ideally, you would want to do something more than simply get an annual credit report since ratings can change rapidly with so many online financial transactions underway and so much hacking.","You can get up to $50,000 of identity theft insurance coverage. If you have questions about the service or fees, the company posts basic information on its FAQs page, a blog and other educational materials on the company website. You also can get help via phone or email."]},"id":"dae7766f-e2bb-4c02-a0b1-35f0146dbd52","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"188af177-b796-4fd9-87b1-b2bb5f4b11d3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CreditReport.com is part of Experian, and any credit reports and scores are calculated using a scoring model unique to Experian.
