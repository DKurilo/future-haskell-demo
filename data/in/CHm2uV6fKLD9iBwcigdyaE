The tube allows the propellers to focus the air they push, thus making them more efficient than conventional propellers.","RC jets are not only significantly more efficient than conventional RC airplanes, but usually more powerful as well. Because they&#39;re faster, they are a bit more difficult to fly, so you shouldn&#39;t consider an RC jet if you&#39;ve never flown before. However, for an experienced pilot, they can be quite fun. Here are five RC jets you should consider.","Â ","<strong>1.\tE-flite Habu 32 DF</strong>"]},"id":"e93e93b3-0f7c-4553-a985-e70e92a8c686","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>2.\tGreat Planes F-16</strong>"]},"id":"f3b44868-0695-490c-8e60-0a6f1c042a0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>3.\tKondor CF-86 Sabre</strong>"]},"id":"332fdd91-1b4e-44e4-a6da-b94765e2d2d0","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>4.\tDynam A-10 Thunderbolt II</strong>"]},"id":"24a54029-77ed-462f-a6f3-73eb25d3c390","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>5.\tFreewing F-22 Raptor EDF Jet</strong>"]},"id":"7a79900c-3be6-4a88-b0d6-eeb048786afe","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8765","url":"/need-for-speed-5-top-rc-jets","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"daniel-staub","url":"/author/daniel-staub","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Daniel Staub","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CF27HsePTJQBHmGnrUhsBZ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-09T22:31:35Z","datePublished":"2014-09-09T22:31:35Z","name":"Need for Speed: 5 Top RC Jets","synopsis":"Electric RC jets are remote control airplanes that use electric ducted fans, or EDFs, to go much faster than a conventional airplane.
