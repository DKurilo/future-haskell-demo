Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray Player here</a>.</em>","The Philips HTB-3525B is unique hybrid of <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray player</a> and sound system. Built to sit underneath your TV set, it&#39;s a combination 2.1-channel integrated subwoofer and Blu-ray player that measures in at over 2 feet wide, 1 foot deep and 3 inches tall. While it&#39;s probably not the most compact home theater device you&#39;ll ever own, it could be the smartest with respect to saving you precious living room real estate because it eliminates the need for potentially bulky stereo components.","Packing two 20-watt subwoofers, two Mylar tweeters and one 40-watt subwoofer into its design, the HTB-3525B works well at filling a room with sound in a manner you just can&#39;t get from your average, tinny TV speakers. Although it doesn&#39;t support DTS-HD Master Audio like all other devices in our review of the best 3D Blu-ray players, it does support DTS Surround Sound and Dolby TrueHD and is capable of delivering satisfactory (if not fabulous) sound. It even includes an FM tuner.","For a device that&#39;s essentially a surround base with a Blu-ray 3D player thrown in for good measure, it&#39;s a bit surprising that the HTB-3525B doesn&#39;t include audio exit ports to connect additional external speakers and lacks the ability to play high-quality Super Audio CDs (SACDs). Taking a closer look at the actual video capabilities of the player reveals there&#39;s a bit more this player can&#39;t do. Most notably, it doesn&#39;t perform 4K upscaling. This may not be a deal-killer, especially if you don&#39;t own a 4K TV and have no plans on buying one, but it also lacks the ability to perform 2D to 3D conversion. Together, these two conspicuous omissions leave you with a ratio of audio to video quality that is a bit lopsided.","That said, it&#39;s not all bad news about the HTB-3525B. Built-in Wi-Fi powers a decent offering of streaming apps that include Pandora for music, Picasa for photos and standards like Netflix, VUDU and YouTube for video. It can also play media files directly from inserted USB thumb drives or a variety of playable disc types. It&#39;s also DLNA certified, which means it can stream media from other similarly compatible devices like smartphones and computers that are connected to your home network. That DLNA compatibility – along with Bluetooth and NFC capability – ensures a wide range of coverage for accessing files across all your mobile devices and home computers."]},"id":"1776a49c-5956-43c4-9ffb-7367fe1b8500","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"266594f3-6af5-41c9-bba6-91e8ab891176","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips HTB-3525B offers the physical convenience of consolidating your sound system and home entertainment hub in a single unit.
