With so many different items available for customization, this can be a big decision. Here are some things to consider that may help you narrow down the selections:"]},"id":"f2236891-507a-4178-bb34-6eee4537d1b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Budget</strong> This is probably one of the biggest things to remember when selecting an item. If you can only spend around $.25 per item, then an engraved metal thermos is probably out of the question. For the lowest price per giveaway, you will probably find yourself considering paper products, like calendars, or writing utensils, like pens, pencils and highlighters.<br/> ","<strong>Theme</strong> Is the giveaway part of a themed promotion? If so, it s important to keep your giveaways targeted towards this concept. For example, a Hawaiian Luau would be a good place to give away personalized beach towels or bottles of sun screen, but a Christmas party would be better celebrated with snow globes and sweatshirts.<br/> ","<strong>Location</strong> If you re giving items away at your checkout counter, then you ll want to stick with something small. If the products are for a company picnic though, something fun like beach balls or visors would be the best choice.<br/> ","<strong>Goals</strong> Do you want your message to spread or to be something the same person will look at every day? Items like pens and pencils get passed around quite often, so these gifts will likely be seen by a number of different people. On the other hand, a desk calendar may be looked at every day by your potential client. Customized tees will remind the customer of your business when they wear it and be seen by anyone who comes in contact with them. Consider which type of advertising you are hoping to do and be sure your item goes along with your goals.<br/> ","<strong>Target audience</strong> If you re appealing to a wide audience, then something with broad appeal, like a customized mug, will be fine. On the other hand, if the products are intended for a specific group, you ll want something specialized for their needs. For example, if you re going to a convention filled with mommy bloggers, a customized diaper bag may get you noticed above your competitor&#39;s light-up keychain.<br/> ","<strong>Competition.</strong> What are your competitors likely to give away? If you re at a technology trade show and you think most people will be giving away customized USB thumb drives, then don t join the crowd. Instead, consider the factors above and then find something that will be unique to your company. If you re the only booth giving away USB-powered keyboard vacuums then you might attract potential customers that would have never stopped by your booth until they learned about your giveaway."],"type":"ul"},"id":"4545cd0c-a516-4547-8100-a338b511f519","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Remember, the more unique your giveaway, the more likely it is to be remembered and the closer it reflects your business, the better it will remind clients of your services.","Now that you know what to consider when choosing a promotional product, be sure to read our reviews on the top <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">promotional product stores</a>.
