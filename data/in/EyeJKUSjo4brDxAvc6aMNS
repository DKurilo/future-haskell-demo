It&#39;s important to remember that your rejection may have more to do with the industry you&#39;re in or where your business is located rather than your credit and how you run your company. ","There&#39;s no standard definition of a high-risk business. It&#39;s up to the underwriters of each <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> service to decide what businesses and industries are too much of a liability for them to work with. ","Therefore, although one company may reject your business as too risky, another may be perfectly comfortable working with it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a good idea to check with multiple credit card processors before deciding which one you want to work with. Many processors list prohibited industries on their websites and note whether they serve companies outside the U.S. ","<strong>Is Your Business Considered High-Risk?</strong>","Some types of business have a reputation for fraud or excessive chargebacks, so many credit card companies simply shy away from them. Gambling, for example, is often classified as a high-risk industry because of its reputation for associating with less-than-legal organizations. Online sales of health supplements are frequently deemed high risk due to consumer distrust and the anticipation of a high-volume of customer disputes. ","In addition to industry reputation, underwriters consider how sustainable the businesses in your industry are. Therefore, if your industry has high turnover, it may be too risky for some credit card processors to work with a business that has a high probability of going out of business. By the same token, a credit card processor may not want to take a chance on a new business in a young industry. ","Some credit card processing companies won&#39;t work with businesses in industries with a high chargeback rate, or with a high potential for fraud, pirating or identity theft, which is why some travel agencies and online stores may be considered high risk. Finally, a few have dollar amount limits for monthly sales or individual transactions that exclude some businesses. ","Every credit card processor has its own list, depending on its level of comfort. In general, however, these are common high-risk categories:"]},"id":"d938a987-46e1-4e21-b8b8-7dd688a7a726","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":[""],"type":"ul"},"id":"b1211d0b-e188-4ec9-825b-90cea5c3e5cb","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Borderline legal: Businesses that are legal in some areas but not others, such as cannabis sales and drug paraphernalia, gambling or weapon sales (guns, knives, Tasers and supplies for them)"]},"id":"5bb49793-3dfd-4364-b61b-8d8a546e330e","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Adult sites – Online dating, &#34;voyeur&#34; subscriptions, 1-900 chats, escort services"]},"id":"cc623759-9194-4d65-8454-a79e409ef2bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Offshore businesses: Companies registered or incorporated in tax haven countries"]},"id":"649888e6-360d-43a4-b66b-2511af8a1c33","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Investment sites: Brokerages, multi-level marketing &#34;business opportunities or get-rich-quick schemes"]},"id":"e5cec9d5-eb2a-4c6b-b0ab-d2da0da4082d","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" Debt-related services: Credit protection, credit repair or collection agencies"]},"id":"f98d7c97-2d5b-4f6c-aefb-fcd6097ac512","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Travel-related services: Airlines, travel clubs, tour guides, vacation planners, vacation rentals/time share"]},"id":"2982f846-6768-4e99-a244-5b77a42fe9ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Health and pharmaceuticals: Mail-order medications, vitamins, health supplements"]},"id":"5388a5db-02ff-4a1d-9f37-0d36d1a531ff","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Third-party sales involving copyrighted material sold online: Music, movies, software or eBooks"]},"id":"8a320131-2e10-4092-a5c8-78099423523b","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Are High-Risk Processors More Expensive?</strong>","If you need to work with a high-risk processor, you can generally expect to pay higher rates and fees. You can also count on less-favorable contractual terms, as most require you to sign a three-year contract that automatically renews for additional two-year terms and carries an expensive early termination fee, rather than the month-to-month contracts offered by the best standard credit card processors. ","The reason for this additional expense and more stringent contractual terms is that high-risk processors take on higher liability because of the businesses they serve. High-risk businesses tend to have more chargebacks, more disputed charges, more unpaid bills and more incidences of fraud, which means more work and a greater chance of financial loss for the processor. ","Because fewer processors are willing to work with these companies, high-risk credit card processing companies are able to charge higher rates and fees. However, some high-risk processors offer better rates, fees and terms than others, so it&#39;s still worth your time to shop around and compare services. And, before signing up with a processor, either standard or high-risk, it&#39;s important to examine the contract carefully and understand exactly what you&#39;re signing and what you can expect to pay. ","<strong>Is High-Risk Processing Your Only Option?</strong>","If your business is in a high-risk industry and you&#39;ve been rejected more than once by standard credit card processors, you may reason that working with a high-risk processor is your only option. However, before you apply for an account with a high-risk credit card processor, remember that each processor&#39;s underwriters determine what high-risk means for that particular processor. ","See if you can identify your business&#39;s risk factor and look for a standard processing service that works with your specific issue. For example, if your business sells products internationally, look for companies that process international sales and deal in multiple currencies. If you have an online bookstore, seek out processors that specifically work with eCommerce businesses as they may be more comfortable with all kinds of online sales. ","<strong>If Your Business Isn&#39;t High-Risk, Why Was Your Application Rejected?</strong>","If your business isn&#39;t high-risk and your credit is good, but your applications are still being rejected, or if credit card companies catering to high-risk businesses reject your applications, you might be on the Member Alert to Control High-Risk (MATCH) list. Also known as the Terminated Merchant File (TMF), this is a list of merchants that have had their accounts terminated by a credit card processor. ","For the most part, merchants on the MATCH list have engaged in fraudulent or illegal activities, have had excessive chargebacks or have grossly breached terms. However, there&#39;s no oversight on this list. As a result, some merchants have accidentally or unfairly been added to the list. For example, some merchants report being added to this list by credit card processing companies after they terminated their contracts early. ","After being added to the MATCH list, a business stays on it for five years unless the business owner can convince the bank that submitted its name to remove it from the list. Thus, you need to contact the credit card processor&#39;s bank and provide evidence as to why the claim that landed you on the list is false or that the issues (such as excessive chargebacks) are resolved. You can usually find the acquiring bank on the contract or by looking at the footer on the credit card processor&#39;s website where it says &#34;(Company) is a registered ISO.&#34; ","The MATCH list is managed by MasterCard, and you can learn more about it, why you may be on it, and how to dispute it on <a href=\"http://www.mastercard.com/elearning/match/story.html\">MasterCard&#39;s website</a>. ","Credit and debit cards have become the primary way that most people choose to pay for products and services, especially online purchases. For this reason, credit card processing services are more than a convenience; they&#39;re a vital tool for nearly every business. Just because you&#39;re in a high-risk industry and have been rejected for credit card processing services doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re shut out from accepting credit cards. There are hundreds of credit card processors, including many that cater to high-risk businesses. If your business is on the MATCH list, there are steps you can take to get off it so you can resume accepting credit cards. "]},"id":"2c275a1c-850f-4f51-8e2d-c2b313b523f7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10158","url":"/are-credit-card-companies-blackballing-your-business","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-20T20:28:59Z","datePublished":"2016-10-20T20:28:59Z","name":"Are Credit Card Companies Blackballing Your Business?","synopsis":"Are Credit Card Companies Blackballing Your Business?","review":{},"strapline":"Are Credit Card Companies Blackballing Your Business?","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-20T20:37:48Z","id":"EyeJKUSjo4brDxAvc6aMNS","meta":{"title":"Are Credit Card Companies Blackballing Your Business?","description":"If your company has been turned down by a credit card processor, it might be because of the industry you&#039;re in.
