Whether accidental or intentional, fires cause great amounts of monetary damage and pose a threat to those in the area. Using a fire alarm system in your structure helps to minimize the overall effect by notifying anyone in the building and surrounding area to call for emergency assistance, preserving more of the structure from burning and ensuring the safety of guests since they have time to leave before the fire worsens. ","Some of the fire alarms offered include the <a href=\"#Cooper\">Cooper SM87PBL Push Button Fire Alarm Call Point</a>, the <a href=\"#Honeywell\">Honeywell Ademco 6160CR-2 Commercial Fire Alarm</a>, and the <a href=\"#ADT\">ADT Fire Alarm and Smoke Monitoring System</a>.","<strong>Fire Alarm Systems: What to Look For</strong>","As you browse through the various models available, there are some different options within each to make your selection simpler. Each of the models offers different programming options to handle the particular coverage areas. To control these specific spots, the control panels for each system vary to customize your zones and often include emergency buttons. The control systems feature several different types of displays, providing another option that helps you distinguish between the choices.","<strong>Programming</strong><br/>Each of the fire alarm systems has different programming built in. For those with specific zones, they vary from as few as three zones to over 200, depending on the available spots for you to install the alarms. Some are already pre-programmed with built-in zones but are expandable to add more in that range. This is a major factor when you consider the size of the area you need to secure. Larger areas will require more covered zones.","<strong>Display</strong><br/>All of the fire alarm systems come with a keypad to dial into the various sensors and to program your different areas. However, some are backlit or have LED lighting to make it easier to see what you are typing. Within these keypads, they have different status functions for the whole system. Though not all of the models list the various status functions, the most often used are to activate the system and show it is armed. Other buttons and options they have include an indicator in the event of an actual fire, a power switch, a deactivate button and programmable circuits for your own setup.","<strong>Color</strong><br/>In the event of an actual emergency, the color of the main panel helps you and others to find it quickly. The panels with these alarm systems come most popularly in red, leaving a bold color that stands out for fast identification. They are also available in stainless steel or black, which can be more difficult to see than the red.","Having a fire alarm system in your commercial space is imperative to keeping yourself and those around you safe at all times and helping to alert occupants as to when they need to evacuate to stay safe.

In the event of a power outage, the alarm system has battery backup options. You choose between 24-hour and 60-hour backup power. This auxiliary power operates on 3 amps, and the panel itself has a 50-hertz power supply option that runs on 220, 230 or 240 volts of electrical current.","If a fire is detected, the emergency fire alarm will begin to sound. This horn will signal to the building occupants to evacuate. If it is safe to reach the SXL Conventional Fire Alarm with Panel TXR-320, the screen will indicate which zone is detecting the fire. This may allow you to locate and extinguish the problem before it becomes a crisis. After any detected event, the system keeps a record that details what zone the problem originated from and other information.","These records and more are available on a Siemens security app for a smartphone or mobile device. This app allows you to check the status of your fire alarm system and arm it remotely. During an emergency, it notifies you and reports which zone detected the source of the problem. All of the systems reports are available as well. Even in a total loss fire, your mobile device app will have a record saved of the incident. These reports help you discover the source, handle insurance claims and more.","The SXL Conventional Fire Alarm with Panel TXR-320 is a commercial fire safety system that works with Siemens Series 3 and 11 fire detectors and accessories. The system has backup power in case of power outages and a mobile app to access your system remotely. To receive accurate pricing, you need to consult a Siemens technician and receive a quote.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Silent Knight Review</strong>"]},"id":"c161eb14-5356-4d4b-a708-a9f7f8e19103","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/8WbwNrxkQjcoA4vmuDnyR5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Silent Knight SK-5208 by Honeywell is an expandable fire detector system that allows you to cover up to 30 zones with proper programming.

These extensions from the original zones can be done remotely using supervised expanders and I/O modules. It connects with two- and four-wire smoke detectors in any of the zones, covering both class A and B alarm systems for the maximum amount of coverage in the area. The panel is programmed to automatically link up with other systems, including AMSECO, Gentex, Faraday, System Sensor and Wheelock.","The display of this fire alarm&#39;s panel is an LCD screen. The control panel is based on the design of a microprocessor, like those found in home computers or cell phones, for a customized setup of your facility&#39;s fire security. It uses raised keys so you have less room for error when typing to alert emergency services or programming the unit. The status module for the panel doesn&#39;t need to be mounted near the panel. For added security, the fire alarm system can be placed up to 1,500 feet away to avoid tampering by possible intruders. Within the panel is a dialer to call out for emergency services in the event of a fire. Over the screen, there is a clear panel to protect the digital display. However, you are still able to access the &#34;reset&#34; or &#34;silence&#34; functions.","To help it stand out in your building, the control panel of this fire alarm system is mostly red. The center of the panel is black where the keypad is located and features a digital display. The lock on the front of the panel keeps unauthorized personnel from tampering with the wiring and settings on the device.","The Honeywell fire alarm comes with a three-year warranty that protects against material and manufacturing issues. To be covered, the unit must have been maintained and the distributor must submit authorization for repair or replacement. The fire detector comes with a user&#39;s manual, but you can download additional documentation for free online.","The Silent Knight SK-5208 by Honeywell offers an extended panel to cover a large array of zones, making it ideal for an area that requires a greater amount of coverage. The panel is clear and simple with raised keys to leave less room for programming errors.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"34e15af0-7565-4a20-af6b-336ed2063d32","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10257","url":"/best-fire-alarm-systems-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-21T14:43:52Z","datePublished":"2016-11-21T14:43:52Z","name":"Best Fire Alarm Systems Review","synopsis":"During a daily business or school day, there is no way to know what hazards you will face.","review":{},"strapline":"During a daily business or school day, there is no way to know what hazards you will face.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-21T17:24:05Z","id":"Gux6qRpt2PPaAEpsjY2QRM","meta":{"title":"Best Fire Alarm Systems Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
