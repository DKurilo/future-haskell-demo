While we gave the LG BD570 our TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award because of its incredible Deep Color feature and its compatability with DivX and MP4 files, we were disappointed because it’s missing one key element: a 7.1 channel audio output. If you already have a surround sound setup for your entertainment room, this player will be somewhat of a downgrade as it only has a 2.1 channel audio output."]},"id":"ae37c4c5-a51c-4278-8dba-5fdb873a6ab0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance &amp; Video"},"id":"1e5152f0-7cae-497a-8c7b-b89ec3daaec6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With remote in hand, feet up and a bag of chips at the ready, let the LG BD570’s waves of video technology wash over you. Not only will your eyes be impressed by the full HD 1080p resolution, but they will be impressed by the intensity of color the Deep Color feature provides. Deep Color enhances the normal color spectrum, increasing the number of colors your eyes see from millions to billions. The LG BD570 has an integrated picture adjustment element that allows you to adjust the camera angle in which you view a scene (if available on Blu-ray disc) and makes it possible to switch resolutions to best fit your TV. Best of all, this Blu-ray player can play your current DVDs and upscales them in the process. This means that not only will your existing DVDs look amazing at 1080p resolution, but you don’t have to purchase a new movie collection to be compatible with this Blu-ray DVD player."]},"id":"b33c9c96-2f76-40a1-a12f-4019192454da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity &amp; Design"},"id":"582dc419-4351-4c58-9bd3-d55d04bfd256","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The fact that the LG BD570 Blu-ray player only has a 2 channel audio out is disappointing. It has all of the audio features you want for surround sound, like Dolby True HD and dts HD, but a listener can’t fully grasp the full potential without a 7.1 channel audio output. This is a shame because Dolby True HD and dts HD were invented to recreate the sound intensity that you hear at a theater –  right in your living room. Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) is another technical aspect of a top-of-the-line audio setup. LPCM encodes audio information digitally, uncompressed, which means that the sound is played back at a much higher quality that compressed audio."]},"id":"c5af5269-2d26-4132-88bf-b4073dd0f08e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio"},"id":"8b74174d-313b-49b1-90e2-3b64ef53cb04","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the LG BD570 doesn’t have a child lock built into the hardware, LG has designed this Blu-ray player with a flip down shield which protects the disc slot and the buttons. Not only is this design feature practical, it also makes the Blu-ray DVD player look very sleek. The modern design hints at other high-tech features like streaming internet video capabilities and DLNA certification. With DLNA, once you hook up the Blu-ray player to your home network, you can transfer data to any other device that is DLNA certified. For example, you pop in a Blu-ray disc and access the BD-Live content. You find a game that you want to play on your phone. By saving the game onto a USB drive, you can then transfer it to your DLNA certified phone.
