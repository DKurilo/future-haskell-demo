It a corded vacuum cleaner that plugs directly into your vehicle’s cigarette lighter so you can take it with you and clean up messes wherever you are.","The Hoover vacuum is also equipped with a crevice tool to help you clean out the tight spots in your car. This vacuum has a 12-volt, 4-amp motor that gives you plenty of suction to clean up most of the messes you will encounter. Perhaps its most impressive feature is it has both wet and dry capacities, so when your child spills a drink in the car you can go to work on it immediately.","It has three height adjustments so that you can easily and quickly clean up any type of substance. The 18-foot power cord can reach across virtually any sized vehicle and also gives you the option of plugging into a wall socket.","It does an effective job of cleaning most spills, but it is rather loud. The Road Rat is compact, making it easy to store in your vehicle or in the closet. It weighs 4.8 pounds, which is not the lightest vacuum around, but it’s light enough that it won’t put a lot of strain on your wrist. The filter and cup in this car vacuum can be easily removed to empty it out after using it. In addition to the crevice tool, there is a brush tool that will let you get at some of the more stubborn debris like pet fur.","This auto vacuum cleaner has a one-year warranty, which is fairly standard.
