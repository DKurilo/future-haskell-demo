Shiver. Just the thought can send you scurrying back into your &#34;spend it and forget it&#34; mentality. But, budgeting is the number one way for you to get your finances back on track. You have to do it, you have to. But, to make the processes less daunting, start small and budget only a few expenses at a time. You can simply use a paper and pencil and stick your budget on the fridge, or you can really make the process work for you by using an Excel spreadsheet, online personal finance tools like Mint.com or even personal finance software such as Quicken Starter Edition.","As you look at your finances, remember, the main goal needs to be to spend less (much less, if you are able) than you earn. Your income <em>must</em> be greater than your expenditures.","Once you have set a budget, you need to track your spending. Again, you can use your Excel spreadsheet or, if you use an online personal finance tool, you can connect your credit and debit cards to your account and the tool will automatically make deductions for you.","2. <strong>Never Pay Retail</strong>","Never pay the retail price. Let us rephrase that: Never, ever, ever pay the retail price. There is absolutely no reason to.","<strong>Shop sales</strong>: Yes, that blouse and those heels are totally &#34;now&#34; but they will still be &#34;in&#34; four to six weeks from the time you originally wanted to purchase the item, and they will be anywhere from 30 to 50 percent off. Be patient, wait for the sales and you can get two or three items for the price you were going to pay for one.","<strong>Use coupon codes</strong>: Before you purchase anything online, we recommend that you use an <a href=\"/services/home/best-online-coupon-services/\">online coupon service</a>, such as RetailMeNot.com or CouponCabin. Stores don&#39;t always advertise their extra online deals, such as free shipping or 20 percent off your entire purchase, but coupon services such as RetailMeNot have these codes. Even 10 percent off your purchase is worth the extra five minutes it will take you to search.","<strong>Use coupons</strong>: Physical or found online, coupons are a fantastic way to save on groceries, household products and professional services. We suggest that you subscribe to the Sunday edition of the newspaper. In this edition, you will receive the SmartSource, RedPlum and the occasional other merchant inserts that contain hundreds of dollars  worth of coupons. You don&#39;t have to become the crazy coupon lady to save money with coupons. Simply take stock of what you need and clip the coupons you know you will use. You will be done in 10 to 30 minutes. No fuss, no muss.","<strong>Second-hand shopping</strong>: We truly mourn for those of you who have yet to discover the magical world of garage sales, consignment shops and second-hand stores. You are missing out! There is no better way to save money on clothing for the entire family, not to mention household, craft, outdoor and entertainment items than to buy used. Don&#39;t make that face. Used does not equal gross. You can usually find brand-new or very gently used items at garage sales, consignment shops and second-hand stores.","3. <strong>Distinguish Between Wants and Needs</strong>","Want and need. In our society, the terms seem interchangeable, but when it comes to saving money and keeping a budget, they are polar opposites.","Your basic needs are food, water and shelter. You need these things to survive. But, let&#39;s take an even closer look at these basic needs. Just because you need food, doesn&#39;t mean you should go out to eat every night to obtain sustenance. You can purchase food at a grocery store or farmer&#39;s market for much less. Dine in!","Before you purchase anything, large or small, stop for a few seconds and ask yourself &#34;Do I really need this or do I just want it and can it wait for later?&#34;","4. <strong>Save</strong>","Pay yourself! You have budgeted money to go towards paying your car payment, mortgage, insurance, etc., but have you set aside money in the budget to pay yourself? You should try to put at least 10 percent of your paycheck into savings. You never know when something unexpected will happen, whether you lose your job or a loved one gets hurt. Having that extra cushion that savings provides will give you peace of mind that, if something does happen, you will be ready for it.","5. <strong>Pay Off Your Debts</strong>","A mounting debt can haunt you. There is hope, however, and you can get out of debt. Just as you set aside money in your budget for savings, begin setting aside a small sum each month towards paying off your debt. Don&#39;t use that money for anything else besides this purpose. Slowly but surely, you will pay off that debt. If you have extra money at the end of the month in your budget, we recommend putting all of it towards paying down your debts.","6.<strong> Set a Goal</strong>","Instead of purchasing items on a whim, open up another savings or checking account exclusively to hold your goal money. Do you want to vacation in Europe in the next five years? Set that as a goal and begin saving. You will be surprised at how much you can save by allotting a small sum of money to the account each month. This goal account is perfect for everything from trips and electronics to college.","7. <strong>Plant a Garden</strong>","There are few things more satisfying than planting, cultivating and harvesting a garden. You don&#39;t have to live on a large chunk of land to plant a garden. If you live in a high-rise or an apartment building, you can plant small-crop items such as tomatoes, onions, lettuce and carrots in a planter box on your terrace. If you live in a home with a small yard, you can convert a flowerbed into a planting area. Or, if you don&#39;t have the time or energy to plant and harvest a garden all on your own, we recommend becoming a part of a community garden. There are community gardens all over the United States. To find one in your area, you can visit the American Community Gardening Association at www.communitygarden.org. Simply type in your zip code and the site will locate a community garden near you.","8. <strong>Be Healthy </strong>","Nothing can send you into a downward financial spiral like medical bills, planned or unplanned. Maintaining a healthy body through healthy living is so important. Make sure that, if you have insurance, you go to all of your yearly checkups that, for the most part, are covered 100 percent by your provider. Do everything in your power to be healthy and you will save hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars in medical bills every year.","9. <strong>Pay With Cash or Debit Card</strong>","If you have credit card debt, or know that you have little self-control when it comes to shopping with a credit card, then we recommend that you pay for everything with cash or a debit card. You can still get the items you need, but you will not be accruing interest on your purchases, and once the cash is gone, it&#39;s gone. Depending on who you bank with, you can go into your personal settings and set limits for yourself. For example, if you spend over $50 with your debit card, you can get an email or mobile alert letting you know that you have done so. These will make you accountable for your spending and remind you of how much you have spent and how much you have left in your account.","10. <strong>Do It Yourself</strong>","DIY has become an acronym for the brave at heart who take on and complete projects themselves. If you have the skill set, willingness to learn and most importantly patience, you can complete almost any project by yourself and save money doing it. Gardening, for example, can be counted as a DIY project. You will be able to save on fresh produce during the winter months if you can your harvest.","By completing projects by yourself, you will save money. You can paint the house, sew curtains, refinish furniture that you picked up for a steal at a yard sale, build a fence, re-work and refashion clothing   the list of projects really is endless.","Sit down right now and begin the first step, budgeting. From there, you will know exactly how much you make, how much you need to save and how much you can then spend. Money is tight, we understand, but by spending a few hours a week building your budget, clipping coupons or tackling projects yourself, you will spend less and save more, we guarantee it.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"b910d645-2454-46df-843b-b672f8885dde","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7413","url":"/living-frugally-top-10-ways-to-live-within-your-means","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"hailey-keller","url":"/author/hailey-keller","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Hailey Keller","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"9s7PZuNK56ozbym3YC6xxF","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-06-18T12:47:30Z","datePublished":"2012-06-18T12:47:30Z","name":"Living Frugally: Top 10 Ways to Live Within Your Means","synopsis":"More than ever, living within your means is critical.
