It achieves this rating through its airflow rate, as well as its limited lighting capabilities. Despite these limitations, this fan offers an excellent value for its price through a modern design, five-blade setup and balancing kit.","This is one of the best ceiling fans with lights because you can wire the lights and fan to separate switches. The fan itself can operate at three speeds to achieve a gentle breeze. That speed equates to 3,525 cubic feet per minute of airflow with a maximum electrical usage of 64 watts. This yields an airflow efficiency of 94 cubic feet per minute per watt, slightly higher than average.","When fully assembled, this quiet ceiling fan achieves a vertical footprint of nearly 18 inches, and should thus be installed on ceilings at least eight feet high. The fan also comes with comprehensive instructions and materials for self-installation, as well as a balancing kit and instructions on how to balance the fan blades, once installed. You may detect some wobbling initially, but after following the directions any undesirable movement and noise can be eliminated entirely for completely silent operation. Unlike the <a href=\"/hampton-bay-review\">Hampton Bay Savona</a>, the Hunter Builder Deluxe doesn&#39;t come with a remote control. However, you can buy a remote separately.","This top ceiling fan comes with two 60-watt candelabra incandescent bulbs, which achieve a soft yellow glow through the fanâ€™s toffee-colored glass bowl cover. These bulbs are by no means bright, which means you may need to consider immediately replacing them with bulbs that achieve a higher light output. However, the fan uses small, candelabra-style light bulbs, which are not readily available in CFL and LED types. The other complication comes from the fan not being designed for use with all CFL or LED bulbs, and with incandescent bulbs over 60 watts being phased out, achieving higher levels of brightness may become difficult to achieve. The Hunter Builder Deluxe has a lifetime motor warranty, which is the best you can find among ceiling fans."]},"id":"4c104ffe-ba3f-4e6d-b0c7-ed04542bab38","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66329","url":"/hunter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-23T21:36:20Z","datePublished":"2015-07-23T21:36:20Z","name":"Hunter Builder Deluxe 53091","synopsis":"The Hunter 53091 Builder Deluxe is a ceiling fan designed for rooms between 125 and 250 square feet in size.
