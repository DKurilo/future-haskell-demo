For this review, we considered only its capabilities on the audio side, though, and in spite of some great features, it does not really measure up to most other audio editors we evaluated.","One great thing about Blaze Media Pro is that it can handle so many different file formats. It can also pull audio from just about any source and help you burn CDs and DVDs. This audio editing software also makes it very easy to switch between different formats, converting from almost any file type to almost any file type. Blaze allows you to rip, record, convert, decode, capture, edit, copy and burn just about anything.","Blaze also is a recording superstar â€“ one of the few products on our lineup that can help you capture sound from just about any source. It can rip CD files, pull audio from video files and record sound from streaming audio, sound cards and line-in sources.","Although this product is great at recording and converting, it does not include as many audio editing tools as other applications. There is no marker tool, track splitter, channel mixer or signal analysis tool. Also, it is not the best product for audio restoration or signal analyzing because it does not include a smoother, noise reducer or pop remover.","The application&#39;s effects list is quite long. Blaze gives you the ability to apply many effects to your editing projects, including amplification, fade in/out, pitch changes, re-sampling and time stretching. This audio editing software also has a few useful filtering options such as band pass and high/low shelf.","Audio engineers of any experience level should able to figure out how to use Blaze&#39;s features. The main screen includes helpful icons and dropdown menus, and you can adjust the playback, record and zoom options from this screen as well.","Blaze offers an in-application help section. Online, you&#39;ll find FAQs, free updates and technical support by email. The product page on the company website also provides tutorials and an audio-related glossary."]},"id":"7761a906-648d-447a-85a4-00185e5502b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"08209784-de74-498f-98ba-bf9f26b33962","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Blaze Media Pro is a good product for those who are interested in converting, recording or burning audio and video files.
