The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-Ray Player Reviews</a> here.</em>","The Philips 5000 series 3D Blu-ray player falls just short of our top three best-rated Blu-ray players, but it should not be denied recognition as a top-tier Blu-ray player. The 5000 series still has many of the features that you find in the top-rated Blu-ray players, including analog audio ports to connect to older A/V receivers.","This Philips 5000 series Blu-ray player boasts a number of features that you would expect from a top-notch Blu-ray player, including 1080p upscaling, deep color visuals, built-in Wi-Fi and BD-Live. With a BD-Live player, you can access additional content on a BD-Live Blu-ray disc.","Some of the best Blu-ray players we reviewed do not have the ability to play DivX-formatted video. The Philips 5000 series player has the ability to read a plethora of video formats, including DivX, DivX Plus, XviD and AVCHD, to name a few. This player also boasts the ability to play both 2D and 3D Blu-rays, though it does not have the ability to convert 2D videos to 3D.","Missing 2D to 3D conversion is one of the reason this player falls short of one of our top three rankings. Other missing features that keep it from being a top-ranking Blu-Ray player are Ultra HD upscaling and not being DLNA certified.","Even though this product is not DLNA certified, you can use this player&#39;s EasyLink feature to control all devices hooked up to your Blu-ray player via HDMI with one remote. This helps eliminate the hassle of having three separate remotes for your TV, Blu-ray player and A/V receiver.","Similar to other Blu-ray players today, this one comes with Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD sound, so you can set up theatre-quality 7.1 surround sound to complement the great 1080p video quality.","A common complaint amongst Blu-ray owners is that their A/V receivers do not support audio from their Blu-ray players. You won&#39;t need to worry about that with this Philips player because of its left and right analog audio ports. This is one thing that sets Philips apart from other Blu-ray players we reviewed."]},"id":"06d7127b-0c79-4d25-a27d-bc3f76673201","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9b63bc79-b699-4bde-b490-c5ba1299c3ac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although this player is missing a few features that keep it out of our top tier of Blu-ray players, it has plenty of features and can play virtually any video format.
