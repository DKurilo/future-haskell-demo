You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Miele KM5753 is a 30-inch, <a href=\"/best-induction-cooktops\">four-burner induction cooker</a> with numerous features and strong power boost capabilities. This device provides a handful of advanced features, such as a stop-and-go function, pan size recognition and power booster capabilities on all four burners. However, it also has a few small drawbacks.","There are four cooking zones on this cooktop, ranging in power from 1,400 watts to 2,400 watts. Each burner has power boost capabilities, which allows a maximum power of 3,200 watts on the cooktop&#39;s largest burner. Even though all four burners provide an added boost of power if needed, the range of power on this induction cooktop is not as extensive as those of other cooktops on our lineup. Some of the best cooktops offer up to 3,700 watts of power.","The burners range in size from 4 to 11 inches in diameter. This wide range allows you to use pans of all sizes on the cooktop with ease. Furthermore, the induction cooktop detects the size of the pan you are using and adjusts the heat element to fit that pan size. However, the pan cannot be too small or the heat element will not detect it. Additionally, there are no bridge capabilities, which would allow you to sync two heat elements together to create one large element that would be ideal for pans such as griddles.","The Miele KM5753 provides a few standout features. For example, the stop-and-go feature allows you to turn down a heat element to the lowest setting if you need to step away from the cooktop for a moment to prevent food from boiling over or overcooking. When you come back, you can press a button once more and the cooktop resumes its previous temperature setting. This is one of the few induction cooktops we reviewed that offer this capability.","You can set a timer for each specific burner, and when the time for a burner ends, the burner automatically shuts off. This is an excellent safety feature to ensure an element isn&#39;t left on for extended periods. There are also control lock capabilities, which allow you to lock the touchscreen display to ensure no buttons are pushed by small fingers or falling objects. There are also indicator lights to alert you when the induction cooker is activated.","This Miele cooker features a one-year parts and labor manufacturer warranty. This is the average length of time many of these products are covered under warranty. If you have any questions or concerns about the cooktop, you can reach a support representative via email or telephone support. You can also access the user manual on the Miele website."]},"id":"bc8632c7-7672-4dbf-b9ea-7f22d921832c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce64cacc-cc1b-40ad-b6c9-e682b88f634b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Miele KM5753 is an exceptional induction cooktop that excels with its wide range of features and safety options.
