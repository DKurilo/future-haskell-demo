It also features a five-year warranty on the frame of the <a href=\"/best-electric-wheelchairs\">electric wheelchair</a>. However, even though this product has several outstanding features, we also noted other areas where improvements could be made, such as a short-lived battery life, which hindered this model from a higher ranking on our lineup.","This Jazzy electric wheelchair has a maximum speed of 4 mph, which is average for electric wheelchairs. It also has a 24-inch turning radius, which allows for a fairly tight turn. Furthermore, this product can clear ground up to 3 inches, which makes it easy to use outdoors and when you&#39;re driving over rocky and rough terrain.","The battery life of this model is lacking compared to the best electric wheelchairs. It can only travel 9.8 miles on a single battery charge, one of the shortest battery lives we noted. Good motorized wheelchairs can travel at least 15 miles on a single battery charge, while the best can travel up to 20 miles.","The Jazzy Elite HD has a maximum weight capacity of 450 pounds. Most electric wheelchairs, by contrast, have a weight limit of 300 pounds. Additionally, you can choose between red or blue fenders, and this wheelchair comes with plenty of padding on the seat, backrest and head rest. However, the wheelchair is fairly heavy, weighing approximately 225 pounds, which is one of the heaviest power-operated wheelchairs on our lineup.","This electric wheelchair comes with a five-year manufacturer warranty on the chair frame. It also includes a 13-month warranty on the electric components and drive motors. This is one of the best warranties we saw on this type of device."]},"id":"5071f10a-a435-45c0-a4d4-56f8ae00e3b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"98e5ca72-74be-4a7e-aefd-5040d67c6ec2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jazzy Elite HD is one of the best options for an electric wheelchair for heavier riders.
