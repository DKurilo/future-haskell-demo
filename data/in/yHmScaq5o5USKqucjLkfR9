Since then, the company has strived to remain both affordable and comprehensive for all Medicare recipients. One of the main highlights of a SilverScript Part D Plan is the thousands of network pharmacies you can choose from, including Walmart, Walgreens and CVS.","You can view the full list of available SilverScript Part D Plans on the SilverScript website. The list of prescription drug plans available to you is dependent on your state of residence. The website lists plans based on your selected options side-by-side for easy comparison. SilverScript Part D Plans have no annual deductible but can greatly vary in terms of the monthly premium. SilverScript Part D Plans have drug coverage based on tiers.  This amount is outlined in detail on the SilverScript website and is shown for both a 60- or 90-day supply. There may be copayments and coinsurance due each time you fill a prescription drug.  This amount may change from year to year.  An example of these out-of-pocket expenses can be found under the details tab at the bottom of each listed plan on the website. It is important to remember these amounts are only quotes and can be different based on your current prescriptions, quantities and preferred pharmacy.","SilverScript Part D Plans include a coverage gap and catastrophic coverage. Although this benefit can help limit your overall out-of-pocket expenses, it can be difficult to understand. Once you reach the catastrophic coverage stage, you are guaranteed to have only small coinsurance or copayments for the rest of the calendar year.  This amount is only based on out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions and is not applicable to monthly plan premiums.","Once you have had the chance to look over the SilverScript Part D Plans available in your area, you can enroll in one on the SilverScript website. If you need additional help choosing a prescription drug plan, you can contact SilverScript customer service. As with all Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, you must continue to pay your Part B premium.  This is not Medicare Supplement Insurance and is for prescription drug coverage only. To learn more, you should use educational resources like <a href=\"/medicare-review\">Medicare.gov</a> and <a href=\"/medicare-interactive-review\">Medicare Interactive</a>."]},"id":"0889f8bc-a612-401c-96ea-95da42c4493c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61635","url":"/silverscript-choice-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sabrina-rojas-weiss","url":"/author/sabrina-rojas-weiss","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sabrina Rojas Weiss","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"tVZv6ejiouijuHU3n7n49Y","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-17T16:21:31Z","datePublished":"2014-12-17T16:21:31Z","name":"SilverScript Choice","synopsis":"SilverScript Insurance Company has been offering Medicare Part D Plans since 2006.
