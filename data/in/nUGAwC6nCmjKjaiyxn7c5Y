We then connected the extender and ran the speed test five times, removed the top and bottom results and averaged the remaining scores. After collecting all 50 measurements for each product (five tests requiring five baseline measurements and five test measurements each), we compared the extenders’ results to their corresponding baseline measurements to see what percentage of the available signal was captured and rebroadcast.","<strong>Should You Buy A Wi-Fi Extender?</strong>","With ever-evolving improvements in networking tech, Wi-Fi extenders are almost obsolete. When we spoke with Phil Michas, owner of SLC Tech Authority in Salt Lake City, Utah, he told us, “At this time I would recommend a ‘mesh’ network to encompass whole-home signal coverage.” He cited the extenders’ limitations and the advances in concurrent technology as his reasons. “Wi-Fi extenders are connected via wireless connection, so speeds and coverage will flux.” Traditional routers have wider ranges and stronger signals than before, and residential mesh routers are steadily becoming cheaper and more accessible.","<strong>Router Placement</strong>","Repositioning your router, or even the antennas on your router, can make a difference to your Wi-Fi coverage. If your router has internal antennas, make sure the router itself is standing vertically for the best range. It’s also best if you place your router in a central location, without major obstructions between it and the places you most use the Internet, such as walls with metal running through them (as in a kitchen or bathroom). Other wireless signals also affect your Wi-Fi. Devices using similar frequencies, such as microwaves, baby monitors, wireless security systems or even your neighbor’s Wi-Fi network, can congest the channel and affect your connection.","If repositioning your router doesn’t do the trick, and if your router is an older model, replacing it may also improve your network performance. Since a home network is limited by the slowest part of that network, a router upgrade could give your Wi-Fi a necessary boost.","<strong>How to Choose a Wi-Fi Extender</strong>","Even with available mesh systems and improved networking tech, range extenders are still an inexpensive option to get Wi-Fi into that one corner of the house that always has weak signal. Here are a few things to look for when purchasing an extender for your network.","Price<br/>The best Wi-Fi extenders we tested cost between $40 and $80. Many products available for less than $40 use previous-standard wireless n technology, which we do not recommend. Devices more than $80 usually have faster advertised speeds, but the added cost is usually not worth the extra potential performance.","Compatibility<br/>A network is only as fast as its slowest link, so buy a Wi-Fi extender on the same wireless standard as your router. For example, if your router advertises AC1750 speeds, an extender that can also reach AC1750 speeds works much better for you than something with N300 speeds.","You also want to check the frequencies the extender can use. Every product we tested, and almost any device on the wireless ac standard, support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.","Type of Extender<br/>There are two main types of Wi-Fi boosters: range extenders and repeaters. These two names are used interchangeably, but they technically describe different technologies. All the products we tested are range extenders. These capture an existing Wi-Fi signal and rebroadcast it as a separate network. The downside is that you must sign in and out of networks to get the best Wi-Fi signal throughout your home, and many extenders only boost half or less of your existing signal. Repeaters also capture your existing signal, but they don’t create a separate network. They work more like amplifiers to boost your signal further than it would normally reach.","Placing Your Extender<br/>The placement of your booster is paramount to its successful operation. To effectively boost your Wi-Fi signal, place your extender in an area that has both a decent signal from the router and is within range of your dead zones. The sweet spot is about halfway between the two. Placing an extender in an area with an already-weak signal doesn’t improve the signal at all, it simply pushes that weakened signal further. Placing it closer to the router where there is a stronger signal to amplify generally increases the quality of the Wi-Fi at your target location.","Many Wi-Fi extenders have built-in signal strength indicators that tell you the quality of signal received from your router. Some also display the quality of connection between the extender and a connected device, so you know your extended network reaches where you need it."]},"id":"f9169744-439d-49e4-8cf1-4db37d7c6c6d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"77b2d21f-ec00-4ecd-85ad-f730fe22cdd7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/tp-link-re305-review\">TP-Link RE305</a>","<a href=\"/tp-link-re450-review\">TP-Link RE450</a>","<a href=\"/tp-link-re650-review\">TP-Link RE650</a>","<a href=\"/netgear-ex6200-review\">Netgear EX6200</a>","<a href=\"/linksys-re7000-review\">Linksys RE7000</a>","<a href=\"/amped-wireless-re1750-a-review\">Amped Wireless RE1750 A</a>","<a href=\"/motorola-mx1200-review\">Motorola MX1200</a>","<a href=\"/netgear-ex6120-review\">Netgear EX6120</a>","<a href=\"/netgear-ex6150-v2-review\">Netgear EX6150 v2</a>","<a href=\"/d-link-dap-1720-review\">D-Link DAP-1720</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"617ab9df-241e-4d9a-92d1-91d250c960de","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_346","url":"/best-wi-fi-boosters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-04T19:38:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-04T19:38:00Z","name":"Best Wi-Fi Boosters of 2019","synopsis":"We lab-tested tested Wi-Fi range extenders, repeaters and routers.
