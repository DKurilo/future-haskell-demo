The SC-1000 is a <a href=\"/best-diy-home-security\">DIY home security system</a> from the company’s popular SC-series of wireless alarm systems. If you’re seeking an all-inclusive security system that works right out of the box, you should consider this DIY solution.","The SC-1000 is a complete wireless alarm system. This means it comes with all the components you need to secure your home including a control panel, sensors and a keychain remote. In addition to the SC-1000, SkyLink offers two other starter kits to choose from; the SC-1000 comes with the most peripherals of all three kits. You can further customize the system by purchasing additional devices to add to the system. This DIY home alarm can support up to 30 peripheral devices.","One of the reasons this system appeals to homeowners looking for DIY home security is that it is economical. This security system has a lower price tag than many comparable systems but is no less functional or effective, according to users.","With this DIY security system, you simply plug in the control panel and follow the step-by-step instructions to wirelessly connect each peripheral device. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a security system that is more intuitive or easier to install than this one.","A minor complaint shared among many users is that when the system is triggered, its remote dialer can take several seconds to call the numbers preprogrammed into the system. However, this isn’t something that is unique to this system, and it doesn’t seem to be a big issue for most users. You can add up to nine different phone numbers and record a 40-second voice message that will play.","An important feature of DIY home alarms is the ability to create zones. Zones are divided sections of your home, each with its own set of peripherals. The main advantage of having zones is you can disable one zone while arming the others. Furthermore, if something triggers the system, you can tell exactly which zone the threat originated from. The SC-1000 system allows you to specify up to four zones in your home, giving you more intuitive use of and greater control over your system.","The SkyLink SC-1000 home alarm system is an excellent choice if you want a security system that you can monitor yourself. With its plug-and-play operation and affordable price tag, it will likely be an effective and invaluable solution in protecting your home and family."]},"id":"5c82e2eb-1809-47dc-9744-f2286a3fb9de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58890","url":"/skylink-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-24T15:42:14Z","datePublished":"2014-02-24T15:42:14Z","name":"SkyLink SC-1000","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
