However, it has an 18-foot power cord, which gives you an ample amount of space to reach an outlet. Its extra power may explain why it is also noisier than the average car vacuum.","This device uses a cyclonic cleaning system, which separates particles like dirt, dust and other debris within the dirt chamber of the vacuum, decreasing the tendency of the vacuum to clog. The cyclonic system also reduces the wear and tear on the filter and decreases the amount of maintenance required.","The HEPA Media Filter is an unusual feature for a car vacuum and another of its strengths. The filter is much more common in upright vacuums. HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air, and the filter is designed to trap harmful particles such as pollen, pet dander and particles in tobacco smoke by forcing air through a fine mesh.
