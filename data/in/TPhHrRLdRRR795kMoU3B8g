In addition, the SmartPlanet did a reasonably good job producing an even cooking temperature throughout each piece of meat.","Unfortunately, this grill took a long time to finish cooking â€“ it had the second slowest grilling time of the indoor grills we tested. It also spattered a fair amount of grease on the counter and did a less-than-stellar job when it came to collecting oil from the meat during cooking. We were disappointed that the SmartPlanet grill did not come with a lid like the <a href=\"/delonghi-review\">DeLonghi BG24</a> does to control the spattering.","This is an open grill with a raised surface, much like the ones used outdoors in summer. This creates some striking grill marks that add a certain pizzazz to nearly any food. The overall surface has a generous cooking area that can handle quite a few food items at once, so you can prepare hearty meals for your family and friends. However, since it is not the clamshell type of grill with top and bottom cooking surfaces, you cannot make such things as panini sandwiches.","The SmartPlanet is fairly easy to clean, taking just under five minutes to degrease and wash, which is about the average cleanup time for the grills we tested. It features a nonstick surface and comes with removable trays, and you can safely put parts of it in the dishwasher. However, you do not get a cleaning tool with this appliance, which would be a useful extra.","In addition, the SmartPlanet does not have heat-resistant handles, which is a decided safety drawback.  Also, this grill does not come with a built-in digital display for cooking temperatures and times. That means you must grill foods using your own intuition and possibly a bit of guesswork, which is not the optimal way to prepare any meal.","You do get a detachable thermostat, and the manufacturer includes a user manual on its website that shows charts of estimated cooking times for certain foods, so you can get some information that way. However, the manual cautions that the charts it contains are for reference purposes only, and you might have to adjust grilling times judging by the thickness, size and type of food. You also can use a meat thermometer, but you&#39;ll end up spending more time hovering over the grill than you might want.","The warranty is a disappointingly short at only 90 days for repairs or replacement if you discover defects. The only way you can contact the manufacturer if you encounter problems with your grill is through email."]},"id":"f0130d73-5310-4921-81c1-5850ce35bd5a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59474","url":"/smart-planet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-08T00:28:22Z","datePublished":"2014-05-08T00:28:22Z","name":"SmartPlanet SIG-1","synopsis":"When we tested this indoor electric grill, it produced some of the best-tasting hamburgers and chicken breasts of all the grills we tested.
