It produces decent prints and offers acceptable printing speeds that are not lightning fast, but are OK.","This multifunction printer presents print speeds of 10.2 pages per minute for black and white prints and 6.4 pages per minute for color, which is not bad. The resolution for black and white printing is 2400 x 1200, and for color it is 4800 x 1200. The monthly duty cycle is 10,000 pages, which is rather good, although it is not outstanding.","This multifunction printer provides a 2.4-inch LCD screen, the paper tray holds 150 sheets of plain paper and faxing is easy and quick at a rate of three seconds per page. The total fax memory for this all-in-one inkjet printer is 150 pages.","With this four-ink device, you get the wireless connectivity or you can employ Ethernet connectivity if that works best for your home or business office. You also can print or scan directly using a USB device.","Among other things, the Lexmark Prevail Pro705 all-in-one printer offers an efficient and effective way to get business cards you receive onto your computer. Just place up to eight cards on the scanner bed and scan them into your computer. When you see that this task is finished at this stage, you can then simply sync the files with your address book software. You now have all of your contacts imported and ready to use.","Lexmark provides several guides that offer a wealth of useful information including one for the initial setup as well as guides for the user, network and fax. Additionally, there is a FAQs page and a place to find the latest software and drivers on its website, so you can be sure that your printer software is up to date on your Windows PC or Apple computer. You can also contact the company directly by email, phone or live chat, which is always a welcome method of getting answers to questions quickly."]},"id":"dfc71d09-fd2a-4e44-8f9e-33760c3f5e0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"508ea445-46ba-4da8-a389-6b2290e00a7f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lexmark Prevail Pro705 offers workman-like capabilities that might serve you well, but overall, it lacks truly outstanding characteristics."]},"id":"825d6102-c964-470f-bdc4-daa92529366a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48308","url":"/lexmark-prevail-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-12-23T17:03:12Z","datePublished":"2009-12-23T17:03:12Z","name":"Lexmark Prevail","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
