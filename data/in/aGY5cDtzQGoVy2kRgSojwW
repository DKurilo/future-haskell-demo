The Polar Loop is Polar&#39;s first attempt at a bracelet pedometer. The sturdy, rubberized wristband features an LED screen bright enough to check in direct sunlight. The tri-axis accelerometer counts your steps, distance and calories. This activity tracker monitors all types of exercises, and it is waterproof, so you can bring it swimming or surfing, too. Polar also makes a heart rate monitor that is designed to work in conjunction with the Loop, but it is something youâ€™ll have to purchase separately."]},"id":"184a160b-770f-4b06-8ff9-94598e7d191c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/dkyv9ADnifDh5wYk8BUcoM.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58463-polar-loop2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkyv9ADnifDh5wYk8BUcoM.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"dkyv9ADnifDh5wYk8BUcoM","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkyv9ADnifDh5wYk8BUcoM.jpg","alt":""},"id":"ae6c898a-fad8-4150-9e99-e5a4e794be6e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The app categorizes your activity with five intensity levels: resting, sitting, low, medium and high. The higher the intensity, the sooner you meet your goal. The bracelet displays different commands to get you moving at different intensities. Up means you should stop sitting and do low intensity activity. Walk means medium intensity and Jog means high intensity. We love the To Go feature because it gives you practical guidance on what you need to do. Notifications tell you to walk or jog for an allotted amount of time help you reach your daily goal.","The Polar Loop does have some disadvantages. It does not have an altimeter, so doesn&#39;t measure how many flights of stairs you climb daily. Also, be aware that the display on the Loop doesn&#39;t count steps immediately, but it has a 30-60 second delay before displaying new steps. To fit the wristband to your size, you need to cut it based on the provided measuring strip. To fit the wristband to your size, measure your wrist and cut the band. We&#39;re not a big fan of this because there&#39;s such a large margin for error, but the good news is Polar will replace the band if you cut too much.","The Bluetooth tech does take up a considerable amount of battery power. The Polar Loop&#39;s battery life typically lasts about five days.
