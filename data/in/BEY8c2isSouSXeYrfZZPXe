Only two other TVs had better color accuracy and better contrast ratios, according to our test results. This color accuracy, combined with the contrast ratio, really makes for vibrant and eye-popping picture quality.","We also did our fair share of watching each LED TV. We viewed HD, UHD and 4K content in both a light and dark room as well as watching the TVs from center and off-center seating. As we watched &#34;Gravity&#34; we noticed that the sky rendered more stars than other sets. While that might seem like a good thing, it actually led to the black sky appearing more gray than other sets, which didn&#39;t look as good as a darker night sky.","During the motorcycle chase scene in &#34;Skyfall,&#34; the sky rendered hazier and white compared to better-performing sets that rendered the sky a more natural blue color. During the chase scene, all of the action was smooth and without any jittering or streaking which can happen when a TV doesn&#39;t refresh fast enough for the fast-moving action. We were also impressed with the deep orange color saturation and detail during the opening scene of our UHD version of &#34;The Martian.&#34; The surface of the red planet was vivid with exceptional detail in the rocky landscape.
