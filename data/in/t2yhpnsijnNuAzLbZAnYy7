These handheld devices allow individuals to communicate with friends and family all over the world. But these mobile gadgets do more than just allow you to talk and send a text message. Smartphones allow you to access the internet, send and receive emails, and even stream music and movies. To access the long list of features these phones provide, however, you must purchase a data plan from a <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\">cell phone provider</a>.","<strong>How is Data Measured?</strong>","A cell phone data plan is critical if you want to access the internet from your smartphone. If you stream music, send or receive an email, or visit a webpage, you are sending and receiving data from your smartphone.","Most cell phone companies offer several data plan options. The variety of these options is designed to help you find a plan that best fits the amount of time you spend on your smartphone. Data is measured in megabytes (MB). According to the CTIA, The Wireless Association, Americans used more than 1.1 trillion megabytes of data from July 2011 to June 2012. They reported that this was an increase of 104 percent from the previous year.","People used this large amount of data by performing small tasks on their smartphones, away from a Wi-Fi connection. For example, if you send or receive 100 emails, you are using 10.24MB. If you visit 200 webpages, you use 204.8MB.","<strong>How Much Data Do I Need?</strong>","Even though data is measured in megabytes, most cell phone companies provide plans with data offered in gigabytes. If you have one gigabyte of data on your plan, you can perform the following tasks without going over your allotted amount of data."]},"id":"c4d53bc7-b09d-46a9-b7d0-b36c8a6a1b04","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Visit 1,000 webpages","Send or receive 11,100 emails with attachments","Stream 33 hours of music","Stream six hours of video","Download 197 apps/games/songs"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2ea97664-c87a-4625-87fa-86f30ba13556","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It is important to note that data usage varies by device. The information above may vary depending on your particular smartphone.","Many cell phone carriers provide plans that include your choice of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10GB of data. If you desire more data, additional fees are required. Keep in mind that if you choose one of these plans and go over your data allotment, you may be charged an overage fee, which can increase your monthly cell phone bill significantly.","Several cell phone companies offer unlimited data. These plans are ideal if you know you will spend a significant amount of time online, sending or receiving emails, or even playing games and watching movies on your smartphone. However, as you can see from the information above, you will need to spend a significant amount of time on your phone to justify any additional costs for unlimited data. Research shows the average smartphone user consumes less than 740MB of data per month.","When choosing the right data plan for you, it is important to carefully consider how much data you expect to use throughout the course of a month and the type of plan you desire. If you are on a family or shared plan, you will need a much larger amount of data because it will be shared among several smartphones. Before you decide on a certain amount of data, you and the other people on the shared plan should discuss your data usage to ensure that your plan covers the expected amount to avoid any overage fees.","If you are on an individual plan, an unlimited data plan may be a little too excessive and expensive for what you need. Many cell phone providers offer data calculators on their websites that allow you to enter an estimate of how many tasks you complete each month that require data. The calculator then gives you an idea of how much data you should pay for to avoid going over your limit and paying extra on your bill.","By understanding how you use data and the type of tasks and features that require it, you can save money by getting a plan that fits your needs without paying for unnecessary features. When you choose a data plan, the key is to take the time to calculate your data usage. Don&#39;t just close your eyes and choose any plan.Â "]},"id":"9beb7e69-5a8c-4743-9e8f-8951ee49f956","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7734","url":"/how-much-data-do-you-really-need","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"courtnie-packer","url":"/author/courtnie-packer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Courtnie Packer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"XeLDpnf8mohkN8LhxKwS3h","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-01-10T21:37:25Z","datePublished":"2013-01-10T21:37:25Z","name":"How Much Data Do You Really Need?","synopsis":"Smartphones have become popular pieces of technology.
