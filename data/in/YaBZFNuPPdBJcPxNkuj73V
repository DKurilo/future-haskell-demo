You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","PrestoPhoto falls short in print quality and usability. The print quality is low, whether you use high-resolution photos or not. The learning curve for the <a href=\"/best-photo-books\">photo book</a> editor is so steep that it’s difficult to do simple tasks, like move a picture. While the photo book service has several shortcomings, it offers a wide selection of templates, sizes and cover options.","The problem we had with this online photo book maker was the interface. It is clunky and poorly designed, which made it hard to find what we needed as we made our sample book. There is no undo button and it was just generally difficult to get what we wanted from the layout. There are 200 predesigned books to choose from, many of which cost extra to use.  ","PrestoPhoto&#39;s editor doesn&#39;t allow you to resize images. This is a problem since if you design a page from scratch (without a template), images fill the page entirely. You can’t shrink the photos down, which limits your design options. ","The quality of the photo books is fair. The custom hardbound cover has a strong binding and looks professional, and it includes a flyleaf to protect the cover and pages. Image quality is adequate, but the photos printed darker than other photo books and we could see the pixels and imperfections from the printer. Some of the photos were blurry, even if the source image was high resolution. The pages also seemed a little flimsy when compared to other photo book websites.","PrestoPhoto offers more sizing options than any other photo book service we looked at. It has 15 different photo book sizes in portrait, square and landscape formats. Additionally, it provides nine cover options, including image wraps, dust jackets and die-cut covers.","This service offers several shipping methods, including overnight. However, it still takes 4-5 days to print a photo book, so even if you select overnight shipping, you have to wait a week to receive your book. For support, the website offers email and live chat options, as well as a FAQs section to help with problems and solutions."]},"id":"0a9af3ae-e108-45cd-b4b4-1138447b2e63","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ddfd6feb-7218-4af0-9380-69ce1fc557b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In our online photo book services comparison, PrestoPhoto made the cut because of its wide selection of sizes, paper options and book covers.
