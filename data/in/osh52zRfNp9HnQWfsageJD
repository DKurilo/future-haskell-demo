The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/computers/networking/best-cable-modems/\">Cable Modems</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Linksys DPC3008 is a capable cable modem. It has good performance, certification from CableLabs, a decent design and helpful supporting documentation. The only real problem with this DOCSIS 3.0 modem is it only works on Comcast&#39;s network. If you don&#39;t subscribe to Comcast&#39;s cable internet service, then there&#39;s no reason for you to look at the DPC3008 – which is unfortunate, because it&#39;s a solid piece of hardware.","We looked at how sturdy the cable modems in our lineup are by subjecting each one to a flex test. We also looked at factors like ventilation to help determine the DPC3008&#39;s overall design score. We gave the DPC3008 a design score of 98 percent because it&#39;s sturdy and well ventilated. It also has some interesting features that we didn&#39;t see on other modems. For example, you can mount the DPC3008 to a wall to keep it out of the way.","With 8 x 4 channel bonding, the DPC3008 can give you access to theoretical download speeds of up to 343 Mbps. With network overhead and congestion, you won&#39;t ever get exactly 343 Mbps on your downloads, even with the best cable modems, but the DPC3008 should be able to handle internet service as fast as 250 Mbps without any trouble. The modem&#39;s upload speed is the same as most cable modems have, giving you a maximum theoretical upload speed of 131 Mbps.","Nearly everything about the DPC3008 is either good or great. But its usefulness is severely limited because it only works with Comcast. Out of the 10 largest cable internet providers in the United States, the DPC3008 only works with one. Of course, if you had to pick only one to work with, then Comcast is the best choice, because it serves the largest percentage of the United States&#39; population. Still, it&#39;s disappointing that you may have to buy or rent a new internet modem in the future if you move.","Linksys provides a large amount of help documentation for the DPC3008 on its website. If you have any problems that you can&#39;t solve with the documentation, then you can contact the support team through email. Keep in mind that you may want to call your internet provider first, as that&#39;s often where the problem lies when your cable modem is struggling."]},"id":"da2d1c14-5a25-4067-8129-862bcb71a258","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"32b1c2a3-7c08-4c48-8ae4-e63c396e2925","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Linksys DPC3008 is a good cable modem that suffers from low compatibility.
