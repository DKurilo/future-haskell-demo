You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When you need to record a lecture, dictate notes or capture an important interview, the Olympus WS-823 is a great option with high-quality linear PCM audio. It has a simple dual-microphone design loaded with features that allow it to outperform your smartphone&#39;s recording features, even if you have a pricey dictation app. However, the lack of XLR/TRS inputs and multitrack recording makes it less versatile than the best <a href=\"/best-digital-voice-recorders\">digital voice recorders</a>.","The WS-823 records in a linear PCM format, which results in an exact digital representation of the analog audio frequencies. The playback format for the PCM format is a WAV file, which is compatible with most operating systems. It&#39;s also a lossless format. This means that the file size is very large and can fill up your storage quickly. As a result, you can compress the audio to MP3 or WMA formats. The audio of those formats isn&#39;t as good as the WAV format, but in most cases, you won&#39;t notice a significant difference.","The downside to the WS-823 is that you can only record to one stereo track at a time, which limits the versatility. The two microphones record to a left and right channel to create a single stereo track. However, the best handheld recorders allow you to record to multiple tracks on a single audio file. They also include XLR/TRS inputs for external microphones and instruments. It&#39;s like having a portable recording studio. You can record in layers and mix the tracks in the device, which you can&#39;t achieve with the WS-823.","An important recording feature is the zoom microphone mode. This mode allows you to increase and decrease the microphone&#39;s gain or sensitivity. The advantage of this mode is that it allows you to record a voice that&#39;s far away. For example, you can sit in the back of a large lecture hall and still record the speaker without leaving your portable voice recorder on the podium. The downside to this feature is that it also increases the ambient noise between you and the voice, which can leave the audio with a lot of irritating and unnecessary noise.","The voice balancer mode is a great feature for meetings with multiple voices. It works by enhancing quieter voices and limiting louder voices so that you can hear everyone clearly. In addition, a voice playback mode skips past moments when nobody talks, allowing you to move through the audio more efficiently.","The best feature is the 8GB of internal storage. This device also has a slot for an SDHC card, which allows you to add up to 32GB of storage. You never have to go looking for the USB cord, because the USB port folds out of the bottom, allowing the entire device to plug into your computer. This also charges the batteries, but only if you use rechargeable AAA batteries, which aren&#39;t included."]},"id":"43331795-03fe-459d-8b50-c67dce80b9da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"554ec0e1-886a-4780-9169-819de0c1bdf4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With features like a zoom microphone and voice balance, the Olympus WS-823 is a good option for dictating notes, recording a lecture or transcribing minutes of a meeting.
