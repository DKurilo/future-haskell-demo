Prices are set by third-party sellers and can&#39;t be above or below face value, so you&#39;re more likely to find affordable options. CTC Tickets also sells Super Bowl tickets. They’re expensive, but that’s also because they’re in high demand and likely to sell quickly. The downside to this website is its return policy: you’ll get your money back if an event is canceled, but not if that cancelation is due to weather. This could come into play for outdoor baseball or golf games, so it might be worth checking the weather before you click buy.","Even though prices are set by third-party sellers, our price comparison test ultimately earned CTC Tickets a rather disappointing C. In three games we used to compare base ticket prices, Coast to Coast had the most expensive ticket to one event and a mid-range price for the other two. On top of that, we were charged $14 in fees for a $25 ticket, which is pretty high. There also isn’t any kind of rewards program where you can earn discounts or perks, so what you see is essentially what you get in terms of ticket prices.","You can’t sell your tickets through CTC Tickets, so if that’s something you’re looking for we recommend trying <a href=\"/ticketmaster-review\">Ticketmaster</a> or <a href=\"/ticket-liquidator-review\">Ticket Liquidator,</a> both of which only take a 10 percent commission. This website also lacks a mobile app, which pushed it toward the bottom of our rankings. It does, however, have some useful features, and the design is easy to navigate. You can contact customer service via the phone number clearly displayed at the top of every page, or your question might already be answered on the website&#39;s informative blog. There you can find tips for when and how to find the best prices for the most exclusive games.","You can search for tickets by quantity, price range, venue level or delivery method, like electronic, physical mail or mobile. The search function is a little busy, but it’s still pretty easy to figure out. Clicking on certain parts of the interactive seating map will sometimes result in photos showing you the view from your seat. This feature works just fine, but the design didn’t impress us and was set to zoom in while scrolling with your cursor over it. This might not be an issue for some, but we found it frustrating on a laptop where it was easy to unintentionally zoom.","Overall, CTC Tickets is functional but not phenomenal. The ticket prices in our tests were a little high, and the fees were too, resulting in its low ranking."]},"id":"cc0c1f06-0c65-404b-8f6e-a7c41a86e6d9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2614","url":"/coast-to-coast-tickets-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","datePublished":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","name":"Coast to Coast Tickets","synopsis":"With this website you get a standard 100 percent worry-free guarantee, and transactions are secure.
