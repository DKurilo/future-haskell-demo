However, it has few features beyond that. Since it’s an old-school model that prioritizes sound quality over function, it is missing some of the connectivity options and extras the best <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a> have.","The NAD T 748 v2’s power output is one of the reasons we decided to review it. With 6-ohm speakers, it has an output of 120 watts per channel, which is above average for comparably priced home theater receivers. It has seven amplified output channels and a subwoofer pre-out, which means it can power front left, front right, front center, middle right, middle left, back right and back left speakers. It also includes two-zone audio, so you can dedicate two channels of amplification to speakers in another room.","As with every modern AV receiver, you can watch all your favorite high-definition DVDs and Blu-rays with Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD audio formats for a great theater experience. However, it’s missing all other audio decoders, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, the newest multidimensional surround sound formats.","This receiver is compatible with 3D and 4K video, which is important because your AV receiver serves as a central hub for all your input sources. However, it only has four HDMI inputs; the best receivers we evaluated have six. It&#39;s also one of the few receivers in its price range that doesn&#39;t connect wirelessly using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so it’s a good idea to make sure the NAD T 748 v2 has enough inputs for your system’s components before you purchase it. It also has three optical inputs, which may offset the need for additional HDMI inputs.","Its exceptionally simple user interface will feel familiar if you’ve used older audio equipment. Unlike some competing manufacturers, NAD does not have a smartphone app to control the receiver. However, it comes with a remote.","NAD includes a two-year warranty, which is average for an AV receiver. You can contact the company’s support staff by phone, email or social media if you have questions about the setup process or features."]},"id":"9966ba39-1cca-40c8-b082-9b5cea77d003","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9fdab191-9539-4889-b9a1-9c2db0fe5621","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The NAD T 748 v2 focuses on audio performance over everything else, which makes it one of the best home theater receivers if you plan to listen to a lot of music.
