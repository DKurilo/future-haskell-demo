This can cause the cream to freeze into a hard block, which then puts strain on the paddle and motor. Too much strain or repeated strain can lead these components to eventually break, so we recommend having the paddle on and spinning when the cream is added. When we tested the ice cream maker, we noticed that the opening was narrow and the plastic edges on either side made it difficult to pour the cream into the freezer bowl.
