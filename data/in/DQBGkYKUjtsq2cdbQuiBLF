It is energy efficient, visually appealing and well organized so users can effectively fulfill all their storage needs. Because it is energy efficient, it will save users money on their monthly utility bills. Also, one reason this refrigerator ranked so high is the Store-N-Door ice dispenser, which is on the freezer door so it clears up extra space in the freezer.

Before you submit to the “bigger is better” mantra, consider how much space your family reasonably needs. This refrigerator has enough space for a family of five, possibly six. When users purchase a refrigerator that is the right size for their family, instead of instinctively buying the largest side-by-side refrigerator, they will conserve energy and save on utility bills.","Like most freezer refrigerators, the Maytag comes in black, monochromatic stainless steel and white.

Most refrigerators have three refrigerator shelves, but the Maytag has four shelves. We value extra storage units, such as shelves or door bins, because they help users effectively organize their food, so the extra shelf was one of the reasons this side-by-side refrigerator scored higher than others.","The Maytag has three drawers in the refrigerator section: a snack pan, a crisper and a deli drawer. The crisper has humidity controls to keep fruits and vegetables fresh, and the deli drawer has an adjustable temperature so users can change the settings depending on what they are currently storing. We were impressed with the temperature controls on the deli drawer since most refrigerators don’t have this feature."]},"id":"bb9cce84-4139-47c8-b3a7-e10188174893","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Conveniences"},"id":"f7640b8d-de31-4e75-8fda-acba6b7006f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In the freezer section, the Maytag has four wire shelves, three door bins and one slide-out basket. Although these are important features, what really stands out in this side-by-side refrigerator is the Store-N-Door Ice Dispensing System. Unlike most refrigerators, the ice maker is not found in the freezer, but on the freezer door. We find this to be a visually appealing and space-saving design. Instead of taking up much of the space in the top half of the freezer and much of the door, this on-the-door ice maker only uses space on the door. This space-saving ice maker is the reason why this side-by-side refrigerator ranked high in this area.","The freezer uses adaptive defrost, a system that detects when and how long the freezer needs to be defrosted.

Right Size ice cubes are smaller ice cubes that are created to fit into water bottles, as well as glasses. These smaller ice cubes are also ideal because they don’t splash as much when dispensed into glasses or pitchers filled with water. Some side-by-side refrigerators from other brands have difficulties with their ice maker – the ice spills all over the ground, instead of into the cup, or it splashes your drink all over. We hope that the Right Size ice cubes will reduce this issue for this model.","The electronic control with LED display is simple, yet it includes all the main features of an ice dispenser display. This side-by-side refrigerator has a door alarm, child lock and filter replacement reminder.

Most users want more space in their refrigerator, so we felt users may be more interested in a larger model.
