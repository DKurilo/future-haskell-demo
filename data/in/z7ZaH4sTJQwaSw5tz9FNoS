The original review is below, but check out our current top</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/laundry/best-front-load-washers/\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The LG TurboWash WM3570HVA front load washer has a tub of 4.3 cubic feet, which gives you plenty of room for most of your washing needs. It also has versatility with its 12 wash cycles, 11 options, five soil levels, and five wash and rinse temperatures.","This front-load washing machine bares the ENERGY STAR label and has a yearly power cost estimate of just $12 a year, which is one of the lowest in our lineup. Along with being energy-efficient, this LG washer has a ColdWash option, which will help to reduce energy usage. This cycle provides you with washing performance that is equivalent to that of a warm water cycle.","The LG TurboWash has an Allergen Cycle, which removes about 95 percent of allergens from your clothes. It performs impressively enough in this area to have become the first washer certified as asthma and allergy friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. The Sanitize Cycle is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation, as it effectively removes dangerous microorganisms from clothing and other fabrics.","The LG Ultra Large Capacity front-load washer is missing a few features, such as a drum light, a reversible door and an internal water heater. Having an internal water heater is an advantage because certain protein stains respond best to low temperatures. Once those stains are dealt with, the water warms, which creates better conditions for color-safe bleach which performs best in warm or hot water.","However, this machine includes all the usual wash cycles and options you find on most front-loader washing machines. It also has a few distinctive cycles and options we found impressive, such as a speed-wash cycle, which could come in handy when you’re in a rush.","This front-loader washing machine has an option for a pedestal drawer. Without the optional pedestal drawer, this LG front-load washer sits at 38 11/16 inches high, and is 27 inches wide and 29 3/4 inches deep. The pedestal drawer adds 13 3/5 inches to the height, and when the door to the washer is open, the appliance is 51 inches deep.","The warranty coverage LG provides for its front-loading washers is one of the best in the industry. Parts and labor are covered for the first year, while the motor is backed by a 10-year warranty and the tub is covered for the lifetime of the appliance.","You can contact LG by phone and email for help and support, and you can even speak to a representative via live chat on the website. LG also provides the user manual, FAQs and product tutorials on its website for your reference."]},"id":"59d38503-cc79-4da3-98fc-31c3f68fe6d0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"373971c1-1942-4ce2-a147-a0dedcf90a31","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG TurboWash WM3570HVA front-load washer has a high-capacity tub of 4.3 cubic feet, and you have a sufficient number of wash cycles and options to choose from.
