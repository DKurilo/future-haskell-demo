While the company may not have the experience of DIY home security veterans, it benefits from a fresh perspective that allows you to get a monitoring plan without a contract. This no-contract strategy allows you to purchase your equipment directly, customize your system and cancel service at any time.","Alarm Grid uses both wired and wireless Honeywell security devices such as security cameras, motion detectors, sirens, glass-break sensors, panic buttons, security key fobs and pet-immune motion sensors that have a 40-pound weight limit. The DIY home monitoring company also sells three types of entry sensors: standard door and window sensors, recessed door sensors and garage door sensors. Depending on your needs, you can choose from over a dozen starter kits that each come with a control panel and multiple sensors.","You can choose to add various alerts to your DIY home monitoring system by purchasing environmental sensors. Alarm Grid supports alerts for fire, smoke, heat, freezing, carbon monoxide, flooding and power failure. If you need medical alert services or child safety monitoring, Alarm Grid can help you outfit your system for those types of emergencies as well. This company does not support alerts for natural gas leaks.","The company offers no-contract DIY alarm monitoring that watches over your home 24 hours a day. The Self-Monitoring plan supports email and text alerts as well as remote system control, but you don&#39;t get professional monitoring. The Basic Monitoring plan has alarm status reports but lacks remote system control. The Monitoring Plus plan has every feature of the lower plans in addition to weather and traffic reports.","One of the best things about Alarm Grid is that you don&#39;t have to purchase the advanced plan to add video surveillance to your monitoring service; you can add it to any plan. Additionally, you can add cellular communication to each plan to supplement Alarm Grid&#39;s internet connection. Alarm Grid allows you to add Z-Wave home automation to the Self Monitoring and Monitoring Plus plans but not the Basic Monitoring plan. Video surveillance, cellular communication and home automation each require a separate fee to add to your DIY alarm-monitoring plan.","Alarm Grid does not offer a warranty on the equipment it sells. Instead, it relies on the original equipment manufacturer warranty from Honeywell Security. Honeywell&#39;s warranty varies by product type and ranges from one year to five years. The DIY installation process is simple, though you can look up a number of tutorials, FAQs and over 150 videos on the Alarm Grid website. You can also contact Alarm Grid directly via email and telephone, but the company does not offer live chat support."]},"id":"08758e8a-3cf6-4dff-8941-92bad3289063","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"eb4dbc86-b340-468c-ad6c-1fbe7ab0f778","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Alarm Grid offers an innovative approach to DIY home security systems.
