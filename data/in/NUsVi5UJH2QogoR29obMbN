You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Mount-It MI-303L is a decent <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">wall mount</a> that doesn&#39;t offer quite as much as some of the best TV mounts. However, it has several features we expect from Mount-It, like flexible VESA pattern compatibility and a sleek design.","This TV bracket mount is compatible with VESA patterns ranging from 100 x 100 all the way up to 800 x 400. Such a wide range makes sense, seeing as the MI-303L can hold TVs measuring between 40 and 70 inches and weighing up to 220 pounds. The mount is made of heavy-duty steel to support so much weight. However, with such a large weight capacity, the bulk of the mount itself starts to be a problem. The bulk in this case manifests itself in the profile.","Once this mount is on your wall and the TV is installed, it sticks out from your wall by a little over 3 inches. In comparison to sitting on an entertainment unit, that may not seem like a lot, but when you compare it with competing TV wall mounts that protrude only 1 inch from the wall, you&#39;ll notice the difference. If you choose to move the wall mount out of a fixed position and into a tilt, up to 15 degrees, the profile will increase even more.","A horizontal adjustment bar allows you to slide your mounted television into the perfect viewing position. This is by far one of our favorite features, because not only does it make up for user error, allowing you to center a misaligned TV, but it lets you adjust the TV for different situations. Once you&#39;ve picked the perfect TV position, you can lock it into place, and the lock even has an area you can hook on a padlock to prevent theft.","Mount-It has a very consumer-oriented attitude. Its website is a great resource for its customers. Each product&#39;s page includes specific information, and the MI-303L&#39;s page describes the five-year warranty included with the mount. In case you need direct assistance, Mount-It has a customer support phone number and email address."]},"id":"d43f9172-f9bd-4a75-bb1d-f9b3fed31272","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a622d1d-34a9-4f0c-b671-5a52a2e86c11","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Mount-It MI-303L TV wall mount has several great features we admire in Mount-It&#39;s products.
