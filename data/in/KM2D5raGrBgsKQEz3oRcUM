You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Zoombak Advanced A-GPS Locator tracking device comes with many features, including continuous tracking, safety zones, a long-life battery and more. The device is small and light, water resistant and has a rechargeable battery. With the web-based service, you can track where your family or pet is, set up a safety zone they can travel in,  and opt to receive text or email alerts when the <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS tracker</a> leaves the zone. You can access the service with any internet-connected computer or smartphone.","The rechargeable battery can last up to five days in standby mode, but if you’re using features like continuous tracking, you&#39;ll get about two days. If the battery charge drops to a certain level, you will receive an email or text alert to charge it. If, for whatever reason, the device turns off, you will also receive a notification.","You can access the tracking information, maps and your account on the Zoombak website. Once you’ve logged in, you can opt to receive alerts by email or text message, and you can create up to 10 safety zones, which are virtual boundaries for your child or pet. You can also set the GPS tracker to continually send position updates as frequently as every five minutes. The Zoombak does have accompanying smartphones apps on both Android and iOS devices, but the apps are updated sporadically.","A safety zone is an area you and your child or teen agree that they can travel within, such as specific streets to get to school, a friend’s house and so on. If they leave or enter the zone, you’ll receive an alert, and you can check their current location on the Zoombak website. You can also set up the device to alert you when they arrive at their destination and when they depart. You also have access to tracking history logs, so you can see up to 90 days of data on their position based on the time and date. The tracking device is not capable of two-way speech, as it doesn&#39;t have a microphone or a speaker.","It’s simple to activate and register the Zoombak Advanced A-GPS Locator. With the included pouch, this GPS tracker for kids is easy to attach it to your child’s backpack or bike or the car your teen is driving in.","The Zoombak Advanced A-GPS Locator comes with several help and support options, including a user manual, a quick-start guide and extensive FAQs sections. The website also has an informative product tour that could help in a pinch. If you need more help, have further questions or require technical support, you can reach Zoombak by telephone or email."]},"id":"d0bafcbf-f35c-41b4-975b-7c12133afd13","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e6efdee7-55be-4318-8984-488d5c431d07","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Zoombak Advanced A-GPS Locator allows you to set up safety zones, receive text or email alerts, perform continuous tracking and more.
