Indeed the relatively new category of prosumer has been created by market demand and technological advances. Fitting into this category is the Canon VIXIA HF S11 which is among the best high definition camcorders on the market today. It’s a fitting upgrade to the outstanding Canon VIXIA HF S10 with double the onboard flash memory. The only question is if the additional memory is worth the higher price."]},"id":"cfefbe76-ecc0-401f-bbd1-bd594b2bf13f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"24cfcad8-c2ab-4007-99f8-7f08af6210d0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["To make the most of a high definition TV, you need high definition input. That’s the logic behind making the investment in a great HD camcorder. The Canon VIXIA HF S11 allows for recording in full 1920 x 1080 high definition at 24Mbps, the highest available bit rate in the AVCHD format. Couple that with the substantial 8.59-megapixel CMOS image sensor and, more significantly, the relatively large 1/2.6” size of that sensor and you can expect some pretty spectacular footage. It’s important to note that the size of the sensor is probably more important in predicting image quality than is the much hyped total number of pixels. The larger pixels created by a sensor like this will yield superior picture quality.","If there’s a down side to all of that top quality recording it’s that it eats up a lot of memory. The HF S11 answers that challenge with 64GB of built-in flash memory plus the option of adding up to a32GB SDHC memory card. Therein lies the fundamental difference between it and the HF S10 which has just 32GB built-in plus the SDHC card option.  Whether or not the $100 price difference is worth it depends on your personal usage requirements. For comparison purposes at this writing, 32GB SDHC cards can be purchased for somewhat less than $100 and the price is sure to come down as still larger cards become available. When purchasing a card, be sure to get one that is at least Class 4 but preferably the faster Class 6. Battery life can also be an issue for a camcorder with this much power. We’ve sited 100 minutes as the battery life on our product matrix but that will be affected by the recording mode, use of zoom or light and numerous other factors. There is a high capacity battery available which will offer about double the expected usage time.","Canon optics are always among the top reasons for choosing Canon products. The VIXIA HF S11 features 10x optical zoom and a built-in 1.7x digital teleconverter which effectively extends the telephoto range while preserving the image quality. For really long shots the camera also offers 200x digital zoom. Optical image stabilization is featured and is superior to the digital image stabilization offered on many camcorders because it preserves the image quality that is captured by the excellent lens.","Manual exposure and focus controls are available for more advanced users and to enhance creativity but the majority of prosumer cinematographers will enjoy the many automatic shooting modes. Programmed AE settings include Auto, P, Av, Tv, Cine, low light, night, spotlight, fireworks, portrait, sports, snow, beach and sunset. There’s also an 8-megapixel still camera built-in which includes a flash and the ability to record up to five images per second in continuous mode.","<strong>Summary of Reviews</strong>","Reviewers are jumping on the increased built-in memory featured on the Canon VIXIA HF S11 HD camcorder – 64GB compared to 32GB for the HF S10. There’s unanimity that the increase is nice but disagreement about whether or not the price difference is justified given that the devices are otherwise the same. Battery life also gets its share of criticism.","The advanced optical image stabilization feature, designated Dynamic SuperRange by Canon, has been widely praised as effectively eliminating one of the most troublesome problems associated with capturing high quality video images. Despite its small size, the controls are seen as easier to use than most of the competition. The $1,400 price tag has taken its share of hits but we suppose that’s to be expected for a device that’s this capable."]},"id":"da1e2c5d-4ecc-45b7-a79b-a7d2ccf5308c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f5b484bc-b00f-42ff-af79-c8a71dd19e21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The image quality attainable with the Canon VIXIA HF S11 is superb, the camera is easy to use and the increased flash memory will meet just about anyone’s filming needs.
