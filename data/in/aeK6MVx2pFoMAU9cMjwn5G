It works with multiple Android and iOS phones, and you can order wristbands or fobs that work if someone you know lacks a cell phone or if you wish to use an alternate mechanism.","This <a href=\"/best-smart-locks\">smart home lock</a> is convenient to install. There is no need to wire it, remove your existing locks or use power tools, an aspect renters enjoy. This smart door lock works with your existing lock. It installs quickly with single cylinder locks that have a thumb turn on the interior. This type of lock is common and includes locks made by Schlage and Yale, among others. The company provides customer service on this issue and asks that you send photos of your existing lock from both an interior and exterior vantage point.","The covers of this smart home lock come in chrome, antique and satin brass along with black, white and a cover you can paint yourself, and you can choose the three you want with your order. The box includes the lock, three covers, a sensor kit, a metal plate with a gasket made of rubber, four batteries, screws and screwdriver, a manual, and a license for Homekeys. The unit measures 6.30-inches high by 2.95-inches wide and 1.65-inches deep. It weighs 8.8 ounces.","There are additional items you can order for this smart lock, such as an access pack, which includes a wristband, fob and large wallet card. It also includes an additional Smart Reader that lets you use this lock with most cell phones, even ones that are not smartphones. You can give the tags immediate authorization and cancel them just as quickly.","You can use your keys to open this smart lock since you never remove the outside cylinder. The wallet cards are handy if your cell phone battery wears down since they use a radio frequency identification. The wristbands are useful for children and guests. Additional accessories, such as a gate opener and a garage door opener, are available at an extra cost.","In addition to notifying you when the lock is in use and the door is unlocked, this smart home lock lets you know if someone tries to enter without your permission through an alarm notification. It does not use picture notification.","Okidokeys Smart Locks give you convenient installation, door-entry and security notification, remote access, and alternate ways to use these Bluetooth door locks. Without the need to rely on Wi-Fi, concern over the loss of the internet is not an issue."]},"id":"f6f2af36-11ee-4403-82b7-6c67387e3ccd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60649","url":"/okidokeys-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-01T16:51:39Z","datePublished":"2014-10-01T16:51:39Z","name":"Okidokeys Smart Lock","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
