We compared the sites&#39; buying and selling processes and to see how simple it was to set up a listing on each site.","We also looked at the cost of each service and whether the fees outweigh the benefits. Fees can take away a large chunk of your selling profits, so make sure you understand what each company charges for listing fees, final value fees, and seller verification fees. We calculated all these fees and found that eBay has the highest final value fees, while companies like eBid doesn’t charge listing fees.","<strong>What’s the Difference Between a Listing and a Web Store? </strong>","A single item that you list in an auction is a listing. A listing has a description of the product, a suggested selling price and photos. Unfortunately, most sites will only let you list a certain number of items for free before charging you for each listing. If you want to avoid this fee and have many items to sell, look into opening a web store.","A web store lets you pay a monthly subscription for lower listing fees and fewer fees overall. Buyers can browse all your listings in one place, instead of finding you by searching for the individual items.<br/> <br/><strong>Are Online Auctions Safe? </strong>","Auction fraud usually occurs when a seller doesn’t ship a purchased item. It can also happen when you accidentally purchase black-market goods and are subject to numerous hidden fees. It’s important to research any seller you’re buying from. Be cautious of sellers outside your country or any who ask that you mail payments to a P.O. box.","If you make a purchase on an auction site, be sure to pay with a credit card or another payment option where you can dispute the charges if you don’t receive the items. Don’t mail a check and never send cash. ","<strong>Apps</strong>","You can even use some online auction sites on your phone. While longstanding auction sites like <a href=\"http://anywhere.ebay.com/mobile/iphone/ebay/\">eBay</a> have apps you can download and use on the go, there are other options to make monitoring and bidding on the things you want easy and fast. <a href=\"https://www.handbid.com/\">Handbid</a> is a silent auction app you can program to continually bid on an item up to a predetermined amount. <a href=\"https://tophatter.com/\">Tophatter</a> lets you participate in 90-second auctions for everything from electronics to toys. In short, you don&#39;t have to be tethered to your computer to participate in an online auction.","<strong>Tips for Buyers</strong>","Research: Even though you&#39;ll be able to see photos of whatever you&#39;re bidding on, check out other websites with something the same or very similar for sale. Comparing an object&#39;s makeup and condition makes it less likely you&#39;ll overpay for something. If you&#39;re bidding on something you know is in your area, try contacting the seller to ask for an in-person inspection or, at the very least, a video of the item from every angle.","Item notifications: Most online auction websites let you create a wishlist or a watch list. This means you can add items you&#39;re interested in to a list, and when they become available or the auction is close to ending, you&#39;ll get an email notification. You&#39;re less likely to miss out on an item you love this way.","Those final minutes: If at all possible, always be watching and ready during the last few minutes of the auction. Make sure you&#39;re near a computer and can bid if you need to.","Respect your limits: If you’re interested in bidding on a product, set your financial limit ahead of time and stick to it. No one item is worth going into debt over.","<strong>Tips for Sellers</strong>","Spread the word: Use social media, snail mail – heck, even water cooler conversation at the office – to spread the word about what you&#39;re selling. You never know who might be interested in your antique clocks, and the more people who bid, the more money you&#39;re likely to earn.","Make it appealing: They say a picture is worth 1,000 words, so make sure the photos of the item for sale are clear and well lit. Use concise, colorful descriptions, and make sure to run them through spell check. "]},"id":"f75e8970-86c5-4502-ac04-cb255606a254","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_121","url":"/best-online-auction-sites","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-brown","url":"/author/ryan-brown","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Ryan Brown","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"HR3J5H9LhLCfWmFnumxwPW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-23T20:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-23T20:00:00Z","name":"Best Online Auction Sites of 2019","synopsis":"Auction sites with large memberships and recognizable names have the highest selling fees.
