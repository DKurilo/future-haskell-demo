With so many functions, and niches it can be hard to know what you window air conditioner is best for each function. ","This buying guide for window air conditions will talk you through the common features, installing the machine, as well as, providing reviews for the best window air conditioners we’ve got our hands on, so you won’t bake this summer. ","<strong>Why trust us</strong>","We&#39;ve tested programmable thermostats and fans in-house for the last three years. This hands-on experience has given us insight into what to expect from heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment. We apply exacting standards to each product we test, primarily focusing on performance and user-friendliness. We design our tests to simulate typical consumer experiences.","When, as in the case of window air conditioners, we cannot test the physical product ourselves, so we can score all the products against our inhouse scoring system, to ensure greater consistency across all out reviews. ","<strong>How we tested</strong>","During our evaluation, we relied on manufacturer specifications as we considered each air conditioning unit’s performance, cooling area and energy efficiency. We measured each air conditioner&#39;s ability to circulate air through a room, operate in different modes and to provide a chilled area to relax in more heavily than the other features of a window air conditioner.","We also considered each unit&#39;s energy efficiency rating and calculated the estimated annual cost to operate it. We used an industry-standard formula to estimate the annual energy cost based on someone using the unit eight hours a day for three months out of the year. Your actual cost depends on how often you use the air conditioner and the cost of electricity in your area – the national average is 12 cents per kilowatt hour – so your actual energy cost may vary from our estimated cost.","Ease of use is also important, so we looked for features that contribute to it such as modes of operation. For example, nearly every unit we reviewed includes a remote control and a programmable timer, which lets you control the air conditioner from across the room and set it to turn on or off at specific times.","Even portable air conditioning units are hefty to move, meaning that can be extremely heavy.  In-window air conditioners shouldn&#39;t be too heavy to lift into the windowsill or more than the window can bear. Having the right sized unit for the windows size should make it super easy to install. Also, consider how much noise the AC makes as it runs – on average, window air conditioners make about 54 decibels of noise, which is about as loud as a conversation between two people. Look for a model with a sound output around this average, if not lower, if you plan on using it while you sleep. There are some units designed to operate at lower noise levels. ","<strong>How much does a budget window air conditioner cost?</strong>","For a budget-friendly and energy efficient window AC unit, you can expect to pay between $100 and $300. These units typically don’t have a lot of features and most won’t feature the ability to use multi-directional air streams. Always look for model that has at least a one-year warranty that covers the compressor.","<strong>Room size &amp; cooling performance</strong>","Window AC units come in many sizes and a variety of power ratings. Air conditioners use British Thermal Units (BTU) to indicate their cooling power, but how does that translate to room size? ","A good starting place is a 100-square-foot room: To properly cool a room this size, you need an AC unit rated at 5,000 Btu. For every additional 100 square feet, add 1,000 Btu. So, a 200-square-foot room requires an AC unit rated at 6,000 BTU and so on.","However, there are other factors to keep in mind. For example, you want an AC with a higher BTU rating than the above formula suggests if the room has a high ceiling or gets a lot of sunlight as well as if more than one person regularly occupies the room. A <a href=\"https://learn.compactappliance.com/btu-cooling-calculator/\">BTU calculator</a> is a nice way to ensure you get an air conditioning unit that is suitable for the space. ","<strong>Efficiency ratings &amp; certification</strong>","Every air conditioner has an energy efficiency ratio (EER), and the higher the EER, the more efficient the air conditioner is. The average EER of the window air conditioners we compared is 11.7, though the most efficient units have EER ratings over 12. Typically, appliances that are Energy Star certified are 20 to 30 percent more efficient than minimum requirements.","UL listed products have been tested by Underwriters Laboratories, which is a company that consults on a products safety. AHAM-certified units have passed performance evaluations by Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers.","<strong>Tips on installing a window AC Unit</strong>","Installing a window AC unit is a job for two people, due to the weight of the unit. Setting up a <a href=\"https://www.hometips.com/diy-how-to/air-conditioner-window-install.html\">window AC unit</a> should take a matter of minutes and shouldn&#39;t be a headache or a serious workout, so look for one that is lightweight and easy to install. The average weight of window air conditioners in our lineup is about 48 pounds, which can make them difficult to install without help.","An air conditioner does not need to be the same size as a window. Window AC units include a window kit that seals open spaces the unit itself does not cover. The kits tend to be the weak point in these systems, as improper installation allows cool air to escape the room and hot air to enter the house. Make sure you buy a unit with a kit that fits your window with a proper seal.","Most air conditioners for windows are designed for double-hung windows, which means that you might have to get creative and so some DIY to get the AC unit to fit if you casement windows or sliding windows. Before buying for these windows, check out DIY guides and videos on <a href=\"https://homeguides.sfgate.com/install-window-air-conditioner-vertical-sliding-window-63431.html\">installing AC units in sliding windows</a> and <a href=\"https://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-install-a-window-air-conditioner-in-a-crank-window\">installing window units for casement windows</a> to ensure you are prepared, and this a home improvement you can undertake. ","<strong>What functions do I need in a window air conditioner?</strong> ","The functions you need in a window AC unit all depends on the purpose you are using it for. Here are the most common functions on an AC unit, and what they are good for. ","<strong>Thermostat </strong>","This is basically the ability to control the output temperature of the air conditioner. ","The budget window AC units will have a regular mechanical thermostat. This is usually in the form of dial that you can rotate, and set the temperature of the room. This dial usually gives presents the temperature as a single digit ranging from 1 to 7 where one is very cool, whilst the other isn’t. This can mean temperature control can be very hit or miss in these models. ","The high end range of air conditioners for windows comes equipped with a digital thermostat. Although more expensive, these thermostats are more accurate and allow greater control. Instead of having a number, you can actually set the specific degrees you want the room to be. ","So, if you want to maintain a room at a specific temperature, a digital model would be better. ","<strong>Fan Speed Adjustment </strong>","An AC unit’s fan speed is how you control the rate of cooling in a room. ","Budget models typically come with two speeds - low and high. More expensive models come with a more options, including an auto-speed function. ","If you are using an air conditioner for a short time, fan speed isn’t so iportant. The high function of an expensive model will allow you to cool the room down quicker, but most people switch over to low to maintain the desired temperature. So, only look for a model with a high fan speed if you need to cool down a room quickly. ","The auto-speed function is a great feature to have. This allows the AC unit to monitor and adjust fan speed depending on the room’s temperature. This means you can set it, and just leave it to adjust and monitor itself. This is an ideal function to have in a bedroom or study, so you can sleep or work without working about the AC. It is also great in rooms where there is a natural heat source, like a kitchen. ","<strong>Automatic Timer </strong>","Automatic timers allow you to program when an AC unit turns itself off. This is a great function for when you are sleeping, or to save yourself money for when the kids, or the other half-forget to switch the machine off when they head out. ","Most budget models will only offer you set intervals for when the machine should turn itself off. Higher models are more advanced timers, which allow you to pre-program the AC unit in advance. This means you can even set the timer to turn on when you are not home. ","<strong>Air Direction </strong>","Window air conditioners allow you to control the direction of cool air through a set of blades that can be tilted and adjusted. ","Budget models usually have limited amount of directions, and blades for you to adjust, while more expensive models will offer you multiple options. The directions from two (up or down) to eight. ","<strong>Air Filter</strong>","As a window air conditioner sucks the hot air from the room, it also sucks in dust particles. These collect in the filter. A standard filter will have to be replaced every so often to prevent damage to a machine. A washable filter can be used again, once it has been washed. ","<strong>Quiet Machines</strong>","Some window AC units are designed to be quiet. These models are usually less powerful, and are not great for large spaces, but they are fantastic for areas that need quiet, like the bedroom. The noise level is something you should check for bedrooms. ","<strong>Dehumidifier Mode</strong>","These are good for those humid days, or if you live by the sea. On those days this mode will remove the moisture from the air, giving you a more comfortable day. The fan usually runs at slower speed, and the compressor is on for smaller durations so the extra humid is collected efficiently. ","<strong>Sleep Mode</strong>","In sleep mode an air condition will increase the degrees in the room. It will usually increase by half a degree every hour for a period of four hours. The window air conditioner will either maintain the room at a specific temperature or turn off after this period. ","<strong>Read more:</strong>","<a href=\"/best-air-conditioners-review\">Best air conditioners</a><br/><a href=\"/best-central-air-conditioning-units\">Best central air conditioning units</a><br/><a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">Best wall air conditioners</a><br/><a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">Best portable air conditioners</a><br/><a href=\"/best-gas-furnaces\">Best gas furnaces</a> ","<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"72365514-797c-4e18-ab7b-3da2f0ee2397","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"3ed8d7a4-6085-4be0-ae3d-0a2fafe46ff4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/lg-lw8017ersm-review\">LG LW8017ERSM</a>","<a href=\"/frigidaire-ffre0633u1-review\">Frigidaire FFRE0633U1</a>","<a href=\"/keystone-kstaw05b-review\">Keystone KSTAW05B</a>","<a href=\"/friedrich-residential-chill-review\">Friedrich Residential Chill</a>","<a href=\"/haier-hwf05xcr-l-review\">Haier HWF05XCR-L</a>","<a href=\"/danby-dac060bguwdb-review\">Danby DAC060BGUWDB</a>","<a href=\"/spt-wa-6022s-review\">SPT WA-6022S</a>","<a href=\"/ge-aem05lx-review\">GE AEM05LX</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2d054e35-f488-4706-9302-4ce2b17a4cd1","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_220","url":"/best-window-air-conditioners","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-16T22:07:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-16T22:07:00Z","name":"Best window air conditioners 2019: have a chilled out summer","synopsis":"Here are the most efficient, convenient, and well-designed in-window air conditioning units, ranked based on price, power and functions.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the most efficient, convenient, and well-designed in-window air conditioning units, ranked based on price, power and functions.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-16T14:13:29Z","id":"6BL576To6kfwj5uR7J3YjJ","meta":{"title":"Best Window Air Conditioners 2019 -
