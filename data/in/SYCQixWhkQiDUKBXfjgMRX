The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</a> here.</em>","The LG LMV1683ST over-the-range microwave is one of the lower-ranked models in our review because it does not have sensor cooking. However, it is our favorite non-sensor microwave, because of its features, its design and its warranty.","Without convection or sensor cooking features, this microwave is pretty basic, but it does have a few handy features. Pre-programmed auto cycles make a good estimate about how long each cycle needs. Auto reheat will bring your leftovers back up to temperature, and auto and rapid defrost will thaw your frozen meats and veggies so they&#39;re ready to cook. The melt and soften feature will make items like butter and ice cream easier to handle. And, of course, there is a popcorn button.","We are happy to see some extra features that are nice to have in a microwave. The child lock allows you to lock out any unauthorized user, and it&#39;s always useful to lock the keypad when you&#39;re wiping it clean. The standard turntable switches off if you do not need to use it for a particular item. This microwave also has a timer that works independently of the cooking function, so you can use it to time all of your kitchen projects.","Although this built-in microwave has less interior capacity than models that offer sensor cooking, it has as much space or more than the rest of the non-sensor models on our lineup. Despite less room on the inside, the exterior is still an average size.","Even with fewer features than most of the over-range microwaves we reviewed, this microwave is still just as powerful as many models. With 1,000 watts and 10 adjustable power levels, your food will be properly cooked and ready to eat in minutes.","The ventilation system is just as powerful as many other over-the-range microwave ovens. It runs at two different speeds with a maximum airflow of 300 cubic feet per minute, which is pretty standard. The vent installation allows for exterior venting to the outside of your house, or filtering and recirculating air in your kitchen if its design does not allow for exterior venting. The hood also has cooktop lights so that you can more easily see your stovetop while cooking, but the lights do not have multiple settings.","Although this over-the-range microwave is not as impressive as the best models, it is a good-looking microwave nonetheless. The sleek design gives it a modern look and it comes in black, white and stainless steel, so it&#39;ll match most kitchens&#39; color schemes. The keypad is basic and easy to use, and because the keys are flat, you can easily wipe up after sticky fingers.","Even though this is a cheaper over-range microwave, LG does not skimp on backing it with a superb warranty. It has the standard one-year warranty on parts and labor, and it has a 10-year warranty on the magnetron â€“ the most important component."]},"id":"0dd921ae-6661-44df-b416-f7e65db48988","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c3518525-3b7f-4cb3-9326-2b685dc42f02","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This microwave is the best out of the lower-ranked models on our lineup.
