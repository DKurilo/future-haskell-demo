This is the second most powerful <a href=\"/best-car-battery-chargers\">jump-starter</a> we reviewed in terms of cold cranking amps (CCA). It&#39;s no slouch when it comes to portability either.","With 1,700 peak amps of jump-starting power, the Jump-N-Carry is the most powerful jump-starter, exceeding the <a href=\"/noco-genius-review\">NOCO Genius GB40</a> and <a href=\"/stanley-review\">Stanley J5C09</a> by 700 amps. an adept tool. It has a slightly lower cold cranking amps rating than the best car jump-starter we reviewed, but at 425 CCA, it can still reliably turn over most engines in cold weather. It&#39;s harder to jump-start an engine in the cold, so the jump-starter needs to supply power for a longer period – because of this, the higher the CCA rating, the better.","The Clore Jump-N-Carry has 46-inch jumper cables, and you store one on each side of the device. There isn’t a power switch, so you must keep the cables separate and store them correctly so they don&#39;t spark or become a safety hazard.","It’s easy to transport the Jump-N-Carry, though it is a somewhat-heavy 18 pounds. This is about as heavy as other car jump-starters with this much power, and it&#39;s still small enough to store in the trunk of your car. It also has a carrying handle. Because it’s so portable, the Jump-N-Carry is a convenient addition to any automobile emergency kit.","This jump-starter doesn’t have many fancy safety features, but it comes with insulated and spark-resistant jumper cables and clamps. One notably absent safety feature is reverse polarity detection, which lets you know if you improperly connect the jumper cables to the battery&#39;s terminals. Be sure you double-check the connections before jump-starting, or you may ruin your battery.","While it doesn’t have a digital or backlit display, the Jump-N-Carry has an easy-to-read battery test gauge on the front that measures your battery’s remaining charge. This is particularly useful if you know that your aging battery has a difficult time holding a charge.","Clore backs the Jump-N-Carry with a one-year warranty, beginning on the date of purchase. While that&#39;s a decent amount of time, the best jump-starters have warranties that last up to five years."]},"id":"80bac9d7-bda1-4e20-80a2-e295a93339e6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53231","url":"/clore-jump-starter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-05T17:27:44Z","datePublished":"2011-07-05T17:27:44Z","name":"Clore Jump-N-Carry JNC660","synopsis":"Jump-starting a car requires significant electrical power, and the Clore Jump-N-Carry has it in abundance.
