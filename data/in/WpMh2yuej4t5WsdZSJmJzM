It runs off 20-volt batteries, which allow it to turn at a maximum rate of 2,000 RPM. This is the fastest turning rate of all the drills we reviewed. You can also adjust the speed between two settings to tackle different jobs. On the low setting (0 to 600 RPM), you can use the drill as a screwdriver. The higher setting is for high-intensity tasks like boring holes through wood.","This drill comes with two 20-volt lithium-ion batteries. In our battery life test, we attached a fully charged battery to the drill and taped the trigger in the on position. We then timed how long it took to drain power completely. The batteries DeWalt provides lasted 43 minutes, which was above the average of 39 minutes. For comparison, the longest lasting battery ran for over an hour. So, you can expect the batteries to last a good while – just make sure you have the extra one on the charger. It only takes about 35 minutes to fully recharge a dead battery.","Unfortunately, DeWalt doesn&#39;t release the drill&#39;s torque specification. Instead, the company lists its power rating, which takes into account the tool&#39;s speed and torque, resulting in a measurement of unit watts out (UWO). According to DeWalt, power is the amount of work completed in a given period of time, which basically means the higher the power rating, the faster the drill can complete a job.","The problem with this system of measurement is that it doesn’t compare with the traditional industry standard, torque. We contacted a representative from DeWalt, and they said that there isn’t a way to compare the drill&#39;s power rating with another brand&#39;s torque rating. As such, we were unable to compare the DCD790D2&#39;s power rating of 360 UWO to the torque  specs all the other drills we reviewed have."]},"id":"d14884bf-496d-4a1d-a84a-536846ececd8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Specifications"},"id":"895390a3-cc24-4575-a452-cdf06611de91","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/pep5B7esmnFc25kdp5uqv3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This drill only weighs 3.5 pounds, which is great, as heavy drills can wear you out quickly.
