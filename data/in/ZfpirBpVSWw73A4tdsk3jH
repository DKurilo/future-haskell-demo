The best audio performance in the series was the 6 x 9-inch rear deck speakers. This is the only three-way coaxial speaker available. The two tweeters provide a balanced sound with good but not great bass and good mids and highs. No single frequency range overwhelmed the others, which makes this an excellent speaker for those who have a diverse library of music.","Aside from the 6 x 9 speaker, all of the DXi speakers are only two-way, which means they have a woofer and one tweeter. This means the woofer is responsible for the low and midrange frequencies while the tweeter produces the high treble. As a result, the audio quality isn&#39;t nearly as balanced as the three-way car speakers. The midrange often feels hidden behind the bass and vice versa, depending on the arrangement of the song.","Perhaps the best feature of the DXi series is the consistently high sensitivity ratings. Most of the speakers have a 92dB sensitivity rating. Other speaker series have a high sensitivity rating for the rear deck 6 x 9 speakers, because these are the most popular speakers, but have significantly less efficient speakers with the smaller speakers. The 92dB rating gives the 6.5-inch car speaker one of the highest sensitivity ratings available among the car speakers reviewed. What this means is that these speakers require less power to produce the same volume of less sensitive speakers. For example, these speakers only need half the power to produce the same volume of a speaker with an 89dB rating.","The rear deck speakers have a continuous power handling rating of 100 watts with a peak of 300 watts, which makes them durable speakers that can handle high volumes. However, the door speakers have power handling that is a bit below average. With a continuous power handling rating of 55 watts and a peak of 165 watts, these speakers are among the lowest-rated speakers for power handling, which makes the high sensitivity all that much more important if you enjoy your music loud."]},"id":"9d9c1bcd-5660-49e5-8723-1fb6772c7989","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6afa6855-ff68-4425-9dd0-0df8ca893c32","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Polk DXi series of car speakers are very efficient speakers with high sensitivity ratings.
