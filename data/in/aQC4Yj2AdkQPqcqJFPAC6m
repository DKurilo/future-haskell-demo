The showcase door is a novel feature that allows you to quickly access drinks or condiments without opening the refrigerator door. The refrigerator also offers the most refrigerated space of any product on our lineup. However, that is at the expense of energy efficiency, as this series uses more energy than any other models in our side-by-side refrigerator reviews.","The ShowCase models come in either full size, with 28.5 cubic feet of capacity, or in counter-depth models with 21.5 cubic feet of capacity. The full-sized Samsung RH29H8000SR model provides 10.1 cubic feet for the freezer and 18.4 cubic feet for the refrigerator, which is more than any other model on our lineup and many other side-by-sides.","The refrigerated portion provides four glass shelves for storage, which, while not adjustable, are staggered to accommodate different sizes of food containers. There are two humidity-controlled drawers, and the door has five bins, which you can access through the showcase door. The quick-cool and quick-freeze features pump cold air into the refrigerator and freezer to restore any lost cool air.","The freezer not only has a relatively large capacity, but it is also organized for maximum usage of that space, with an in-door icemaker that frees up storage space. It has four shelves, two clear plastic drawers and three door bins. The ice and water dispenser is taller than average to fill pitchers and tall glasses with filtered water.","The Energy Star compliant RH29H8000SR model uses more energy annually than similar-sized models. The estimated yearly energy use is 741 kWh, with an operating cost of around $90 annually. Samsung&#39;s warranty is something to brag about, however. It covers parts and labor for the standard one year, the sealed system for five years and the compressor parts for 10 years.","Samsung also offers stellar support options. The website provides ample information, including digital user guides, a plentiful knowledgebase, FAQs, tutorials and troubleshooting steps. If you need further assistance, you can contact customer service by phone, email form, live chat or even live video chat."]},"id":"b7b8a8de-c7ec-47c2-a053-5c71b763e116","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"579809d7-6528-45cb-bf3a-04902cc85760","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Samsung side-by-side refrigerators with Food ShowCase are not only good-looking models with a fancy showcase door on each.
