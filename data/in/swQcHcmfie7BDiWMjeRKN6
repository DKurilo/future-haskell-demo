There are some things to consider when deciding between a software-based or web-based POS program for your business. Both systems should run off a regular computer that is running an operating system like Windows or Mac OS X and the difference can be subtle at times.  ","Older systems were all software-based and were imperfect in their design.

Those older systems can still be found, but are slowly being phased out because of the advantages of the modern solutions. Convenience and broader potential are the biggest differences and are what make sales transactions in our day such a smooth process.","These are the major advantages and disadvantage of both types of POS systems:","<strong>Web-based POS</strong>","<strong>Advantages </strong>"]},"id":"707cb5d5-85e9-4e39-b063-762657d0bb3f","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["The provider will back-up all of your important information on their server so you will not lose anything due to a computer crash or theft.","You can access reports, inventory and other information from any computer with an internet connection.","You do not have to purchase expensive POS software.","Most services provide free updates so your POS program will never become outdated.","Web-based POS programs are easy to upgrade.
