You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","At 5.5 cubic feet of storage capacity, the Danby DCF550W1 is hardly the largest <a href=\"/best-freezers\">chest freezer</a> in the company&#39;s catalog. In fact, only one is smaller. Still, the Danby DCF550W1 has the features needed for most home refrigeration needs.","Physically, the Danby DCF550W1 measures 22 x 24.9 x 32.9 inches (L x W x H) and weighs just 87.1 pounds, which makes the chest freezer relatively easy to move around a home. This unit is compact and will give you enough space to store extra groceries.","Due to the operating requirements for the DCF550W1, the chest freezer cannot be placed directly against a wall because it requires circulation from the rear. Additionally, Danby recommends placing this model on support planks to prevent any type of moisture damage if you plan to put the freezer in a basement or other moist environment.","Danby has focused on flexibility in this model&#39;s moving and cleaning options. Leveling legs to support the mini chest freezer are built into its base. This small chest freezer features a side-mounted drain for removing water during defrosting cycles, as well as a single, aluminum-lined chamber that prevents rust from developing inside unit.","A front-mounted thermostat also lets you control the exact temperature within the chest freezer. This function – combined with secure foam insulation within the cabinet and lid – helps the chest freezer&#39;s efficiency and cuts down your power bills. To reduce extra strain, the Danby DCF550W1&#39;s motor is only activated when the freezer&#39;s internal temperature rises above the thermostat setting. This ensures that the freezer will only consume power in order to maintain a stable operating temperature. Danby also recommends that you maintain a temperature of no lower than 0 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure that this small freezer chest operates at the highest efficiency.","As with all of Danby&#39;s chest freezers, the DCF550W1 comes with a standard 12-month warranty program that deals with parts, labor and in-home service, though installation and cleaning costs are not covered.","The Danby DCF550W1 possesses features that are similar to most entry-level chest freezers. With its 5.5 cubic feet interior and power management options, the DCF550W1 is capable of long-term food storage in your home."]},"id":"46ccbda9-30f5-42e9-a0f1-ba0e044a4e35","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58816","url":"/danby-freezer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-19T20:44:47Z","datePublished":"2014-02-19T20:44:47Z","name":"Danby DCF550W1","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
