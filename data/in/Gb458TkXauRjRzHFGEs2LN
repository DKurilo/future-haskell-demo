Over the past eight years, we&#39;ve researched online and read many reviews in order to find the best wine fridges on the market to compare and test. We looked for appliances that fit a modest wine collection, fewer than 50 bottles, and our reviews include both compressor- and thermoelectric-cooled units. The models we chose also work well in most homes – they accurately maintain temperature, have flexible storage arrangements and include safety features.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To evaluate temperature accuracy, we measured each fridge&#39;s temperature multiple times at different spots inside the fridge. All our testing occurred in a laboratory so we could ensure the ambient temperature stayed consistent, right around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. This is worth noting because thermoelectric units can be less effective at cooling in places with dramatic temperature fluctuations.","We also used wine bottles of various sizes to gauge how well they fit. We favored coolers that fit larger-than-average bottles, and we used standard-size bottles to make sure the coolers fit the number of wine bottles they were advertised to hold.","While we tested several of the wine coolers in our lab, we weren&#39;t able to physically test each model we compared. As such, we also relied on user guides and customer feedback to learn about the fridges&#39; features and how dependable they were.","During our research, we chatted with Barbara Zeigler, a wine enthusiast who has enjoyed wines for over 40 years and who has stored her wine in a wine cooler for nearly 15 years.","Zeigler and her husband chose a small dual-zone wine cooler that holds a few bottles. She used to keep white wine in the fridge, but red wines must be kept at warmer temperatures and shouldn&#39;t be chilled that way.","Now Zeigler keeps 50 bottles in her wine cooler. It has “storage for 25 red and storage for 25 white. [And] no room taken up in our crowded refrigerator and wines stored at the perfect temperature.”","“We don’t have any space for a wine cellar and we don’t have that many bottles,” Ziegler explained, “so the [wine] fridge is perfect for our use.”","During our research, we chatted with Barbara Zeigler, a wine enthusiast who has enjoyed wines for over 40 years. She has stored her wine in a wine cooler for nearly 15 years. Zeigler has toured vineyards in Napa and Sonoma and is amazed by the entire process. “It’s very hard work and one small mistake can be very costly to your batch.”","Zeigler and her husband chose a small dual-zone wine cooler that holds a few bottles. She used to keep white wine in the fridge, but red wines must be kept at warmer temperatures and shouldn&#39;t be chilled that way.","Now Zeigler keeps 50 bottles in her wine cooler. It has “storage for 25 red and storage for 25 white. [And] no room taken up in our crowded refrigerator and wines stored at the perfect temperature.”","“We don’t have any space for a wine cellar and we don’t have that many bottles,” Ziegler explained, “so the [wine] fridge is perfect for our use.”","<strong>Key Features of Wine Coolers</strong>","Temperature: How cold should a wine cooler get?","The right temperature depends on the type of wine you&#39;re chilling – red and white wines need to be stored at different temperatures. If you want to store both types at the same time, you need a dual-zone wine refrigerator. These models, such as the <a href=\"/koldfront-review\">Koldfront TWR181ES</a>, have two areas and can maintain a different temperature in each. However, if you chill only one type of wine, a single-zone cooler is a more economical option.","For red wine, it is best to keep your wine cooler between 50 degrees and 65 degrees Fahrenheit. White wine should be chilled between 41 degrees and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, with 46 degrees being the optimal temperature if you’re storing both sweet and dry varieties. This is warmer than a standard refrigerator, which is kept between 32 degrees and 40 degrees to keep food from spoiling.","Size: How many bottles does a wine fridge hold?","Wine fridges come in a variety of sizes – some can hold as few as six bottles and others as many as 100. If you have a wine cellar, you probably only need a small cooler to chill a few bottles to have ready for guests. Most of the wine coolers we evaluated held between 12 and 18 bottles, but many of their manufacturers make fridges that hold more or fewer bottles.","You should also consider the size of the bottles you buy. A cooler&#39;s advertised capacity is the number of standard-size bottles that fit comfortably inside. A standard wine bottle is between 3 inches and 3 1/2 inches around (diameter) and 12 inches tall. If you need to store a larger bottle, you can take out a shelf or two and stand it upright in the cooler. The <a href=\"/danby-review\">Danby DWC93BLSDB</a> is a decent cooler that is compact and holds 36 standard bottles, though it stores larger bottles when you remove some shelves.","<strong>How much does a wine cooler cost?</strong>","Because wine coolers differ so much in size, number of cooling zones and features, their prices vary greatly. You can find some for as low as $100 or as much as $4,000. We focused on wine fridges designed for a modest wine collection and priced between $100 and $400. <strong></strong>","<strong>What is the difference between a compressor and thermoelectric cooling system?</strong>","There are two big differences between a compressor and a thermoelectric cooling system: energy usage and noise. There are also some differences with the temperatures they can reach – wine coolers with compressors get much colder, so they better accommodate sweet and sparkling wines. However, there are some thermoelectric wine fridges, like the <a href=\"/wine-enthusiast-review\">Wine Enthusiast 272031805</a>, that are an exception to this rule and can get cold enough to chill these varieties of white wines as well.","As far as noise, you can expect a wine cooler with a compressor to make some noise while it runs. It typically isn’t loud enough to interrupt a conversation, but it’s still noticeable. Thermoelectric coolers are much quieter, sometimes running nearly silent.","For energy usage, thermoelectric cooling systems don’t have as many moving parts as compressors, so they don’t use as much energy to cool your wine. As such, they also cost less to run.","<strong>Can you put beer in a wine cooler?</strong>","Technically speaking, you can store beer in a wine cooler. Craft and specialty beers cool to the same temperatures as white wines, and the bottles are small enough to fit on the shelves. Or, if you have a case of beer, you can take out the shelves and store it on the floor of the fridge. ","However, if you buy domestic beers, such as Budweiser, Keystone, Michelob or Miller-Coors, especially in cans, it’s best to get a <a href=\"/best-mini-fridges\">mini fridge</a>. They are designed to hold cans and can chill your draft to a more pleasant temperature than a wine fridge. Additionally, wine coolers can’t be placed anywhere the surrounding temperature isn’t regulated, such as in a garage or on a patio, because doing so voids the warranty. On the other hand, a mini fridge can handle the ambient temperature changes in these areas, so you’re less restricted on where you can put them. This can be important if you’re pressed for space and the only room open is in your garage. ","id:622"]},"id":"5b575e96-ff94-4bca-b1ae-6b81815840e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a09570b0-3d61-426c-9ec5-40f58a2c839c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/nutrichef-review\">NutriChef PKTEWC18</a>","<a href=\"/danby-review\">Danby DWC93BLSDB</a>","<a href=\"/kalamera-review\">Kalamera KRC30SZB</a>","<a href=\"/koldfront-review\">Koldfront TWR181ES</a>","<a href=\"/magic-chef-review\">Magic Chef MCWC12B</a>","<a href=\"/wine-enthusiast-review\">Wine Enthusiast 272031805</a>","<a href=\"/avanti-review\">Avanti EWC1201</a>","<a href=\"/igloo-review\">iGloo FRW1225</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"56594a6c-a62c-4959-b0e3-4a306e775379","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_146","url":"/best-wine-coolers","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-09T20:57:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-09T20:57:00Z","name":"Best Wine Coolers of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best wine storage coolers, based on their features, design and convenience.
