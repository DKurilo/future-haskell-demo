Utilizing Husqvarna’s latest advances in engine and design technology for increased power and efficiency, this chainsaw will help draw out its value for years to come.","Husqvarna adds many unique and helpful features to their devices to make them appeal to consumers who don&#39;t mind paying for quality. The features provided on the 450 model give significant incentive to make such an investment in this long-lasting, powerful machine."]},"id":"b303c314-b469-456c-b2c4-ce2a9319b82c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/s3gTfJpbYL5wNFSYVJJdzX.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56692-husqvarna-4504.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s3gTfJpbYL5wNFSYVJJdzX.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"s3gTfJpbYL5wNFSYVJJdzX","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s3gTfJpbYL5wNFSYVJJdzX.jpg","alt":""},"id":"85b8dd70-e90b-4f96-af33-19445e18a549","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The first and most noteworthy of features is the X-Torq engine, which is designed to not only use less fuel during than typical gas engines, but also to reduce overall exhaust emission levels. In a world of ever-growing environmental concerns, this is a very proactive move on Husqvarna’s part to be environmentally conscientious. The fuel economy of this chainsaw is further complemented with the presence of a quick-release air filter. As dust and wood particles build up on the air filter in a chainsaw, overall performance suffers. The quick release functionality allows for easy cleaning and replacement of the air filter to ensure the continued performance of your chainsaw.","The Husqvarna 450 comes equipped with a combined choke and stop control so you can more easily start the chainsaw while mitigating the risk of the engine flooding. In addition, the cylinder cover operates with a snap-lock style of closing and opening. This means when the time comes to replace spark plugs or access the air filter for cleaning, you can easily access engine parts without the need for tools.","On the exterior of the chainsaw, the Husqvarna 450 offers a fuel indicator. It acts as a window to the fuel tank, providing a convenient glimpse at how much fuel is left without the need of popping open the fuel cap.","In addition, the Husqvarna 450 makes use of a valuable safety feature, the inertia-activated chain brake. When kickback occurs normally, chainsaw operators simply need to let go of the trigger to activate the chain brake, or else make use of an additional button or lever. The Husqvarna 450 instead relies on inertia to indicate the potential of a kickback and overrides any controls to instantly brake the chain and reduce possible injuries.","The Husqvarna 450 continues the manufacturer’s legacy of creating powerful and innovative chainsaws for personal use. They’ve combined a series of important features to increase the versatility, power and efficiency of this device while still keeping it at a manageable price."]},"id":"8e122268-6959-497f-95d2-a18502f3aa60","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56720","url":"/husqvarna-chain-saw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
