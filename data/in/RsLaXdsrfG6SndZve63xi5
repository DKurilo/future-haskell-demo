As we researched subscriptions, we discovered that many of the free audio books paid services include in their memberships are LibraVox recordings.","The downside to this service is that it may take you some time to find a quality recording. Because LibriVox uses volunteers, narrators can change from chapter to chapter, and there isn’t a universal quality standard required for recording.","Because the recordings aren’t always professionally produced, it can occasionally be hard to understand the narration, but it’s a global effort and sometimes injects new life into older texts. For example, we’ve heard good things about Mil Nicholson’s recordings of some of Charles Dickens’s greatest works that are free for download on the site."]},"id":"d1756ad3-7727-4dfd-abaf-f6aae7fcf738","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"659511b8-fb36-47e6-8cbe-2eaa9f217aca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00NB86OYE/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1422899139880&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&tag=ttr_audiobook-services-20&linkId=2V6M3OYINB4OGIU2\">Audible</a>","<a href=\"https://www.playster.com/us/en\">Playster</a>","<a href=\"http://affiliates.audiobooks.com/tracking/scripts/click.php?a_aid=toptenreviews&a_bid=52ce997a\">Audiobooks.com</a>","<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Cty0dj6o3sg&mid=38466&u1=AudiobookServices&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.downpour.com%2F\">Downpour</a>","<a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=599842&u=113582&m=52971&urllink=&afftrack=AudiobookServices\">AudiobooksNow</a>","<a href=\"https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=5f97d6947584dea7e4afd9ac5c4d5419&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2F\">Scribd</a>","<a href=\"http://www.theaudiobookstore.com/\">AudiobookStore</a>","<a href=\"http://www.simplyaudiobooks.com/\">Simply Audiobooks</a>","<a href=\"https://www.nookaudiobooks.com/\">Nook Audiobooks</a>","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8\">Apple Books</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4f4d6cbc-3d22-4998-b798-5f4203f638dd","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_178","url":"/best-audiobook-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2007-05-02T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2014-05-23T00:17:22Z","name":"Best Audiobook Services","synopsis":"While Audible is the most popular audio subscription service, there are other options to consider that have well-stocked libraries and useful features.
