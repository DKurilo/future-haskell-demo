When you buy a wall mount system from Sanus, you are guaranteed a product that will last for at least 10 years and adjust with you throughout those years. Not only can you adjust your mounted television horizontally using the Sanus Systems VMPL50A-B1, but you can move it vertically as well.","The Sanus Systems VMPL50A-B1 is capable of mounting a TV weighing up to 150 pounds and measuring 32 to 70 inches on your living room wall. It is compatible with all VESA patterns up to 673 x 438, so it fits most TV’s mounting requirements. Still, it’s important to double-check your TV before purchasing a wall mount.","It is made of heavy-gauge steel that securely supports your TV with a double-stud installation. If you install it correctly, the distance between the wall and your TV should be no more than 1.8 inches – just enough room to run cords to the TV, but small enough to maintain a clean, modern profile.","Unlike the <a href=\"/mount-it-review\">Mount-It MI-305B</a>, the VMPL50A-B1 is a tilting TV wall mount, which is ideal for optimizing the viewing perspective and minimizing glare. It only has a max tilt of 10 degrees, which is less than the best tilting wall mounts but still enough to minimize glare from overhead lights or sunlight. Sanus&#39; tilting feature allows you to adjust the tilt angle with just a slight touch.","Before drilling holes in your walls, it is important to determine where the wall mount should go. Height is a huge factor to consider, because you don&#39;t want the mount to be too high or too low in regard to the seating situation. Sanus has a solution. If you visit the company&#39;s website, you can use the Height Finder to decide things for you. You simply enter in a few specifications and the program spits out the measurements of where to hang your TV wall mount.","The user manual that comes with the mount indicates the different tools and hardware you&#39;ll need to properly mount it to your wall. The manual goes so far as to specify which kind of drill bit you&#39;ll need for different installation surfaces. For example, if you&#39;re installing the mount onto a cinder block wall, you&#39;ll need a 3/8-inch drill bit. If you&#39;re installing onto drywall with studs as the braces, you&#39;ll need a 7/32-inch drill bit. The manual is full of detailed information like this to assist you in a safe and secure installation.","In case you decide you don&#39;t like the location of the wall mount after installation, Sanus has a feature called ProSet that allows you to slightly adjust the mount vertically and horizontally. All you need do is tighten or loosen the ProSet fixtures on the top of the mount.","A cord-management system is also located on the back panel of the mount. From here you can run cords down to an electrical outlet or have a professional install an outlet directly behind the TV.","One of the best features is the 10-year warranty. Many TV wall mounts including the <a href=\"/mount-it-mi-318b-review\">Mount-It MI-318B</a> have warranties up to five years or less. With 10 years, it’s possible that it’ll outlast your TV.","While it’s one of the more expensive tilting TV wall mounts, the Sanus Systems VMPL50A-B1 is a good option, especially if you have a big TV. The company goes above and beyond the wall mount norm with intricate features and user-friendly elements that set this system apart from the rest."]},"id":"31b467a7-8cf7-46df-ab3c-224ae7ed725d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53635","url":"/sanus-systems-vmpl50a-b1-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-09-22T03:06:00Z","datePublished":"2011-09-22T03:06:00Z","name":"Sanus Systems VMPL50A-B1 Tilting","synopsis":"Sanus Systems offers a generous customer service package to its TV wall mount customers.
