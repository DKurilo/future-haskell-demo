The Breeze mode is activated by pressing the breeze mode button. Pushing the breeze mode once will activate the lowest breeze setting, and the selected breeze mode operates in accordance with the chosen speed setting. In other words, if your fan is set on high speed, the breeze mode will alternate between the high and medium speed settings. If it&#39;s running on medium speed, breeze mode will alternate between the medium and low setting. So does breeze mode actually live up to its claims of replicating a gentle outdoor wind? We cannot say that it accomplishes this feat exactly, but the breeze it does generate is pleasant. Still, this feature tends to feel a bit more like marketing hype than substance. Ironically, it is while in breeze mode that this tower fan it at its loudest. The fluctuation in noise levels while in breeze mode may be off-putting to some.","The Honeywell HY-041W includes an ionizer feature, which is supposed to freshen the air with negative ions. These negative ions are distributed into the room where they cling to dust, dander, cigarette smoke and other pollutants to form larger particles, which can then be captured by the unit&#39;s filter. These nasty pollutants can fall to the floor to be vacuumed up later. The result, in theory, is a more crisp and natural environment. Did we feel a noticeable change in our environment? Not necessarily, but even the thought of a fresher and less polluted living space brings smiles to our faces.","The programmable timer allows you to set the fan to shut off at intervals of two, four, six or eight hours, granting you the ability to maintain your desired comfort level for a set amount of time. Setting the timer to eight hours as you prepare for sleep will enable you to relax with a gentle breeze while being soothed by the sounds of the tower fan&#39;s white noise.","The included remote control is very convenient and user-friendly. Since it contains the same functions as the unit&#39;s control panel, the remote is very simple to operate. The remote is very intuitive and features a built in flashlight, making nighttime navigation easy. Not having to fumble around looking for the correct buttons in the dark is a welcomed relief.","While the Honeywell HY-041W is a bit loud, it is by no means as loud as many of its competitors. On all but the highest setting, it&#39;s possible to maintain a normal conversation over the noise of the fan. Although the highest setting made it somewhat difficult to engage in normal conversation at close range, it did not interfere with us watching television at a moderate volume level. As previously stated, some may find the breeze mode&#39;s fluctuation in noise levels to be a bit strong."]},"id":"f63eb0d7-08ec-4b66-91e8-83311d27a968","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"75ab6ab4-a8ff-48c4-8c8f-e623b0a00209","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/wcrQmaYGNsASo73kRTq6dA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Honeywell HY-041W is backed by an industry-leading five-year warranty, which should instill plenty of peace of mind in potential buyers.
