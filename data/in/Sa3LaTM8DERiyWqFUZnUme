As I listened to the songs, I evaluated the mix by listening for imbalances in the frequency ranges, distortions common to Bluetooth decompression and other noise. At the same time, I recorded the maximum volume of each song with the phone and stereo&#39;s volume setting at the same level for each device to measure the signal strength.","In the audio clarity test, the TT-BR05 earned a B grade. The difference between B grades and A grades in this test were down to minor distortions common with Bluetooth decompression. The average listener isn&#39;t likely to notice a difference until it&#39;s pointed out, like when something is only slightly asymmetrical.

Unlike the other AUX-in kits and FM transmitters, this kit is battery powered like the visor-style Bluetooth car kits. This provides some value, because it only requires a cord when you&#39;re charging it. However, the downside is a weak signal. Compared to the Anker SoundSync Drive, the audio signal was an average of 7.5-dB quieter when at the same volume level on the stereo. It was 4.8-dB quieter than the <a href=\"/soundbot-review\">SoundBot SB360</a>. This isn&#39;t a major issue though, as it simply means you turn your stereo up more to reach the desired volume; but since this is among the most common complaints for Bluetooth car kits, it&#39;s worth noting.","The call quality received a C grade. The built-in microphone is serviceable, but the noise cancellation is not good. It had a problem with a feedback loop (common with AUX-in Bluetooth car kits). This occurs when the microphone picks up the caller&#39;s voice because as it&#39;s played over the car speakers. Most devices have tried to account for this with echo-cancellation features, but most aren&#39;t nearly as good as advertised. However, hands-free calling is considered distracted driving. Studies have proven hands-free calling isn&#39;t safer than hands-full calling, so I&#39;ve deemphasized this aspect of performance.
