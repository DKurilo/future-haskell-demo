This <a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">ISP</a> has been in business since 2003 and was known as Cebridge Connection until 2006. Like most other cable, DSL or fiber optic companies, Suddenlink has been busy acquiring cable systems from other businesses. This is an ISP to watch as it continues to acquire infrastructure and deliver competitive connection speeds.","Since Suddenlink is mainly available in small towns and niche markets, it does not provide services for the eight random test addresses we used with other ISPs. However, we looked in to what this company offers in rural areas of Northern California to see what kinds of services it offers its customers. Suddenlink&#39;s plans all come with free McAfee Antivirus and 2GB of email space per each of 10 email addresses.","In other areas, such as in Arkansas, Suddenlink offers a high-speed connection with free 24/7 support and ESPN360. In third-party speed tests, Suddenlink consistently rank just below the major players but well above DSL. This internet provider should be able to offer you the speeds you need to stream movies and play online games.","As a high-speed internet provider, Suddenlink offers impressive download speeds. If you live in the right areas, you could see speeds of up to 150 Mbps or even 107 Mbps. Upload speeds are fast too, clocking in at 3 Mbps and 5 Mbps. If you don&#39;t need that much speed or want a more inexpensive option, you can still get 15 Mbps and 30 Mbps for reasonable prices.","Suddenlink has TV apps and a website called Suddenlink2GO to connect you to your favorite TV shows, and it comes free with a high-speed internet subscription. Suddenlink2GO can access TV, movies and other types of video content from any computer across the U.S. This video service has featured networks such as National Geographic Wild, HBO, NBC, PBS and CNN. Full movies include everything from older titles, such as &#34;The Breakfast Club,&#34; to newer flicks.","In terms of customer service, you can contact Suddenlink by telephone, email or instant chat. You can also search help topics online, browse the company blog or follow it on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The company also provides operating system and hardware specific support, which is helpful. Online, you can find information about running Suddenlink with PCs, Macs and Linux machines, as well as Linksys and Netgear routers. Suddenlink has also added tutorials about setting up your wireless network and creating home groups using Windows 7."]},"id":"be75f5af-e20a-48df-b23d-62c71c396900","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fe1f8a25-caf2-41f8-953c-9a47d15b576c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Suddenlink is beginning to offer some of the convenient features that other large ISPs provide, and we are watching it closely for future upgrades.
