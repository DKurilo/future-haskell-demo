Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.</em>","The Ivation Wireless BBQ thermometer supports two probes so you can simultaneously monitor the temperature of either two cuts of meat, or your food and the grill&#39;s temperature. Its versatility, accuracy and extensive range, for both temperatures and the distance from which you can wander off while your food is cooking, make the Ivation our best value for <a href=\"/best-digital-grill-thermometers\">digital grill thermometers</a>.","This grill thermometer isn&#39;t as fast as other ones, but we had no problems with accuracy when grilling four steaks to various levels of doneness during our testing. The biggest problem we had with this thermometer is that it doesn&#39;t have built-in temperature presets, so we had to manually enter the temperatures that we didn’t want our meat to exceed. For instance, we cooked a rare, medium-rare, medium and medium-well steak at 125, 135, 145 and 155 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively.","The thermometer features a transmitter and separate wireless receiver. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t pair with your smartphone, but you can easily attach the receiver to your belt or slip it in your pocket to monitor temperature changes. It has a wireless range of up to 300 feet, which allows you to move away from the grill while your food is cooking. The receiver refreshes the temperature normally in 10–15 second increments. But if you just want an immediate reading, it takes slightly longer for the display to refresh.","The display for both the receiver and transmitter are illuminated, and the numbers are large and easy to read. Setting alerts and timers takes some work and patience, but some other thermometers are more difficult to set. We found it beneficial to read the instruction manual rather than attempt to figure things out by fiddling around with it.","This thermometer features two distinct modes: thermometer and timer mode. Thermometer mode displays only the temperature for both probes. You can set an alarm for when the thermometer reaches a certain temperature. Also, if you are using the second probe to monitor the temperature of your grill, you can to set it to alert you if the grill&#39;s temperature exceeds your setting and it will also let you know if the grill gets too cold, like if you run out of propane.","For timer mode, the thermometer counts down until time runs out. Ivation allows you to set a count-up timer as well. When your meat reaches a certain temperature or a certain amount of time has passed, the unit loudly beeps. If you would rather have the unit display temperature in degrees Celsius, you toggle a switch so temperature is no longer displayed in degrees Fahrenheit.","Ivation&#39;s digital BBQ thermometer is water-resistant, so you are free to grill even if it&#39;s raining outside. However, the two included six-inch probes are not waterproof and need to be washed by hand with a slightly damp cloth. Ivation includes a one-year warranty for its digital thermometer set. The company offers telephone and email support as well, but we were unable to find a FAQs page online."]},"id":"7c32f3c5-d5ad-447e-bad8-d0b454e9c7c1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60142","url":"/ivation-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-05T16:11:55Z","datePublished":"2014-08-05T16:11:55Z","name":"Ivation Wireless BBQ Thermometer","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":76,"verdict":"The Ivation Wireless BBQ Thermometer not only reads a wide range of temperatures, it has an extensive wireless range, so you can do other things rather than linger around a hot grill.","pros":["This digital grill thermometer has a range of 300 feet, twice as long as several other thermometers."],"cons":["The thermometer doesn&#8217;t have built-in temperature presets."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-30T00:00:00Z","id":"wUvQyEGvbEk8djRw5zfmRQ","meta":{"title":"Ivation Wireless BBQ Thermometer Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Ivation Wireless BBQ Thermometer not only reads a wide range of temperatures, it has an extensive wireless range, so you can do other things rather than linger around a hot grill.
