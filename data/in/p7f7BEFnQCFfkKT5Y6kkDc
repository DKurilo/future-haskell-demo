We compared power and performance, overall design, and compatibility. Value was also a major consideration, and we looked at the features and power you get for each generator’s price.","We also reached out to portable generator users and experts for their advice on what to look for in a good model. Dan Carpenter, who runs <a href=\"https://homesteadlaunch.com/\">Homestead Launch</a>, a prepper planning website, tells us that “In disaster prone areas, generators are the lifeblood to keep basic home functions running when the power is out.”","He emphasized that picking the right one for you requires you to know exactly what you need in terms of wattage. “Most people have no idea how many watts are needed to run basic household appliances, tools, and other electrical components.” Suffice it to say that you need to check the power requirements of your electronics and appliances before you buy a generator.","Carpenter also emphasized the importance of considering how long you anticipate using it. “In most emergency situations, a portable generator will be tasked with running the lights, internet and communications equipment, and refrigerators (intermittently) for 1-2 days. During large storms and more regionally sized disasters, this number can be more like 7-10 days, although this is extremely infrequent.”","We also spoke with David Speer, an electrical engineer, who uses his personal generator frequently for camping as an alternate power source for his trailer. He said the most important buying decision for him was longevity. “When I buy a generator, I’m expecting it to last about 15 years,” and the model he currently owns has lasted 10 years so far. But he cautioned that generators for camping are becoming less of a necessity because camping sites are increasingly providing power supplies themselves “Our use of the portable generator has gone down over the years because when we show up at parks and locations, they’ve put in electricity so we don’t need the generator now, we just plug in.”","<strong>How Much Does a Portable Generator Cost?</strong>","Portable generators are expensive. The cheapest one we reviewed costs $136, but expect prices to vary anywhere from $130 to $2,500 for generators. The average price is around $1,000 – still a serious investment.","<strong>How We Picked the Best</strong>","We researched the features, benefits and shortcomings of more than a dozen portable generators, studying their specifications, run time, fuel type and available outlets. We considered the needs of different types of users. For example, durable, heavy-duty generators with large fuel tanks and high fuel efficiency are great for regular use on job sites. Smaller, lighter, more compact generators are better suited for occasional use on camping or day trips. Models with a full array of outlets that can power common electronics, appliances and more are great backup power supplies for your home in the case of an emergency. We kept all these things in mind when selecting which models to feature.","<strong>Can I Use a Portable Generator in the Rain?</strong>","If your portable generator gets wet, you risk destroying it or worse – hurting someone through electric shock or electrocution. Some portable generators have a GFCI outlet, which automatically shuts the device off if it gets wet. If you think you’ll be working in wet locations, we recommend purchasing a generator that has a GFCI outlet.","While it’s best to avoid using your machine during bad weather, sometimes it can&#39;t be helped. If you must use it on a rainy or snowy day, try to keep your generator dry by placing it on a dry, flat surface and covering it. Some companies even sell generator tents, like this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Champion-Portable-Generator-000-Watt-Generators/dp/B01N7E32XB?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Champion Storm Shield</a>. Just make sure you get one that fits your generator. Many of these tent covers connect to your generator in such a way that they can resist strong winds up to 70 miles per hour, so they&#39;re good for all types of weather.","<strong>What to Look for in a Portable Generator</strong>","Power &amp; Fuel Performance<br/>Every generator has two power ratings: running wattage and surge wattage. The running wattage is the amount of power the generator can handle on a continuous basis, and the surge wattage is the amount it can handle in short bursts, usually about 10 seconds. The latter accounts for the surge created when appliances with electric motors start – their starting power can be two to four times the amount needed to operate.","Most portable generators use gas engines, though some use propane and others both. Propane generators have many advantages over gas generators: propane is cheaper, less toxic, cleaner burning and easily accessible during a power outage. Also, you can store it indefinitely because it doesn&#39;t degrade like gasoline.","Fuel efficiency is critical, especially if fuel becomes difficult to acquire during a natural disaster. The best generators burn less than half a gallon of fuel an hour and have a running time of more than 10 hours with a 50-percent load.","Safety Features<br/>Safety features include things like circuit breakers, grounding methods, never-flat tires and spark arrestors. The most important one is ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protection – a sensor that measures the alternating current going back and forth from the generator. If the returning current diminishes, it could mean the electrical current has found an alternate path to the earth. The GFCI cuts the power if this happens, protecting you from electrocution.","You should also consider the operating noise. Gas generators are combustion engines like the one in your car, and they make noise. A loud generator can cause your neighbors to complain or make it difficult for you to communicate with others while you use the machine.","Control Panel Features<br/>Most generators have four standard household plugs and at least one twist-locking 120/240-volt AC outlet for large appliances or industrial extension cords. The best portable generators have electric ignitions that only require a flip of a switch or a push of a button to start. However, you should make sure the recoil ignition is still available so you can start the generator if the battery dies.","The best generators also feature a voltage selector switch, which allows you to isolate the voltage to whatever you&#39;re using at that moment. They also have readouts for voltage and hours operated, which are like odometers, gauging when you need to have the machine serviced.","Help &amp; Support<br/>The best generators come with a three-year warranty. While most manufacturers don&#39;t sell directly to consumers, you should still be able to receive excellent support. This includes adequate contact information and a service center network so you can get your generator serviced or fixed. You should also look for videos, maintenance tutorials, product manuals and FAQs pages."]},"id":"d3cebb55-e2a0-4664-a006-3fd1a0ca655e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"b925b74d-03b1-4d2a-9fa6-2c438d9e7247","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/generac-review\">Generac GP5500</a>","<a href=\"/suaoki-review\">SUAOKI Portable Power Station</a>","<a href=\"/yamaha-review\">Yamaha EF5500DE</a>","<a href=\"/westinghouse-review\">Westinghouse WGen2000</a>","<a href=\"/pulsar-review\">Pulsar PG7000W</a>","<a href=\"/champion-power-equipment-review\">Champion Power 75531i</a>","<a href=\"/wen-review\">WEN PowerPro 56101</a>","<a href=\"/generac-gp2200i-review\">Generac GP2200I</a>","<a href=\"/wen-56200i-review\"> WEN 56200i</a>","<a href=\"/honda-review\">Honda EM6500S</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"366ecf9e-2f16-48ce-a904-d4b56bc9ec5f","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_221","url":"/best-portable-generators","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
