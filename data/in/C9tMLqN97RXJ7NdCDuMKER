The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">Floor Standing Speakers</a> here.</em>","The Fluance XL7F floor standing speakers are three-way speakers with four total drivers. There is an 8-inch, down-firing woofer located at the bottom of the speaker enclosure, two 6-inch midrange drivers and a 1-inch tweeter between the two midrange drivers. This is the only speaker we reviewed that features a down-firing woofer.","We like the fact that the down-firing woofer is 8-inches. Larger woofers tend to accentuate bass better than smaller drivers, and this was the case in our listening test. As we listened to a song that is heavily driven by low thumping, prominent bass tones, we noticed that the down-firing woofer was helping the bass travel. The bass was a little boomier than other speakers we listened to, but the bass was powerful and prominent. These tower speakers eliminate the need for an additional subwoofer.","These Fluance speakers produced natural-sounding music. While listening to classical music, there wasn&#39;t any overemphasis of specific frequency ranges, and the speakers maintained tonality and sharpness even during high, fluttery piano music. These speakers are among the few that keep their composure during quick high tones.","Beyond our listening tests, we also ran frequency analysis tests on all of the speakers to see how accurately each speaker produced low, midrange and high frequency tones. In our tests, the XL7F struggled to accurately produce midrange frequencies. This is mostly likely due to the 3,500Hz crossover point, which is the point where the midrange sends the audio duties to the tweeter. Unfortunately, 3,500Hz is right in the middle of midrange frequencies. The best speakers we reviewed have a crossover point at or above","On the back of the speaker you will find dual five-way, gold-plated binding posts. These dual posts give you the option to bi-amp the speakers. You can do this to separately power individual drivers if you please. This helps squeeze every bit of sound quality out of your speakers, but only true audiophiles find the need to do this. It is nice that these tower speakers give you the option.","These home stereo speakers have a great finish. Both the dark walnut and mahogany finishes are aesthetically pleasing. We received the mahogany finish in for testing and it simply looks great, especially when you remove the protective cover from the enclosure.","One major benefit of going with these Fluance tower speakers is the lifetime warranty. It feels good to know that if anything goes wrong with your speakers, you are covered. Fluance is the only speaker company we reviewed that offers this kind of warranty."]},"id":"44732641-7bc8-4658-ad07-dfd433a0cca7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ed2402a6-aa6b-431c-bf55-0d49f4f0d875","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The powerful Fluance XL7F home floor speakers have a large down-firing 8-inch driver to enhance low frequencies.
