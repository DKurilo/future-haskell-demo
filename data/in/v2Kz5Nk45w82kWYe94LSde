tracking industry, it&#39;s difficult to stand out. Polar&#39;s Loop 2 attempts to draw attention to itself with an interesting design and promises of improving your exercise habits. Of course, most <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness trackers</a> make similar promises. We found the Loop 2 to be an accurate fitness tracker that suffers from some issues. For example, its progress tracking can be problematic for people who want precise control over their fitness goals.","While the Loop 2 isn&#39;t as accurate as some of the other activity trackers we reviewed, it maintained decent accuracy during our testing. In some areas it did really well. The Loop 2 closely reflected reality in steps recorded and calories burned. However, it wasn&#39;t very good at tracking active minutes. The sleep tracking and distance recording were somewhat accurate but missed the mark sometimes during testing.","The Loop 2 does many things well, but we weren&#39;t particularly impressed with its progress monitoring. Many fitness trackers allow you to set and monitor custom fitness goals. You don&#39;t get that control with the Loop 2. Instead, this activity tracker automatically creates exercise goals for you and lets you decide which level to strive for. It then tells you how much progress you&#39;ve made via a percentage bar. The tracker never tells you exactly what your fitness goals are. For those who need greater control over their fitness goals and planning, the Loop 2&#39;s setup may be counterproductive.","The last thing you want is your fitness tracker dying before you&#39;ve synced the data. Happily, that&#39;s not likely to happen with the Loop 2. Its rechargeable battery can last up to eight days before you need to juice it up again.","This is in part thanks to the lack of a display on the Loop 2. Instead, 85 LEDs are hidden underneath the top layer of silicone. Those LEDs are bright enough to shine through and give you information about your workout. However, it can be difficult to read that information in direct sunlight.","On the fashion side, the Loop 2 is slim and unobtrusive. You won&#39;t make much of a fashion statement with it, but it&#39;s also not going to draw much attention to itself. We found the Loop 2&#39;s clasp to be annoying. You need to cut the band down to size in order for it to fit on your wrist. This involves pulling parts off and reattaching them, which is not ideal.","The Loop 2 has some of the best support options we saw with activity trackers. It ships with a two-year warranty, which is double the industry standard. That gives you plenty of time to notice any factory defects. In addition to email and phone support, you can contact Polar&#39;s support team via live chat on its website."]},"id":"6031efe7-aa8c-4172-a82b-16feba2c9ddf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c4c919ab-bbe0-4e0f-becf-41a335d33af1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Polar&#39;s Loop 2 is a decent activity tracker.
