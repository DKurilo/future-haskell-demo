The PlayStation 4 Pro offers premium processing power and 4K gaming and video streaming. Along with an extensive game library with current and vintage titles and a newly updated controller, the PS4 Pro is an especially powerful video game console for serious gamers who also enjoy streaming media.","The PS4’s chassis is stylized plastic with an all-matte exterior. Measuring 2.17 x 11.6 x 12.9 inches (HWD), it should fit into most entertainment centers without any trouble. For serious gamers, processing power and other hardware specs matter, which is why the PlayStation 4 Pro is a heavy-hitter in comparison to its standard and Slim counterparts. The system is built to compete with gaming PCs, and the 2.1GHz eight-core AMD Jaguar CPU and 4.2 TFLOP AMD Radeon-based graphics card do just that. The processor is paired with 8GB of GDDR5 RAM. Compared side-by-side with the Xbox One, most on-screen details look the same, but the PS4 has more consistent output at 1080p and better frame rates.","The PS4 comes standard with a 1TB hard drive, while the <a href=\"/xbox-one-s-review\">Xbox One S</a> offers built-in storage options ranging from 500GB up to 2TB. However, despite the lack of storage options, the PlayStation 4 Pro does support hard drive upgrades, so you can opt for a 2TB storage upgrade. Additionally, PS4 consoles make it easy to plug in external storage.","With its built-in Blu-ray drive and online network, the gaming console is a great choice for a centralized entertainment center in your home. In addition to DVD and Blu-ray playback, the Pro allows you to download apps for media streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, HBO GO, Amazon Video, Plex and others including a variety of sports apps. You can also rent or buy videos through PlayStation Network, also known as PSN. Sony also gives TV lovers two options. You can connect directly to your cable or HDTV antenna for live TV viewing, or opt for Sony’s bundled media package, called PS Vue, which, for an extra monthly subscription fee, gives you access to tons of channels like ESPN, Food Network, AMC, Fox Sports, USA and Comedy Central.","The PlayStation Network is Sony’s online platform for downloading games, demos and media. It not only allows you to play games and talk with your friends online, but also provides access to various online services. To access the PSN, you must pay the subscription fee either monthly or annually. It also gives you access to an ever-changing lineup of free games each month, as well as members-only discounts and game sales.","Over 200 physical video games have been released for the PS4 console series, including entries from well-known games including Overwatch, Battlefield, Grand Theft Auto and FIFA Soccer. Additionally, you’ll have access to exclusive PlayStation titles like Uncharted and Driveclub. Through the PlayStation Network you have access to more than 500 titles in the PS4 game library. These titles include new releases, indie titles and re-releases from past consoles.","The included DualShock 4 controller connects to Bluetooth and charges via micro-USB. A glowing light bar along the front of the controller helps you tell which controller is player one, player two and so forth, and even provides atmospheric lighting in some games. You can buy the DualShock 4 in a variety of standard and special-edition colors or customize yours through a third-party company for an extra cost.","The controller still has its traditional dual analog sticks, four directional buttons, four action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, square), two bumpers and two triggers. Updated from its previous version, it now boasts new features like a capacitive touch pad, built-in speaker and 3.5 mm audio jack. Also, a dedicated share button lets you easily capture and share in-game screenshots to share on PSN, social media sites and even Twitch.tv.","The Sony PlayStation 4 Pro gives you powerful gaming capabilities, massive multimedia options, and lots of game titles and accessories to choose from. Whether you’re a hardcore gamer or simply want to stay connected to your gamer friends and favorite TV shows, the PS4 Pro is an easy choice for a central home entertainment hub."]},"id":"8ee31f15-e6c5-4a11-bbd2-edd237abcd0f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69277","url":"/playstation-4-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-01T15:22:33Z","datePublished":"2017-05-01T15:22:33Z","name":"PlayStation 4 Pro","synopsis":"Of the major gaming consoles on the market right now, the Sony PlayStation 4 series is great for all types of gamers.
