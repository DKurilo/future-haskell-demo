It works well to heat a room while also having the ability to simulate flames without heat. The multiple convenience and safety features make it one of the best fireplaces for your home.","This fireplace has a 5,000 Btu output and works best to heat a 400-square-foot room. Like most other <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">powerful fireplaces</a>, it uses 1,500 watts to operate. If you are willing to pay more, you can also choose to get this exact style fireplace with infrared heating. This isn’t simply a fireplace – it’s a mantel as well. The front of the mantel is elegantly decorated but the backside is uncovered, so it’s best to keep the back hidden from view.","It comes with a remote control, which allows you to control the thermostat and adjust flame settings and heat settings independently. The thermostat ranges between 62 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit and can be adjusted in 4-degree intervals. Once you select a temperature, the heater will work to maintain it. You can also use the buttons on the top right of the fireplace insert to adjust temperature and flame settings. The firebox insert is 23 inches wide and 20 inches tall.","Should the unit overheat, it will automatically shut off and allow the fireplace insert to cool and then start up again once the coils have reached a safe temperature. The glass and mantel remain cool to the touch so you can feel better about having children and pets in the room. It also comes with a child safety lock that you can activate using the remote control. The cord is 6 feet long, and since it comes out from behind the mantel, it won&#39;t be as distracting as it is for some other electric fireplaces. If you&#39;d prefer a fireplace that comes with storage space, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/walker-edison-review\">Walker Edison Jackson</a>.","The mantel of the Southern Enterprises fireplace comes in espresso or ivory, so it can match a variety of décor styles. The unit weighs 110 pounds when fully assembled and can hold up to 85 pounds on the mantel, which is strong enough for a flat screen TV. It is 44.5 inches wide, 14.5 inches deep and 40.25 inches tall, so it can typically hold up to 42.5-inch TVs.","You will need to assemble this unit when it arrives, but the process is relatively simple and shouldn&#39;t take very long. Southern Enterprises covers this electric fireplace with a one-year warranty. If you have questions for the company, it’s easy to reach support staff via phone and email."]},"id":"1ffecd5c-9de2-4e87-8016-0c907ab16e1a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59387","url":"/southern-enterprises-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-18T16:05:18Z","datePublished":"2014-04-18T16:05:18Z","name":"Southern Enterprises Calvert","synopsis":"The Southern Enterprises Calvert electric fireplace is perfect for a living room, media room or bedroom since it can be a standalone piece of furniture or a TV stand.
