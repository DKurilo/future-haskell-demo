This makes security a sizable concern â€“ if you don&#39;t use a trustworthy driver finder, you risk malware finding its way onto your computer. The aptly named DriverUpdate managed to find a decent number of outdated drivers in our test scans, but we don&#39;t trust it enough to install it on our home computers. Not only does its installer bundle unwanted software, but its developer doesn&#39;t reveal the sources for the drivers it provides.","During our extensive testing of every driver checker on the market, we ran DriverUpdate on a computer with 36 known outdated drivers. Of those 36, the DriverUpdate found just 19. It managed to spot needed updates for the PC&#39;s video card, Ethernet controller and motherboard drivers, but it missed many others, including the audio controller and every single peripheral device that was or had previously been connected to the system. The best driver software will find the widest range of important drivers on a computer; with an identification rate of just over 50 percent, DriverUpdate is a lackluster performer at best.","While its scan was average, DriverUpdate offers a solid feature set. Along with the free scan that all the best driver updaters provide, it sports one-click downloads and installation. Its scheduler lets you set periodic, automatic system scans for new driver updates, while its backup tool should be used every time you download an update, lest something go wrong during installation and you need to roll back your setup.","The deciding factor that swayed us away from DriverUpdate was its poor stance on security. The program&#39;s developer, SlimWare, doesn&#39;t guarantee  original equipment manufacturer sources for all its files. Drivers made by the OEMs are never infested with malware, so they can be safely installed. Some third-party developers, however, will make drivers and package them with unwanted extras. The best driver update software only uses OEM drivers, but without such a guarantee, there&#39;s no way to know whether DriverUpdate&#39;s recommendations are safe.","The bundled software DriverUpdate includes in its installer compounded our security concerns. Not only is the SlimWare download page plagued by pop-up advertisements, but when you install the program, it will try to install a series of AVG browser add-ons. AVG is a popular anti-virus provider, but its add-ons are unnecessary, annoying and can be difficult to remove."]},"id":"49a3aeed-b3ef-47e4-8009-5d3634bfdaf4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"86854c59-93dd-4bfc-809b-6752b3f5fb60","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["DriverUpdate is an adequate, if unimpressive, entry in the driver finder market.
