Anyone can learn to use this software, regardless of their skill level, and the end results look and sound fantastic. It has everything you need to make high-quality videos, but leaves out some of the advanced features we look for in this category.","The main window of the interface provides complete control over your video project. You can edit your project on a timeline. You can have a total of 100 video and 100 audio editing tracks. This is more than enough for any project. This is a great move forward for Filmora, since previous versions of the software only offered a single editing track.","Another change for the latest release of the software is that Filmora has removed its storyboard mode. It is an odd omission since storyboard mode is a great place to make quick projects. It’s absence makes the software feel diminished.","Despite that, anyone should be able to learn to use Wondershare Filmora. Its interface and workflow are among the easiest to grasp of all the video editing programs we reviewed. All the tools and features, like adding text and transitions, applying filters, and exporting, are accessible from the main window of the interface. You can learn to navigate Filmora in just a few minutes – whereas other programs can take hours.","Tools such as the chroma-key (green-screen), are accessed simply by double clicking on the clip when you’ve put it on your timeline. You also get some very simple-to-use color correction tool. It’s functional, but the filters it provides are more useful at getting the shade you want.","When you’re done creating your project in Filmora, you have a number of options to get it out into the world. When you export, you can create a simple video file and optimize it for playback on specific devices like smartphones, tablets and gaming systems. You also have the option to upload your project directly to video sharing sites like YouTube, Facebook and Vimeo, which is a great time saver for regularly posting your videos to social media. It also provides the option to burn your project to a DVD.","Because this software is geared toward the casual user, it lacks several of the tools we look for in the best video editing software. For example, you cannot create closed captions for the hearing impaired, import and edit 360-degree video, track moving objects or configure your audio for surround sound. While you can create DVDs with this software, you cannot add a menu to your disc. Our top pick, <a href=\"/powerdirector-review\">CyberLink PowerDirector</a> has all these abilities.","One of the things this software lacks is an action cam module, which Filmora used to have before recent updates. Although you can still import the footage and perform add effects like fisheye correction, manipulate speed, freeze frame and stabilize shaky footage, the lack of a dedicated module for this type of footage is a let down.","If you’re just starting out with video editing, or just want a simple program that works, Wondershare Filmora might be what you’re looking for. It has the essential tools, and anyone can learn to use it easily. However, if you want more advanced tools for more complex projects, you should look at the video editing programs that are designed for more experienced editors."]},"id":"32558653-affc-4b6c-b503-2a1c68323263","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63962","url":"/wondershare-video-editor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
