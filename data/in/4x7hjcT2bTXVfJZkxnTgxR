PaaS products offer a stable web-based platform that is entirely independent of on-site computing hardware, making the app creation process less complex and more affordable than it is on alternative platforms. This means you can save a great deal in software and app development efforts by taking advantages of these more budget-friendly online options.","A PaaS is an application platform that covers certain administrative details so you can focus on your customers and on developing your apps. This is why a PaaS is convenient for those who do not want to deal with more complex parts of the app development system, such as setting up servers, installing frameworks and configuring testing tools. Three of the top PaaS systems that help in these areas are <a href=\"/services/web-hosting/best-paas/oracle-review/\">Oracle Cloud</a>, <a href=\"/services/web-hosting/best-paas/windows-review/\">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href=\"/services/web-hosting/best-paas/amazon-review/\">Amazon Web Services</a>.","<strong>PaaS Software Programs: What to Look For</strong>","With the right PaaS platform in place, you only need to worry about creating code for your next project, meaning it is fast and simple to push your new app to run on the PaaS. However, different companies have different needs for their platforms and different budget restrictions for adopting a new cloud-based platform. There are certain features and capabilities to keep in mind when shopping for one of these programs to ensure it meets your company&#39;s needs.","<strong>Flexibility &amp; Scalability</strong><br/>Flexibility and scalability are two of the most important aspects to consider when it comes to buying a PaaS platform. Look for a polyglot program, or one that supports several programming languages and frameworks, allowing flexibility in your coding language.","These platforms also need to be flexible when it comes to hosting environments or be polyhost platforms. This means they can handle hosting environments such as public or private clouds, so you can move your application as needed to keep up with privacy issues, heightened demand or potential cloud outages. This type of flexibility also allows the PaaS platform to be more scalable and to grow with the demands of your company and your new application.","<strong>Data Storage</strong><br/>Consider your data storage needs when considering a new PaaS solution. Some basic PaaS platforms still only allow you to choose between relational databases or custom file-based storage databases. More advanced solutions not only offer these solutions, but also other NoSQL options and varying levels of data storage capabilities, to fit the needs of both large and small applications. Keep in mind that the amount of data storage will likely impact overall cost.","<strong>Application Integration </strong><br/>PaaS vendors should support developer tools and provide integration with commonly used applications such as programming platforms. The ability to integrate with programs like Visual Studio can help expedite the uploading and code-managing process. A PaaS that works with existing programming and code management tools not only makes the creation process quicker, but it can reduce the amount of errors. Consider integration capabilities with all types of applications, including database management tools and storage services, to ensure a seamless fit with your existing processes.","PaaS programs vary when it comes to these different features, just as they vary in price. However, when it comes to finding the right program, it is essential that it not only makes sense financially for your business, but that the program can support your company&#39;s development needs both today and over the long term."]},"id":"9911059c-f54b-49a2-921b-a225d45e1d24","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"7f5e1ab9-f5a3-412e-81ac-790e8e6d6eb5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a>","<a href=\"https://www.appfog.com/product/\">AppFog</a>","<a href=\"https://www.engineyard.com/pricing\">Engine Yard</a>","<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine\">Google App Engine</a>","<a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/pricing\">Heroku</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/\">IBM Bluemix</a>","<a href=\"http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/\">Microsoft Azure</a>","<a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/paas.html\">Oracle Cloud</a>","<a href=\"https://www.openshift.com/products/pricing\">Red Hat OpenShift</a>","<a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/ap/platform/overview/\">Salesforce Platform</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0840c589-4bd6-4de0-a6a6-6146d2f4e0d1","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1704","url":"/best-paas","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-20T16:13:56Z","datePublished":"2015-09-21T22:53:54Z","name":"PaaS Review","synopsis":"PaaS programs can give companies the app development help they need.
