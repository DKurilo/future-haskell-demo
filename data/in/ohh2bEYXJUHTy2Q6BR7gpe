Naturally, there is a Pavilion for the multimedia computer geek. Enter the HP Pavilion Elite M904n.","The HP Pavilion Elite M904n packs a lot of muscle. Featured is a quad core chipset, in a slimmer profile than earlier designs. Since this is a multimedia computer, you would expect it to have a large hard drive. It has two 320 GB drives, enough for just about anything you can throw at it. The Nvidia GeForce 8400 GS graphics card renders images and video effortlessly. Windows Vista is a nice touch, since it comes with the ability to use the machine as a PVR, essentially turning your PC into a Tivo.","The overall performance and features included with the machine impressed expert reviewers. The gloss black exterior was also well like among the reviewers. The inclusion of both an HDMI and DVI outputs were also well received, making it extremely easy to connect it to that new HDTV sitting in your living room. Of course the consumers liked this feature as well. Consumers also appreciated the ample storage capacity provided by the 2 320 GB hard drives.","The HP Pavilion Elite M904 is a solid choice for those looking for a great multimedia PC at a great price."]},"id":"cdb83999-a539-4c92-a513-ad576d0c4cae","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_21860","url":"/hewlett-packard-gn553aaaba-19247-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-07-16T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-07-16T06:00:00Z","name":"Hp Pavilion Elite M9040n GN553AA#ABA","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":61,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-07-16T21:46:13Z","id":"ohh2bEYXJUHTy2Q6BR7gpe","meta":{"title":"Hp Pavilion Elite M9040n GN553AA#ABA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
