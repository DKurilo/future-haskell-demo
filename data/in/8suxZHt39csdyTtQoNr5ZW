It can get frustrating at the best of times, but it&#39;s even worse when we&#39;re calling about a support problem.","Being put on hold is part of modern life. In fact, a 2013 poll published in <em>PR Newswire</em> showed that 80 percent of callers are put on hold every time they call a company. On average, we spend 10 to 20 minutes a week on hold. People expect to be put on hold, but what you do for them in that time can score points for your company. Fortunately, many phone services, especially <a href=\"/best-small-business-phone-systems\">business VoIP services,</a> give you flexibility in how you handle on-hold customers.","First off, don&#39;t apologize. Studies show that these kind of apologies actually increase customer frustration, and a recorded apology is even worse because it is impersonal. &#34;We are receiving a high volume of calls&#34; is another message that doesn&#39;t always have the effect it intends. Unless it&#39;s rare for your company to put someone on hold, this message could make people think you are understaffed; on a support line, you give the impression that people are always calling with problems. Finally, nix the message, &#34;Your call is very important to us.&#34; How easy is that to believe from a machine that doesn&#39;t know if you are a customer, a telemarketer or a wrong number? As well intentioned as these messages are, they send the wrong signal to the savvy caller of today.","So, what can you do to keep your customers patiently waiting until you can get to them?"]},"id":"450df7a1-943e-462f-aef3-8524acbb326c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Offer Choices. </strong>Many phone services have on-hold features that announce wait times and offer your caller to opt out of on-hold music.

A bank, for example, could share some facts about the first banks in the United States, how dollar bills are made or how interest rates are determined. Consider providing some useful information. A doctor&#39;s office might give some tips on dealing with a sprain or a fever. A mechanic might give advice on winter driving. If you do this, try not to use information that&#39;s common knowledge.
