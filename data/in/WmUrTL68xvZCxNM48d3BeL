Numerous studies available show children who play an instrument, score higher on both standard and spatial cognitive development tests alike. There are also findings that show kids who play piano, in particular, scored higher in math, especially on problems dealing with ratios and fractions.","In one particular study conducted by Dr. Frances Rauscher (a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh) and Gordon Shaw (a physicist at of the University of California at Irvine) tested preschoolers who received piano instruction. They found that preschoolers who received piano lessons scored 34% higher than their nonmusical counterparts in tests measuring spatial-temporal reasoning, which is the brain function used to understand math, science and engineering."]},"id":"0a62a5a1-e851-40ad-94b1-7046f792f5a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"2.

Kids who play the piano have improved fine motor skills and, unlike other instruments, the piano requires both hands to work independently of each other, one moving fast while the other may be moving at a slower rate.

In addition, the skills and knowledge they learn in piano may help them easily pick up another musical instrument later.","So, as I sit and listen to my little one, pounding painfully away on the black and whites, all I have to do is remember that as she continues to practice, she&#39;ll be creating a great deal more than a few simple melodies, which is truly music to my ears.","Find the best <a href=\"/best-learn-piano-online\">piano lesson software</a> for your kids (or yourself) with our comparative reviews.
