There is a video tutorial available on the Safety 1st website if you need to watch a demonstration.

In that time, we have evaluated dozens of baby car seats. While we were aren’t equipped to test baby car seats for safety, we used a number of the car seats in our reviews over a period of weeks and carefully evaluated their convenience features. We only reviewed car seats that have been through rigorous safety tests. We read dozens of online reviews and consulted with professionals and experts to narrow our focus to the most important features. Our findings are detailed in our baby car seat reviews.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","While we didn&#39;t conduct crash testing ourselves, we chose to only evaluate products whose manufacturers had thoroughly tested each device for safety. Since being a parent is a full-time job, we wanted to find products with convenience features to make your life a little easier. We looked at user reviews, safety certifications and convenience features to compare the products in adjustability, durability, ease of use and overall safety.","We also evaluated products based on price. Less expensive car seats scored extra points, but to rank among the best they must have all the safety features combined with essential convenience features. Products with longer warranties also scored higher.","Safety<br/>We chose to evaluate only car seats that had undergone thorough crash testing and were certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Keep in mind that the NHTSA does not require manufacturers to publish crash test results. We looked for rear-facing car seats that had high weight and height limits to accommodate growing children. Car seats that could account for larger babies scored higher. We also awarded more points to car seats that could convert to face forward when your child is old enough.","Adjustability<br/>We looked for center-pull adjustments, since you can typically tighten these safety restraints with one hand. We gave more points to car seats with adjustable handles and moveable canopy shields, as these allow you to use the car seat and move your baby around easier.","Durability<br/>We wanted to make sure that the car seats in our comparison would stand the test of time. The only time your car seat will be fully put to the test is if there is a crash, but there are certain features that can add to its durability. We only chose car seats that offered side-impact protection, LATCH connectors and energy-absorbent foam, as these features raised the durability of a carrier. The length of a car seat&#39;s warranty can often portray the confidence the manufacturer places in the product. For that reason, we gave more points to car seats with longer warranties.","Ease of Use &amp; Convenience<br/>In our assessment, we considered how easy it was to install and remove the device. We gave more points to car seats that included stay-in-car bases as these helped save time. For these same reasons, we scored a device higher if it had an adjustable carrying handle, could be used on a variety of strollers, came with machine-washable cushions and could be installed without the base.","<strong>How Much Should I Spend on a Baby Car Seat? </strong>","Price is an important factor, but when it comes to baby car seats, safety is always first. The more expensive car seats in our comparison are between $200 and $350, but they have innovative and safe design features that make it easy to properly install in your car. The more cost-effective models in our guide range from $100 to $200 and are certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), but are missing some convenience features like a stay-in-car base and machine washable cushions and canopy.","<strong>Should I Install a Used Car Seat?</strong>","It’s expensive to raise children, and many parents are happy to accept hand-me-downs or get bargains at garage sales. Baby and child car seats can carry a hefty price tag; however, many law enforcement, consumer and medical organizations discourage using a second-hand car seat because it might not provide the protection your little one needs. On its <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/car-seat-safety/art-20043939\">website</a>, the Mayo Clinic’s staff recommends you check for these things before installing a used car seat:"]},"id":"1ae8da79-087c-4ddb-8cfe-0aedc5579ec9","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Comes with instructions and a label showing the manufacture date and model number","Hasn&#39;t been recalled","Isn&#39;t expired or more than six years old","Has no visible damage or missing parts","Has never been in a moderate or severe crash"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0d6bcdc7-ef4c-478e-a42c-b016afdce02a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["“If you don’t know the history of the car seat, don’t use it,” the Mayo Clinic advises.","An <a href=\"https://thecarseatlady.com/used/\">article</a> on The Car Seat Lady blog states that many seat manufacturers recommend that any child car seat that has been involved in an accident – even if a child wasn’t in it at the time – should be discarded because it could have been harmed by the force of the crash. Some manufacturers say it’s ok to use a seat if it has been in a minor accident, and the blog recommends you check the owner’s manual to see if it’s safe to use.","Although an expiration date might sound unusual for a car seat, they exist for a reason – primarily because these seats are made of plastic, according to The Car Seat Lady. “Plastic becomes brittle and weak as it ages – two qualities you don’t want in a car seat that has to withstand severe crash forces.”","Sometimes you’ll see car seats with different expiration dates, and a longer-lasting seat may be made of different plastic than one with a shorter life. The longer-lasting seat may also have some steel reinforcement, the blog says.","<strong>Other Things to Consider with Baby Car Seats</strong>","The most important part of any car seat is its safety features. While all baby car seats in the United States must pass federal crash tests, the companies are not required to publish the results. Adjustable five-point harnesses are the most secure restraints on the market. They help secure shoulders, chests, hips and groin from dangerous movement and can be tightened or loosened to fit your baby. A car seat made of energy-absorbent foam and engineered with side-impact protection will keep your baby safer in case of an accident.","Look for a car seat that will fit you and your child&#39;s needs. Weight and height limits vary from product to product, so you should find one that best fits your baby. Many car seats are compatible with a few different stroller types, so choose a carrier that attaches to a stroller that fits your needs and budget. If you travel a lot, look for a baby car seat that is airplane compliant.","To make your life easier, consider finding a car seat that has removable and machine washable cushions – because, let&#39;s face it, babies can be pretty messy. Having a stay-in-car base can make it easier for you to insert and remove the carrier whenever you use your car. Additionally, some carriers can be installed without the base, which makes it easier for you to transfer the car seat between cars.","Look for a carrier that comes with a canopy to shield your baby from bright lights and the elements. Infants have weak neck muscles and will need plenty of support to keep them safe and comfortable; look for adjustable head supports to accommodate them. A typical car seat warranty lasts about one year and covers replacements and repairs for defective seats within the warranty time.
