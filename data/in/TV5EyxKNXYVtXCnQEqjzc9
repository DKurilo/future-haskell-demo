Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/electronics/photo-video/best-hd-camcorders/\">HD Camcorder Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","JVC has a variety of different high definition camcorders in their Everio line. The GZ-EX250 is a great example of a full HD camcorder with excellent video quality as well as user-friendly features. This camcorder also has a lightweight  design, and JVC’s customer service is one of the most helpful support teams to deal with.","The Everio GZ-EX250 shoots video at 1080p resolution, which is considered full HD. It will also record at 60 frames per second (FPS), a very high frame rate in this category. Because the camera captures more frames per second, the video playback quality will be smooth, and video you play back in slow motion will not jumpy. This HD video camera also has a 40x optical zoom, one of the highest optical zooms we found in our review of the best HD video recorders. A high optical zoom is more desirable than a high digital zoom because with an optical zoom the lens actually moves toward your subject and video quality will not be degraded. On the other hand, digital zoom simply crops an image and magnifies it,. A little digital zoom is nice; however, too much digital zoom will compromise video quality.","This camcorder has a couple of features that you will find very useful. First off, the integrated Wi-Fi on this HD camcorder is a convenient function that makes sharing video with friends and family very easy. Instead of hooking the camcorder to a computer, you can upload your videos to the internet wirelessly. On top of that, you can download JVC’s app and have your video camera stream video live to your iPhone, iPad or Android device.","This full HD camcorder is lightweight, weighing in at about half a pound. It is portable and easy to use, so the Everio GZ-EX250 easy to carry around with you. If you need assistance with your camcorder, you can contact JVC’s helpful customer support team  via email or telephone. There is not a live chat option, but the email and phone options are incredibly helpful, and that makes up for that one missing element."]},"id":"f8ab2734-f59c-4c48-b68a-1e352079b836","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1436de09-961e-4f23-8520-a8dd66e43b58","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It’s not hard to see why the JVC Everio line is one of the more popular HD camcorder series.
