The modular cooktop options range from a non-stick griddle for perfect pancakes and grilled cheese to a grill for steak and kabobs. Or you can choose a matching sealed burner set. Each of these modules fit snuggly onto the left side of the cooktop for a wide range of dinner options.","The two included gas burners offer multiple temperature settings for a powerful rolling boil or a gentle, steady simmer for delicate foods. The three-speed fan runs the downdraft exhaust to absorb smoke, steam and most importantly, any gas fumes that may be harmful to you or your family. The sealed burners keep spillovers contained and prevent them from leaking into the cooktop and interfering with the flame quality. The contained spill area makes cleaning as simple as wiping down the stainless steel surface with a damp paper towel. The removable, dishwasher-safe knobs and grate mean you don&#39;t have to clean every inch of the cooktop yourself. You can remove the grease filters as well to avoid grease fires and clogs."]},"id":"02618a03-d5bb-4c99-9b30-460be2e4c1a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/UHNSUuv23nMvpUUALEEQm7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Unfortunately, the modular pieces do not come included with the rest of this powerful gas cooktop.
