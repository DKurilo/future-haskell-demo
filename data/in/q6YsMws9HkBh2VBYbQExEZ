Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Whether you are looking for an office printer or a printer with multifunctional tools, the HP Color LaserJet CM2320nf has an assortment of features that may fit your needs. This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> can print, scan, fax and copy. It features a monthly duty cycle of 40,000 pages, decent speeds and a large paper tray. Although with the addition of multifunctional tools, this printer is a hefty and heavy device.","The HP CM2320nf features a 40,000-page monthly duty cycle. This allows you to print up to 40,000 pages a month without causing your printer to overheat or causing any technical damage to the device. It also has a maximum printing resolution of 600 x 600dpi (dots per inch). The images produced are clear, crisp and sharp; however, they aren’t as vibrant as they could be with a higher resolution.","This laser printer offers adequate printing speeds. You can print black and white and color images at a speed of 21 pages per minute. This is not the fastest speed you will find on a laser printer but is similar to what you will find on a basic printing device. And unfortunately, there are no automatic duplex printing capabilities on this printer. This feature would allow you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper without having to turn the sheet of paper over manually.","The HP CM2320nf offers multifunctional tools that make it the ideal office companion. You can do it all with its scanning, faxing, printing and copying abilities. There is a 250-sheet paper tray, which eliminates the hassle of restocking paper on a constant basis. And this laser printer will print on a variety of devices, such as heavy or glossy paper, transparencies, labels or envelopes. It will print on material up to 8.5 x 14 inches.","There are no wireless printing capabilities on the CM2320nf but there is Ethernet connectivity to enhance networking to this laser printer. There is also a USB 2.0 port for additional connectivity or for printing directly from a flash drive or even a camera. There is 160MB of installed memory and a one-year warranty included on this device. This laser printer consumes 460 watts during use and, unfortunately, it is not an ENERGY STAR qualified device.","The size of the CM2320nf is large and bulky. It is too large to sit upon your desk without it consuming an abundant amount of space. It is 19.6 inches wide, 19.4 inches thick and it stands at 21.7 inches tall. It weighs 59.3 pounds, making it a hard device to move, especially from one area to another. There is a 2.4-inch display screen on the device, along with a large control panel. The LCD display screen is a nice addition and helps you to control the printer’s features easier, but the large control pad can be confusing and overwhelming to use."]},"id":"6e499ff7-f3bd-4a21-9dbe-ec4111cabce3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"82c45b6b-aac2-4120-adc1-e01f66b4bf71","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP CM2320nf is a multifunctional laser printer that offers several tools.
