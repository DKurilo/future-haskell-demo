This means you can vent air to a traditional outlet, which is generally associated with more efficient drying, or have moist air go through a condensing process with no need for venting of any kind. That is a nice advantage that makes this machine more versatile than others for fitting into different kinds of space that you have available.","The machine has 14 different washing cycles, which puts it in the same class as the best washers in the category. For drying, you can adjust the time and choose between full heat and half heat. This machine also has only one soil level setting, so you can’t adjust the speed, time or agitation to deep clean heavily-soiled clothing specifically.","The machine costs an estimated $13 a year to operate if you use an electric water heater. That&#39;s above average when compared to other machines, so that&#39;s disappointing, especially considering its relatively small capacity, which should leave to energy savings. With its small drum – offering just 1.6 cubic feet – you are probably going to have to do more loads than you would with a larger machine, too, so that will mean even more energy use. If you prefer a machine with more capacity, check out the <a href=\"/lg-review\">LG WM3997HWA</a>.","This one comes in above average for price. Like the price, the warranty is not great. It just has basic coverage of one year on everything.","The dimensions are nice and compact with this unit. There was only one machine that was slightly smaller in our comparison. This one will fit in even the smallest space and work well whether that space has a vent or not."]},"id":"23d187dc-eecc-4b59-a867-ecb369ee9ecc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0f8475b3-37aa-45d4-b0b1-00a50f3c0d7d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This one is not as energy efficient as it should be, especially considering how small the capacity is.
