Although it&#39;s not our top choice when it comes to ways to protect your iPhone screen, it will still keep it from scratching in fairly calm conditions.","Halo didn&#39;t disclose information on how hard or thick its iPhone screen protector material is. However, it&#39;s obviously not very hard or thick. The Halo iPhone screen protector for iPhone 6, 5, and 4 models will protect your phone from key scratches, but the cover will not come away unscathed. It obviously shows key scratches. Halo screen protectors seem to wear out quickly as well.","While you can&#39;t just slap a Halo iPhone 6 screen protector on your phone, it&#39;s not too difficult to apply. This screen protector goes on without water or other liquid on the screen. The side of the screen protector that sticks to the iPhone screen doesn&#39;t have much adhesive on it. As you apply it, you can work out air bubbles so that the finished product is smooth.","Fortunately, Halo produces an iPhone 6, iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 screen protector with an anti-glare matte finish as well as a clear film, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. There isn&#39;t a privacy-filter option, however, and the screen protectors aren&#39;t especially oil resistant. You will find yourself wiping down your iPhone&#39;s screen more frequently with a Halo protector than you would with most other brands.","Halo iPhone screen protectors come with a 14-day money-back guarantee. Customer service is nearly nonexistent for the Halo protectors. The company doesn&#39;t offer phone support or a FAQs section on its website. Representatives are only available via email, and even then, it&#39;s tough to get a timely response. Halo could certainly improve in this area."]},"id":"9182151a-9559-4904-8bce-cde348071df8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ef269d12-9d6a-4672-a386-765e18b6e8dc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For an affordable iPhone screen protector that&#39;s easy to apply, Halo performs acceptably.
