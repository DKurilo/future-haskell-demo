On one hand, you have disgruntled clients and customers writing reviews online. Most of the time, these reviews are based on actual experiences. A customer can walk into a department store and have a horrible experience, motivating them to write a scathing review of the company while telling as many people as they can to avoid the business. These reviews are justifiable, and it&#39;s up to the company to right the wrongs and make sure future customers don&#39;t have a similar encounter.","However, just as easily as a person can post a bad review, anyone can create a blog or even an entire website dedicated to destroying a business&#39;s reputation. Creating content online is simple now and allows people the freedom to publish anything they want. Scarily, if they know what they&#39;re doing, these people can take over the traffic from search results about your company and lead potential customers astray. This is where an online reputation management service comes in.","One of the primary objectives of an <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-online-reputation-management-services/\">online reputation management service</a> is to quell negative search results in favor of positive ones. The positives are often content that the service itself creates for your business or brand, or even you as an individual. They do this by employing SEO practices that tell search engines like Google or Bing that the positive content is much more relevant to the interests of the consumer and contains information that is more accurate. This, unfortunately, also weeds out potentially legitimate complaints that will go unanswered because of these practices.","Therein lies the problematic gray area of online reputation management. When does weeding out defamatory remarks turn into ignoring the complaints of your customers? Most reputation management services recommend that you respond to criticisms as part of your strategy, but these companies also offer you the ability to moderate all incoming reviews and comments on sites you control. It can obviously be tempting to silence the naysayers as they approach your internet doorstep, and doing so will certainly place your business in a more positive light. However, it creates a sense of distrust in your company in the long term. If you think you&#39;re silencing the masses, think again. The internet never forgets.","Ultimately, the ethics of online reputation management services boil down to your own decisions with the company. Check out our reviews of these services to find out which ones offer the most effective and varied resources for managing your reputation on the web. However, know that it&#39;s up to you to decide how far you wish to go. And ultimately, listening to your customers&#39; complaints and responding to them appropriately will be the most effective way to establish happy, long-term relationships.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To.Â "]},"id":"0f0c6ccd-496b-43b6-9a5b-0c1364074dda","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7951","url":"/is-online-reputation-management-ethical","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alex-larrabee","url":"/author/alex-larrabee","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alex Larrabee","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"VVNfSr88Bcs3N44cr2hCA","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-27T20:09:52Z","datePublished":"2013-06-27T20:09:52Z","name":"Is Online Reputation Management Ethical?","synopsis":"There are two sides in the online reputation management discussion creating a muddled gray area of ethics.
