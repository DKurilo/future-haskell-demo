Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP LaserJet Pro CP1025nw is an ideal <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> for your home. This device features a small size, low power consumption and wireless printing capabilities. It doesn’t offer any extensive printing capabilities and isn’t powerful enough to meet the demands of a busy office. This printer’s standout features include duplex printing capabilities, a sturdy but lightweight design and the ability to print on paper up to 8.5 x 14 inches.","The CP1025nw offers a monthly duty cycle of 15,000. This means you can print up to 15,000 pages on your printer without causing any damage to the device. Any duplex printing on this laser printer must be done manually. There is no feature available on the laser printer that will automatically print on both sides of the same sheet of paper for you. The printing speed for black and white documents is excellent, with speeds reaching up to 17 pages per minute. However, the color speed is a huge disappointment and prints at the slow speed of only four pages per minute. This speed makes it difficult to use in an office, and we were surprised by the drastic difference in speed between the black and white and color documents. The CP1025nw also prints with a maximum resolution of 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch).","One of the standout features available on the CP1025nw is its wireless printing capabilities. This printer has built-in Ethernet, along with Wi-Fi connectivity. The wireless connectivity allows you to print anywhere without the need to connect your computer via cables or wires. There is also a USB 2.0 port for additional connectivity using a cable.","You can print on a variety of paper sizes using this laser printer. The HP CP1025nw supports letter, legal and executive paper sizes, along with envelopes. The paper tray on this device can hold up to 150 sheets of paper. This isn’t an extensive amount of paper but provides an adequate amount if the printer is not used for large projects multiple times throughout the day.","The CP1025nw is an ENERGY STAR qualified device. This means the laser printer has met the required specifications proving it offers energy-efficient features. This device also boasts only 295 watts of power consumption during use. This is one of the smallest amounts of power consumption we saw on similar devices.","One of the benefits of using the CP1025nw is the small dimensions and lightweight design this laser printer offers you. This device is only 15.7 inches wide, 9.9 inches tall and 15.8 inches deep. Its small size fits nicely on any desk. It also weighs 26.7 pounds and is easy to move from one area to another. There is no display screen or control panel on the device, but it is still easy to use and doesn’t require any technical expertise to use all the features offered on the device."]},"id":"12db43e2-c339-40ce-b6f5-cb8a215d6c8e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4db12e98-1212-48b3-8bfb-19d3cc251708","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>HP LaserJet Pro CP1025nw</strong> is a laser printer with a small size, low power consumption and well-performing feature set.
