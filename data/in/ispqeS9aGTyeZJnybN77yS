Depending on how you spend your money, you can choose one plan that comes with a monthly fee but has no activation fee. The other plan comes with a setup fee that&#39;s lower than the monthly fee of other prepaid cards. However, there are other fees that can rack up with transactions, ATM withdrawals and balance inquiries (which is often the case with prepaid credit cards).","You can make online and store purchases with your READYdebit card just like any prepaid credit card. You can use your card at a gas station, but READYdebit will place a large dollar amount hold on your funds until the transaction has been approved.","READYdebit&#39;s mobile banking feature allows you to pay your bills and view your balance. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices. Even if you don&#39;t have an iPhone or Android device, you can still receive text alerts, notifying you of your account status. There are several alert options you can choose, including a helpful low-balance notification.","Like their traditional counterparts, prepaid credit cards have their drawbacks and restrictions. READYdebit is no exception, as it requires a minimum and maximum dollar amount that you can load, save and spend on. To load the prepaid card, you have several options at your disposal, including an in-house bank transfer, or you can purchase a Green Dot MoneyPak card (which costs extra). You can also load cash at various retail locations, transfer money directly from your checking or savings account and send money from one READYdebit card to another.","There is a limit on the amount of cash you can load to your card via direct deposit. This limit, though, is  in the thousands of dollars, which makes READYdebit a preferred choice for travelers, as your card is safer to travel with than cash. Added fees apply, though, when using your card overseas or withdrawing money from ATMs. READYdebit lists its fees on its website.","You can contact customer support by email. According to the company, they respond within one business day. There is also an FAQs section that covers opening a new account, the fees it charges, and more.","A READYdebit prepaid credit card can be a worthwhile option for those who don&#39;t want to carry cash or their personal credit cards while traveling. However, like any prepaid card, you face steep charges for a variety of transactions, and those fees go up when you travel internationally."]},"id":"6aa04412-b28f-4f28-afff-ace6af8862c3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3391","url":"/readydebit-visa-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-07-16T20:37:05Z","datePublished":"2009-07-16T20:37:05Z","name":"READYdebit","synopsis":"READYdebit prepaid credit card offers a couple of different plans for customers.
