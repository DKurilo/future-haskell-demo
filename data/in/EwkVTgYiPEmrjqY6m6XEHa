You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Magellan makes several different sizes of navigation GPS devices and has the devices split into series based on these sizes. You can choose from 4.3-inch, 5-inch and 7-inch screens. The Magellan RoadMate5255T-LM has a 5-inch resistive screen. A navigation system of this size is great for the dashboard or windshield, as it is small enough as to not obstruct your vision, but large enough to see directions clearly.","The RoadMate 5255T-LM uses a resistive plastic screen that is not capable of multitouch. This screen requires physical pressure to make selections, making it less responsive than a capacitive screen. You’ll have to rely on pushing the onscreen buttons, too, as this device lacks voice control. This can be troublesome while en route, but Magellan made the buttons on this device large enough to see at a glance. The RoadMate 5255T-LM also lacks Bluetooth capability, which is another key feature in a hands-free unit. This device has a rechargeable lithium ion battery that holds a charge for two hours. The RoadMate 5255T-LM is also capable of connecting to a back-up camera, giving it another use.","Accuracy is particularly important when using a navigation system. Magellan uses a landmark guidance system in many of its navigation GPS units, and the RoadMate 5255T-LM uses this program to provide directions that are more precise. The location of your car on the device&#39;s map is accurate to within three to five meters of your actual location, making directions using landmarks not only possible, but also more effective. Along with the location specific directions, the RoadMate 5255T-LM comes with map and traffic updates for the life of your particular device. Magellan puts out new maps four times a year and you can upload these maps onto your device for free. This ensures you have the most current maps available.","With seven million points of interest, you can find almost any movie theater or restaurant you are looking for. Search for a dog groomer, coffee shop and a dry cleaner, and this GPS unit will find these destinations and allow you to finish your errands efficiently. The RoadMate 5255T-LM can take multiple destinations, sort them,  and find a more efficient and direct route. To help you reach your destinations, this device has lane assistance and traffic updates. You will know which lane you need to be in and how best to avoid any traffic jams. You can choose from different routes, such as the shortest or the fastest, and you can program this model to avoid highways, construction zones and toll roads."]},"id":"85ec337a-02c4-400e-b06e-04581d9fe236","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0313531d-f455-4b7b-8515-49879445293a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magellan RoadMate 5255T-LM has many basic features we looked for and a few advanced features such as landmark guidance and the ability to auto-sort multiple destinations.
