You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You&#39;ve probably never heard of Huawei. It&#39;s the third-biggest manufacturer of <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> in the world, but it&#39;s sold primarily in Asian markets and, until now, hasn&#39;t been widely available in the States. With the Ascend Mate2, Huawei (that&#39;s pronounced &#34;WAH-way&#34;) is trying to break onto the American scene, and while it&#39;s not about to topple Samsung&#39;s Android throne, a few of its features are worth consideration.","The first thing we noticed when we unboxed the Ascend Mate2 is its size: This phone is massive. With a 6.1-inch screen and a plastic chassis that&#39;s taller, wider and thicker than anything else we&#39;ve reviewed, Huawei&#39;s phablet is a beast. Unlike Samsung&#39;s Note line, the Mate2 doesn&#39;t come with a stylus, nor is its screen 1080p; instead, the IPS LCD display is merely 720p. At that resolution, you&#39;ll get a pixel density of 241ppi, which – while sharp from certain distances – falls far below the 300ppi threshold at which you tend to lose track of individual pixels. The result won&#39;t bother you, but it&#39;s not particularly exciting.","A 6.1-inch screen is impressive, but this phone&#39;s battery is even more so. The Mate2 lasts longer, on average, than any other phone we&#39;ve ever used. We got through our first day of heavy testing, and the device kept on going. Then we had it run videos on repeat for a solid six hours, and the phone only smiled at us. It wasn&#39;t until the third day of use that Huawei&#39;s device finally needed charging. Whether you&#39;re planning an extended camping trip or just like to watch a lot of movies on the go, it&#39;ll easily handle your needs.","All top smartphones should boast impressive processor performance, and we were optimistic for the Mate2, but it&#39;s here that Huawei&#39;s device falls unfortunately short. At a time when 2.3GHz and even screaming 2.5GHz processors are becoming the norm, the Mate2 only sports a 1.6GHz chip. The move likely helped keep costs down and, indeed, the phone is about half the price of a comparable off-contract flagship from another company, but it&#39;s nevertheless a disappointment. You won&#39;t have any trouble navigating menus or using Facebook, but expect top-tier games and 3D apps to stutter."]},"id":"bf0be29b-349d-420c-9e6d-2a09d3a1de57","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"43b0aaa7-7335-4b42-888b-b71e4d535331","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When we write our smartphone reviews, we look for phones that stand apart from the competition.
