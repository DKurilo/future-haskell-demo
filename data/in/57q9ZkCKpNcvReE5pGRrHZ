Bagel slicers cut bagels into two uniform slices to make them easier to consume. By cutting your bagel into even halves, you can add your favorite spread or toppings to make a sandwich or eat each piece individually. These devices also can slice multiple bagels in much less time than it would take using a knife or other cutting tool. Most can also be used to cut other items, like rolls and hamburger buns. Some popular models of slicers include the <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-bagel-slicers/tablecraft-review/\">Tablecraft E5613</a>, the <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-bagel-slicers/larien-review/\">Larien Commercial Bagel Biter 5400</a>, and the <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-bagel-slicers/doughxpress-review/\">DoughXpress DXSM-270E Bagel and Bun Slicer</a>.","<strong>Bagel Slicers: What to Look For</strong>","Bagel slicers come in a wide variety of sizes and styles. Generally the most effective designs consist of a frame to hold the bagel still and a blade which either slides through the frame or is built into the device. If you cut a lot of bagels, you may want to consider a guillotine style where you put the bagel in place and push down on a handle to slice it. Of course, you can also purchase units powered by electricity that help you cut a large number of items quickly. Here’s a breakdown of various features you may want to consider before buying.","<strong>Blade Action</strong><br/>Due to the fact that bagel slicers come in different sizes, some are easier to maneuver than others. While some slicers are handheld units, others use a guillotine action in order to slice the bagel. Others are powered by electrical plugs or batteries, making them safer to use because your hands don’t have to go anywhere near the blade. If you plan to use the bagel slicer frequently, make sure it comes with a replaceable blade. This allows you to switch out the blades when the old one gets dull.","<strong>Convenience &amp; Safety</strong><br/>If you want a bagel slicer that is quick and convenient, you may prefer an easy-to-use bagel cutter over a more elaborate or powerful model. The most convenient is the simple serrated knife style that&#39;s enclosed in plastic. Not only is this design safe, it&#39;s easy to use, keep clean and store. Additionally, as it is one complete unit, you never have to worry about needing to take something apart. For safety, make sure the bread slicer you choose features a safety shield to protect your hands and fingers.","<strong>Adjustability</strong><br/>Not all bagels are the same width. There are models that are designed to cut bagels of different sizes, and these slicers can be used to cut items other than bagels. A bagel slicer that is adjustable to hold a variety of items, including bagels and beyond, can be a versatile and useful kitchen tool.","<strong>Cleaning Options</strong><br/>One of the most important things to consider about a bagel slicer is the ease of cleaning it. Since not all slicers are constructed from the same materials, it is important to understand whether yours can be placed in the dishwasher or not. A model that has to be hand washed will be less convenient to use, overall.","Bagel slicers make the process of cutting bagels safer and easier. Check out the various models available at different price ranges to obtain the one that is best suited for your needs."]},"id":"1c31cdba-6547-44c2-aa67-1c823af5fdf4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"870db8e2-d02b-4131-ac43-e41e35bb1134","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SES1AI/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63734[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Brooklyn Bagel</a>","<a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=113582&b=263106&m=29871&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Ekatom%2Ecom%2F257%2DDXSM270E%2Ehtml%3Fzmam%3D29342707%26zmas%3D1%26zmac%3D32%26zmap%3D257%2DDXSM270E%26utm%5Fsource%3Dgoogle%26utm%5Fmedium%3Dadwords%26utm%5Fcampaign%3DCSE%26gclid%3DCKT0lZCDkMcCFY9gfgodbOQM1Q\">DoughXpress</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F66V70/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63736[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Ironwood Gourmet</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U8FSR6/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63732[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Larien</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DSP81E/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63735[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Out of the Woods</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RN8ISHE/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63738[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Prince Castle</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094J4YVE/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63739[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">RSVP</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BQEKS0/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63731[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tablecraft</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KJ3UGNE/?&tag=ttr_bagel-slicers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1450[art|NA[pid|63740[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Trudeau</a>","<a href=\"http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/bagel-cutter/\">Williams-Sonoma</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"634d202e-4424-461f-942d-196ea9cc7ae6","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1450","url":"/best-bagel-slicers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-01-28T19:02:48Z","datePublished":"2016-10-06T15:09:53Z","name":"Bagel Slicers Review","synopsis":"A bagel slicer allows you to cut your bagel into manageable and even slices.
