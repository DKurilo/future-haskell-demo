You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Dirt Devil’s Accucharge 15.6V Cordless Bagless Stick Vacuum cleans both carpet and hardwood floors. With the ability to turn off the brush roll, you can clean any surface without worrying about damaging it, which is vital for hardwood floors. Additionally, the vacuum automatically adjusts to the optimal height for the floor you are cleaning. By doing so, you receive maximum suction and remove any risk of harming your floors. However, you cannot adjust the actual suction of this <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\">hardwood floor vacuum</a>.","The Dirt Devil Accucharge Stick Vacuum has a filter that helps remove allergens from the air. It is also backed by an Energy Star from the Environmental Protection Agency, indicating that the model uses minimal energy and is safe for the environment. It does not require bags. You simply empty the dirt cup whenever it reaches capacity, which also saves you money and helps the environment.","This lightweight model is an effective vacuum for hardwood floors. Weighing less than 6 pounds, it places minimal pressure on the floor when you clean and helps you maneuver between furniture legs and corners with ease, much like an electric broom. The vacuum has a 9.5-inch cleaning path, which optimizes your time by covering more of the floor’s surface with each stroke.","The compact battery contributes to the vacuum’s light weight. The model has a 15.6-volt battery that allows you to use the vacuum for a maximum of ten minutes. Despite the short life, the vacuum’s battery still requires at least six hours to charge in between sessions. As such, this vacuum serves better to clean up small messes in between vacuuming sessions.","Dirt Devil offers a two-year warranty on the parts and motor of the vacuum, which reflects the quality of the machine. You can contact company support by phone or email. Dirt Devil also has a service center locator on its website."]},"id":"dc1cb0e1-58ca-45bf-9416-4f80c4806538","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7b2c812-eff1-4135-a299-fcbf4607d5a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dirt Devil Accucharge Stick Vacuum is the best hardwood floor vacuum to use for small clean-up jobs.
