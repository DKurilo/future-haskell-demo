A lot of us have people that we care about that no longer live close to us. Naturally, we can t afford, nor do we have the time, to travel to see them every day. Instead of spending all of this money, we could urge them to get online or find an affordable telephone plan that would allow them to call long distance every day. That way no time would be lost and you would be able to keep in touch with those you love. The same can be said for people you haven t seen for quite some time. You can t exactly go to their house if you have no clue where they live. The Internet gives us the ability to find anyone we have ever come across in life.","A world without the communication methods we hold dear is hard to imagine.  The world is nothing like what it used to be.  People are clinging to the past not realizing that what we have before us is an easier way to communicate.  A lot more can be said over the phone or behind closed doors on the Internet than could ever be said in person.  The current state of things is something we should embrace with open arms rather than use as fuel to become more frustrated.  As technology progresses, we re going to find that communicating each other is going to get easier.  We might as well come to grips with what s happening and start talking to those we love a little more.  A little change is a good thing as long as it does something as good as improving communication.","If you re too scared to venture out, you can always explore the intricate world of VoIP Services. No longer will you have to deal with the phone company. They re more interested in their bottom line than providing you with good phone service anyway. You should want to go with a company that is focused on staying on the cutting edge and giving you what you need than anyone else. You work too hard for your money to have some telephone company spend it on stuff you aren t going to use or care about. Everything you have endured with bad telephone companies is going to be worth it the moment you find one that s good."]},"id":"56d82267-616f-44ec-9611-1fa52fd2013c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4533","url":"/taking-personal-communication-for-granted","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"allen-glines","url":"/author/allen-glines","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Allen Glines","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"BiyVe2vAJdgjoSh5weh9rf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-22T19:35:13Z","datePublished":"2010-06-22T19:35:13Z","name":"VoIP Services: Don't Forget the Past","synopsis":"Believe it or not, there was a time before the Internet, cell phones and all of the other pieces of communication technology we hold dear.","review":{},"strapline":"Believe it or not, there was a time before the Internet, cell phones and all of the other pieces of communication technology we hold dear.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-21T23:22:30Z","id":"FybY6ZGPLwy3X7yxwkv8tZ","meta":{"title":"VoIP Services: Don't Forget the Past","description":"Thanks to modern technology and the rise of VoIP services, talking to someone is as simple as turning on your computer and hitting a few keys.
