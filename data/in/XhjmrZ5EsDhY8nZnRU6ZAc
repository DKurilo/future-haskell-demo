Similiar to the <a href=\"/breville-smart-toaster-review\">Breville Smart Toaster</a>, we were thoroughly impressed by how consistent it toasted in our tests, in which we evaluated toasting quality based on evenness and consistency, as well as how it handled frozen items and bagels.  A score of 100 percent indicates perfect results, while anything lower reflects lesser performance.","<em>Evenness</em><br/>With a score of 98 percent, this toaster was only two percent lower than the best toaster for evenness. And compared to the average of 86 percent across the board for the toasters we tested, the Frigidaire Professional proved to be an exceptional performer. We were impressed by this machine&#39;s ability to produce evenly toasted bread on a steady basis.","<em>Consistency</em><br/>The Frigidaire Professional was the most consistent of our lineup in our tests. It had no problem toasting several slices of bread consecutively. Its score of 100 percent in this category was the highest and well above the average of 94 percent. The only issue we encountered was that the toast came out a little darker than desired as the model heated up, but it still was evenly toasted. This could be easily resolved by lowering the toasting settings if you make multiple batches at once.","<em>Frozen</em><br/>This toaster performed exceptionally well at toasting frozen bread, which is reflected in its high score of 100 percent.  Whether the bread was frozen or at room temperature, it came out evenly toasted on both sides in all of our tests.","<em>Bagel</em><br/>Scoring a 98 percent, this Frigidaire toaster was also excellent at toasting bagels in our testing. The bagel halves came out with a nice and even browning, and there were few visible bar marks. This model has a special bagel feature designed to only toast one side, so bagel halves come out toasted on top and still soft on the bottom."]},"id":"dd78de93-e6ef-477a-8f3e-da6d7d9b49fc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"767f2f55-f34b-493a-8d65-d8bbd908b0b8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/UsWEC5cKK9AUes7Bpc9Ar8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58452-frigidaire-professional5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UsWEC5cKK9AUes7Bpc9Ar8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"UsWEC5cKK9AUes7Bpc9Ar8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UsWEC5cKK9AUes7Bpc9Ar8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"fe2842d7-60a5-4cb8-a2ae-5dc31131b0f9","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The design of the Frigidaire Professional is among the best of the toasters we reviewed.
