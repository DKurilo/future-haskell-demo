This RC truck doesn&#39;t make our list because of abundant features or unique abilities, but because it is one of the most accessible <a href=\"/best-remote-control-cars\">RC cars</a> available for young children.","Billy FunWheels isn&#39;t very quick, which helps toddlers learn to control RC cars without getting hurt or frustrated. Four AA batteries keep the wheels turning, but make sure you turn the toy off when your child is finished playing, as there&#39;s no automatic shut-off feature.","This RC car doesn&#39;t have any specific durability features like shocks or bumpers, but a hard plastic exterior and low top speed help to keep everything intact despite occasional crashes. It&#39;s not waterproof, however, so you&#39;ll want to watch out for puddles and drive it mostly indoors.","The tires are fairly large, which helps to keep the car moving forward on short grass or carpeted floors. They are hard, however, so they don&#39;t provide the best traction on steep or slippery terrain.","Although its range is limited, the remote is perhaps the most special part of driving Billy FunWheels. Its design resembles a real steering wheel, but it incorporates two buttons for its various driving functions. A button on the right causes Billy to speed ahead, while a similar button on the left side of the wheel makes it reverse.","In order to steer the car, your child must turn the controller wheel in whichever direction they desire to go. Although this is simpler than most controllers are, using it will no doubt be a learning experience for a toddler. Fortunately, there&#39;s a horn in the center of the controller to warn oncoming traffic.","As your child drives it around, Billy flashes its lights and plays fun sounds that correspond with every action it takes. Features like these help to capture the attention of young ones and keep them interested for more than just a few minutes.","Chicco provides several options for support. You can find a phone number and email address on its website. Like most inexpensive toy-grade RC trucks, Billy FunWheels doesn&#39;t come with an extended warranty of any sort."]},"id":"b9a2d992-452d-4e71-9437-accfa78af0f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"74c51cdc-b445-4c8d-899b-cfdbfef3cd6a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Billy FunWheels is an inexpensive, toy-grade radio-controlled car made exclusively for young kids and toddlers.
