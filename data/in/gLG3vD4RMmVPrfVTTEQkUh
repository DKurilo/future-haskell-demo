This makes it one of the easiest platforms to navigate among competing models. Roku TVs allow even the least tech savvy person to navigate through the menu to find streaming services, menu options and video inputs without getting lost or confused. Although the TV is easy to use, the picture isn&#39;t nearly as good as some of the best 4K TVs we reviewed.","We watched a handful of ultra-high definition programs on each TV to help evaluate picture quality. We watched in dim and well-lit environments, as well as sitting directly in front of the sets and off to the sides. With the TCL 55US5800, off-center viewing causes the screen to wash out. Many of the TVs towards the bottom of our lineup had this problem. This 4K LED TV was also less vibrant and had less color saturation than other TVs in our lineup. The screen just looked duller than other TVs.","The middling image quality is also due to a less dynamic contrast ratio when compared to other TVs. Using Calman software and our testing pattern generator and sensor, we were able to test the contrast ratio and color accuracy of each LED TV.  Our results showed that only one TV we reviewed has a worse contrast ratio. It is also one of the most inaccurate in terms of color accuracy. This helped to justify our visual observations as we felt the picture quality wasn&#39;t nearly as vibrant as other TVs.","The two things that make this TV stand out in our comparison are the remote and the Roku interface. The remote is small and comfortable to hold but cluttered with buttons. You can access streaming services such as Netflix just by touching the Netflix button at the bottom of the remote. There is an RDIO button on the remote, which is puzzling since this service has been discontinued.","The interface is about as simple as can be. This is good for anyone who isn&#39;t tech savvy. The layout displays all of the available streaming services and accessible inputs in one place. It is so basic that even TV settings are stripped down. You can&#39;t manually adjust the TV&#39;s brightness, for instance, like you can on other TVs. Instead, there are four different options: brightest, bright, dark, darker. This doesn&#39;t give you full control over the picture quality, which is a little disappointing, but it does keep things simple so you don&#39;t have to sort through deep menu options.","The TV features four HDMI ports and one USB port. This is plenty of HDMI ports, but it does have fewer USB ports than most LED TVs we reviewed, many of which boast at least three. This TV is available in both 65 and 55 inches and is covered by a one-year warranty from the date of purchase."]},"id":"500b4bf8-f4df-4cae-8b68-870ab3776381","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fac7ded7-ffde-48b6-b3cf-26b5558f7a0c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This TV isn&#39;t going to blow you away with amazing picture quality, but the Roku interface makes it easy to use and convenient for streaming movies using the streaming app of your choice.
