small <a href=\"/computers/3d-printers/best-budget-3d-printers/\">budget 3D printer</a>, the UP mini has some convenient features and worthy print accuracy. The miniature design keeps the footprint low but also prevents you from making larger prints. Perfect for any small desk or cramped office, the UP mini is compact, efficient and safe for any tiny project.","Since the UP mini is so small, your 3D designs need to be scaled down to less than 4.7 x 4.7 x 4.7 inches. They also print very slowly, with speeds ranging from 3 to 30 millimeters per second. For how slow this printer prints, it would be nice to for it to have higher resolution, but its smallest layer height is 0.2 millimeters, which is only average for the best 3D Printers. Although the UP mini&#39;s prints didn’t have the high quality of other affordable 3D printers in our review, we found that they were extremely accurate.","The UP mini has many of the best features found on cheap 3D printers. The printer is enclosed and has a heated platform, which keep ABS prints from warping too much from environmental humidity and other factors. Because of the enclosure, it is also safe; hands and fingers aren&#39;t in danger of getting burned. However, since it is made from black plastic, you can’t see the progress of your printing models. The perf board print plate has tiny holes that allow the filament to stick. Perf board needs to be replaced every few prints, which is inconvenient, but clean up with rafts or other supports is very easy.","ABS and PLA are both compatible with the UP mini budget 3D printer. Since the manufacturer doesn&#39;t sell replacement cartridges, you can use any 1.75-millimeter universal cartridge. Purchasing from another filament retailer can keep future costs low for your affordable 3D printer.","Before you buy a 3D printer, make sure its software is compatible with your home or office computer. The UP Software is only compatible with select Windows and Mac operating systems. USB is the only connection available; you cannot print with a flash drive, SD card or Wi-Fi. However, you can unplug the cable once your print is sent to the printer – this partially untethered printing frees up your computer for the hours it takes to print. The UP mini comes with its own power supply, USB cord, maintenance tools and starter filament cartridge. The filament cartridge has about 680 grams of filament, which is significantly more than many comparable budget 3D printers, making the UP mini more cost effective."]},"id":"55b2a76c-21d4-4fe3-8dfc-89ae8e8b0648","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fdeba533-2c8b-4c3b-a65f-0a8a98fb3604","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The UP mini is one of the safest 3D printers, and it keeps the heated platform well concealed behind a housing enclosure.
