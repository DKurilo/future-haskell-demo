Its battery lasts over three hours, giving you plenty of time to watch your favorite movies before needing to find a charger, and if you need to charge while on the road, the player comes with a DC power adapter. Unfortunately, when we tested the video quality, we were far less impressed.","We started by testing the  video and audio quality. First, we used a protractor and thread to test the viewing angle. We noticed distortion at 35 degrees from center, which seems somewhat narrow, but this should be fine for two viewers. We watched a DVD we were very familiar with so that we could judge the quality of the picture. Unfortunately, the screen is far darker than any other player on its default settings. Prepare to turn the brightness up just to get a usable picture, but even then, the video was pixelated and had noticeable horizontal lines. This isn’t the worst video display we witnessed, but it was a disappointment.","Fortunately, its audio quality is far stronger. Both its built-in speakers and headphone port are able to deliver clear sounds. The speakers are able to reach volumes of 95 dB, while the headphones offer a more humble maximum loudness of 56 dB.","Craig Electronics does not list the expected battery life, so we didn’t know what to expect when we tested it. With a full charge, we were able to watch a DVD for just over three hours.","While the video quality was a disappointment, the DVD player has a full range of features. Its anti-skipping allows you to watch on the road without worrying about the disc jumping around. The parental controls allow you to set limits on what your kids can watch. Also, this is one of the few portable DVD players that come with a set of headphones. Finally, its included DC car adapter allows you to watch movies in the car and charge the player if it dies."]},"id":"cffd2d0e-581e-42bd-9fa7-e385ebbe8506","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1b5ae481-8df7-41b8-99c7-91813853f520","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Craig Electronics CTFT713 is a portable DVD player with a full range of features and an impressive battery, but its video quality is a disappointment.
