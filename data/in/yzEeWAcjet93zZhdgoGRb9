You’ll also see how many gift cards are left in any given amount from any given retailer as well as whether it’s a physical or digital card. As with all gift card exchanges, availability and discount changes almost daily.   <br />\nThe other reason we really liked Cardpool is the speedy shipping. If you’re selling a gift card you don’t want, you can expect payment in 5-10 business days and you’ll get physical gift cards you purchase in 3-7.

These kiosks are usually located inside another store, such as a Target, and you can locate one using Cardpool&#39;s online map search feature. Once you find a location, simply bring all your unwanted gift cards to that store and swipe them at the machine. You can also exchange electronic gift cards.","The downside is the cards must have at least $15 on them and no more than $1,000, so that Starbucks card in your wallet with a couple dollars on it won’t work. You can get up to 85 percent of the card&#39;s value at a kiosk, though your return will vary depending on the type of gift card you exchange. The kiosk prompts you to enter your personal information and then offers you cash in return for the cards. Finally, you collect your money from the store&#39;s service desk or at the kiosk if you have a reloadable Visa gift card.","To use a kiosk you need a government-issued ID, cell phone number, email address and sometimes a credit card number. This is to prevent fraud and keep someone else from collecting your cash at the store’s service desk. If you are asked to enter credit card information, Cardpool will never charge it without your permission. However, if the gift card you sell was obtained illegally, you could be charged.","If you are used to using Coinstar kiosks you probably noticed some changes in recent years. Cardpool now owns Coinstar Exchange kiosks, so these machines can also be used for counting your change and giving you cash along with exchanging your unwanted gift cards. These machines are usually green. Gift Card Exchange kiosks are yellow and only work with gift cards.","<strong>Zeek</strong>","If you have unused gift cards, another company to check out is <a href=\"https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=7a233b490633faabf15758a2356fb65a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeek.me%2Fgb%2Fbuy-gift-vouchers%2F&amp;cuid=ascsubtagtoptenreviewsttrenUS43Review362&amp;opt=true\">Zeek</a>. This company will buy your unwanted gift cards and give you up to 95 percent of their value. You can also shop for gift cards at a discounted price. The London-based company works most effectively in the United Kingdom and pays you in Zeek credit, through PayPal or via bank transfer. You can use Zeek credit to buy discounted gift cards on the website. Zeek claims it takes an average of 36 minutes to sell your unwanted gift cards, after which you get paid.","Since launching in 2015, Zeek has gained 550,000 registered users, so you have pretty good odds that someone will buy your unwanted gift card quickly. In 2018 alone, the company sold 707 gift card brands. We didn&#39;t include this service in our tests, but we saw gift cards from a wide variety of retailers, including H&amp;M, Starbucks, Ticketmaster and Pizza Hut. The website is easy to use, but it&#39;s not ideal for people in the U.S., as all of the prices are in British pounds. The website&#39;s help center is useful for troubleshooting, if you run into problems.","<strong>Card Kangaroo</strong>","If the companies we tested aren&#39;t giving you the results you want, try <a href=\"https://www.cardkangaroo.com/\">Card Kangaroo</a>. This website had an inventory of about 1,300 cards as of March 2019 and has served nearly 59,000 customers.

CardKangaroo guarantees the stated balance up to $500 of purchased gift cards for 100 days from the day you buy them. They accept major credit cards as well as PayPal.","If you&#39;re looking to sell cards you simply select the merchant, value of the card and get an offer from the website. This company is unique in that you&#39;ll receive a shipping label and be asked to mail your gift card in, rather than simply providing the card&#39;s number and other information. If this isn&#39;t too much of a hurdle for you, CardKangaroo is a great gift card swap option. You&#39;ll receive payment via a check in the mail or through PayPal.","If you&#39;d rather trade for a different gift card you simply click that option after providing information about the card you no longer want. Once you&#39;ve picked which gift card you want you&#39;ll have to ship yours in before getting the one you swapped it for in the mail.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We went through every part of these gift card exchange websites to see how well they work and whether they’re worth your time. We bought 20 gift cards and found out how much we could get in return for selling them. We also checked out how big the discounts were on cards available for purchase. When it was an option, we also downloaded the app to make sure it worked as advertised and while the majority of gift cards out there are digital, we also looked at shipping rates for shoppers looking for a physical gift card."]},"id":"2a1abc5e-80f2-44b6-91f0-d64e09350a49","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/mbSZZLxMn33H4nbwEWPJhP.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/gift-card-exchange-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9RL1QvODA0NDg1L29yaWdpbmFsL0dpZnQtQ2FyZC1FeGNoYW5nZS1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMS5KUEc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mbSZZLxMn33H4nbwEWPJhP.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"mbSZZLxMn33H4nbwEWPJhP","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mbSZZLxMn33H4nbwEWPJhP.jpg","alt":""},"id":"79ecfd16-549c-4434-9c6f-2ded8d1d2d0b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The number and variety of retailers you can buy gift cards on exchange websites changes all the time. Instead of trying to keep our thumb on how many individual retailers were available, we searched for three big players – Target, Amazon and Walmart – at the same time on the same day across all the websites we tested. We then assigned a letter grade corresponding to whether the website had cards available for purchase from those retailers.","We also used the Better Business Bureau to make sure these gift card exchange websites are legitimate. The BBB is a consumer watchdog group which assigns ratings A+ through F to companies based on information from business and customer complaints. These ratings aren’t a guarantee, but they’re helpful in seeing whether businesses and websites have had consistent problems or consumer complaints.","<strong>Prepaid vs. Gift Cards</strong>","A gift card is essentially like cash you can only spend at a specific store. You use the card until the balance is gone and then discard it, though some retailers allow you to add more money to the card so you can continue spending with it. Not all stores allow you to reload existing cards, and there&#39;s a chance the store could give you a new gift card every time you want to add money. One red flag to look for are fees, as gift cards shouldn’t have any. If a retailer tries to charge you a fee for using a gift card, we recommend using another method of payment or simply shopping elsewhere.","Prepaid cards are designed to be reloadable, and as such, they sometimes carry fees. These vary by card, so it’s important to read the fine print if you go this route. These cards are often available from credit card companies like Visa and can be used on everyday expenses. <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/prepaid-cards-report/25821/\">Wallet Hub</a> found prepaid cards can cost a person up to $311 per year in fees though, so if you can, you should opt for cards directly from a bank because they have fewer fees and a more secure guarantee. Or, you can avoid this quagmire altogether and opt for a gift card. If the person can&#39;t find anything at the store it&#39;s good at, they can use a gift card exchange to swap it for one they’ll love!","<strong>Physical vs. Digital</strong>","When exchanging gift cards, make sure you know what you’re getting. Some websites deal only in digital gift cards. This means you’ll receive a code via email, usually within a day or two. These codes can then be used for online shopping, though most retailers will let you use them in person at the cash register if you have all the required information like the full card number and activation code. Some websites will send you a physical gift card in the mail, but that means you’ll have to wait longer for it to arrive. Our research shows it usually takes about seven business days for cards to get to you, but that’s on top of the one or two days it will take for the company to process your order and get it in the mail. If you’re in a hurry, digital gift cards are the way to go. Another thing to keep in mind when deciding between digital and physical gift cards is how organized you are. If dozens of punch cards and gift cards tend to get lost and forgotten in your wallet, a digital card will be much more useful. On the other hand, if your computer’s emails and files aren’t well organized, you might want to opt for something physical you can keep your hands on until you need it.","<strong>How Much Do Gift Card Exchanges Cost?</strong>","If you’re selling an unwanted gift card, exchange websites take a cut. It depends on the website, card you’re selling and overall demand, but most take 15 percent or less. If you’re buying gift cards you can expect to see discounts of up to 35 percent, meaning you’d pay $65 or more for a $100 gift card. This too depends on the retailer and demand for that card."]},"id":"86ad1ca2-81f8-4654-8d91-352d26f6a9ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/6Px5M4RFzcvUDr8fbps45V.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/gift-card-exchange-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9RL1UvODA0NDg2L29yaWdpbmFsL0dpZnQtQ2FyZC1FeGNoYW5nZS1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMy5KUEc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Px5M4RFzcvUDr8fbps45V.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6Px5M4RFzcvUDr8fbps45V","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Px5M4RFzcvUDr8fbps45V.jpg","alt":""},"id":"60cee89d-894b-4a78-8c46-7e30d33a24dd","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Selection<br/>Because users are buying and selling cards all the time it’s difficult to say exactly how “good” one website’s selection is compared to another.

What we’d recommend is to shop around; if you can’t find the gift card you want on one website, you might be able to find it on another.","The Fine Print<br/>While you’re shopping around, make sure the website you’re using is reputable. We made sure all of the websites we reviewed were secure, but we also found some sketchier options out there we wouldn’t recommend. Make sure wherever you’re shopping has responsive customer service representatives and never give out your credit card number on websites that aren’t secure.

When you&#39;re looking at gift card exchange websites check out Cardpool, which offers Amazon gift cards in exchange for cards from retailers you don&#39;t buy from. Walmart was the second most preferred gift card, followed by Target and then Starbucks. Keep this in mind if you&#39;re shopping but don&#39;t know what kind of gift card to get a friend or loved one. These retailers are very popular, so the odds are this card will get used. Amazon knocked Walmart out of the No. 1 spot in 2017, which signals the rising popularity of online shopping. Some other preferred gift card brands include Kohl&#39;s, Lowe&#39;s, Olive Garden, Home Depot, McDonald&#39;s and Best Buy.","Multi-Store Gift Cards<br/>You&#39;ve probably seen them at stores like Walmart or CVS. Usually displayed on large stands, you can oftentimes purchase gift cards from numerous retailers without having to visit the store itself. These cards usually work for restaurants or businesses that are owned by the same or partner companies. For example, a Darden Restaurants card works at Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, Cheddar&#39;s and several other eateries. These cards are great if you&#39;re unsure what kind of card to get a person or simply don&#39;t know much about what they like to eat or buy. Along with more customer choice, these kinds of cards are good because you&#39;re protected in case one store or restaurant closes. They also don&#39;t have any fees.","Gift Card Security<br/>Whether it’s around the holidays or not, scammers look for ways to steal information and money. You might feel safe and secure using your debit and credit cards at everyday retailers or big box stores, but some of the largest companies have experienced data breaches that left consumers vulnerable.","It might be easy to use your credit or debit card, but it’s not always safe. In December 2013, Target confirmed the credit and debit card information of roughly 40 million customers had been stolen. The number of customers affected later increased to 70 million. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/target-security-breach-settlement.html\">New York Times</a> reported the company ultimately paid a settlement of $18.5 million plus $202 million in legal fees, but millions still had their personal information stolen. If you shopped at Best Buy in September or October of 2017, you also may have had your information stolen. The same can be said for Sears and Delta Airlines according to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/04/06/best-buy-shoppers-payment-information-may-have-been-exposed-data-breach/493690002/\">USA Today.</a>","Gift cards can help you avoid having your identity or information stolen. Simply purchase gift cards at retailers you frequent with cash and use them like debit cards. This eliminates the need to use a credit or debit card and potentially put your personal information in a vulnerable position. You can also use gift card exchange websites to acquire gift cards and use them to make everyday purchases at stores you frequent. There’s no reason to save a gift card to buy something special, and the added sense of security is a nice bonus.","<strong>FAQs</strong>","Can I use a gift card anywhere?"]},"id":"029802e4-0bb7-4682-bc30-c2964688fad5","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Gift cards have to be used at the merchant that is listed on the card.

The <a href=\"https://www.thebalanceeveryday.com/reuse-empty-gift-cards-904518\">Balance Everyday</a>, part of Dotdash publishing, recommends putting more money on the card and giving it away as a gift. Cards with beautiful patterns or designs can even be cut into shapes and used as design or scrapbooking embellishments. You can also easily turn an old gift card into a stencil with a pair of scissors. In addition, cutting a jagged or curved edge makes an empty gift card a great pottery tool.","<a href=\"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/10-uses-gift-cards\">This Old House</a>, a home builders website, has a lot of home improvement uses for old gift cards. For example, they&#39;re extremely handy to have in your pocket to use as a straight edge. You can also use a gift card to glue down loose tiles rather than getting a trowel dirty. In addition, the website says gift cards can be used to smooth out air bubbles in wallpaper or to caulk your tub, and you can use one as a miniature paint shield in tight spots.","Pinterest users have also compiled a long list of alternative uses for gift cards, including using them as the covers for mini journals, cutting them into shapes to make magnets or recycling them as guitar picks. If you have a sharp enough blade, you can even cut a gift card into a multipurpose tool to keep in your wallet.","<strong>Reddit</strong>","If you&#39;re looking to swap gift cards in an unofficial way, one option is Reddit&#39;s gift card exchange program. Note, however, that this swap program is merely a community of Reddit users following a set of guidelines. The program is not officially run by a company. As such, there is no one to back up your purchases, and it&#39;s possible to get scammed. That said, there are 32,000 traders in the community who swap cards. Because the program is not monitored or controlled by a private company, there’s no one to charge fees to reduce the value of your card; you could get 100 percent of the value of your card if you find the right person to swap with. The <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/comments/2gig0n/gcx_safe_trading_guide/\">GCX Safe Trading Guide</a> outlines the precautions you should take before swapping cards, including verifying a user&#39;s account age and karma and making people send you links to their GCX Rep Profiles. Google Chrome users can also add the Reddit Scam Labeler extension to their browser for an added layer of security. Even if you take every precaution, however, it’s possible to get scammed, so we recommend using one of the gift card exchange websites we tested."]},"id":"7059a468-f525-48fc-8125-31859bd4e590","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_362","url":"/best-gift-card-exchange-sites","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-06T08:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-06T08:00:00Z","name":"Best Gift Card Exchange Services of 2019","synopsis":"Gift card exchange sites allow you to sell unwanted gift cards, buy other cards at deep discounts or swap your gift cards for something better.","review":{},"strapline":"Gift card exchange sites allow you to sell unwanted gift cards, buy other cards at deep discounts or swap your gift cards for something better.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-17T15:47:53Z","id":"yzEeWAcjet93zZhdgoGRb9","meta":{"title":"Best Gift Card Exchange 2019 - Swap, Trade and Sell Gift Cards","description":"Gift card exchange sites allow you to sell unwanted gift cards, buy other cards at deep discounts or swap your gift cards for something better."},"products":[{"slug":"cardpool","url":"/product/cardpool","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","name":"Cardpool","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"BkVw8CYrFs3gvdVTTgmj76","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"cardcash","url":"/product/cardcash","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","name":"CardCash","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"unT73CWuyGoz6Z3YxEWJgm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gift-card-granny","url":"/product/gift-card-granny","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","name":"Gift Card Granny","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"hysf38BJATBHiATCkz9TsS","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"raise","url":"/product/raise","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","name":"Raise","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"WAZBFPjWdWuYgCJK5VuPE4","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gift-card-spread","url":"/product/gift-card-spread","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","name":"Gift Card Spread","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"zsFrt6SATaXLckLtCMjVbF","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mzMzsFYxcKxqkndD6j6WN5.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Gift-Card-Exchangea.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/T/A/804574/original/Hero-Gift-Card-Exchangea.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"mzMzsFYxcKxqkndD6j6WN5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mzMzsFYxcKxqkndD6j6WN5.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Gift Card Exchange Services of 2019","description":"Gift card exchange sites allow you to sell unwanted gift cards, buy other cards at deep discounts or swap your gift cards for something better."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mzMzsFYxcKxqkndD6j6WN5.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Gift-Card-Exchangea.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/T/A/804574/original/Hero-Gift-Card-Exchangea.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"mzMzsFYxcKxqkndD6j6WN5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mzMzsFYxcKxqkndD6j6WN5.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Gift Card Exchange Services of 2019","description":"Gift card exchange sites allow you to sell unwanted gift cards, buy other cards at deep discounts or swap your gift cards for something better."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gift-giving","url":"/hobbies/gift-giving","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","name":"Gift Giving","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:17Z","id":"pd7Tb3aPbQ3mqu2tBCBawf","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
