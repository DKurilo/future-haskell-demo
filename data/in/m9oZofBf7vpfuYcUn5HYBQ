So when we had the chance to test and evaluate a cheaper way to access live TV, we were pumped.","Our experts know you’re used to a clear, crisp picture, so antennas with spotty output scored lower. It’s important to get the most for your money, so the more channels these antennas picked up, the better.","In short, we don’t want to pay hundreds of dollars every month for quality TV channels, and we don’t want you to have to, either.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We tested every HDTV antenna in two locations: our lab in a small metropolitan downtown surrounded by other buildings, and in a second-floor apartment a few miles south with unobstructed west-facing windows. These locations are served by one TV tower that&#39;s 35 miles away and another that&#39;s 50 miles away.","In both locations, we moved around the space, scanning for channels until we found the spot that received the highest number. Then came the most difficult part of our tests: watching TV. We watched hours and hours of local television, taking note of picture quality.","We also looked for signal breakup or glitches. Using all the data we gathered, we assigned a score to each antenna. Devices with the most channels, best picture quality and fewest glitches received the best scores.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying an Indoor HDTV Antenna </strong>","Price<br/>Most of our top-performing antennas cost about $50 or less, so great antenna TV reception isn’t very expensive. Non-amplified antennas tend to cost a little less than amplified ones, but the extra performance is worth the price, since you’re likely to get more channels and a better-quality signal for your money.","Location, Location, Location<br/>Your HDTV antenna&#39;s placement is key for optimal television enjoyment. Fewer obstructions between the antenna and the broadcast tower equal better reception. One way to figure out the best place to put your antenna is through trial and error. Try several locations near enough for the antenna’s cables to reach your TV and evaluate how many channels you can pick up and the quality of the channels you’re interested in watching.","One helpful tool is antennaweb.org. You can type your ZIP code or address into the system, and it gives you a map of the stations broadcasting nearby. It also includes information about how far each station is from you and the station’s broadcast channel. The map is meant for use with outdoor antennas, but it can give you an idea of what channels you can expect to pick up and which direction you want to aim your antenna.","Amplified vs. Passive<br/>Non-amplified antennas, also called passive antennas, don’t require external power sources, have shorter ranges and costs less than amplified antennas. Amplified antennas require an external power source, like a wall plug or USB connection to your TV, and they cost a little more. But amplified antennas provide a generally higher quality and greater number of channels. They are ideal for suburban and rural areas that are farther from broadcast stations, whereas passive antennas work better in cities, as they’re close enough to pick up signals.","However, not every amplified antenna has better range than every passive antenna, so it’s important to check the antenna’s advertised range. The products we tested have 35- to 50-mile ranges. It’s also important to remember that both types of antennas benefit from optimal placement. Even with a long-range, amplified antenna, you should take care when choosing where to put it.","Design and Accessories<br/>HDTV antennas come in a wide range of shapes and types. They can stick to your wall, sit behind your TV or hang on a window: It’s up to you and the service you’re able to get in various locations throughout your home. Keep in mind you might need to place your antenna in a very visible spot to pick up the maximum number of channels, so get one that is the right color and design to fit your living space. ","<strong>Indoor vs. Outdoor Antennas</strong>","We stuck to indoor antennas for our tests, but outdoor antennas also allow you to tune in to local TV channels. Outdoor HDTV antennas are larger and sturdier devices that are designed to be mounted on your roof. As such, the installation of outdoor antennas is more complicated. Because the installation requires mounting the antenna to your home’s exterior and running cables from the antenna to your TV, it&#39;s important to find the ideal placement for your antenna prior to installation. Many outdoor antennas are motorized, however, and can rotate to aim in different directions. The main advantage of an outdoor antenna is better signal reception, due to sturdier hardware and better placement. Outdoor antennas also have longer ranges and generally pick up more – and better-quality – TV stations. However, they cost more than indoor antennas.","But indoor antennas have pros as well. They&#39;re less expensive than outdoor antennas, and less of a commitment, if you’re just looking to try it out. The installation process is much simpler, so indoor antennas are better for apartments and spaces without roof access. If you live in a city or close to a TV tower, the extra range of an outdoor antenna isn’t necessary to receive a great signal.
