For example, you can check the status of every member profile you’ve kept in your Favorites folder. You can tell exactly when they’ve last been on udate.com and if they’ve read the email you’ve sent.

First, you can pick preferences from an extensive list and then rank the importance of each. This is a good way to find people with similar profiles without eliminating those that don’t exactly match. However, the process isn’t intuitive and takes patience to learn.","Also, the geographic search tool is misleading. udate lets you initiate a search, but only within your own state. Our first impression – it’s too restrictive. However, the search engine returned people from four nearby states. So, the expectation of receiving only matches from your home state is not entirely accurate."]},"id":"f1b44fc1-1b91-44dd-aedd-e1561c3b866e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Profile &amp; Matching"},"id":"f0f5ea16-f52e-4c15-afd0-72f47ff9f4c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like many dating sites, completing the basic profile is simple.

The new names take some time to grasp.","One feature udate offers that most other sites don’t—the ability to see everyone who has taken a close look at your photo.
