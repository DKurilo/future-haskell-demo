Unfolded, it consists of two 50-watt panels. You can make a connection with alligator clips and a 15-foot cable, so it&#39;s mainly used for storing power in large batteries when you’re off the grid or in an RV. It’s not light enough for hiking, but offers a solid option for basecamp.","When folded, the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-portable-solar-power-systems\">portable solar generator</a> is a little over 2 feet wide. Inside the case, you can stand up the black solar panels at the best angle using included folding legs. There is also a solar charge controller that tells you how much energy has been stored. Through the controller, you can set up overcurrent protection and adjust the voltage. For portability, the case comes with a sturdy handle and latches shut.","This portable solar power system is mainly for RVs, car campers or charging batteries at a cabin. The output is a bit too aggressive for charging cellphones or laptops. If you prefer to charge your smaller devices, your best option is purchasing an external battery, charging that first, then plugging in your devices to the storage system. That being said, the Renogy solar panels are a good option to have around your home in case of an emergency. If there is a major power outage or natural disaster, you can quickly set up and recharge batteries you have in storage.","This is an efficient solar system that gives you a high wattage and a quick charge. The solar power kit is easy to set up, doesn’t require a lot of special instructions and will hook up directly to any battery with positive and negative terminals. It’s heavy though, so you shouldn’t intend to lug the panels around. The Renogy foldable solar suitcase is best tucked away in an RV and used for extended stays in the outdoors."]},"id":"771e53c7-e998-477d-8a59-9f0ae02ef9b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61709","url":"/renogy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:29:15Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:29:15Z","name":"Renogy Solar Suitcase RNG-F-2X50D","synopsis":"The Renogy Solar Suitcase is a power generator and it's portable, weighing about 20 pounds.
