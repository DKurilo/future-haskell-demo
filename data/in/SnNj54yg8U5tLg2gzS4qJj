Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Weed Eater WE EL-13TNE is an <a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">electric string trimmer</a> that has average power and speed. It doesn&#39;t adjust to your height, but you can move the front-facing handle up or down to help you find a comfortable fit. You can also alter the angle at which you&#39;re cutting the grass to achieve different effects such as edging, trimming and scalping.","The electric weed eater uses 4.3 amperes (amps) to power its motor and it runs at 7,800 rotations per minute (RPMs). This is enough power for light-duty trimming and edging. Several of the electric weed eaters we reviewed have more power and speed, but this electric string trimmer still gets the job done.","It&#39;s made for light duty and is one of the lightest electric string trimmers we reviewed. It weighs in at 5.2 pounds. Unlike many of the products we reviewed, this electric weed eater lists its height, which is 45 inches, or 3.75 feet. However, the Weed Eater WE EL-13TNE doesn&#39;t adjust in height.","This electric weed whacker uses is the standard 0.065-inch line. It uses automatic feed to advance the single line. Its cutting diameter is 13 inches. You don&#39;t have to worry about accidentally cutting into your shrubs or trimming off your flower heads because it has an edge guard that helps you keep track of where your line is. To keep you moving, this electric string trimmer comes with a cord-retention hook in the top handle. This retention hook allows you to connect your extension cord to avoid putting stress on the cord that would unplug it from the weed eater.","It comes with a straight shaft to help you get trimming done under low decks and in other hard-to-reach areas. You can convert the electric weed eater into an edger by pressing the button on the head of the trimmer and twisting the head 180 degrees clockwise. The manual illustrates how to trim, scalp, mow, edge and sweep with your trimmer by adjusting the angle at which you hold it.","Although you can&#39;t change the height of this weed eater, you can adjust the position of the front-facing handle. This electric string trimmer comes with two handles to help you maintain control over where the trimmer head moves. Having two handles also distributes the small amount of weight between both handles so it&#39;s easier to hold for longer periods.","There&#39;s more assembly required with this electric weed eater than you&#39;ll find with most of the other string trimmers we reviewed. Most of the assembly requires connecting pieces with bolts and doesn&#39;t take much time. Once you assemble it, you won&#39;t need any tools to change out the spool.","Poulan, the manufacturer of the Weed Eater WE EL-13TNE, has a repair and parts telephone number and a link to the manual online. Although it is a parts and repair number, the customer service at Poulan was able to answer general questions we had about the product. The manual has clear instructions and easy-to-understand illustrations. The warranty lasts for two years. It covers defects in the workmanship and manufacturing. It doesn&#39;t cover reasonable wear and tear, however."]},"id":"3b6e30c2-2771-4b9f-b1ae-19fda64698db","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3a37d8b7-cd22-45b2-9c8c-8e465dec8a6d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Weed Eater WE EL-13TNE<strong> </strong>electric string trimmer works as both a trimmer and an edger.
