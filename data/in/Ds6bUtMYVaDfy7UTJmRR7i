The Swivel <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-cheap-usb-flash-drives\">USB flash drive</a> is available in six memory capacities: 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB, all in classic black. It comes with a key string and Imation Disk Manager Software for Windows.","Imation is concerned about security. In fact, the company just acquired IronKey&#39;s secure data-storage hardware business. This partnership will allow Imation to increase the capabilities of its secure USB devices and move into cloud-based security services as well. We will keep our eye on Imation.","The Imation Swivel is a USB 2.0 device that is backwards compatible to USB 1.1. If you have older devices, you might benefit from this backwards compatibility. It has a convenient keychain or lanyard loop and a cap-less, swivel design. It is a tad larger than other USB drives at just less than 1 ounce in weight and 2.2 inches long. However, this slightly increased size is irrelevant to its performance.","This USB drive is TAA compliant and CE, C-Tick and FCC certified. TAA compliant means that it is assembled in the U.S. and approved to be purchased for U.S. government use. The device has also been tested to ensure that it complies with FCC rules part 15, which means that it does not cause harmful interference via radio frequency energy. These certifications may not mean much to the average consumer, but they do prove that Imation has taken the effort to make certain that its products meet or exceed these stringent quality standards.","The Disk Manager Software that is compatible with the USB drive does not include encryption software, but it does include other useful security features. The disk management software can help you create drive partitions that are password protected, as well as set up password protection for specific files. These tools can protect your data should you lose your drive. The security software is also helpful if you share the USB drive, since you can limit other users&#39; access to your files. Unfortunately, the security software is not Mac or Linux compatible.","The Imation Swivel can share files with systems running the following operating systems: Windows ME, 2000, XP, Vista, 7 and 8, Mac OS 9+ and Linux 2.4+. The disk management software is compatible with Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7 and 8.","This flash drive comes with a five-year warranty. Imation reports that your data will be stored safely for up to 10 years. Should you need technical assistance, you can contact Imation by telephone or email. The company does not provide chat support, but you can follow Imation on Twitter or Facebook if you would like to stay abreast of company news and emerging products. On the Imation website, you can read helpful FAQs and explore the company&#39;s warranty offerings."]},"id":"8942587f-993a-449b-a868-bbe73cf282b6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"be0f68b8-0f3b-45dd-839c-bc70b7fec33a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Imation Swivel is the best USB 2.0 flash drive that we reviewed.
