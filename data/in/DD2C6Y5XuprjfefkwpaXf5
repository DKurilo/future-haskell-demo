Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/smart-home/best-smoke-detectors/\">Smoke Detectors</a> here.</em>","The BRK 7020B is one of only two products in our lineup of best smoke detectors to include a safety light that can guide your way to safety in the event of a fire. A hardwired smoke alarm, it plugs directly into your home’s electrical wiring. It comes with a photoelectric sensor and is backed by a 10-year manufacturer warranty.","Since photoelectric sensors are better at detecting large particles in the air, the BRK 7020B can alert you to a smoldering fire long before it bursts into flame. Its alarm sounds off at 85 decibels, which is the standard for all wired and wireless smoke detectors sold in the U.S. This device comes with a single button that can be used to silence an alarm or test an alarm. The escape light bulb cannot be replaced but is covered by the alarm’s 10-year warranty.","Because hardwired smoke detectors are able to interconnect with one another, the BRK 7020B brings added safety by sounding all alarms if only one of them goes off. This makes it easier to hear if an alarm goes off in a back room or in your garage where you might otherwise miss it. A flashing LED on the detector’s front face indicates which alarm was tripped so that you can find the source of the smoke quickly. This smoke detector can interconnect with up to 18 compatible BRK devices.","In the event of a power outage, the BRK 7020B continues to operate by way of battery backup. This is provided through a single 9-volt battery that will ensure the unit continues to operate until power is restored. Because it doesn’t rely on battery power 24/7, battery drainage is minimal – however, it is strongly recommended that you replace the battery in the smoke alarm at last once per year. If the battery begins to die before then, the unit will alert you by sounding a chirp once every 60 seconds.","BRK offers some of the most comprehensive help and support, which includes telephone and email for troubleshooting issues or asking questions. There is also a variety of online literature available, including downloadable user manuals and FAQs."]},"id":"32ecf776-8281-47a0-8f39-e65cb8b7e8c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"65efe62b-dec0-48f9-b361-54730f6d3043","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Equipped with a photoelectric sensor which detects smoldering fires and an escape light that can illuminate the way to safety in fire, the BRK 7020B is a device that’s highly capable of alerting you to the presence of smoke in your home.
