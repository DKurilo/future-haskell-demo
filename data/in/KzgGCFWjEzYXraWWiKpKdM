Clicking on the buy button will take you to this new version for purchase. We will test and review this new version when next we update the Mac Photo Editing software reviews. Until then, enjoy our review for ACDSee Photo Studio for Mac 4.</em>","ACDSee Photo Studio for Mac Pro has a variety of basic and advanced photo editing tools you can use to enhance your photos. You can crop, rotate and straighten your photos, as well as alter their color, saturation, hue and lightness. The software uses sliders, so you can easily adjust the color and level of intensity.","ACDSee sells this Mac program for $99.99, though you can often find the company selling it for less through promotions. We couldn&#39;t find this software selling anywhere on Amazon, so you&#39;ll have to purchase from the manufacturer. If you&#39;re unsure about this software, check it out using the 30-day free trial."," The <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">photo editor for Mac</a> only provides 2 creative filters to apply to your photos. While you can add a sepia tone or convert your photo to black and white, it would be nice to have a wider variety of filters to choose from. It also lacks several advanced editing tools such as panoramic photo, HDR image, cloning and makeover tools.","While this Mac photo editor offers a limited number of editing tools, it has a built-in photo organizer. The program helps you categorize and keep track of thousands of photos. You can search for images, view EXIF information, give ratings and create your own albums to organize your photos in a way that makes sense to you.","The software also automatically scans for and imports picture files to your hard drive when you plug in an external device. This picture editor imports common file types, including RAW, JPG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, PSD and PDF files.","This software does not offer direct sharing capabilities. While you can still share your photos with others through email attachments or transferring via memory card, the application does not directly post your photos to social media sites, photo galleries or even your email. ACDSee&#39;s SeeDrive Cloud Storage costs extra, so you&#39;ll need to pay a subscription if you want to store your photos on this cloud service.","We compared the PC version of this software to the Mac version and found that the latter is lacking many of the tools you&#39;ll find in the PC version. There are no background removal tools, no painting and drawing brushes, no HDR guide, and worst of all, no layers. This means you won&#39;t be able to quickly select specific sections of your project and manipulate them. <br/>ACD Systems offers several support options for its Mac photo editing software. You can always access the user guide from within the application. The website also gives you access to a FAQs page and user forum. If you still have questions, you can email or call technical support representatives.","ACDSee Mac Pro serves as a good option for basic photo editing. The software is easy to use and includes standard tools to help you edit your photos. It also has a robust photo organizer that helps you manage your photos. While the software has few advanced editing tools and no sharing capabilities, you can use it to perform quality basic edits like cropping, red eye removal and color adjustments. We recommend using a photo editor with a more robust toolset, like <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-mac-photo-editing-software/cyberlink-photodirector-review\">CyberLink PhotoDirector</a>."]},"id":"4ee97111-48c8-4876-bb2c-a5d38eb6c14f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57836","url":"/acdsee-mac-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-18T19:10:39Z","datePublished":"2013-10-18T19:10:39Z","name":"ACDSee Photo Studio for Mac 4","synopsis":"Editor's Note: A new version of ACDSee Photo Studio for Mac is now available.
