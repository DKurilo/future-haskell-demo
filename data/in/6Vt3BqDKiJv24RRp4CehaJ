Its customer service team is bright and bubbly, always on hand to answer questions, take care of problems or provide recommendations. It’s a company that’s honest about what it does well and equally honest about what it doesn’t: Instead of trying to sell you a mobile hotspot that probably won’t work very well for you, considering the company’s pricey data tiers, Ting actively recommends going with a different company – but still provides a hotspot if you’d rather stick with them. These are moves that just don’t happen elsewhere.","It’s also a company that’s hitting its first real competition and falling behind as a result. It pioneered an easy, bucket-based system for selling minutes, texts and data to low-usage customers, but in the past couple years, US Mobile has cribbed the system and one-upped it with slightly lower prices and a prepaid, rather than post-paid, model.","Yes, Ting is post-paid. It may seem an odd inclusion in our lineup, given that we’re comparing the best prepaid cell phone plans in America, but Ting’s cheap prices make it the perfect fit and kept it near the top of our rankings for quite some time. Now that unlimited plans are becoming even more prevalent, it’s not quite as appealing as it used to be, especially when US Mobile does almost everything Ting does, only better.","All Ting plans charge for minutes, texts and data separately. You pay $6 a month for line access, on top of which you’re charged in buckets depending on how high your talk, text and data usage was for the month. For example, if you don’t talk or use data but text like a madman, you’re only charged for those texts. This makes Ting great for light users: If you use less than 100 minutes of talk time, less than 100 texts and less than 100 MB of data (but still use a little of each), you fall into the lowest, $3 buckets for each service, and your monthly bill will be just $15 – $6 for line access and another $9 for activity.","Ting’s problem is that it has been outpriced. US Mobile only charges $2 for line access, $2 for 100 texts and $2 for 100MB of data. That $15 price tag for minimal service on Ting? It would only be $9 with US Mobile. If you want at least 500 minutes of talk time, 1,000 texts and 1GB of data, it’ll cost you $36 at Ting but just $29 at US Mobile – and US Mobile gives you an extra 250 minutes to use.","The fact is, Ting’s no longer set apart by its low-usage rates; today, its claim to fame is its customer service, and rightfully so – the company actually works with you to pick a great prepaid smartphone that matches your budget and works on one of its networks. It doesn’t have an official return policy, but we’ve seen evidence of it taking great care of customers who’ve had problems with devices."]},"id":"6de3c6ae-99c3-430c-94c2-2821db6d0e8b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2db1e3aa-f3ac-4b15-be74-cb87606e1be7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The question of whether to pick Ting is almost more philosophical than it is practical.
