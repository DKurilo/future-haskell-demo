It helps dry your carpets faster, which is exactly what you want in a carpet cleaner. It also got tough stains out – both dirt and grape juice that had time to set in. This machine uses six small scrubbers underneath to get out dark, deeply set stains. In addition to the stain we created, this <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaner</a> also brightened and refreshed the strip of carpet we didn’t intentionally stain.","It also got more water out of the carpet than most of the competition. There were only a couple that extracted more water during testing.","Most carpet cleaners don’t offer much in the way of maneuverability – back and forth is what you can expect –  but this one seemed particularly clunky at times, and it is well above the average weight among the machines we tested in our comparison.","This machine is easy to clean – including the nozzle. You can pop it off from the top of the cleaner’s head and then rinse it under running water to loosen any trapped dirt or hair. The lint screens are also easy to access. Cleaning out the dirty water tank and the clean water tank are a cinch because of their design. We were able to reach in and pull any stubborn pieces of pet fur out of nooks and crannies.","This cleaner has the widest cleaning path of any machine in our comparison, so you clean bigger areas of your floors and therefore finish cleaning faster. Also, the tank on this unit is one of the bigger ones, so you can clean more before having to refill. We found that we were able to clean about 100 square feet with one full tank. ","It also has a separate tank for the carpet shampoo; it automatically mixes the solution with water to clean your carpets. This means that you can switch a knob from wash to rinse so you can rinse your carpets immediately. ","Most carpet cleaners give you a stretch hose along with attachments that you can add to the end and use to clean other surfaces. This cleaner offers one of the longest reaches with its 9-foot hose, but you only get one attachment in the box: an upholstery tool. Like every carpet cleaner in our comparison, this one includes a sample bottle of carpet cleaning solution. ","This carpet cleaner includes a limited 2-year warranty that will cover defects in workmanship or parts. You can also find a service center near you on its website, along with tutorials on how to assemble, use and clean your carpet cleaning unit."]},"id":"884129de-ad21-4492-850b-443ec53cac78","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58130","url":"/hoover-max-extract-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T16:18:59Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T16:18:59Z","name":"Hoover Max Extract 60 Pressure Pro","synopsis":"The Hoover Max Extract 60 Pressure Pro has user-friendly components, such as its easy-to-fill clean water tank and separate tank for detergent, which lets you apply cleaning solution and water to a strip of carpet, extract and then follow that up with a rinse without having to stop to refill.","review":{"rating":72,"verdict":"This is a heavy and expensive machine, but the cleaning performance was quite good, if a little slow.","pros":["This was one of the best machines at extracting water and leaving carpets dry."],"cons":["Only one accessory is included for the hose attachment."]},"strapline":"The Hoover Max Extract 60 Pressure Pro has user-friendly components, such as its easy-to-fill clean water tank and separate tank for detergent, which lets you apply cleaning solution and water to a strip of carpet, extract and then follow that up with a rinse without having to stop to refill.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-05T00:00:00Z","id":"CspM7YkohnnCZGgeuDbChZ","meta":{"title":"Hoover SteamVac Max Extract Pressure Pro 60 Carpet Cleaner Review","description":"This is a heavy and expensive machine, but the cleaning performance was quite good, if a little slow."},"products":[{"slug":"hoover-max-extract-60-pressure-pro","url":"/product/hoover-max-extract-60-pressure-pro","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","name":"Hoover Max Extract 60 Pressure Pro","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","id":"bmYKBB84Sh3ARcuw8Vgg6F","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LqBKoxssXoftP2JxrxWu5R.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"073cfc46d7de8e702a126af195e6717a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/073cfc46d7de8e702a126af195e6717a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","id":"LqBKoxssXoftP2JxrxWu5R","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LqBKoxssXoftP2JxrxWu5R.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Hoover SteamVac Max Extract Pressure Pro 60 Carpet Cleaner Review","description":"This is a heavy and expensive machine, but the cleaning performance was quite good, if a little slow."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LqBKoxssXoftP2JxrxWu5R.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"073cfc46d7de8e702a126af195e6717a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/073cfc46d7de8e702a126af195e6717a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","id":"LqBKoxssXoftP2JxrxWu5R","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LqBKoxssXoftP2JxrxWu5R.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Hoover SteamVac Max Extract Pressure Pro 60 Carpet Cleaner Review","description":"This is a heavy and expensive machine, but the cleaning performance was quite good, if a little slow."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-carpet-cleaners/hoover-max-extract-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"cleaning","url":"/home-and-garden/cleaning","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","name":"Cleaning","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","id":"g3KQ7Pcm4GfzdEDqfZcVVR","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"product-tenancy-hoover-max-extract-60-pressure-pro","url":"/product-tenancy-hoover-max-extract-60-pressure-pro","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","name":"Product Tenancy Hoover Max Extract 60 Pressure Pro","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:08Z","id":"2RpJ7EUjwFLeYaMYfBUVoh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"control","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
