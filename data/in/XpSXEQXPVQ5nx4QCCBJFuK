Jawbone originally developed this technology for the military so that soldiers could effectively communicate despite the noisy atmosphere of helicopters, vehicles and gunfire. It uses voice activity sensors that rest against your jaw to measure vibrations in order to delineate your voice from background noises. It proved worthy of the NoiseAssassin moniker in our noise reduction tests, effectively suppressing almost all of the background noises.","The Era is one of the few headsets that automatically adjusts the volume of your call to compensate for background noises. However, even in the updated Era version, this feature can be unreliable. Everyone hears differently, and the auto-adjust has no way of knowing if the volume is right for your ears.
