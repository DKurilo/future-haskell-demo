Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Of all the <a href=\"/best-driver-update-software\">driver update software</a> we reviewed, from the best on down, DriverCure is the least impressive. It may not be truly abysmal in any single category, but from its feature set to its scan results, it lacks any redeeming qualities that set it apart from the competition. There are plenty of great options available for those hunting for a decent driver checker; DriverCure simply isn&#39;t one of them.","The fundamental purpose of a driver finder is to help you track down outdated drivers and update them. Unfortunately, in our scans DriverCure failed to find all but a handful of updates. It spotted just one of our test PC&#39;s numerous motherboard drivers; a bundle of USB drivers that was also identified by just about every other program we tested; and the computer&#39;s Ethernet driver. It missed updates for the video card, the audio controller, the hard drives, the PCI express chipsets, cameras, printers – the list goes on. For a piece of software that&#39;s designed to locate and fix outdated drivers, DriverCure didn&#39;t do a very good job.","Nor is performance in our tests the only area in which it was deficient. We expect any decent driver updater to have a helpful toolset, and the best are feature-packed. DriverCure doesn&#39;t even offer the version number or release date for the drivers it recommends you download – there&#39;s no way to verify whether it&#39;s suggesting the right fixes for you. Likewise, it doesn&#39;t offer backup and restore tools, so you can&#39;t backup your existing drivers in case something goes wrong during installation – a common occurrence when dealing with system-level software like device drivers.","Even in its service and support, DriverCure is sub-par. The program isn&#39;t compatible with Windows 8, and its help and support team can only be reached via e-mail – there&#39;s no phone number you can call or hotline you can reach if you need assistance. You can find the answers to a few basic questions on the company&#39;s FAQs page, but if you&#39;re looking for more in-depth assistance, you&#39;ll need to submit an email request and wait for a response."]},"id":"df040e0c-a041-4375-8052-f2fd0ae027da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1c80c024-4f9a-4105-8c0e-f4e757146f61","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In our search for the best driver software around, DriverCure falls dead last.
