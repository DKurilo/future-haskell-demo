This purifier offers a four-stage filtration system that offers maximum cleaning for the indoors. However, this unit uses its PlasmaTrue ionizer to charge particles as they exit the purifier, which may be harmful to sensitive lungs. The ionizer cannot be disabled, so we cannot recommend the AeraMax DX95 to individuals with respiratory problems.","This air purification system has a four-stage filtration process that begins with a carbon pre-filter that removes odors and captures large particles. The True HEPA filter then removes small particles from the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke and allergens. Air passes through the AeraSafe antimicrobial treatment to reduce the growth of bacteria on the True HEPA filter. Finally, the PlasmaTrue ionizer charges escaping particles as they leave the filter so that they will get caught on the next pass through the AeraMax DX95. This filtration system effectively removes indoor pollutants in medium-size rooms.","It is important to note that the EPA warns against using ionizers heavily, as charged particles can be harmful to lungs, especially for individuals with breathing-related issues. Air filters with permanent ionizers typically have an operational timer or scheduler that lets you set the machine to operate at specific times, like when you&#39;re away from home, to help limit exposure to charged particles. The AeraMax DX95 doesn&#39;t offer these features, which means you have to manually turn the unit on or off as you see fit.","This home air purifier has an auto mode, which is the default setting when you first turn on the appliance. An air-quality sensor determines the level of pollutants in the air and adjusts the fan accordingly. You can manually adjust the fan speed if you prefer, but we found the auto mode efficiently reduces pollutants on its own. The AeraMax DX95 also has a filter monitor to help you determine when it&#39;s time to replace your filters.","On the Fellowes website, you can read through the FAQs section and download a new user manual. If you need personal help, customer support representatives are available by email and phone. Finally, the AeraMax DX95 comes with a three-year warranty."]},"id":"6825109b-d3ee-4be5-ac35-1f72d111f5cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cfcb2559-3f69-494e-a0b1-c246a30923b9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Fellowes AeraMax DX95 is an ionizing air purifier that effectively cleans air in mid-size rooms.
