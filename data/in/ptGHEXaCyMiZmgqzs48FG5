You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","MONI, formerly Monitronics, is a national alarm monitoring company with authorized dealers across the country. It provides <a href=\"/best-home-security-monitoring\">home security monitoring</a>, equipment and installation for homes. With a variety of customer service resources comparable to other top-rated companies, MONI has earned a spot on our list of the best home security monitoring companies. Its years of experience contribute to its reputation.","MONI Smart Security’s contracts and monitoring fees are typical of the alarm system industry. For example, the $39.99 monthly monitoring fee and $99 starting costs match the average among most home security companies. To build on this, all of MONI&#39;s monitoring plans have three-year contracts, which is also average among the companies we reviewed.","If you cancel early, MONI requires you to pay 80 percent of your account balance upon termination. The company&#39;s return policy gives you a meager three days to return your equipment without any fees. This is quite short compared with companies like LiveWatch and ADT, which respectively give you one year and six months to return your equipment.","Recently, MONI Smart Security started offering monitoring services to owners of the Nest Secure DIY home security system. The unique thing about using MONI with Nest Secure is you have both month-to-month and three-year contract options. The month-to-month service costs $29 each month, while the contract option only costs $19. The Nest Secure system is not as full-featured as MONI&#39;s professional options but is a good alternative to get lower monitoring fees.","This company has all the typical necessities in its home security monitoring service. As a 24/7/365 company, MONI can protect you by landline, cellular connection or VoIP. As is standard now, if you are willing to pay a bit more each month for the service, the company throws in interactive access and home automation. MONI sends a technician to your home to install equipment, which can be convenient if you are unable to install equipment on your own – something home security companies like Link Interactive require you do.","With interactive monitoring, you can check the status of your system and even make changes to it while you are away from home. MONI does this through Alarm.com, which several other companies use as well. Alarm.com also provides remote access control over your home&#39;s lighting, thermostat and more when you automate them through MONI.","MONI breaks its systems down into three main plans: Core, Connected and Comprehensive. Each of the plans comes with basic equipment, but the two higher plans allow you to add a variety of devices, such as video cameras, thermostats and lighting controls. As with most home security companies, you can customize your system to your house to accommodate your personal needs. MONI also offers takeover monitoring plans, so you can use the existing equipment in your home with the system.","MONI provides 24/7 customer support by phone, live chat, social media and an email form. However, the email form isn&#39;t specific to customer support. When we called MONI to find out about the availability of a service plan, we were unable to obtain information without signing up for a new service. The customer service number on the company&#39;s website redirects you to a sales specialist. MONI provides lifetime warranty coverage on its equipment as long as you have an active monitoring plan, which is much longer than the industry average of three years.","MONI&#39;s home security monitoring service is worth looking into, especially when you consider the company&#39;s extensive customer support resources. It also offers useful monitoring plans and a variety of equipment. Its monitoring isn&#39;t as affordable as that of other services we looked at but is still competitive within the industry."]},"id":"5ad8327c-0048-4a74-ba5b-efc209b2d577","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51396","url":"/monitronics-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-11-16T17:12:00Z","datePublished":"2010-11-16T17:12:00Z","name":"MONI (now Brinks) Core","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is now Brinks Home Security.","review":{"rating":93,"verdict":"MONI Smart Security has excellent technical support resources, though its contract isn&#039;t the most competitive we&#039;ve seen.","pros":["The company&#039;s customer support resources are extensive and available 24/7."],"cons":["MONI requires customers pay 80 percent of the remaining balance when canceling a contract early."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is now Brinks Home Security.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-08T00:00:00Z","id":"ptGHEXaCyMiZmgqzs48FG5","meta":{"title":"MONI HomeTouch Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"MONI Smart Security has excellent technical support resources, though its contract isn&#039;t the most competitive we&#039;ve seen."},"products":[{"slug":"moni-now-brinks-core","url":"/product/moni-now-brinks-core","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","name":"MONI (now Brinks) Core","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","id":"fwUPcmZK9J7LJKDRwufLp3","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fmCHdG4xE9xtUhf8zbpYwY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","mimeType":"","name":"b2c84fbb8a719cfaaaf027bb427133c4.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b2c84fbb8a719cfaaaf027bb427133c4.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","id":"fmCHdG4xE9xtUhf8zbpYwY","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmCHdG4xE9xtUhf8zbpYwY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"MONI HomeTouch Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"MONI Smart Security has excellent technical support resources, though its contract isn&#039;t the most competitive we&#039;ve seen."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fmCHdG4xE9xtUhf8zbpYwY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","mimeType":"","name":"b2c84fbb8a719cfaaaf027bb427133c4.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b2c84fbb8a719cfaaaf027bb427133c4.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","id":"fmCHdG4xE9xtUhf8zbpYwY","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmCHdG4xE9xtUhf8zbpYwY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"MONI HomeTouch Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"MONI Smart Security has excellent technical support resources, though its contract isn&#039;t the most competitive we&#039;ve seen."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/smart-home/best-home-security-monitoring/monitronics-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"security","url":"/home-and-garden/security","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","name":"Security","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:40:25Z","id":"S72GevTPy4i8qUbbeJywuG","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
