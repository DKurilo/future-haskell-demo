You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The XP1000 espresso machine, part of the Krups Steam series, is good for brewing a rich cup of espresso. This steam <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a> is a little less powerful than other espresso machines, so it will take a bit longer to heat up so you can make your java. However, by making your own espresso at home, you will save the money that you would otherwise spend at the local coffee shop.","When using this espresso maker, you have the option to make between one and four cups at a time. This is a nice feature to have if you are brewing espresso for friends or family. It is also nice if you just cannot stop at one cup of cappuccino yourself. Because you can brew more than one cup at a time, you will also be spending less money than you would if you were to purchase more than one cappuccino at a coffee house.","A great feature of this cappuccino maker is that it comes with a dishwasher-safe carafe. This handy feature allows you to quickly clean up after making a rich latte since  you won&#39;t have to hand clean the container.","In order to get the best cup of cappuccino, you must tamp the coffee grounds and spread them evenly in the filter. This will keep grounds from slipping through the sides of the filter and into your latte. The Krups XP1000 does not come with a tamping tool so you will have to purchase one separately.","If you need to contact the customer service team at Krups, you can do it by filling out an email contact form on the company&#39;s website. However, if you would like to speak to someone on the telephone, you can also contact its customer service department by telephone Monday through Friday. We are disappointed that the company does not provide a list of FAQs; however, it does offer product manuals for your espresso machine that you can download from its website. Krups also offers a two-year warranty for the XP1000."]},"id":"de76fdbb-7f55-4bb4-9f7b-18d9b78a14df","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1506f350-b1da-4653-8ed5-f32095b228c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Krups XP Steam series machines are compact cappuccino makers that fit nicely on most any countertop.
