Esky Crank Radio is compact and has a decent hand crank, but it did not fare well in our reception tests compared to the best <a href=\"/best-crank-radios\">crank radios</a>. It also had the worst charge time in our test group – we left it plugged in for more than 14 hours, and it never reached a full charge. It is, however, the most affordable radio we reviewed, so if you are looking to add a crank radio to your emergency preparedness kit and want to spend less than $20, this is your best option.","In our tests, the Esky Crank Radio’s hand crank generated an average of four and a half minutes of battery life during the two minutes we turned it at a rate of 120 revolutions per minute. That is average for the radios we tested but better than every other model under $40. This is one of the smaller radios we tested, and its size had an adverse effect – we had to grip it awkwardly to turn the crank.","The Esky’s nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery lasted eight hours and 15 minutes when we played the radio at its maximum volume. That is above average for our test group, and it could potentially last longer if you get a radio that can reach a full charge. We left ours plugged into a wall socket for more than 14 hours, and it never reached a full battery.","This radio received the worst scores in our reception tests, but it projected this poor-quality sound at one of the loudest volumes in our test group. Its analog tuner dial made it hard to find good reception for specific radio stations compared to crank radios with digital tuners. We received the same NOAA weather alerts with this Esky as we did with all the other models we tested, but they lacked clarity compared to the best radios.","The Esky Crank Radio has a USB port you can use to charge your mobile devices. That, along with its IPX3 water-resistance rating and compact design, makes it a good fit if you plan to take your crank radio on hikes or camping trips. In addition, its solar charger comes in handy on long trips because the radio doesn’t take disposable batteries as a power source in case the built-in rechargeable one stops working.","Esky includes a one-year warranty, which is average for emergency radios. If you have a question about your radio, you can only contact the manufacturer by email. When we reached out with questions, it took four business days to receive an unhelpful response."]},"id":"e7e21f0d-9592-4625-821c-2b3858c9b4b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69573","url":"/esky-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-08-15T20:02:26Z","datePublished":"2017-08-15T20:02:26Z","name":"Esky ES-CR01","synopsis":"The Esky Crank Radio is compact and has a decent hand crank, but it did not fare well in our reception tests compared to the best crank radios.
