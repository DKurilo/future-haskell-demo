Also, when we compared its plans’ benefits, we found it is one of the most cost-effective services available.","Like most roadside assistance companies, National General offers plans with different service levels. Its basic plan costs $59 a year, which is about $5 a month. That price is competitive and well below average. If you want to add someone to the plan, the annual price increases by $10.","National General’s basic plan is more limited than similar plans from its competitors. You get 5 miles of free towing, which is relatively standard and should be sufficient if your car breaks down in a city. The plan also includes coverage for jump starts, flat tires, fuel delivery, winching and lockout services. It reimburses you $60 for lock replacement, which is about average.","One of National General’s biggest drawbacks is how it limits the number of times you can use roadside assistance each year. You get three service calls on the basic plan, no matter the number of people covered on your subscription. Some other roadside assistance companies, such as <a href=\"/good-sam-roadside-assistance-review\">Good Sam</a>, don’t limit the number of times you can use their services.","National General’s Elite plan has higher service limits and only costs $89 a year, or slightly more than $7 a month, which makes it one of the most affordable options we saw. It costs $10 to add another person to your plan, or you can add your entire family for an additional $30. The Elite plan includes up to 100 miles of free towing, $130 worth of locksmith reimbursement and all the standard roadside assistance features included in the basic plan.","Furthermore, if you are in an accident or your car breaks down 100 miles or more from your home, the Elite plan reimburses you up to $750 for meals, lodging and car rentals. This limit is lower than it is with other companies, which typically reimburse about $1,500 for trip interruption. However, it doesn’t restrict how much you can be reimbursed for a single incident. The Elite plan limits you to four claims per year if you are the only person on the plan, five claims for a couple and seven claims for a family."]},"id":"22a591a6-794b-433d-a746-9f5ec81fb843","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67790","url":"/gm-motor-club-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-04-13T19:02:29Z","datePublished":"2016-04-13T19:02:29Z","name":"National General Motor Club","synopsis":"National General Motor Club is one of the less expensive roadside assistance services we reviewed.","review":{"rating":91,"verdict":"National General Motor Club&#8217;s premium plan has one of the lowest prices we saw and includes generous benefits.","pros":["National General reimburses you up to $130 for locksmith services."],"cons":["You get a limited number of service calls each year."]},"strapline":"National General Motor Club is one of the less expensive roadside assistance services we reviewed.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","id":"kLPbueSZqCoZtXfPSbfhjL","meta":{"title":"National General Motor Club Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"National General Motor Club&#8217;s premium plan has one of the lowest prices we saw and includes generous benefits."},"products":[{"slug":"national-general-motor-club","url":"/product/national-general-motor-club","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","name":"National General Motor Club","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","id":"a5XckfDzvAie2RBNJCDZjN","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dx7QCcUuh8iXnCWNvhJsR6.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"2db84e28c5e0990da635829cbd9d3cca.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/2db84e28c5e0990da635829cbd9d3cca.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","id":"dx7QCcUuh8iXnCWNvhJsR6","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dx7QCcUuh8iXnCWNvhJsR6.jpg","alt":""},"title":"National General Motor Club Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"National General Motor Club&#8217;s premium plan has one of the lowest prices we saw and includes generous benefits."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dx7QCcUuh8iXnCWNvhJsR6.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"2db84e28c5e0990da635829cbd9d3cca.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/2db84e28c5e0990da635829cbd9d3cca.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","id":"dx7QCcUuh8iXnCWNvhJsR6","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dx7QCcUuh8iXnCWNvhJsR6.jpg","alt":""},"title":"National General Motor Club Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"National General Motor Club&#8217;s premium plan has one of the lowest prices we saw and includes generous benefits."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/auto/best-roadside-assistance-services/gm-motor-club-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:30:40Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
