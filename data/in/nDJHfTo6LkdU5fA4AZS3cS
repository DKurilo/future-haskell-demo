The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-mixers\"><em>mixers here</em></a><em>.</em>","The Bosch Universal Mixer is one of the most powerful mixers we reviewed. The 800-watt motor on this <a href=\"/best-mixers\">kitchen mixer</a> has the power to handle 15 cups of flour at a time. This can save you time in the kitchen and spare your arm the fatigue from mixing heavy batches of dough by hand.","For the bread making extraordinaire, there is no need to look any further. This lightweight kitchen mixer has no shortage of power. The 800-watt motor can mix even the toughest dough without a hitch. This stand mixer isn’t flashy and won’t ‘Wow’ you with its design, but it will power through any mix you need.","Unlike the best stand mixers we reviewed, The Bosch Universal Mixer’s arms are attached to the middle of the bowl. This design turns out to be a bit of an inconvenience.  If the instructions in your recipe call for adding ingredients throughout the mixing process, be prepared for a mess. This design doesn’t mix the ingredients in during the process; rather it seems to kick them out, making a mess.","Though the attachments are dishwasher safe, this cake mixer is not as easy as others to mix. Your mixtures tend to get caught in the middle column, which is a bit inconvenient to clean, and if you add ingredients during the mixing process, you will have to clean your kitchen as well.","Included with this mixer is a bowl scraper, double beater and dough hook. Though there isn’t a pasta maker attachment, this electric mixer is versatile to say the least. Sold separately are attachments such as a juicer, food grinder and slicer/shredder combo.","The manufacturer’s website has all of the information you will need if you ever have any questions about your Bosch Universal Mixer. You can choose to extend your warranty from one to two years if you want more coverage. Furthermore, if you are looking for recipe ideas for your mixer, Bosch has a recipe section that will help you get your thought process going."]},"id":"79e4090e-a2a4-4779-b087-e16d8c8a25f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1030ab7b-46c4-4537-bd21-9d4ea653e8a7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are a bread-making wizard in the kitchen, the Bosch Universal Mixer is for you.
