You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hoover Air series of vacuum cleaners are powerful lightweight machines that make cleaning carpets easy. We wrote our review about the Hoover Air Pro Bagless upright for its stand out cleaning performance and design.  This powerful upright has no problem lifting embedded debris and pet hair. The Hoover Air Pro Bagless Upright operates by using 12 small cyclones that create airflow. This <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaner</a> uses cyclonic air to create suction just as a cyclone has enough force to lift objects.","This vacuum comes equipped with a reusable HEPA filter, so when the filter gets dirty, you just rinse it off, let it dry and put it back in. This will save you money because you do not have to buy expensive replacement filters, but it will not screen out microscopic allergens as well as paper HEPA filters do, so it is not ideal if you have severe allergies.","This upright vacuum cleaner does not have a sealed system. Each compartment of the vacuum is not secured with a seal, and as a result, air can escape while it is running. When air leaks through the seams of the machine, microscopic allergens and pollen the vacuum has picked up can be dispersed back into your home.","The Hoover Air is easy to maneuver and has three channels of suction, giving it triple the power of other cleaners. It has an automatic height adjustment, so it cleans all flooring types. There is also a shut-off button for the brush roller. This feature lets you turn off the roller when you clean hardwood flooring, which prevents debris from scattering and also keeps the brush from scratching the floor.","This machine is equipped with two automatic shut off features. The roller automatically stops if you run over an object. The vacuum cleaner is also equipped with a thermal protection shut off. That means if there is a clog or if the bag is full, the machine will shut down to protect the motor from overheating, ensuring its long life.","The machine weighs an impressively light 15.6 pounds, and the cord is 30 feet long. The cord length is passable, but the best upright vacuum cleaners have longer cords so that you do not have to interrupt your cleaning to switch electrical outlets.","This slender machine has a steerable technology that allows you to navigate around corners and furniture by twisting the handle. It boasts a flat-to-floor design so that it can clean under low furniture.","When you purchase this upright vacuum cleaner, you can expect it to come with a complete cleaning kit. It includes a two-in-one crevice tool and a dusting tool for cleaning vents and furniture surfaces. It also includes a turbo tool and an extension wand.","This vacuum comes with a five-year warranty. With service centers in most major cities, you will be able to find local repair services. You can also contact the company by email or by phone. The Hoover website offers informational and instructional videos as well as a FAQs page."]},"id":"dbdf7e18-8d72-4d24-877e-317a24f8a7ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"43313b1d-8b94-4f35-addf-8cb371d91739","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This sleek vacuum is responsive and turns corners with ease.
