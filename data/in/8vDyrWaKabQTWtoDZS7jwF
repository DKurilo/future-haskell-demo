You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When it comes to wireless routers and Wi-Fi range extenders, Netgear is a good bet. The company specializes in designing a variety of effective equipment to provide you with the best wireless internet possible. The Netgear WN3000RP is a popular Wi-Fi booster. It’s reliable, affordable and easy to set up. There are certainly better boosters, but if you have dead spots in your small home or apartment, this is a good option.","Let’s face it – if you live in a small house or apartment and you’re having wireless issues, it could be your router. Swapping out your router with a newer, upgraded model might be the best choice, as a single router with a greater output is better than an old router supplemented by a <a href=\"/best-wi-fi-boosters\">Wi-Fi booster</a>. However, your current router is not always the problem, and a new one can cost more than an extender. In these cases, a simple Wi-Fi booster is the best way to cover those blind spots.","The WN3000RP is an N300 Wi-Fi booster, like the <a href=\"/d-link-review\">D-Link DAP-1330 N300</a>, which means it’s rated for a throughput of 300 Mbps. This isn’t the fastest speed for a wireless range extender, but it’s as fast as you’re going to get with a booster under $30.","It has a simple and effective design – it plugs straight into an outlet and has adjustable antennas to give you the best coverage possible. The setup process is very straight forward. You simply plug it in, hit the WPS button on your router and the corresponding button on the WN3000RP, and you’re ready to go. It’s doesn’t require any special software, though you can use the Netgear app to troubleshoot any issues you have.","One downside to the WN3000RP is it has a single Ethernet port to connect wired devices like printers or gaming consoles. With only one, you’re severely limited, especially if you have several devices you want to connect. If that’s the case, you’ll have to spend more on Wi-Fi booster with more Ethernet ports, as there aren’t any under $30 with more than one port.","There isn’t a lot to the Netgear WN3000RP, which is a good thing if you’re just looking to swing some Wi-Fi into a dead spot in a small home or apartment. While it’s not super-fast and doesn’t have the range of better, more expensive range extenders, its affordability and ease of use make it a good option for simple situations."]},"id":"ff5101fb-73db-436d-85e2-4d59a25f7449","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54347","url":"/netgear-universal-w3000rp-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-01-31T03:07:28Z","datePublished":"2012-01-31T03:07:28Z","name":"Netgear WN3000RP N300","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":25,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-01-31T03:07:28Z","id":"8vDyrWaKabQTWtoDZS7jwF","meta":{"title":"Netgear WN3000RP N300 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Netgear WN3000RP is a reliable N300 Wi-Fi range extender for small homes and apartments.
