When you&#39;re choosing between traditional credit card processing, with a point of sale system setup at a counter, and <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">mobile credit card processing</a> that allows you to accept payments almost anywhere, you should consider the following factors.","<strong>1. Location, location, location.</strong> Convenience is a key dynamic in this decision. Consider where you want to be able to accept payments and which type of service will make it as easy as possible for you to conduct your business.","<strong>Choose a traditional credit card processing setup</strong> when you have a shop or a restaurant and you want to accept payments at a counter. A traditional credit card processing service equipped with a credit card reader, a receipt printer and a cash drawer makes sense because all of your equipment is together in a central location and you can efficiently ring up orders.","<strong>Choose a mobile credit card processing setup</strong> when your business takes you to different locations each day or you conduct your business out of your vehicle. Mobile credit card processing saves you time because you can bill your customers and accept payment from them on the spot rather than having to go back to the office to invoice them and then wait a week or two to receive your money. If you&#39;re selling items at an outdoor market or festival, offering mobile credit card processing means that you won&#39;t have to turn away customers who don&#39;t have cash.","<strong>2. Consider your clientele.</strong> Although most of your customers just want to pay you with cash or credit cards, tech-savvy customers expect you to take payments in any form, including NFC.","<strong>Choose traditional credit card processing</strong> when your customers want to tap and pay with their phones using Apple Pay or Google Wallet. A traditional credit card processing system allows you to add an NFC reader to your service. And, if you want to add another checkout line without the expense of a second register, you can always add mobile credit card processing to your current system. You may even be able to get your service provider to send you a free mobile credit card reader.","<strong>Choose mobile credit card processing</strong> when your business takes you on the road and your customers are happy that you accept more than cash. With mobile credit card processing, you can take all major credit cards and record cash transactions. However, most mobile credit card processing services don&#39;t currently have the ability to accept NFC payments.","You may also be interested in choosing mobile credit card processing when you have a brick and mortar location and you want to dazzle your customers with your sleek mobile credit card readers attached to the latest phones and tablets. You can accessorize with a stand, cash drawer and printer if you want a full-service checkout counter.","<strong>3. It&#39;s all about the money.</strong> Although convenience and technology are definitely aspects worth considering, the determining factor is your bottom line. It&#39;s important to understand how much each type of service will cost you upfront and per month as well as how the right setup can affect your ability to accept revenue.","<strong>Choose traditional credit card processing</strong> when you have the resources to invest in a traditional credit card processing point of sale system and you know that a significant portion of your sales are going to be made using credit cards. In addition to the point of sale equipment, remember that you also have to pay for the service, which typically charges monthly fees for gateway access and statements in addition to a percentage rate and a per-transaction fee.","<strong>Choose mobile credit card processing</strong> when it&#39;s important to be able to accept payments at various locations or when you don&#39;t have much money to invest in a traditional point of sale system. A mobile processing system can also be useful when the majority of your sales are invoiced or your customers are purchasing with cash. Several mobile credit card processing services are perfect for startups or small businesses that are just starting to accept credit cards because they only charge a percentage rate for each transaction, and the mobile credit card readers are often free.","By considering the primary location of your business, the preferences of your clientele and the costs associated with each type of service, you can make the best choice for your business. As always, no matter which type of service and provider you choose, make sure you understand the service terms and exactly how much you&#39;ll be paying for it, both upfront and per month."]},"id":"910728aa-800d-4440-9891-749df9f42d2c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8819","url":"/traditional-vs-mobile-credit-card-processing","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-06T22:01:44Z","datePublished":"2014-10-06T22:01:44Z","name":"Traditional vs. Mobile Credit Card Processing","synopsis":"You've already decided that your small business needs to accept credit cards, so now you need to decide how you're going to make that happen.","review":{},"strapline":"You've already decided that your small business needs to accept credit cards, so now you need to decide how you're going to make that happen.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-13T17:50:01Z","id":"wcTuctQmC7Mv3F5PJahSsC","meta":{"title":"Traditional vs. Mobile Credit Card Processing","description":"Can&#039;t decide which type of credit card processing service is best for your small business?
