This is the company&#39;s first phablet, a pocket-stretching smartphone/tablet hybrid that trades comfort for functionality and raw power. You get a very large screen and a beefy battery when you buy a phablet, but making phone calls can be awkward.","Whether you prefer phablets over smaller smartphones is a matter of personal preference, as both form factors having their advantages and drawbacks. If you&#39;re looking for a more discreet Apple device, there&#39;s always the iPhone 6. But we review phones on their own merits, and the iPhone 6 Plus is unquestionably meritorious.

Part of its success can be traced to two newly introduced technologies: optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus. Optical image stabilization has been around in top smartphones for a while, but it&#39;s new to the iPhone line and exclusive to the iPhone 6 Plus. It takes the familiar digital image stabilization a step further, compensating for hand shake before the camera&#39;s sensor actually captures any light.
