However, iPhone screen protectors can be such a hassle. They can sometimes make you want to throw your phone in frustration. As you try to find an <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1204-best-iphone-7-screen-protectors.html\">iPhone screen protector</a> that is fashionable yet functional, may we suggest some pros and cons, and offer general help, for both PET film and tempered glass screen protectors.","<strong>Scratch Proof   Or Are They?</strong>","Although screen protectors claim they&#39;re scratch resistant, it doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t scratch. Thinner screen protectors are typically made of PET film. Thicker screen protectors are made of tempered glass. Although the glass is harder than the PET film, it can still scratch. It will take more force to scratch it than it would take to scratch the softer, thinner screen protectors. However, if you drop your phone on its tempered-glass screen protector and it slides across the cement, it&#39;s likely your screen protector will be scratched. Still, it&#39;s better your screen protector than your screen, right?","<strong>Warranties</strong>","Many iPhone screen protectors are similar. If you look at the products&#39; specs, you&#39;ll find that the thickness, hardness and other features are practically the same. So what can help you decide? Take a careful look at the warranty options the company offers. Talk to a customer service representative to make sure you understand it fully. The best iPhone screen protectors replace all scratched, cracked or peeling products, regardless of how they got that way.","<strong>Thin Screen Protectors</strong>","<strong>Cons</strong><br/>Very thin screen protectors can be difficult to apply. Some fold and stick on themselves. Others capture air bubbles between the screen and the screen protector.","PET film and other thin screen protectors typically have a distinct feeling to them. When you run your fingers across the screen, they can feel tacky, rubbery or like plastic. While some thin screen protectors feel smooth under your fingers, others feel bumpy and textured.","Thin iPhone screen protectors sometimes also have a textured look to them. You may notice a milky color or small distortions in the picture. However, keep in mind that this isn&#39;t necessarily the case for every thin screen protector.","<strong>Pros</strong><br/>Typically, PET film screen protectors are less expensive than tempered-glass models. If you don&#39;t typically drop your phone and you&#39;re extremely gentle in how you handle it, you may be able to get away with thinner thin iPhone screen protectors and save yourself some money."," ","<strong>Thick Screen Protectors</strong>","<strong>Cons</strong><br/>Some of the thicker screen protectors (0.5mm to 0.4mm) have adhesive over the whole screen that can show imperfections and dust particles. With these rigid iPhone screen protectors, it can be difficult or even impossible to work out the bubbles. You simply have to place it on the screen and hope you removed every fleck of dust. If you are unlucky enough to trap a particle of dust under your iPhone screen protector, the adhesive may still show an imperfection on your screen where the dust disrupted the sticky silicon   even if you successfully remove the dust.","Thicker screen protectors that only have adhesive around the edges are very easy to apply; however, they may not stay firmly attached to the screen for as long as those that are entirely attached. If you want a tempered-glass screen protector that has adhesive only around the edges, be sure to find a product that has a strong adhesive. Then again, some are so strong that they&#39;re difficult to remove, so be sure to align it perfectly before you apply it to your iPhone.","Since these iPhone screen protectors are made of glass, there&#39;s a bigger chance that if it shatters, it could injure someone. Additionally, if the screen shatters, small glass shards can break away from the screen protector and be hazardous. While this is possible, it isn&#39;t that likely it will happen.","Many glass iPhone screen protectors are thicker than PET-film screen protectors. A typical glass screen protector is about 0.4mm thick. This makes the Home button feel slightly recessed in your phone. While some companies provide Home button stickers to make up for it, others do not.","<strong>Pros</strong><br/>Tempered glass is much harder than PET film. This means that this type of iPhone screen protector can remain unscathed even in the midst of hammer blows, moderate pressure with a pocketknife and more. Additionally, you don&#39;t have to worry about the edges peeling and looking unsightly because the tempered glass adheres firmly to the iPhone.","You&#39;ll also notice how aesthetically pleasing tempered glass is. As long as you have all dust and debris cleared from your phone before you apply one of these iPhone screen protectors, you&#39;ll hardly notice it there. The screen will feel silky smooth.","<strong>Summary</strong>","Although some iPhone screen protectors are less practical than having your phone go naked, others are incredibly helpful and can save you the cost of repairing a cracked or severely scratched screen. As iPhone technology continues to advance, so does iPhone screen protector technology. Perhaps someday, Apple will invent an iPhone that doesn&#39;t need a screen protector to keep it looking pristine.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"3db5ffa6-f049-4973-a925-262b1e4d827c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7806","url":"/pros-cons-of-thick-thin-screen-protectors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kimberly-bowen","url":"/author/kimberly-bowen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kimberly Bowen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"b8MJQh4eTYahbv48ZxQEJk","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-03-06T19:50:28Z","datePublished":"2013-03-06T19:50:28Z","name":"Pros & Cons of Thick & Thin Screen Protectors","synopsis":"iPhone screen protectors can be a phone saver if you stick your keys in the same pocket as your delicate iPhone or if you accidentally drop your phone off the edge of a table.","review":{},"strapline":"iPhone screen protectors can be a phone saver if you stick your keys in the same pocket as your delicate iPhone or if you accidentally drop your phone off the edge of a table.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-03-06T20:33:19Z","id":"bFG4nEsed7eyS9nkVP72e7","meta":{"title":"Pros & Cons of Thick & Thin Screen Protectors","description":"With many types of screen protectors available, it can be hard to know which one will provide the best protection for your iPhone 5.
