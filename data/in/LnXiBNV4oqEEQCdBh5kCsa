You can buy <a href=\"/best-contact-lenses\">contact lenses</a> alongside glasses, and there is even a try-on feature from brands like Nike, Cole Haan, Ray-Ban and Gucci. This tool is powered by Ditto, just like the lens try-on option on Discount Contact Lenses. Using your webcam, the site takes your photo from several angles and then superimposes the glasses on your face for a realistic result. We did, however, have problems getting the Eyeconic website to render the bottom half of faces even though the part that did load worked well.","Eyeconic sells 24 brands of contact lenses in several styles like multifocal, bifocal, toric, colored and for people with astigmatism. Given that we’re reviewing these websites based on their ability to sell contacts, Eyeconic fell low in our rankings because other websites, like <a href=\"/aclens-review\">AC Lens</a> and <a href=\"/discount-contact-lenses-review\">Discount Contact Lenses</a>, sell almost twice as many brands. While there are a handful of colored contacts to pick from on Eyeconic, it doesn’t sell any of the wilder Halloween-themed contacts like cat eye. If you get stuck, you can use the site’s live chat feature to get advice from customer service representatives.","In our tests this website got an F in the price comparison, but it offers a price match guarantee if you find your particular lenses for less money elsewhere. Three other websites we evaluated have price matching, two don’t and three will match a price and give you a discount on top of that. We favored the websites with a match and discount combo. Eyeconic also doesn’t make you pay for standard shipping on any order, and you can expect to get your contacts in four to seven days. You’ll also save money if you buy a year’s supply at one time rather than one box at a time.","This website doesn’t sell contact solution or eye drops either, so that’s a purchase you’ll have to make separately. While Eyeconic doesn’t have a huge selection of contacts, it’s not a bad place to look for glasses. There is a FAQs page to help you choose the right kind of lens and frame. This includes videos and other information about what frames fit best on certain face shapes. Just note that while you still get free shipping on glasses, it takes longer to get them in the mail than contacts, roughly nine to 14 days."]},"id":"2dff8f3e-3e73-4072-a0aa-c197e8e2ff47","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69919","url":"/eyeconic-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-09T15:59:29Z","datePublished":"2018-05-09T15:59:29Z","name":"Eyeconic","synopsis":"We’ll admit, we really liked the design and usability of Eyeconic’s website.","review":{"rating":36,"verdict":"Eyeconic&#8217;s contact lens selection left us looking for more, but a wide range of eyeglasses does make this website stand out.","pros":["There is a handy glasses try-on feature online."],"cons":["There are only 24 individual contact brands available."]},"strapline":"We’ll admit, we really liked the design and usability of Eyeconic’s website.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-18T00:00:00Z","id":"LnXiBNV4oqEEQCdBh5kCsa","meta":{"title":"Eyeconic Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Eyeconic&#8217;s contact lens selection left us looking for more, but a wide range of eyeglasses does make this website stand out."},"products":[{"slug":"eyeconic","url":"/product/eyeconic","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:10:19Z","name":"Eyeconic","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:10:19Z","id":"ck9tsAG3ugLniDVkZu2U7R","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:10:19Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/UfoTzwvUKZBtnDMbJd87ri.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:10:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"6a40769dc351d13171d106ac56029775.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6a40769dc351d13171d106ac56029775.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:10:19Z","id":"UfoTzwvUKZBtnDMbJd87ri","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UfoTzwvUKZBtnDMbJd87ri.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Eyeconic Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Eyeconic&#8217;s contact lens selection left us looking for more, but a wide range of eyeglasses does make this website stand out."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/UfoTzwvUKZBtnDMbJd87ri.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:10:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"6a40769dc351d13171d106ac56029775.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6a40769dc351d13171d106ac56029775.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:10:19Z","id":"UfoTzwvUKZBtnDMbJd87ri","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UfoTzwvUKZBtnDMbJd87ri.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Eyeconic Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Eyeconic&#8217;s contact lens selection left us looking for more, but a wide range of eyeglasses does make this website stand out."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/beauty/best-contact-lenses/eyeconic-review/","label":"","tags":[]}
