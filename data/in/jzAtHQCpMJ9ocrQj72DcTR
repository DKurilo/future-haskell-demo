Now you can get a front-seat view of the journey with the Nano Spy Copter. With a video and picture camera, you can see the action as it takes place and get a clear view of everything your remote control helicopter sees. The camera is built right below the cockpit of this nano-sized <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">remote controlled helicopter</a>, so you don&#39;t have to assemble or mount the camera yourself as part of the setup. However, the camera is not as powerful as those in some other similar models. In fact, some other models have two high-definition cameras that can connect wirelessly to YouTube to share your videos.","The remote control helicopter is missing some of the speed and power of similar models. And while the camera is a nice feature, the picture quality is grainy and the camera&#39;s controls are somewhat difficult to use. The included camera is a great thought, but it&#39;s not executed fully. The helicopter includes a 1GB micro SD card for capturing video and pictures.","The helicopter is solidly built. It has a metal frame encased by a hard plastic to prevent structural damage in the case of a crash. It’s inevitable that you’ll have at least a scrape with the ground, a tree or a wall, so it’s good to know the helicopter can withstand a beating.","The Metal Nano Spy Copter comes ready to fly right out of the box. You&#39;ll need to have six AA batteries for the 3.5-channel radio control transmitter to get the copter in the air. You’ll also need to dedicate about 90 minutes of charge time to fly the radio-controlled helicopter for 10 minutes. This is the longest charging time we saw on similar models.","This helicopter can hover in one place, and it&#39;s very stable. Often, with some of the more unstable models, a little wind can knock it off balance and make it difficult to fly, but this unit&#39;s stability means it will manage outdoor conditions well. Feel free to fly your mini RC helicopter both indoors and outdoors.","It can also fly in all directions: forward, backward, up, down, left and right. The gyro stabilizer is a bar on the top of the blades that acts as a counterweight to all forces pulling on the copter, stabilizing the flight. With this built-in gyro, you&#39;ll be able to focus more on flying rather than on trying not to crash.","However, this unit is missing some of the advanced features of other helicopters, including an alarm to alert you before a crash. It is also not able to perform some of the more advanced tricks and stunts, such as loop-the-loops and flying upside down."]},"id":"75c0ed90-9026-432d-9f28-3bc332c8bcb4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"390ac52c-d088-409d-a96f-25ddeb83072c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nano Spy Copter takes an interesting approach to remote control helicopters.
