Fortunately, there are a handful of ways to lower car insurance premiums that don&#39;t involve breaking the law.","<strong>Scale Back Coverage on Older Vehicles</strong>","For motorists with older cars valued at less than $1000, having a policy with a low deductible--or even any deductible--can be a costly, unnecessary expense. Switching to liability only will still protect the policyholder from incidental damages to other cars and, with many policies, still enable them access to free towing and emergency roadside services.","<strong>Skip Flashy, Choose Smart</strong>","The make, model and vehicle type often play a larger role in determining one&#39;s insurance premiums than anything. Smart motorists looking to save money on insurance should start with their choice of car. The logic used to be that domestic cars were always cheaper to repair and maintain given the location of manufacturing plants, but, with non-domestic auto manufacturers now manufacturing parts in the States, foreign vehicles once expensive to repair have become less expensive. Also, motorists should give safety features and IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) ratings greater weight when purchasing a vehicle.","<strong>Low-Mileage Discounts</strong>","Many car insurance companies offer discounts for drivers that agree to keep miles within a pre-determined limit, as well as drivers that carpool. This can also be used by multiple-vehicle owners with vehicles that are only used occasionally.","<strong>Good Driver Discounts</strong>","Unfortunately, this is a discount that only drivers with clean driving records (3-5 years with no traffic violations or offenses) are eligible for. But, for those that do qualify, good driver discounts can mean substantial savings for the policyholder.","<strong>Raise the Deductible</strong>","Raising your deductible from $0 or $250 to $500 or $1000 can reduce monthly premiums substantially. But, motorists should always set aside the sum of the deductible in the event of car accident or a liable incident.","<strong>Scheduled Electronic Payment</strong>","Some car insurance companies offer discounts for policyholders that set up payments to be debited from their checking account instantly each month on a given date. This also saves policyholders the hassle of sending in payment by mail or of receiving late payment penalties.","<strong>Take Out Multiple Policies</strong>","Many <a href=\"/best-auto-insurance\"><strong>car insurance</strong></a> companies also offer policies for home and, in some cases, life insurance. Taking out multiple policies will generally give policyholders a reduced car insurance premium, as well as simplify payment and claims processes by having a consolidated insurer.","By doing one--or all--of these steps, motorists are likely to save themselves money on a now-mandatory expense, without sacrificing personal safety and the protection of one&#39;s vehicle."]},"id":"61b8374c-fb7a-48c1-ac3f-e8af0c95c1af","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_2816","url":"/best-ways-to-save-on-car-insurance","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"derek-hardman","url":"/author/derek-hardman","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Derek Hardman","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"HTrkgmskHH5fB6s5MxxZSQ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-08-04T16:44:35Z","datePublished":"2009-08-04T16:44:35Z","name":"Best Ways to Save on Car Insurance","synopsis":"Car insurance is a mandatory expense and, unfortunately, one that can be fairly pricey too.","review":{},"strapline":"Car insurance is a mandatory expense and, unfortunately, one that can be fairly pricey too.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-05-27T22:07:47Z","id":"VnvW4hpafJa7tkPkhqsynW","meta":{"title":"Best Ways to Save on Car Insurance","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
