The result is a modern, intuitive and professional script-writing program.","The first difference you&#39;ll notice between Fade In and other screenwriting programs is that Fade In&#39;s interface is dressed mostly in black and dark gray. This may seem like an inconsequential style choice, but it&#39;s a bit more than that. Writers stare at computer screens for hours at a time, and there are times when it seems like all the blank white pages begin to burn holes in your eyes and brain. The black interface is much easier on the eyes, and if you&#39;re a professional writer who has logged thousands of hours behind a keyboard and in front of a blinking cursor, you&#39;ll appreciate it.","Another major difference between Fade In and other screenwriting applications is that Fade In saves the screenplays you create as Fountain files, rather than a proprietary file format. Simply put, Fountain files are plain text files that you can open and edit with any text editor. This seemingly simple feature changes nearly everything. It means that you don&#39;t have to have Fade In installed on a computer to edit your screenplays with it. It also means that you can import files you create in Fade In into any screenwriting software with no problems. All the elements and formatting remain intact no matter where you take the file.","Additionally, Fade In has the ability to open and export your scripts in the proprietary formats other screenwriting programs use. You can open and save screenplays crafted in Final Draft, Movie Magic Screenwriter, Scrivener and Celtx. Of course, you can also open any plain text file or any Fountain file that may have been created with applications such as Slugline and Storyist.","Following the theme of compatibility, Fade In is available for every popular operating system, both desktop and mobile. You can get this screenwriting application for Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as iOS and Android devices. No other one of the best screenwriting software programs is compatible with every single one of these platforms","Fade In is a case study in giving customers exactly what they want. In this case, screenwriters want a simple, powerful program to help them create their screenplays without getting in the way of their creative processes. Furthermore, this application plays nicely with nearly every other screenwriting application and is available on every major computing platform used by the English-speaking world."]},"id":"84fdcfbe-f7aa-483f-80b0-2d5b81ad2663","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57326","url":"/fade-in-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
