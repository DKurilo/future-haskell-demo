You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Thinking about <a href=\"/best-life-insurance\">life insurance</a> isn&#39;t exactly the most uplifting way to spend your day. New York Life, however, makes it easy to choose a policy so you can continue living your life. Term life, universal life and whole life policies are flexible and affordable forms of life insurance that will protect your family financially after a tragedy. Representatives are also available nationwide to assist you in choosing and managing your policy.","New York Life offers the most common types of life insurance policies so you have the flexibility to cover your family in the event of a tragedy. With term life insurance through New York Life, if anything should happen to you before you retire, your family would receive funds to replace your income. With universal and whole life, you can cover yourself even after the retirement age to pay for funeral costs and other end-of-life expenses. The only form of life insurance missing from New York Life&#39;s selection is survivorship, which covers two people, usually you and your spouse. In the event of an untimely death, the insurance funds would be paid to the surviving spouse. However, New York Life&#39;s range of available policies makes it easy to choose the best coverage for your loved ones.","To find a life insurance quote, you have a few different options. Talking to an agent via email, phone or in person will get you an accurate quote for how much your premiums could cost you. An online quote is also an option, but although this method is fast and very easy, your life insurance quote will only be a rough estimate. New York Life&#39;s quotes represent very reasonably priced premiums, especially for term life insurance rates.","Life insurance isn’t the only service provided by New York Life. Through this company, you can also secure your assets and family through small business and group insurance. Homeowners insurance is not available as New York Life mainly focuses on post-retirement finances. With New York Life, you can plan for retirement, access estate planning tools, manage annuities and find long term care options for loved ones.","New York Life isn&#39;t just for New Yorkers. Like the best life insurance companies, New York Life has offices around the nation, even major cities. A convenient agent search helps you find a nearby agent or office, contact customer support or send a request so that an agent will find and contact you. The New York Life website also has FAQs, a learning center and insurance calculators to aid in your life insurance research."]},"id":"1d989d85-68c0-4bbe-a1fb-2905e54e7710","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7314ae77-6f18-4ba0-a6be-87ea65aca1a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it may be unpleasant to think about, life insurance through New York Life is a safe way to protect your husband, wife or children should anything happen to you.
