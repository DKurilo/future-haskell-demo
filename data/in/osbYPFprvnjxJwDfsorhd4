It only has 59 locations, so it’s much less accessible than <a href=\"/enterprise-review\">Enterprise</a> or <a href=\"/hertz-review\">Hertz</a>. ACE has good pricing, with the third lowest average prices.","To compare <a href=\"/best-car-rental-services\">rental car</a> prices, we looked at how much it costs to book one-day and one-week rentals. We priced rentals several weeks in advance of the booking date. We noticed that trying to book next-day rentals often resulted in higher costs. ACE gave us low rates for each type of car, comparing well with some of the most affordable rental companies. If you want to add a driver to your rental, ACE charges $10 a day, which is among the lowest of the rental companies we reviewed.","It’s free to sign up for ACE’s rental car rewards program. Its Rental Genius program is one of the least impressive we’ve seen. It offers points for each dollar spent, but ACE does not allow the points to be redeemed for free rentals. It has a list of rewards, ranging from gift cards to electronics like Xboxes, that you can redeem your points for.","ACE’s Rental Genius doesn’t have an expedited service line or drop-off option, something other rewards programs include. It’s one of the more limited rewards programs we evaluated.","With only 59 locations in the U.S., ACE is the smallest rental company we reviewed. It’s also the only company that isn’t owned by Enterprise, Avis or Hertz, so if you value a more independent firm, it’s worth looking at.","There are downsides to being small though. All the locations are at airports, so your rentals will have additional fees. Since it only operates at airports, it doesn’t have a home pick-up option. Also, smaller rental companies are more likely to run low on cars and can sell out if you don’t book far enough in advance. With a smaller inventory, ACE doesn’t offer any electric vehicles."]},"id":"b0f748e5-9317-4d1e-8cbc-51e290738595","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50191","url":"/ace-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-26T15:20:25Z","datePublished":"2010-07-26T15:20:25Z","name":"Ace","synopsis":"ACE Rent a Car is one of the smallest companies we reviewed.
