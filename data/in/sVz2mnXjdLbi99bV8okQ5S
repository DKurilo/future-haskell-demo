You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","FireKing Security Group offers the Fingerprint Safe BIO2014 that uses advanced fire-resistant technology along with state-of-the-art fingerprint scanning for personalized security. Fireproofing in <a href=\"/best-home-safes\">home safes</a> is very important in the event of a house fire. If, in the unfortunate situation your home or office does catch fire, you want to be reassured that the safe containing your valuables is going to remain intact, along with the belongings inside of it.","You might have distressing property damage, but knowing that such things as important documents and other valuables are tucked away unscathed in your fireproof safe can give you considerable peace of mind. The Fingerprint Safe system that FireKing offers is top of the line in safe unlocking technology. Access to the safe is authorized by you, and only your unique fingerprint is what will be recognized and will permit the safe to be opened. The up-to-date Fingerprint Safe system gives you a highly secure solution and a more modern and better alternative to storing your valuables than simply using a key, combo or dial-lock system.","The BIO2014 safe is quite big and is built to accommodate many of your household valuable items such as electronics, jewelry, money and documents, along with anything else that will fit inside it. The safe is nearly 2 feet tall, coming in at 20 inches in height. The interior height of the fireproof safe is 19.5 inches, so you don’t lose much interior space. The exterior width is 16.5 inches, and the exterior depth is 15.5 inches. The interior width is 16 inches, and the interior depth is 13.5 inches. The safe weighs 105 pounds, so it is unlikely that a burglar would be able to easily walk away with this secure safe without using a dolly or some other moving equipment. For a smaller fingerprint safe, consider the Barska AX11620.","Most modern safes, including this one, typically are equipped with mounting ports and mounting bolts that let you secure the safe solidly to the floor, or a wall or any other fixed point in your home or office. Bolting it down adds yet another deterrent to any intruder who might try to steal the safe with the idea that it could somehow be pried or broken open elsewhere. This feature, combined with fingerprint access, ensures that the FireKing Fingerprint Safe will securely lock down your important personal belongings.","The FireKing Fingerprint Safe BIO2014 is a high-quality and well-built personal safe. It includes lots of space and innovative fingerprint detection and recognition technology, making it more secure and easier to access. Unfortunately, the FireKing BIO2014 has a comparatively high price tag, which may be a deterrent for some potential buyers, but you do get what you pay for with the number of features provided by this safe."]},"id":"9f2a8db1-5310-4588-9c34-074c3a7af6f6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61968","url":"/fireking-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T00:27:53Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T00:27:53Z","name":"FireKing Fingerprint Safe BIO2014","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":85,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-30T00:27:53Z","id":"sVz2mnXjdLbi99bV8okQ5S","meta":{"title":"FireKing Fingerprint Safe BIO2014 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The FireKing Fingerprint Safe BIO2014 gives you fire protection and fingerprint unlocking technology, and it can be bolted to the floor to deter burglars.
