You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Similar to other <a href=\"/best-webcams\">webcams</a> in its price range, the HP Premium Autofocus Webcam did not deliver any surprises. The web cam comes with all the features and tools you need to video chat and record a homemade video for YouTube. The installation and set-up seemed more involved than with other webcams, maybe because the ArcSoft Magic-i special effects software downloads the same time as the software. The overall quality is lower than most cameras, so we recommend getting one of our top-rated webcams that offers more features and tools.","The HP Premium Autofocus Webcam captures still images with a maximum resolution of 12 megapixels. The still images turn out great and are a higher quality than many of the digital cameras used today. The video capture, which is recorded at 30 frames per second, doesn’t provide the high quality you would expect from a web cam offering 12 megapixels of resolution for still images. It has a CMOS sensor which provides a higher quality video capture than a traditional VGA sensor used in other options. Throughout our research we found that many users were displeased with the quality, but others, taking into account the price were satisfied.","We really appreciated the design of this web cam. It has a clip that will attach to any size monitor for stability. The clip was easy to use, but we felt that it could have fit more tightly to our monitor. It has three buttons on the top of the camera itself which allow users to chat, record or access the controls. HP created this USB web camera with a built-in microphone and, like most desktop and laptop web cams, it connects through one USB cable to a 2.0 port.","Many users have been very pleased with the simplicity and ease of the HP Premium Autofocus Webcam. We also feel that HP did an excellent job creating a product that is so easy to understand and use. It has auto-focus capabilities that work great when you record or take a picture.","HP provides a user guide and a one-year warranty, and they have a customer support team in case you have a question or problem with your web cam. Their customer support team can be contacted via a toll-free phone number, chat or email. We were very pleased with the knowledge and professionalism the customer service team provided as they addressed our inquiries and provided us with additional information about the product."]},"id":"b541b04d-f753-44fe-82d2-d46a4cfbfa6f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f70e461a-95cf-4b98-81cb-5ddfcb70732e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, we recommend the HP Webcam HD-3110 Webcam over the HP Premium Autofocus Webcam.
