When your fishing rod is primed and ready, you need the ability to slow down and steer your boat into places your main motor can&#39;t take you, and that&#39;s what a trolling motor does.","A trolling motor makes your boat more versatile and provides a backup should your main motor quit on you. When you shop for a trolling motor, the array of options and styles can be overwhelming. Popular models include the <a href=\"/home/auto/best-trolling-motors/minn-kota-edge-review/\">Minn Kota Edge 45</a>, the <a href=\"/home/auto/best-trolling-motors/motorguide-review/\">MotorGuide Bulldog</a> and the <a href=\"/home/auto/best-trolling-motors/watersnake-review/\">Watersnake Asp T18</a>. These, along with a variety of other models, offer their own feature sets at various price points. With a little research, you can find a trolling motor that makes the most sense for your boat, likely conditions and lifestyle.","<strong>Trolling Motors: What to Look For</strong>","Start your research by examining your boat. You&#39;ll need to know its dimensions and weight. Also consider where you want your new trolling motor to take you. Once you have these facts, it&#39;s time to consider the array of features you might need.","<strong>Thrust &amp; Voltage</strong><br/>No matter where you&#39;re fishing, you need enough power to propel your boat and enough juice to last your entire outing. This is where you consider thrust and battery voltage.","Thrust, measured in pounds, is the amount of power that the trolling motor supplies to propel your boat. This is why the weight of your boat is important. The more thrust the motor has, the heavier the boat it can propel. One rule of thumb is to have 4-5 pounds of thrust for every 200 pounds your boat weighs. Don&#39;t forget to include the weight of the contents as you make your estimates.","Batteries are available in 12-volt and 24-volt sizes, and hardcore anglers use multibattery systems to ensure they never run out of trolling power on their longest days. In general, a single 12-volt battery is the bare minimum, and it will last for only a few hours. Newer technologies offered in some models provide methods for conserving battery power, which may be attractive to anyone who spends a lot of time on the water.","<strong>Shaft Length</strong><br/>The length of the trolling motor is referred to as shaft length, and it needs to be the proper length for your boat, taking into account how it is mounted. Most trolling motors offer different shaft length options for a proper fit, and adjustability is a nice feature to have when you use your boat in waters of varying depths. You&#39;ll also need to decide how to mount the trolling motor, depending on the configuration of your boat.","<strong>Other Features</strong><br/>You may wish to consider how you want to control steering and speed and whether you want to be able to use advanced technology. A foot pedal leaves your hands free so that you can strike at any time, and rack-and-pinion steering can give you finer control for getting into and out of your favorite spots.","New advances in trolling motor technologies make this an opportune time to purchase your first model or upgrade your old. Discover the features of a range of models so that you can enhance your outdoor experiences."]},"id":"9bde16dd-b4d3-4ab9-8387-5418a15b7f5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"1619910e-45de-4be6-971c-0f92853fb728","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012BJXLIU/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66436[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Aosom</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QIB7K8/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66433[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Intex</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GRCJS8/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66432[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Minn Kota Edge</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004360NKY/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66429[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Minn Kota Endura</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269WC22/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66427[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">MotorGuide Bulldog</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HXC2P2/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66434[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">MotorGuide R3</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EYST1L8/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66430[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Newport Vessels 55lb</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KJE9PDK/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66435[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Newport Vessels 62 lb</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HN9782Y/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66428[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sevylor</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O1T7TM/?&tag=ttr_trolling-motors-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1742[art|NA[pid|66431[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Watersnake</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5fc91047-648e-4099-91e7-7dc04f249084","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1742","url":"/best-trolling-motors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T16:24:47Z","datePublished":"2015-09-17T22:37:57Z","name":"Trolling Motors Review","synopsis":"Trolling motors can help you maximize your time out on the water and allow you to sneak up on fish.
