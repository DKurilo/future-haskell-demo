We use representative products in our tests and evaluate manufacturers rather than specific models to give you a general impression of the company&#39;s offerings. This allows you to look at our experiences with a company and choose a system with the storage options, resolution and number of cameras that fit your needs and budget.","Most of the systems we reviewed come in both wired and wireless versions that you can find online and at retail stores. If you only need one camera, we suggest looking at our <a href=\"/best-security-cameras\">security camera review</a>.","During our research, we contacted <a href=\"https://www.onvif.org/about/mission/\">ONVIF</a>, an industry association that promotes interoperability standards for security cameras. Stuart Rawling, of the ONVIF Steering Committee, answered our questions on how people can get the most out of surveillance cameras in their homes, you’ll find some of his answers throughout this article.","<strong>How Much do Home Surveillance Systems Cost?</strong>","You can expect to pay between $100 and $500 for most home surveillance systems. The costs usually increase alongside the video storage capacity and number of cameras. If you choose a wireless system, this will also increase your costs. Systems with eight or more cameras typically cost over $500. Add-on cameras for most surveillance systems usually cost between $50 and $100.","For our comparison, we chose systems with similar pricing between $100 and $400. This is the low end for HD digital surveillance systems and a good starting point for a small home.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To test the differences between camera systems, we limited our tests to systems with 720p resolution. This means that every system we tested records digital HD video rather than older, less precise analog video. One exception, <a href=\"/ezviz-review\">EZVIZ</a>, didn&#39;t have any 720p systems available at the time of testing, so we tested one of its 1080p systems using its 720p setting.","Aside from video resolution, all of the systems in our comparison have the following in common:"]},"id":"dbd8d5f5-3caa-46e2-a437-c9a91cd7487d","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Multiple cameras","A mobile app","DIY installation","Night vision","No-cost video storage included"],"type":"ul"},"id":"59c50f73-6427-4c08-ba37-2a61f7e8ac51","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["These systems require at least one cable for power, video and internet connectivity. All wireless communication is done via each system&#39;s mobile app.","<strong>Video Performance</strong>","We developed a test chart to evaluate many factors that can make or break video quality. This allowed us to examine overall clarity, color accuracy, picture contrast, text readability, and whether a human face was recognizable with enough detail to make a positive identification. For each system&#39;s test, we placed the chart at distances of 10, 20 and 30 feet.","In addition to the test chart, we looked at each home surveillance system&#39;s ability to capture moving objects. If there was any lag or distortion, we took points away from the system. With regards to motion, all of the cameras produced excellent results in our daytime tests, but two failed our nighttime motion tests.","Day<br/>For our daytime video tests, we used the systems in a bright room with all of the lights on. We did not perform low-light testing with the lights off and ambient light from a nearby window. Foscam and Lorex tied for first in daytime video quality, and <a href=\"/amcrest-review\">Amcrest</a> came in a close second.","Night<br/>During our nighttime video tests, we stayed after hours to test the effectiveness of the cameras in near darkness. We used the same test chart as during the day, though clarity wasn&#39;t nearly as important as noise and brightness.","Noise that distorted the image and made it difficult to identify key details lowered the score more than anything else. Additionally, if a video was too dim or too bright at various distances, we deducted points. Our top performers at night were Swann and Foscam.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong>","Although video quality is a major factor in a home surveillance system, it&#39;s a passive trait that works in the background. When you&#39;re controlling the system, ease of use is the most important factor. Systems with complicated installations or cluttered controls don&#39;t hold up as well as those that provide clear directions and simple options.","The biggest part of our ease of use score is each system&#39;s interface and how it performs in terms of menu navigation, playback controls and notification options. Although the mobile app was our primary interface, we also looked at how each system&#39;s web apps or onscreen controls differed.","An important thing to remember about installation is that it&#39;s meant to be a one-time event. This is why it makes up a smaller part of our overall ease of use score. To evaluate installation, we looked at how long it took and how difficult it was to set up each system. In this category, our top performers were Blink, Arlo, Foscam and Swann.","Interface<br/>During this evaluation, we looked at the ways that you can control each home surveillance system. Since all of these systems have a mobile app, we used that first. A good mobile app is easy to navigate and learn. Additionally, it shows active cameras on the main screen when you open the app and keeps advanced controls hidden away to reduce confusion among novice users.","One of the benchmarks we looked for in the interface was whether a home video surveillance system sent out activity notifications when it detected motion or started recording. We also evaluated how easy it was to export video to a computer or smartphone.","Aside from the mobile app, most systems have web apps, onscreen controls built into the system&#39;s DVR, or a combination of the two. With the exception of Blink, which connects over Wi-Fi, every system in our comparison requires you to connect an Ethernet cable to your router to add internet.","For systems with onscreen controls, you can connect them to TVs and computer monitors over HDMI or VGA. This is useful if you don&#39;t need internet in favor of a traditional closed-circuit television system. Systems with this option often include a USB mouse that allows you to navigate the menu.","Installation<br/>For the most part, the type of installation you choose depends on your budget and patience. Here&#39;s a brief rundown of what you should expect while installing wired and wireless systems.","Wireless home surveillance systems have a simple setup, and placement is much easier, but you can run into problems if the camera requires a power cable. The trade-off for completely wireless systems is limited battery power and higher system purchase costs, especially if you plan to record continuously.","In general, wired systems don&#39;t require any special instructions to install each camera, run cable and connect it to the DVR. Despite the straightforward installation process, it takes longer to set up wired systems. The cost of installation can also increase if you require longer cables or hire an electrician.","Additionally, it&#39;s possible you&#39;ll spend extra time plotting cable routes and tidying or hiding cables. This is especially true if you run cable through walls between multiple rooms or to the exterior of your home. In cases like these, it&#39;s best to consult an electrician so you&#39;re less likely to damage existing wiring or violate local building codes.","<strong>Other Things to Consider When Buying a Home Surveillance System</strong>","The best home surveillance systems offer features that combine high performance and usability. In particular, it&#39;s a good idea to focus on recording modes, video storage, camera quantity, audio and customer support. Here are a few things we learned during testing.","Camera Placement<br/>Regarding placement of outdoor cameras, Rawling said “the most important spot for cameras is at each entrance point. The camera should be facing the entry point so anyone who enters your property is visible.” He also suggested consulting your neighbors if you plan to point a camera toward their property as this can be considered an invasion of privacy.","Indoors, Rawling suggests pointing cameras at the valuable items you want to protect with an important consideration: “Some people aren’t comfortable with cameras inside the home, so it is wise to be mindful of the objective for indoor security when determining if it is necessary.&#34;","If you find it necessary to use cameras in your home, don’t put them anywhere in your home where family members or guests have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as bedrooms and bathrooms.","Depending on regulations where you live, you might need to get consent from people you&#39;re recording. This is usually as simple as using a sign that says there are security cameras present. “A sign is a good way to indicate that anyone entering your property is being recorded, and therefore by entering your property, they are consenting to such. Postings are legally required in some places, so it’s smart to have one.” Rawling said.","Video Storage<br/>Each system in our comparison saves video recordings to either a network video recorder, also known as an NVR, or a cloud video server. Although both options have pros and cons, this doesn&#39;t factor into our rankings, since the final decision comes down to personal preference. If you choose an NVR, we recommend a capacity of at least 500GB for a four-camera setup. Here are some features that can help you use video storage more efficiently on NVRs:"]},"id":"fe1d5927-f713-4a36-8b5f-5218ab402cfd","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Adjustable resolution or video quality","Adjustable frame rate","Multiple recording modes"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f9e8a23e-9fdb-4859-8a54-192e229905ab","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For cloud storage, it&#39;s less about overall storage than it is about the number of clips you can store. Two systems in our comparison use cloud storage exclusively: Arlo and Blink. Both have free storage options, though Arlo also had a paid subscription with better storage options and features.","Recording Modes<br/>When a system has a variety of recording modes, you gain more control of video storage and increase efficiency. Here are a few common modes worth considering in your home surveillance system:"]},"id":"8a9ff120-cd87-45f6-992c-4aaef7c79a76","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Continuous – The system is always on, which is good for full coverage, but uses storage quickly, and older footage can be lost to free up space. Also, reviewing hours of video can be tiresome.","Scheduled – The system only records during certain hours of the day, which is especially useful in off-hours. Anything outside the schedule is not recorded, for good or ill.","Motion – Recording only happens for a brief period when movement happens in front a camera. This is a very efficient use of video storage, but it isn&#39;t always available on a system."],"type":"ul"},"id":"42b66a61-0c4e-40b2-a6b6-762cf743cf9a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Number of Cameras Included<br/>Not all homes and businesses are equal. Naturally, larger homes or more sensitive locations require more cameras, while small homes and apartments can get away with fewer. We didn&#39;t factor this into our scoring. It&#39;s up to you to decide how many cameras you need for your home surveillance system.","Maximum Number of Cameras<br/>Sometimes you might need to buy additional cameras. For example, it&#39;s also possible to buy an NVR that supports up to four cameras but only comes with two. In these instances, you can usually order extra cameras from the manufacturer.","If you&#39;re adding wired cameras, it&#39;s important to make sure you also get the appropriate cables and to allot some time for installation. Also remember that your video storage might get used up faster, or, in the case of cloud storage, you might have to pay a subscription fee.","Audio<br/>If you want a camera that can record audio in addition to video, you should not expect this feature to come built in. With most NVR-based systems, a microphone is a separate purchase that only works indoors. The sound quality will be similar to a typical phone call. As for the legality of recording audio, check your local or state laws before doing so.","Warranty &amp; Support<br/>For warranty coverage, it&#39;s a good idea to purchase systems with warranties of two years or longer, though most warranties only last one year. This can help you replace cameras that fail over time. If you have an issue, you should be able to contact the manufacturer directly.","Although we score each contact method the same, our experience has been most effective with live chat support, which typically gets fast or instant responses. With email support, you might wait a few days before getting a reply. Telephone support is the least effective because it often requires more of your time than other methods."]},"id":"0d06433d-e0e8-4ab8-90bb-d01380a9912d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"13781afc-3cc0-479d-a5f4-5665bf592afa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/foscam-review\">Foscam</a>","<a href=\"/lorex-review\">Lorex</a>","<a href=\"/swann-review\">Swann </a>","<a href=\"/amcrest-review\">Amcrest </a>","<a href=\"/q-see-review\">Q-See </a>","<a href=\"/ezviz-review\">EZVIZ</a>","<a href=\"/arlo-review\">Arlo </a>","<a href=\"/blink-review\">Blink </a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d5a9dcc9-5284-46f2-baa4-39094bdbcd75","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_347","url":"/best-home-surveillance-systems","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-16T22:38:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-16T22:38:00Z","name":"Best Home Surveillance Systems of 2019","synopsis":"Looking for the best home surveillance system?
