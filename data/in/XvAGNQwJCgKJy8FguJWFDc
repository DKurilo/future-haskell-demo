You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Citi ThankYou® is a <a href=\"/best-rewards-credit-cards\">rewards credit card</a> that’s all about giving back to you. With each purchase you make, you will earn one point. You also have the option to earn double points on dining and entertainment. The credit card rewards you earn with this card can be redeemed for a number of different things including cash, a large selection of merchandise and even travel. Additionally, the points don’t expire or have a cap, so you are free to save your points up to redeem on that big trip.","We were disappointed to find this rewards card does not offer a sign-up bonus, but it does offer a lengthy introductory APR.","New cardholders can enjoy an introductory 15 month 0%* annual percentage rate on purchases and balance transfers. After the introductory period, you can expect a 12.99%-22.99%* (Variable) APR on both purchases and balances transfers that you make with the card. Additionally, this card has a 25.24% APR for cash advances and a 29.99% penalty APR.","This rewards card has relatively standard fees that accompany most credit cards. We were happy to see that this card offers a 0%* annual fee. You can expect a 3% charge for every purchase you make while traveling abroad. Additionally, if you plan to use this card for any balance transfers or cash advances, you will have a fee tacked on to each transaction. Balance transfers are charged a $5 or 3% fee, while cash advances are charged a $10 or 5% fee.","This credit card with rewards includes a handful of helpful features and additional services. If you use your card to purchase travel fare, rent a car, or purchase a product with a manufacturer warranty, you will be eligible for either its trip cancelation/interruption coverage, auto rental insurance or its extended warranty service. Citi also offers a number of other services to its cardholders like $0 liability on unauthorized charges, retail purchase protection, travel assistance and more.","You can contact Citi for member support via phone, and a customer service representative is available to help you at any time, day or night. Additionally, Citi provides a handful of very helpful frequently asked questions on its website for you to reference."]},"id":"a036965b-8ccf-4881-9f05-6d7f408017ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8ce35b0f-ac2e-46b4-9cad-c1b755c3e342","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Citi ThankYou® Card is a great way to earn rewards on some of your favorite things, but this rewards card does not come with an enticing sign-up bonus.
