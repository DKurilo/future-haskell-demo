You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","RCA offers a limited range of <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD</a> and Blu-ray players that are available as part of a surround-sound home theater system or as stand-alone products. The players from RCA are comparatively basic and light on features, but they still offer solid performance and reasonable value.","These units are region-specific, usually Region 1 for DVD and Region A for Blu-ray, so if you plan to watch discs that are encoded with a different region, this brand isn’t the best choice. Some models support streaming via native apps from services such as YouTube, VUDU and Netflix, as well as offering support for Pandora Internet Radio.","DVD and Blu-ray players from RCA connect to your television via HDMI, but some DVD players also feature composite video outputs to increase versatility. Some RCA players have internet connectivity and use an Ethernet cable to connect to your home network. Notably, there aren’t any wireless connectivity options. Several products in this line have USB ports, usually in the front, which let you connect cameras, computers and other storage media, so you can access music, video, images and data files. Select units make use of Bluetooth wireless technology to connect with compatible devices, including some home theater speakers.","If you’re using the HDMI output, you can expect to achieve a maximum resolution of 1080p, or Full HD, with compatible discs. Lower-resolution discs are automatically upconverted to near-Full HD to enhance your viewing experience. As these units are pretty basic, you won’t get 4K Ultra HD, nor do they provide 3D playback. However, unless you have a 4K, 3D-capable television, this isn’t an issue.","Because RCA DVD and Blu-ray players are budget-friendly, they have relatively few features. However, you do get plenty of quality for your money, along with features like upscaling, a number of native apps on some models and BD-Live access. While you won’t find any advanced smart technology, social media sharing support or web browsing on these players, you do get high-quality audio, including Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby TrueHD and Dolby ProLogic II. As well as aux audio input and analog video outputs, some units have a line-in jack that lets you connect your compatible audio device, like an MP3 player."]},"id":"30df57ea-eb1d-4c93-85ba-2a7e5e6ef941","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53447","url":"/rca-drc300ih-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-16T18:34:12Z","datePublished":"2011-08-16T18:34:12Z","name":"RCA","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-16T18:34:12Z","id":"bfRkLTepPauBXAeucGsaKn","meta":{"title":"RCA Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"RCA DVD players work alone or as part of a home theater system, offering high-quality audio and images.
