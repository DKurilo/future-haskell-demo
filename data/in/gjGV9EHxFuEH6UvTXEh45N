It offers batch file encryption for Macs via a document-based approach. Essentially, you create a document that contains all the necessary information needed to encrypt files on your Mac, which creates a virtual vault into which you drag the files you want to encrypt. It&#39;s quite simple, and the software even creates a random password to enhance the security around your encrypted files.","Another thing that is nice about AutoCrypt is the fact that it offers more than one encryption standard. All the other products on our list offer only AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which, while powerful and secure, is pretty standard fare for Mac encryption software. AutoCrypt gives you the option to encrypt your files via the Blowfish standard. It&#39;s lesser used, but as of the time of this writing, it has never been broken. While it may not be necessary, we like the fact that AutoCrypt gives you this option.","Another thing we like that gives AutoCrypt a little boost to security is its random password generator. On top of the rock-solid encryption, AutoCrypt creates a password that is resistant to dictionary and brute-force attacks. However, be warned that if you alter this password after you&#39;ve encrypted documents with it, they become undecipherable. It&#39;s like throwing away the key to a safe, so use extreme caution when altering the main password.","When you encrypt files with AutoCrypt, the file extensions change to AutoCrypt&#39;s proprietary .acrypx format. This means that you cannot decrypt them with a simple password. You need AutoCrypt on the machine in order to remove the encryption. This is both a help and a hindrance. It&#39;s a help in that if a file somehow escapes your machine and someone has access to your password, they still could not break the encryption without the AutoCrypt software. But it has an equal and opposite effect if you want to share an encrypted file with someone remotely; it&#39;s simply inaccessible without AutoCrypt."]},"id":"3923fe23-88dd-45ab-b188-e1e88d098dcd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"988e7faa-d346-47ec-bd04-096868a3d960","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["AutoCrypt is a perfectly acceptable choice for Mac encryption software.
