The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/electronics/home-entertainment/best-home-subwoofers/\">Home Subwoofers</a> here.</em>","The Polk Audio PSW125 shines in the right setting, which is a small room. It comes in two gorgeous finishes, and looks are worth considering when you&#39;re outfitting an entertainment room. In our frequency testing, we found its ideal performance range was between 40Hz and 100Hz, which isn&#39;t impressive for a 10-inch woofer.","The active subwoofer falls right in the middle of our lineup in terms of power. The PSW125 operates on 150 RMS power and reaches as high as 300 watts of peak power bursts. The average power was evident in our listening test. Our panelists described the subwoofer as having a warm quality, but overall, it left our listeners wanting a little more bass in the mix. When the bass reached really low frequencies, you could hear the PSW125 start to struggle. During deep and low frequencies, the bass became flabby and lost definition and punch.","One of the best aspects of the Polk Audio speaker is the design of its cabinet enclosure. The front-firing subwoofer cone is recessed in the center of the cabinet’s front panel, and a rounded, circular grille shields the speaker. The grille is reminiscent of speaker enclosures during the age of radio in the 1920s and &#39;30s. This home subwoofer is available in two finishes: a sleek, modern-looking glossy black and a vintage-looking cherry varnish that reveals the wood grain beneath it.","The Polk Audio PSW125 home subwoofer has an automatic signal-sensing power function and an LED power-mode indicator. Its controls include adjustable volume, crossover-frequency dials and a phase switch. If your receiver has a sub-out port, you can connect it to your sub using the left and right LFE or sub-in RCA ports. There are also two left and right speaker-level input terminals, and two left and right speaker-level output terminals to connect your subwoofer to older receivers.","The Polk Audio powered subwoofer is covered by a five-year warranty for the speaker and a three-year warranty for the amplifier. The Polk Audio website has a FAQs page, a user forum and PDF product manuals that you can download. You can contact technical support by phone or email."]},"id":"76be4b94-95d9-482f-8bce-3d6b97db1d61","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f32e3325-28e1-4b85-ae10-d8151d0a1cf6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The PSW125 subwoofer’s performance is best suited for a small room.
