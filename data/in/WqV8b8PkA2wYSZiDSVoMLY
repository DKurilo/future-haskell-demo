You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LG LT1235CER <a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">wall air conditioner</a> will make cooling large rooms easy with its variety of air-flow, temperature and timer options. It is also a fairly energy-efficient machine and removes moisture from the air quickly. Additionally, LG’s multiple customer service options make seeking help convenient.","This unit has moderate cooling capacity, with 11,500 Btu. This means it can easily cool a room of up to 700 square feet, and its maximum air-flow capacity of 310 cubic feet per minute will help cool the room quickly. Three versatile fan speeds let you choose the best air intensity.","This model also is one of the most effective wall air conditioners in our lineup at removing moisture from the air; it can take 3.8 pints per hour out. This is beneficial if you live in a humid area, such as Florida.","The LG in-wall AC unit has an energy-efficiency ratio of 9.8, and is tied for the fourth-most energy-efficient product in our lineup. Its estimated annual energy cost comes in at $101.09, which is better than most featured products. This estimation is from the U.S. Department of Energy and is based on three months’ use of eight hours per day. This unit is also Energy Star certified. However, it is not UL listed and does not have AHAM (American Home Appliance Manufacturers) certification.","You can save money while keeping cool, thanks to this unit’s energy-saver mode. It will still keep you cool while turning off the compressor and using the fan in limited intervals. The unit’s fan-only mode lets you create a breeze without using refrigerated air, and with the auto restart function the system will automatically turn itself back on once power is restored after an outage.","The programmable timer has many benefits, from letting you determine how long it runs to running it through the night so you aren’t disturbed by it cycling on and off. The included remote control gives you added convenience, letting you make adjustments from a distance. Its light-colored exterior looks sleek and also features four-way directional louvers, which let you control where the air flows in your room.","There is a limited one-year warranty for anything on this product, including general appliances and the compressor. LG has an online copy of the owner’s manual on its website, as well as a FAQs section. If you want to correspond directly with one of LG’s customer service representatives, you can do so via email, telephone or live chat."]},"id":"3def2488-9336-411a-b9a1-ea47cf9c9614","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"481d90f2-a79d-4772-9fd9-15b1d443bb5c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG LT1235CER wall air conditioner is energy efficient and capable of cooling medium-sized rooms.
