You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a> doesn&#39;t have any fancy gadgets or add-ons, but what it does provide is an open, airy and spacious interior. The Maytag MSF25C2EXM compares to other top-rated refrigerators in capacity level, warranty offerings and energy output.","The stainless steel side-by-side refrigerator also comes in a glossy black and white, while the inside remains a crisp white, no matter the outside color. This Maytag side by side has a refrigerator capacity of 15.2 cubic feet and freezer capacity of 9.9 cubic feet for a total capacity of 25.1 cubic feet. The freezer, thanks to the Store-N-Door ice dispenser, provides that extra space inside.","Inside the refrigerator, you will find two crisper drawers, perfect for storing fruits and veggies, as well as an Adjusti-Temp deli drawer. This feature allows you to keep items in the drawer cooler or warmer than the rest of the fridge. The Maytag MSF25C2EXM sports four door bins, three of which are gallon-capable.","The freezer has four wire shelves, one pull-out drawer and four slots in the door for a bit of extra storage. The real space-saver and storage creator is the in-door ice dispenser, which we prefer since it creates extra shelf space. We love this thing. The dispenser is also clear, so you can easily see how much ice is left.","The ice dispenser in this stainless steel side-by-side refrigerator is something else. Maytag uses the Store-N-Door Ice Dispensing System in this refrigerator model. The Store-N-Door moves the ice dispenser from its traditional location inside the freezer to the actual inside of the door. This opens the freezer and creates 15 percent more useable freezer space, according to Maytag.","The side-by-side refrigerator also boasts Right Size Ice Cubes, meaning they are smaller than your typical ice cube. Because of the smaller size, they will actually fit in the mouth of a larger water bottle and are easier to use in blenders.","The side-by-side refrigerator has a one-year limited warranty, which is compatible with top-rated refrigerators.","The Maytag side by side is Energy Star Efficient and, according to its official EnergyGuide, uses 577 kilowatts of energy annually. Based on this estimated number, you should pay around $61 a year in operating costs for the Maytag MSF25C2EXM.","If you register your product with this appliance company, you will have access to the Owner Center. Here, you can schedule a service appointment and receive all recall information.","Technically, there is a user manual, but we feel obliged to tell you just how terrible it is. You would think that Maytag could provide a user manual for this specific side-by-side refrigerator model, but no. And with only 18 pages in English, you get the very basic information about a Maytag side by side. We don&#39;t know how to actually use this specific model&#39;s ice dispenser or how to work the display. We are also missing video tutorials on how to care and clean for this fridge or instructions for any of its specific features.","If you don&#39;t want to search through the literature (and we don&#39;t blame you), live chat is the answer. You can contact Maytag Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST. If you live in the U.S. or Canada, you can call a toll-free number during the same hours of operation. And, for anyone who owns a Maytag side by side, you can fill out the online contact form."]},"id":"4832c505-157b-4e25-af4f-b117f0718f96","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a29f1d98-96b3-4f6a-8061-c3734e7a8e18","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag MSF25C2EXM may not be the top of the line or have amazing features, but what it does have makes it a pretty great side-by-side refrigerator.
