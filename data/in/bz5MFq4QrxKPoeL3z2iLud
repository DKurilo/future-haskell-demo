The company can help you obtain the correct documentation so that you can legally drive again.","In order to obtain an <a href=\"/best-sr22-insurance\">SR-22 insurance</a> certificate from SafeAuto, you must first sign up with insurance through the company. You can either call the company&#39;s 1-800 number or sign up for insurance coverage online. Whether you fill out the quote online or through an agent, check the box on your application that states you need the document or let the agent know so that it can be added to your policy. The standard filing fee for the SR-22 documentation is $25, but you do not have to repay this amount if you have to renew the document.","This provider is generally geared toward people who need inexpensive insurance. When you speak to a customer service representative, that person can help guide you on what the absolute minimum level of insurance you will need is. This amount varies depending on the state, but it is usually between $15,000 and $25,000 per accident. If you decide to save money on the minimum due to your high-risk SR-22, you should be aware if you are involved in an accident and it is your fault, the insurance will only cover the other driver.","An SR-22 document with SafeAuto will remain effective as long as you continue to pay your premiums and keep your insurance policy active. The company can also keep track of how long the state requires you to keep the SR-22 active. If you do decide to stop your insurance policy or if you allow your coverage to lapse, the company will report you to the state authorities. This can result in a suspension of your driver&#39;s license. Every state has a different length of time that you must keep the SR-22 car insurance in place. Once you meet your requirement, your policy premium with SafeAuto could go down each month. If you have any questions about your policy at any time of the day, you can contact a company representative.","Getting SafeAuto SR-22 insurance documentation requires only a few steps. Customer service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so you can ask questions and keep the policy active. Renewal requires nothing on your part except the requirement of keeping the policy active by paying."]},"id":"a5f8b54c-805a-4290-aedc-31c8997b52a8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67250","url":"/safeauto-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-16T20:42:53Z","datePublished":"2015-10-16T20:42:53Z","name":"SafeAuto","synopsis":"SafeAuto Insurance Company is a low-cost insurance company that may be ideal for those looking to purchase the minimum amount of insurance required by their state.
