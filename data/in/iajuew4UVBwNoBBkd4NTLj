You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The trim Brentwood TS-322 weighs a mere 3 pounds, so you can take it with you when you travel in an RV, to a motel room or on trips where you have access to electrical power. The <a href=\"/best-hot-plates\">electric hot plate</a> comes with a chrome drip tray under the single coil, and it is easy to clean since you simply lift the coil and wipe the tray with a sponge or cloth and a bit of soap and water.","In our tests, we got a mixture of results trying different cooking methods for different items. When we tried boiling water, it took 10.5 minutes to bring a pot of water to a full boil, which was the fourth-longest time among the 11 hot plates we tested.","Melting chocolate went much better. We melted 4 ounces of chocolate chips in a glass bowl over a pan of hot water. The chocolate melted in 14 minutes, but that is not a bad time since chocolate needs to melt slowly in order to preserve its texture and avoid burning. In this case, the chocolate turned into a soft, smooth and easily stirred liquid with exactly the texture and taste we wanted.","However, when it came to making crepes, this hot plate burner did not perform quite as well as we had hoped. The finished crepe was burned just a little in the center. Nonetheless, the crepe was tasty and it had cooked through completely.","You do need to experiment with this electric burner in order to learn its quirks and adjust your cooking style accordingly. One thing to note is that when you turn this hot plate on, the entire appliance gets hot – not just the coil. However, it cools down quickly. Some of the safety features we value were there, including non-skid rubber feet that help keep it in place on a countertop or tabletop. It also comes with an auto shut-off feature.","You get two lights with this device: one shows the power is on while the other shows the appliance has reached the right temperature that you set with the control knob. However, both lights are a bit hard to see, even in a well-lit kitchen."]},"id":"78fa854f-9154-41d6-b8b9-df700fc05bac","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f00b39d1-4ad6-49d3-9e5e-a95ab7a02ea6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you choose the Brentwood electric hot plate, you can make some good-tasting foods and take this cooking tool with you to any place that offers electrical power.
