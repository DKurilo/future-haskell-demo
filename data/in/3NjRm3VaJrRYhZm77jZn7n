While some models have keys that differ in height and curvature but are otherwise normally laid out, others in the series have a split-keyboard design with a separate 10-key number pad that promotes wrist health. The latter style can take some getting used to.","The wireless keyboards in the Sculpt series are full-size models, and they use a 2.4GHz radio frequency wireless connection via an RF USB adapter receiver to connect with your computer. Some models feature a USB pass-through so you can connect your other peripherals to the keyboard instead of your desktop tower. Notably, most models in the series do not have AV ports, so if you want to connect a mic or headset, you need to plug it directly into your PC or laptop.","The keys on the Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboards use scissor switches. They are mostly ultra-low profile, so there&#39;s minimal key travel. Still, the keys provide ample tactile feedback, making them well-suited for touch-typists, transcriptionists and other power users.","Some Microsoft Sculpt keyboards feature Windows hotkeys to perform common Windows functions. There are also models with dedicated media player keys and programmable keys. Some come with an integrated, full-size number pad, while others have a separate number pad you can position wherever it is comfortable.","The Sculpt series is built around ergonomic comfort. Some models feature a substantial wrist rest, adjustable tilt and a curved body. Others have a split and arced design, along with a separate number pad and a split spacebar with backspace functionality. Each model in the series is designed so you can hold your hands and arms in a neutral position, ensuring good posture and reducing musculoskeletal stress, which lowers the risk of repetitive strain injuries and carpal tunnel syndrome.","Keyboards in this ergonomic series don&#39;t have anti-ghosting and tend to have low polling rates of between 125Hz and 500Hz. They also donâ€™t have saveable profiles or backlighting. Microsoft Sculpt keyboards are designed for home and business users who spend long periods of time working at their keyboards rather than gamers."]},"id":"36a76886-e8a6-4a71-95e3-41748d2faf9e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68436","url":"/microsoft-sculpt-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-21T18:29:33Z","datePublished":"2016-09-21T18:29:33Z","name":"Microsoft Sculpt","synopsis":"Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboards combine ergonomic form and practical functionality for a comfortable, healthy and efficient typing experience.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboards combine ergonomic form and practical functionality for a comfortable, healthy and efficient typing experience.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-21T18:29:33Z","id":"3NjRm3VaJrRYhZm77jZn7n","meta":{"title":"Microsoft Sculpt Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Type in ergonomic comfort and maintain good wrist health with the Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboard series.
