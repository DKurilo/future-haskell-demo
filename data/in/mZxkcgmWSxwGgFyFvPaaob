It’s quiet because it uses a thermoelectric cooling system, which is also more energy efficient since it uses less electricity than compressor wine coolers. The trade off is that thermoelectric cooling systems don’t generally get as cold as compressor systems. The iGloo FRW1225’s temperature range is between 52 and 72 degrees, which is perfect for red wines and some dry white wines but not cold enough for most sweet or sparkling wines.","There are metal racks that hold the bottles, most laying down, but some thicker bottles may be maneuvered to fit. You can also remove some of the shelves for a better fit. Additionally, there is a shelf that lets you place opened or taller bottles upright. ","This wine fridge is designed with a curved, tempered glass door, which keeps UV rays out and helps to keep the inside temperature consistent. It also lets you see into the cooler to know what you have chilling.","This is a freestanding unit, so you shouldn’t build it into a cabinet; it needs enough room to vent properly. It also isn’t made to work in an area with uncontrolled temperatures, like a garage.","One feature missing from the iGloo FRW1225 is a lock. It is compact (under 2 feet high) so it could be placed on a counter and out of reach of kids. But if you want a lock, check out the <a href=\"/avanti-review\">Avanti EWC1201</a>, which is comparable in price and features and comes with a locking door."]},"id":"0bb1f320-a76d-4ca2-a5e7-c561960cdc43","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69982","url":"/igloo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-25T14:47:58Z","datePublished":"2018-05-25T14:47:58Z","name":"iGloo FRW1225 12 Bottle","synopsis":"The iGloo FRW1225 wine cooler is a top seller on Amazon, where customers report that it stays cold and runs quietly.","review":{"rating":56,"verdict":"This thermoelectric wine fridge is energy efficient, plus the tempered glass helps maintain the inside temperature by blocking UV rays.","pros":["The iGloo FRW1225 holds 12 standard wine bottles and can accommodate wider and taller bottles as well."],"cons":["It doesn&#8217;t have a locking door."]},"strapline":"The iGloo FRW1225 wine cooler is a top seller on Amazon, where customers report that it stays cold and runs quietly.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","id":"mZxkcgmWSxwGgFyFvPaaob","meta":{"title":"iGloo FRW1225 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"This thermoelectric cooled wine fridge is energy efficient, plus the tempered glass helps maintain the inside temperature by blocking UV rays."},"products":[{"slug":"igloo-frw1225-12-bottle","url":"/product/igloo-frw1225-12-bottle","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","name":"iGloo FRW1225 12 Bottle","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","id":"LPUZzDwd2n4wqT6RxCrpVh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/yQDHkBCxcsErKwh35FjDtH.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","mimeType":"","name":"1e9aa1dc5f07b16e525ec4a2e9957ae2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/1e9aa1dc5f07b16e525ec4a2e9957ae2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","id":"yQDHkBCxcsErKwh35FjDtH","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yQDHkBCxcsErKwh35FjDtH.jpg","alt":""},"title":"iGloo FRW1225 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"This thermoelectric cooled wine fridge is energy efficient, plus the tempered glass helps maintain the inside temperature by blocking UV rays."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/yQDHkBCxcsErKwh35FjDtH.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","mimeType":"","name":"1e9aa1dc5f07b16e525ec4a2e9957ae2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/1e9aa1dc5f07b16e525ec4a2e9957ae2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","id":"yQDHkBCxcsErKwh35FjDtH","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yQDHkBCxcsErKwh35FjDtH.jpg","alt":""},"title":"iGloo FRW1225 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"This thermoelectric cooled wine fridge is energy efficient, plus the tempered glass helps maintain the inside temperature by blocking UV rays."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/kitchen/best-wine-coolers/igloo-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"refrigerators","url":"/kitchen/refrigerators","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","name":"Refrigerators","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:11:11Z","id":"hGnCzHoUh2aAKgnXsQGcFg","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
