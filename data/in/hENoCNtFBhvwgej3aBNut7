You can connect your iPod, iPhone or other MP3 player to your car stereo through the front auxiliary input or the USB port. You can also plug a thumb drive with MP3 files into the USB port if you do not have an MP3 player. However, unlike most other in-dash receivers, your MP3 player cannot be controlled by the head unit.","The CDE-102 is Bluetooth ready, but you&#39;ll need to purchase the KCE-400BT adapter. This adapter has a built-in microphone so you can talk with your hands free and hear the caller&#39;s response through your car speakers. Some car audio head units we reviewed, like the Sony DSX-S100, were not at all compatible with Bluetooth, so this unit is a step up from that, but it would be better if the Bluetooth were built-in, like on the Kenwood KDC-BT645U."]},"id":"a2b169fe-587e-4159-b62f-ce5b5700dbdd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"d390319b-af04-4dc8-9895-3893995b652d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Neither HD Radio nor satellite radio will work on this car audio receiver.
