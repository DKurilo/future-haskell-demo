Its classic S-curve frame is rigid, its arm cup is padded, and its grip is comfortable enough for long sessions in the wilderness.

In fact, most treasures the MP3 Pro finds are no more than 2 to 4 inches from the surface.","The control box feels flimsy, and its layout is poorly designed. The power button is positioned in the center of the display, where you can accidentally hit it as you brush your fingers from the sensitivity controls on one side to the discrimination controls on the other. There’s a graphical target ID, which generally makes it simple to identify what the detector is detecting. However, the ID display is positioned on the bottom of the control box, while the label that describes each graphic is on the opposite end. The information you need is all there, it’s just difficult to piece together.","This metal detector doesn’t have any notching or ground balancing features. Without these, finding useful targets amid trash, especially in mineralized soil, can be difficult. Furthermore, because this unit lacks depth indication or pinpointing, precisely locating those targets becomes a headache."]},"id":"e1b2bc73-f302-4de5-b425-b07e4faeac8e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bd9db732-00e9-4b61-9cd6-865dea2d2fd4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MP Digital MP3 Pro is serviceable at simple tasks, but it lacks some of the more advanced metal detector features, such as notching and ground balancing.
