Known as a sound conditioner, the Marpac Dohm-DS has two speed modes that you can adjust to offer higher- and lower-pitched tones. This allows you to set the device to operate at a level that best helps your baby sleep.","The Dohm-DS only offers white noise as a sound option, which is generated by the internal fan rather than from a digital device. Unlike with other baby sound machines, there are no nature sounds or lullabies to alternate the noise effects in the room.  Although the lack of sound options is disappointing, a plus side of this is that the sounds don&#39;t loop at all because the noise comes from the air flow itself. There is also no port for an MP3 adapter. This is solely a white noise machine.","This unit is limited on features as well. Unless you manually turn off the white noise machine, the sound of rushing air will continue throughout the night. There is no accompanying timer, night light or resume play function on this infant sound machine. You have to flip the switch from off to low or off to high and then twist the central portion to adjust the air flow speed.","This model has a one-year manufacturer warranty, and you can return the white noise machine if you notice any defects in materials or workmanship. The device also comes in three colors: black, white and fog, which is a creamy off-white color.","The Dohm-DS capable of plugging into either a 120-volt outlet, standard in the U.S. or Canada. Marpac makes an identical model that is compatible with a 240-volt outlet if you plan to be in Europe, Australia or the U.K. The compact and lightweight size makes this white noise machine ideal for travel. However, the machine won&#39;t run on batteries, so make sure you have access to electricity wherever you plan to go."]},"id":"7739d410-fdcc-4bef-a61d-e4efb5308e8d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fd73c1a7-ddf2-4a14-9a61-24d730a4dd2f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite its lack of sound variety, the Marpac Dohm-DS white noise machine produces sound that is effective in lulling your baby to sleep.
