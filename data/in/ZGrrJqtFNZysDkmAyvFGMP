You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The RoamEO pet tracker is a reasonably priced yet effective <a href=\"/best-pet-tracking-devices\">pet tracker</a> that operates with a GPS system.","The RoamEO pet tracker comes with an adjustable, flexible rubber pet tracking collar that fits dog neck sizes 12 to 24 inches and is suitable for medium to large dogs. This collar will not fit dogs that weigh less than 18 pounds and it&#39;s only suitable as a GPS tracker for dogs and not for cats. The collar weighs 6.5 ounces and is about one inch wide, but the antenna is built into the collar, so it won&#39;t get in the way or get caught on anything. The collar can be washed, and rain or snow won&#39;t harm it. This RoamEO system can handle two collars at a time, but the second collar has to be purchased separately as a standalone item.","Also in the kit is the hand-held receiver, which weighs 5.9 ounces. Like the <a href=\"/sportdog-review\">SportDOG TEK 1.0</a>, the LCD display has an EL backlight for night use and is also readable in bright sunlight. This GPS pet tracking system is designed using Wide Area Augmentation System-enabled GPS technology that continuously tracks multiple satellites in almost any conditions; the time to first fix is generally 45 seconds. The system uses radio transmission to connect the pet collar to the owner&#39;s receiver. The GPS locator is accurate to about nine to 12 feet, and the GPS coordinates are refreshed every four seconds, so you know in real time where your pet is located. The range of the system is about half a mile radius, approximately within a 500-acre circle.","Two lithium-ion batteries and a universal charger are included in the kit. The batteries take three hours to recharge, so you need to be prepared to wait before going out if the batteries are flat. RoamEO estimate that the batteries last for 24 hours of continuous pet tracking without needing a recharge, slightly longer than the <a href=\"/garmin-review\">Garmin Astro 320.</a> The pet collar takes one battery at a time so they can be swapped when necessary. The downside of the limited battery life is that if your dog is lost, the collar&#39;s batteries may go flat while you&#39;re searching.","Because the RoamEO pet monitor systems use WAAS GPS technology, it doesn&#39;t need any third-party activation, so there are no subscription or activation fees. It can be used where there is no cell phone coverage so it&#39;s ideal for country hiking. The home mode feature enables you to find your vehicle or campsite when you&#39;re out in the wild.","A sturdy, effective pet tracker, the RoamEO is suitable for use around the home, but it is particularly good when you&#39;re out and about with your dog. It is a nice system for adventurers."]},"id":"509af1d4-f1a2-4f5c-8c2c-3c9c39efef09","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62787","url":"/roameo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T00:11:04Z","datePublished":"2015-02-18T00:11:04Z","name":"RoamEO","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-18T00:11:04Z","id":"ZGrrJqtFNZysDkmAyvFGMP","meta":{"title":"RoamEO Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Learn more about the RoamEO Pet Monitor System, a GPS pet tracker for dogs.
