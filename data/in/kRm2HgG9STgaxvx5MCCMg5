The same manufacturer, Cyberlink, makes it. PowerProducer Ultra has fewer editing tools and exporting options. Additionally, it lacks transitions and effects. This video editing software is best for those who need a very simplified application to help them create basic movies.","With PowerProducer Ultra, you can adjust the contrast, hue and brightness of the video. You can also add text, titles and photos to your movie. When you finish creating your movie, you can add a DVD menu. One of the things we like about this movie editing software is that it comes with automatic tools such as the Magic Fix, which helps to smooth out shaky footage, and Magic Cut, which identifies which portions would be best to keep and which ones you might not need.","This video editing software allows you to create DVD and Blu-ray Discs or put your movies on your iPod. PowerProducer Ultra supports AVCHD. It doesn&#39;t upload FLV files. You can also convert VHS tapes as long as you have the correct hardware to complete the job.","Cyberlink provides email support, a user guide, tutorials and a FAQ on its website. Cyberlink promptly returned our emails, but we had to reply several times before they answered the few questions we asked in the first email. The telephone support for PowerProducer Ultra is fee-based and requires you to sign up for it."]},"id":"91b882c9-24db-4b83-8a23-caa90093a371","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"46cc9922-82a8-4300-978f-83b87f96ff27","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This video editing software lacks features that are standard in other applications, such as effects and transitions.

The final videos look great, and you will soon see that the advantage to this application is its ease of use. Without all of the extras, you don&#39;t have to spend time learning to use the software.
