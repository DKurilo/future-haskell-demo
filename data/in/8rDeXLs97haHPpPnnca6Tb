Even though regular HDTVs are not much thicker than slim TVs, the latter give the perception that they takes little to no room. Slim TVs are thin   typically less than 3 inches thick   and have small bezels, which are typically less than 1 inch around the edge of the the display. A few examples of slim TVs are the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">Samsung UN24H4000 LED TV</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">Panasonic TC-60CX65OU 4K HD TV</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LG 55EC9300 Curved OLED webOS TV</a>.","<strong>Slim TVs: What to Look For</strong>","Most of the features you look for in regular HDTVs are also the ones to consider when searching for the right slim TV. In addition to the sleek design and thin bezel of these TVs, some manufacturers produce slim TVs with curved displays. Curved slim TVs offer certain advantages over flat-screen TVs, such as improved contrast and wider field of view. Whether you want a curved or flat slim TV, here are the most important features to look for.","<strong>Resolution</strong><br/>The resolution of a TV determines the sharpness and clarity of its picture. TV resolution is a measure of the details visible in the images displayed on the screen. Slim TVs are usually high-definition TVs with resolutions ranging from 720p to 1080p. However, you can also find slim TVs with ultra-high-definition, also known as UHD, 2160p or 4K resolution. 4K UHDTVs have four times the definition of 1080p TVs. While there&#39;s not a lot of 4K video content on the market now, as more 4K-capable smartphones and cameras are released and studios shoot in the resolution, a 4K slim TV may serve you for longer.","<strong>Display Technology</strong><br/>The type of display technology a slim TV uses will affect how slim it actually is. For example, LED flat screen TVs are slimmer than traditional LCD TVs because they use small, energy-efficient LEDs for backlighting rather than fluorescent lights. There are two types of LED LCD TVs: edge-lit and full-array LEDs. An edge-lit LED TV is usually thinner than a full-array LED TV because it packs its backlighting LEDs at the edges. However, the latter produces more evenly lit pictures than the former. OLED TVs are even slimmer because they do not need dedicated lighting sources. An OLED display generates its own backlighting using organic LEDs and has a lower energy consumption than LCD and LED LCD TVs. They are sharper and more naturally lit than both edge-lit and full-array LED TVs.","<strong>Bezels &amp; Stands</strong><br/>To keep their devices slim, manufacturers sometimes house a TVs electronics elsewhere. For example, sometimes a slim flat screen TV has a thick stand that doubles as a non-detachable base because most of the electronics have been moved there. Likewise, to achieve thin cross sections, a slim TV may have wider bezels taking up a considerable proportion of the display. A truly slim TV would have ultra-thin edges measuring less than 3 inches thick, an edge-to-edge display with sliver-thin bezels measuring no more than 1 inch and a sleek, detachable stand.","<strong>Connectivity</strong><br/>Slimming down TVs often comes with compromises. In most cases, manufacturers sacrifice input/output ports as well as optional hardware to make their regular HDTVs slimmer. You may see fewer numbers of HDMI and USB ports, and some slim TVs lack an Ethernet port and Wi-Fi capability. Therefore, port selection should be an important consideration while comparing different slim TVs.<br/>Thanks to advances in TV technologies and design, slim TVs do not have to come with fewer features than regular HDTVs. Even with ultra-slim bezels and thin profiles, the best slim TVs pack a similar number of ports, have similar features and have speakers that are equal to the ones found on thicker HDTVs.","Slim TVs mount closer to the wall than regular HDTVs. In this way, they look more like wall art than regular TVs. Their thin bezels, minimal frames and clean lines make it look as though their pictures pop from the wall. Even if you choose not to mount your slim TV, its thin side profile is still striking, especially when standing next to other appliances. And most of them achieve this with no compromise in quality or connectivity options."]},"id":"fefc41b0-f386-4e7c-bcc7-eea36d5a4139","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f5f56454-8cde-4316-8e89-27cdf856075e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.pieratts.com/electronics/led-flat-panel-hdtv/led-50-59/55EC9300/\">LG</a>","<a href=\"http://shop.panasonic.com/tvs/all-tvs/TC-60CX650U.html?sc_mc=sem_google-search_cov_entertainment-tv_brand_product\">Panasonic</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KSBBGA4/?&tag=ttr_slim-tvs-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1608[art|NA[pid|64024[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Samsung</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DP7VRA2/?&tag=ttr_slim-tvs-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1608[art|NA[pid|64025[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sceptre</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7805194-11034749-1424824741000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sears.com%2Fshc%2Fs%2Fp_10153_12605_05771580000P&cjsku=05771580000\">Seiki</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MCHE3ZW/?&tag=ttr_slim-tvs-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1608[art|NA[pid|64031[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sharp</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BSREPRS/?&tag=ttr_slim-tvs-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1608[art|NA[pid|64028[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K3EPUXK/?&tag=ttr_slim-tvs-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1608[art|NA[pid|64027[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">TCL</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SCP34LM/?&tag=ttr_slim-tvs-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1608[art|NA[pid|64033[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">UpStar</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MA7DBYI/?&tag=ttr_slim-tvs-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1608[art|NA[pid|64030[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">VIZIO</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"76b2dd97-65d9-4272-b49e-b234ac56b55d","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1608","url":"/best-slim-tvs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-27T17:32:23Z","datePublished":"2015-05-19T23:06:39Z","name":"Slim TVs Review","synopsis":"Slim TVs are sleek, lightweight high-definition TVs.
