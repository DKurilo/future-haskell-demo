Many excellent models also account for convenience and cost savings with washable filters and timers. As Top Ten Reviews researched and tested the various models, they held them up to four main criteria.","<strong>Functionality</strong>: The most important question to ask about an air purifier is how well and how often it cleans the air. TTR&#39;s minimum functional requirements included a coverage area of 300 square feet, an average airflow rate of 150 cubic feet per minute, and filtering through the air at least four times an hour.","<strong>Safety</strong>: Safety is always of paramount importance when dealing with a home&#39;s air quality. TTR looked for industry-standard certifications from Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), Energy Star verification and HEPA standards adherence. An additional item to look for is an ozone-free filter, even though many filters use this method to remove odors in a home. The ozone odor removal method introduces up to 10 times the recommended amount of ozone into a home s atmosphere. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America along with AHAM and EPA heavily discourage using an ozone generator in homes.","<strong>Features</strong>: Additional features are like the icing on the cake. While they don t make the device any better at cleaning the air, they certainly contribute to the usability of the purifier. Washable filters, timers and remote controls all add an additional level of convenience to an air purifier.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>: While configuring and operating an air purifier isn t exactly rocket science, it s always reassuring to know that there is adequate support for any consumer product. A hefty warranty, online help, a phone line, an email address and a user manual are standard methods of help and support. The best air purifiers also feature an online chat option on their website to assist with any questions or concerns customers have.","Keeping a home clean and dust-free is the most effective method of minimizing breathing problems, and an air purifier is a great tool to have the home to ensure the comfort and good health of family members.","<em>More product reviews can be found at <a href=\"/\">Top Ten Reviews</a>.</em>"]},"id":"0ae894d2-b7c4-4db6-bbdb-51eb9a9cdbf9","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/air-purifier-vs.-ozone-generator\">Air Purifier vs. Ozone Generator</a>","<a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">Best Humidifiers for Your Home</a>","<a href=\"/best-tower-fans\">Choosing the Best Tower Fans</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6ac4147a-3bfb-4128-b45d-b852d8722f2b","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7345","url":"/best-in-home-air-purifiers-revealed","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"toptenreviews-editors","url":"/author/toptenreviews-editors","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"TopTenREVIEWS Editors","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6yWTF9SkaD2BnPo6GVTbs8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-30T16:08:22Z","datePublished":"2012-05-30T16:08:22Z","name":"Best In-Home Air Purifiers Revealed","synopsis":"Top Ten Reviews has just released a comparison of the best air purifiers for use in homes.","review":{},"strapline":"Top Ten Reviews has just released a comparison of the best air purifiers for use in homes.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-30T20:06:09Z","id":"Xbzd2uak8jCR2AzWy37Z4j","meta":{"title":"Best In-Home Air Purifiers Revealed","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
