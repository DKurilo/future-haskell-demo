The flash, coupled with a quick trigger, makes the M-880i a solid <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-cameras\">game camera</a>.","This game camera has a 50-degree field of view, which is about average among the trail cams we reviewed. Its maximum flash range is 70 feet, which is a step behind other top trail cams.","The M-880i&#39;s detection zone is sufficient for most hunters&#39; needs. It has a detection range of 50 feet and a detection angle of 50 degrees. This was a standard detection zone for game cameras a few years ago, but now, with more cameras in this price range having bigger zones, it&#39;s a bit smaller than the competition.","The camera has an excellent trigger speed of 0.8 seconds. This is quick enough to capture even animals that are running past your camera placement at full speed. The M-880i&#39;s standard recovery time is five seconds, but it has a well-designed multi-shot mode that allows it to take up to three shots quickly. The camera will sense movement, trigger the first picture and then stay in a readied state in which the recovery time is only 1.5 seconds. Multi-shot modes like this often result in some of the most interesting photos, as you get to see the animal in different stages of movement.","The best feature of the M-880i is its invisible infrared flash. While the other wildlife cameras we reviewed emit a faint red glow when they&#39;re taking images at night, the M-880i&#39;s flash is invisible to humans and  animals. This is useful because occasionally an animal will see the red glow and stare directly at the camera for the next shot, robbing you of a candid image and possibly discouraging the animal from returning to that spot. An invisible flash is also useful if you choose to use the M-880i as a home security camera, because potential intruders won&#39;t know they&#39;re being filmed.","The M-880i has a power input jack, so you can plug it into a solar panel or external battery pack. This feature proves especially useful if your residence and your hunting property are far apart and you don&#39;t want to have to change out the batteries every few months.","The camera is patterned in Mossy Oak Bottomland camouflage, one of the most trusted patterns on the market, so animals or people will have a hard time seeing it hanging on a tree. This camouflage and the invisible flash make the M-880i the best choice among cameras we reviewed to be used as a home security camera."]},"id":"a2bbf74b-722a-4d48-821a-2d56d54f1e55","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b4b44a33-38e7-4552-83c4-276837ca5d49","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Moultrie M-880i is one of the best-selling game cameras on the market because it provides essential functionality at a fair price.
