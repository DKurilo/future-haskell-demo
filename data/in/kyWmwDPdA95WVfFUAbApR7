Our firsthand demo with the product was impressive to say the least. In an audio simulation of a rainstorm, it sounded as though we were in the middle of the downpour.

The HT-ST5000 is Sony’s take on the Dolby Atmos sound bar trend. The sound bar features multiple drivers that fire in different directions for three-dimensional sound. It offers 4K support as well as multiple inputs such as HDMI and analog inputs.","Samsung<br/>The new MS750 sound bar from Samsung, as expected, also joined in on the parade of Dolby Atmos sound bars. The difference between the MS750 and the LG and Sony sound bars is the lack of an additional subwoofer. The woofer is built right into the bar, narrowing the sound system down to one component. In our experience, it can be difficult to maintain powerful bass without a separate subwoofer, but only time will tell how the move will affect the new MS750 from Samsung.","Mini sound bars are an immerging trend.
