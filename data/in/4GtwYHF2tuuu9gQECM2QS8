It measures 12 feet across and is one Poolcenter&#39;s smallest round blankets. For pools of different sizes and shapes the <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Leslie’s 7-Year</a> solar blanket is a good option. It comes in 15 different sizes and can fit pools with a variety of shapes.","The top layer of this Poolcenter solar blanket is made of heavy-duty polyethylene, and it has an aluminized bottom layer. The underside of the solar blanket has a row of raised air pockets that make it look like a large piece of bubble wrap. With a thickness of 16 mils, this solar blanket is one of the thickest solar pool covers available. This makes it heavy and means that it requires considerable effort to roll up and deploy the blanket. However, the thickness also confers some advantages. For one, it makes the pool cover more durable than thinner blankets. In addition, the thickness improves the blanket&#39;s efficiency at trapping heat underneath it and warming up a pool. The solar blanket is not only very thick but also backed with an eight-year warranty, one of the longest warranties available for solar pool blankets.","The solar blanket can warm up your pool by 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, thanks to its transparency, thickness and air pockets. The bubbles on the surface serve as an insulating layer between the water in the pool and the wind blowing over it. Therefore, it significantly reduces the amount of heat lost by convectional heat transfer between the water body and the air. In addition, the aluminized bottom layer reflects heat back into the pool. The clear and transparent nature of the solar blanket does not impede any part of the incident sunlight coming through. Unlike colored pool covers, clear blankets do not absorb any part of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, this solar blanket delivers maximum thermal energy to the pool.","Although the solar blanket is thick and has reinforced seams, it is not indestructible. Poolcenter did not equip this solar cover with an ultraviolet-resistant film. Therefore, UV rays from incident sunlight can slowly break down the air bubbles and weaken the polyethylene fabric. In addition, the durability of the pool cover is affected by extreme temperatures. Leaving it out in the sun on very hot or cold days can shorten its lifespan.","This Poolcenter Clear Round Solar Blanket may be too small to cover big swimming pools, but it is a thick, durable solar cover with a long warranty. However, even then, it is heavy and needs protection from UV rays."]},"id":"af08c4fb-95db-4e9b-a243-fe02390af5e2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63267","url":"/poolcenter-16-mil-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T20:23:35Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T20:23:35Z","name":"Poolcenter 16 Mil Swimming Pool Solar Blanket","synopsis":"The Poolcenter 12-Foot Clear Round Swimming Pool Solar Blanket is a round solar cover for in-ground and above-ground swimming pools that are kidney-shaped, oval-shaped and irregularly shaped.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Poolcenter 12-Foot Clear Round Swimming Pool Solar Blanket is a round solar cover for in-ground and above-ground swimming pools that are kidney-shaped, oval-shaped and irregularly shaped.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-05T20:23:35Z","id":"4GtwYHF2tuuu9gQECM2QS8","meta":{"title":"Poolcenter 16 Mil Swimming Pool Solar Blanket Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Poolcenter 16 Mil.
