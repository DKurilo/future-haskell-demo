You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The 3510 TruTemp Candy/Deep Fry Thermometer is an easy-to-use thermometer with an appealing design. Use this <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">kitchen thermometer</a> to get a good reading on your candy mixture or to monitor deep-fry oil temperature as you cook. If you like a dial display better, consider the <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">CDN IRXL400</a>.","The tempered glass tube design of the 3510 TruTemp Candy/Deep Fry Thermometer allows the thermometer to extend into your pot and gives you a temperature reading in Fahrenheit from 100 to 400 degrees, and in Celsius, from 50 to 200 degrees. These readings are not labeled with heat stages for candy making, so you will need to have a goal temperature in mind and keep a sharp eye on your thermometer as you cook.","This candy thermometer also features a pan clip that lets you clip the thermometer directly to your cooking pan and keep it stable. An insulated ball at the top of the clip makes it easier for you to grab the thermometer without burning your hands, if you need to take a closer look at the temperature gauge. A safety cap serves a similar purpose, giving your fingers something to hold on to without burning as you move the thermometer or pull it out for reading.","With this candy thermometer, you can also read the temperature of almost any liquid that is boiling in a pot, including frying oil. Its bulbous sensor would not, however, be suitable for taking the temperature of meat or baked goods.","Like all thermometers of its type, this glass candy thermometer must be handled with care. They are built to be sturdy and to withstand extremely high temperatures, but they are not indestructible. If the thermometer breaks, you will need to throw out any food that came into contact with the broken glass and the contents of the thermometer.","Some people may find the reading pane on this thermometer a bit hard to see – the type is very small, so if this is an issue for you, look for a thermometer with slightly bigger, more readable type. If you do not have trouble reading small type, this candy thermometer, with its handy heat insulated pan clip and safety cap, may be a nice addition to your kitchen tool drawer."]},"id":"50890082-d272-4547-b4a4-35fdaf89ba2a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63290","url":"/trutemp-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:09:15Z","datePublished":"2015-03-06T23:09:15Z","name":"TruTemp 3510","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-06T23:09:15Z","id":"JNsceAeZGPV7not3e8koXb","meta":{"title":"TruTemp 3510 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of TruTemp 3510.
