One of the biggest problems associated with salt water is rust, which can occur just about anywhere that the salt water penetrates, unless you take proper care of your boat. The easiest way to take care of the salt water problem is to thoroughly clean your boat after you have used it in such conditions. When cleaning your boat you will want to make sure you use a neutral base soap and plenty of fresh water. You also want to ensure that everything on the boat is dry and all of the metallic parts are oiled before putting the boat away.","Not only do you want to take care of your RC boat after you have used it in salt water, but there are also certain precautions you want to take before you even put it in the water. The first thing that you will want to do is check to ensure that all of the screws in the boat are tight, pay close attention to the engine mount, propeller and rudders on every boat. If you are using a sail boat you want to ensure that the mast screws are also tight to reduce the risk of capsizing. You will also want to seal any openings in the radio box with silicone, if this is not possible you will want to use rubber boats to help prevent water from getting inside. The receiver should be kept inside a plastic bag, with a small hole cut for the antenna, and then close the bag with plastic straps.","Another big problem that RC boats face is capsizing, which is going to happen sooner or later no matter how good you are. Capsizing is hard on the boat because it allows salt water to get inside, which can wreak havoc with the electrical components of the boat. To help prevent your boat from sinking when it capsizes you will want to insert empty soda bottles into the bow of the boat. To do this take the lids off the empty soda bottles and squeeze them flat so you can fit as many as possible into the bow. Once inside the bow fill them up with air so they are in their original shape and then replace the caps. For your hull you will want to put as many pool noodles as possible, so that when it does capsize it doesn’t act as a buoy.","The most important thing to do when your boat flips is to get rid of the water as soon as possible. This not only means emptying out the gas tank and the fuel lines, but it also means cleaning out the engine. When cleaning your engine look for plain oil coming out, if it is a brown liquid that means water is still present in your engine.","These are just a few of the more important things to do before, after and during your outdoor adventures with RC boats. Salt water boating is something many people enjoy. It may take a little extra time to get everything up and going but it&#39;s always worth it in the end.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don’t Have To.™"," "]},"id":"38f3bd65-b6c0-44f0-a251-b5e8dd5ab88a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4809","url":"/safely-using-your-rc-boat-in-salt-water","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sheila-homer","url":"/author/sheila-homer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Sheila Homer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"3eo84DPoKWudatse8WsUgb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-24T16:32:40Z","datePublished":"2010-08-24T16:32:40Z","name":"Safely Using Your RC Boat in Salt Water","synopsis":"Using your RC boat in salt water is a little different than using it in fresh water because of the damage that can be caused by the high levels of salt in the water.","review":{},"strapline":"Using your RC boat in salt water is a little different than using it in fresh water because of the damage that can be caused by the high levels of salt in the water.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-30T18:32:38Z","id":"xtDtKTBhfinZttuA8x2FaB","meta":{"title":"Safely Using Your RC Boat in Salt Water","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
