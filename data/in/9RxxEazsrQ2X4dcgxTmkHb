You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you suffer from diabetes and want first responders to know about your condition quickly and easily without broadcasting it to the world, the LIFETAG 2-Tone Magnetic Bracelet with ID Slide may be ideal. Additionally, it has magnetic properties, which some people and medical practitioners believe may provide additional health benefits.","This two-tone bracelet is a unique type of <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">medical ID bracelet</a>. Designed by a jeweler after four years of research, this stainless steel and gold bracelet looks more like a fine piece of jewelry, similar to the <a href=\"/hera-review\">Hera Stretch</a> and <a href=\"/lynx-roman-review\">Lynx Roman</a> bracelets, than a medical ID bracelet. However, the ID slide ensures that EMTs and other medical personnel are aware of your condition. This is an ideal product if you prefer to keep your condition private and don&#39;t want to wear an obvious medical ID bracelet, but still want something in case of an emergency.","Another way this bracelet is different from many others is that it features small magnets in the band. Some medical practitioners suggest that magnetic therapy helps to increase blood flow in the area it&#39;s placed, which may offer diabetics who suffer from poor circulation an added benefit. They also suggest that magnetic therapy may help speed healing, reduce inflammation and pain, and be beneficial to those suffering from other medical conditions such as fibromyalgia and arthritis.","This medic alert bracelet with the LIFETAG diabetes ID tag is available in various lengths that range from 4.5 to 9 inches, and it is adjustable. The ID slide itself is a discreet charm-like piece that features the Rod of Asclepius with the word Diabetes through the middle. This design is a universal symbol that represents medicine and it instantly alerts EMTs and medical personnel that you have a condition of which they should be aware.","It is a decent choice if you are looking for an ID bracelet that discreetly lets people know you have diabetes. However, it is a pricey option and doesn&#39;t include other features or functions such as a complete medical history or engraveable faceplates. Additionally, if you have other conditions or want a medical alert bracelet that can store your entire medical history, you may find this product to be insufficient for your needs."]},"id":"8161e195-b70d-41ce-a53b-cdb66c3e3134","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63672","url":"/lifetag-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:14:07Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:14:07Z","name":"LIFETAG 2-Tone Magnetic Bracelet 342735","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-24T19:14:07Z","id":"9RxxEazsrQ2X4dcgxTmkHb","meta":{"title":"LIFETAG 2-Tone Magnetic Bracelet 342735 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The 2-tone Magnetic Bracelet with ID Slide from LIFETAG is a discreet piece of jewelry designed for diabetics.
