They are, in most ways, the same die cutting machine, now manufactured by the same company. But since both are widely available and often competing for the same crafter’s dollar we thought it would be worth looking at them both on their own. The only very noticeable difference was in pricing. Craft ROBO seemed always to be less expensive. You really get a lot for your money too. This die cutting unit comes with many of the features we liked on more expensive units.","It can cut without a computer. That is a priceless feature. You can cut with your computer, another priceless feature. You can save your designs to SD cards, insert one in the Craft ROBO and cut away. This die cutting system comes with software that will help you create any design you can possibly imagine. Your only limitation in terms of design will be finding the time to do it.","You will also have a lot of control over things like blade depth, pressure and speed. You can instruct the machine to cut patterns along specified curves and other paths or to fit as many of your patterns as possible onto one page.","This die cutting machine is light because it really is tiny. The widest cutting path it can muster is 8 inches. That will be a major drawback for some folks. Most of the die cutting systems in our lineup cut at least 12 inches. It’s light but could still use some portability creature comforts like a carry handle and onboard tool storage."]},"id":"155b5a0f-9857-4da1-b113-fefc7c4a9189","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Portability &amp; Convenience"},"id":"fb7e87ec-7342-474f-be6b-b81f20d7d821","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This die cutting unit will cut cardstock, acetate, sheet magnet, vellum and vinyl without much trouble.
