We were surprised that several of our <a href=\"/health-and-beauty\">pillow</a> testers already owned a MyPillow and were unhappy with it. And our official MyPillow sleep testers reported the same findings.","The inside of the MyPillow is filled with large chunks of memory foam. You can feel the individual chunks through the pillow material, which feel like pieces of carpet foam. When we squished and fluffed and punched this pillow, these pieces didn’t meld or stick together, it always felt lumpy. This became a problem while sleeping because these chunks didn’t feel soft, so sleepers felt very sore, especially in the neck area, after using the MyPillow all night.","Several testers did mention that when they bunched the MyPillow into a certain shape that in the morning it was still in that shape. So we feel confident in affirming this claim made by the manufacturer. And after washing the whole pillow a few times, it still retained its shape. The MyPillow comes with a 10-year warranty just in case it loses its shape and you need a new one.","We purchased the standard, regular filled pillow, but MyPillow does offer other sizes with more or less filling inside. But even users of the more filled and firmer MyPillow designs reported they felt the lumpiness in their pillows, too. And no matter how long we used, bunched and fluffed it, the inside foam never became softer or more uniform. Overall, we were not as impressed with this pillow as we hoped to be. We found the <a href=\"/health/wellness/best-pillows/casper-review/\">Casper Pillow</a> to be a better option for a soft, moldable pillow with good support. "]},"id":"a72402b5-50aa-4fbb-bf32-db35f80ca63d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3b27282e-8e05-4fec-8b15-97ac78fa3384","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MyPillow does keep its shape all night and even after several washes.
