This appliance is a manual <a href=\"/best-pasta-makers\">pasta maker</a> from France that includes a manual, a recipe book and a warranty on all parts for three months.","This stainless steel machine is nearly one solid piece. The black, plastic handle is the only nonmetal piece. The removable parts are the accessories that cut the dough as it rolls through the appliance. The unit is 8 inches long, 8 inches wide and 5.5 inches high.","The roller has an adjustment knob on the side of the machine with nine different settings. These settings regulate the thickness of the pasta as the apparatus churns it out. The minimum thickness possible with this machine is 0.3 millimeters, while the thickest you can roll pasta is 2.5 millimeters. This allows you to cut a range of thicknesses. Thinner settings are for making spaghetti or tagliatelle pasta, and thicker sheets are ideal for lasagna.","The appliance weighs a little less than 7 pounds, making it a compact machine. It clamps to the edge of your counter or table, which allows it to remain sturdy as you turn the handle and roll the dough into pasta sheets. This limits where you can place your pasta maker machine in your kitchen and may be an issue if you have limited counter space.","This pasta maker does not have many separate attachments. Eurodib does not sell any add-on parts to let you cut shapes other than spaghetti and tagliatelle or motorize the appliance. If you want a pasta maker that lets you buy extra attachments, take a look at the <a href=\"/cucinapro-review\">CucinaPro Imperia Pasta Machine</a>.","Included with this appliance is a recipe booklet. The aim of this book is to teach beginners how to make pasta by sharing step-by-step instructions. There are recipes for different pasta dishes that call for long, flat noodles. The book also discusses how to make dough from scratch and other pertinent information.","The Eurodib Pasta Party Machine is designed for beginners who want to learn about pasta making. However, it is limited to two cuts of noodles because Eurodib does not manufacture attachments for this pasta maker."]},"id":"d4dfa6ef-62e1-41bd-aa6d-f30825eee00e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64719","url":"/eurodib-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-07T18:12:40Z","datePublished":"2015-05-07T18:12:40Z","name":"Eurodib","synopsis":"The Eurodib Pasta Party Machine can make spaghetti, tagliatelle and similarly shaped pastas.
