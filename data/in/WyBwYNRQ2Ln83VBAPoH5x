This speaker system falls right in the middle of the pack in terms of sound quality. It is one of the least expensive systems in our lineup, providing an option between budget and pricy. Our listening panel enjoyed the bass response, but that wasn&#39;t enough to propel this <a href=\"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-home-theater-speakers/\">home theater system</a> toward the top of our lineup.","Our reviewers watched the same movie clip to evaluate all of the home theater speakers in our comparison. The subwoofer in the Yamaha system provided rumbling bass that added depth to the movie scene, but the surround sound wasn&#39;t nearly as impressive. We calibrated each set of speakers to be optimized for the room we were listening in. Even calibrating this system multiple times, the two mains were by far the most dominating. This left almost no need for the center speaker. There was also a slight echo between the center speaker and the two mains which became audible at higher volumes.","There is a scene in the movie where the main character is surrounded by a group of motorcycles. The left and right surround sound speakers didn&#39;t do this part justice. The best surround sound speakers engulf the listener, making them feel as if they were surrounded as if they were the main character. This Yamaha surround sound system failed to produce the same effect. Again, it felt as if the majority of the sound was coming from the front left and right speakers with little help from the side speakers.","The dialogue and treble clarity were above average. While the dialogue was clear, the speakers had a slight boxy tonal quality to them. This term refers to the speakers sounding as though there was a box placed over the speaker, giving them a slightly muffled sound. They weren&#39;t as bright as others in our lineup. That being said, the Yamaha speakers still sounded clearer than half of the speakers in our lineup.","The subwoofer amplifier can produce up to 100 watts of power for rumbling bass. The 8-inch front-firing subwoofer definitely rounds out the sound with quality low end. Our panelists felt the subwoofer was the best component of the home theater speaker system.","The sound system is covered by a two-year warranty. This is average coverage. Other companies offer up to five-years of coverage on speaker systems. You can contact Yamaha via live chat, phone or email if you have any questions about the system."]},"id":"2947230c-f03a-40ca-a720-9d96fdf13858","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"83eedd5f-ef49-4187-8797-6ef45955ea9d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This sound system falls right in the middle of our lineup for sound quality.
