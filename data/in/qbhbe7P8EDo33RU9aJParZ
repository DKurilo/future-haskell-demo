This <a href=\"/best-electric-wheelchairs\">power-operated wheelchair</a> can travel up to 4 mph and can travel more than 16 miles on a single battery charge. Additionally, it has a tight turning radius and an excellent warranty. However, it is missing a few features and has a few drawbacks common with other electric wheelchairs.","This motorized wheelchair can go up to 4 mph, which is the average speed you find on many electric wheelchair models. The battery life is better than average: You can travel more than 16 miles on a single battery charge. Good wheelchairs can go approximately 15 miles, and the best can go approximately 19 miles on a single charge.","The wheelchair&#39;s 21-inch turning radius is also impressive. This is one of the tightest turns we recorded. The tighter turns allow the chair to more easily move around indoors in small rooms and around corners. Additionally, when you&#39;re outside, this model can climb steep slopes or grades at a 7.5-degree angle. The average motorized wheelchair climbs at a 6-degree angle.","The design of this electric wheelchair is fairly basic. It comes with features such as a seatbelt and joystick control. It features plenty of padding on the seat, backrest and headrest. However, the fenders are only available in one color â€“ red. Furthermore, this product is heavy. It weighs approximately 240 pounds, making it one of the heaviest electric wheelchairs of any we reviewed. This model has rider weight capacity of 300 pounds, and the model measures 42 inches tall, 24.5 inches wide and 35.5. inches long.","The warranty is excellent: The frame is covered by a lifetime manufacturer warranty, and the electronic components are covered for 13 months. This is one of the best warranties we saw with electric wheelchairs."]},"id":"5a4911f0-d8fd-429e-9ddc-6bff1aeabb2a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"50fd992c-44c3-4887-b14a-7f8cc63f9b2b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jazzy 600 ES can help you maneuver around indoors easily with a tight turning radius.
