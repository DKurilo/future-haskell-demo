Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You can <a href=\"/best-learn-english-software\">learn English</a> and 100 other languages from 101 Languages of the World software. In this sense, it&#39;s the most comprehensive language software in our ranking. We looked at just the English component in our evaluation of this software.","This ESL application is written for Spanish speakers to learn English. The accompanying instruction text and translations in the English lessons are in Spanish, though much of the application teaches through virtual immersion. 101 Languages of the World offers foundational elements and tools to learn English grammar, speaking, reading and writing.","The ESL component of this application is a learning module that immerses you in English grammar, text, translations, information, audio and illustrations. The text comes from stories, articles, tutorials, movies and more.","Learning English in the immersion environment is separated into five segments: theater, reading, activities, pronunciation and conversation. The theater segment provides images and text. Images are available on the theater screen and reading screen. The reading screen presents English text for you to read and learn vocabulary. You also can use the sound feature as you read and listen to words and segments. The reading screen shows you translations, the roots of words and grammatical information.","The activities segment presents several English exercises and games to help you learn, and the pronunciation segment is comprised of three components: Listen &amp; Speak, Words and Sentences. Listen &amp; Speak lets you hear native speakers and record yourself saying the same statements, and then compare sound-wave charts of the two. Words gives you feedback on aspects of your word pronunciations that need work, and Sentences does the same for your pronunciations of complete sentences. The Conversation segment offers 36 conversations that you can hear and model by recording your voice.","101 Languages of the World has all the English Fundamentals we look for in our review, except Cultural Aspects.","This software offers several games and English exercises under the Activities tab. They include Crosswords, Vocabulous, Word Dictation, Unscramble, Plug-n-Play, Graffiti and Sentence Dictation. In Vocabulous, you fill in the blank to complete sentences. The Unscramble game lets you make sense of scrambled sentences and then reads the reordered sentence to you. Plug-n-Play requires you to plug in the correct words in the proper word context. When you do, a voice reads them to you.","The Reference Tools tab at the top of the user interface gives you access to grammar basics. It contains information on parts of speech, the alphabet, sentence structure, gender, conjugations and more.","This ESL application lacks a dictionary, does not let you set personalized learning paths and does not come with videos or books.","This program is harder to use than some competing products, and it seems a bit older. You often have to read the help guide to learn to use the different features and tools. This is the least intuitive application of all the software we evaluated. It scored lowest in our Ease of Use category of all the products on our lineup. Spanish is the only instructional language offered in the ESL component of 101 Languages of the World.","Good customer and technical support can make a difference in your user experience. Representatives we contacted were helpful and knowledgeable. In addition to FAQs to answer common questions, you can access support via email and telephone. 101 Languages of the World does not offer live chat support."]},"id":"ebe0f461-7629-4a75-a66d-69288d991b10","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e518f828-26e9-48e3-9dbf-dec65bd2c7db","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["101 Languages of the World has all the necessary elements to help you learn English.
