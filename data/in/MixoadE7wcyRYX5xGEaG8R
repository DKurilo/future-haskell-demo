To ensure we include the best companies, we look for insurers with ratings of A or above from A.M. Best, an organization that grades companies on their financial health. Because life insurance has such a far-off horizon, you want to work with a company that can pay claims in 20 years. You should avoid any insurer with a grade below a B. You can find companies’ life insurance ratings on <a href=\"http://www3.ambest.com/lh/default.asp\">A.M. Best’s website</a>.","Because there are so many life insurance companies, we couldn’t possibly include every insurer. We looked at those with a relatively high market share and name recognition. We also excluded companies that operate as brokers – for example, companies like GEICO and Progressive who don’t offer their own life insurance policies and instead connect you with a third party. If you do use a broker, check its rating and consult your <a href=\"http://www.naic.org/state_web_map.htm\">state insurance commission</a> to see if any complaints have been made about the agent.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Price is probably the biggest consideration when choosing a life insurance policy. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution – your policy is customized to you specifically. Insurers factor in your health, your financial situation and what your beneficiaries will need in the event of your passing. To provide some idea of what you can expect to pay, we got quotes from each of the insurers we reviewed. ","One quote was for a 45-year-old man who smokes and is in good, but not excellent, health. Our male subject was married with a 12-year-old child. Our other quote was for a 33-year-old woman in excellent health with a 2-year-old child. To have some measure of uniformity, both our hypotheticals had similar financial situations. ","We got quotes for a 20-year term policy and a permanent insurance policy. We’ll explain the difference below, but briefly, a term policy provides a single benefit for a set number of years, while a permanent policy lasts indefinitely and includes an investment portion that builds value over time. Permanent policies tend to have much higher premiums than term policies.","Because these policies are customized and complex, you can expect to spend close to a half hour on the phone answering questions about your health and income. Some insurers, like New York Life, prefer face-to-face meetings, so we couldn’t include them.<br/>","<strong><br/>How Much Does Life Insurance Cost?</strong>","This question is always followed by another: How much coverage do you need? The amount of coverage you need determines how much you pay in monthly premiums. For example, a $250,000 term life insurance policy can cost close to five times less than a $1,000,000 policy. Your premium also depends on your gender, age and health. A healthy woman can expect to pay around $20 a month for a $250,000 policy, while a healthy man can expect to pay around $25 a month. Whole life policies, which include a savings account that builds value, are more expensive and cost between $100 and $500 a month.","<strong>How to choose a life insurance policy</strong>","Life insurance is a grim subject – no one wants to think about dying, much less how their family will be provided for when they’re gone. But when you get a life insurance policy, your family will continue to receive an income as well as have money to pay for funeral expenses and your children’s future educational expenses.<br/><br/>","How much do you need?<br/>According to the American Council of Life Insurers, most experts recommend getting a policy that pays between seven and 10 times your annual income. Depending on your age, income, savings and other factors, you may need more or less. There are many <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/insurance/life-insurance-calculator.aspx\">online calculators</a> that can help you figure out how much you need in insurance as well as how many years your policy should last. ","<br/>Generally, the older you are, the more likely it is a shorter policy will be useful. If you have enough savings, a good retirement plan and low debt, a lower limit policy is a good option. When you call for a quote, the agent will ask you questions about your financial situation, health and plans for beneficiaries before making recommendations.","What type of policy should you get?<br/>There are two main types of life insurance policies: term and permanent. A term policy is the most common and most affordable. It covers you for a certain amount, called the face value or death benefit, for a set period of time. A $250,000 policy with a 20-year term will pay your beneficiaries $250,000 if you die at any time during the 20 years the policy lasts.","<br/>A permanent policy doesn’t expire and instead lasts for as long as you pay the premium. A permanent policy is guaranteed to pay out the claim. It’s not an if – it’s a when. In addition to the death benefit, a permanent policy has a living benefit that builds value each year. A portion of your premium is put toward building the value of the living benefit. A permanent policy is much more expensive than a term policy, often costing up to 10 times as much.","<br/>A good way to think about the differences between term and permanent life insurance is to compare it to renting versus owning a home. Renting can be cheaper, but it’s temporary and doesn’t build any value. Owning a home is more expensive, but you build equity and long-term value.","<strong>Pros &amp; Cons of Permanent Life Insurance</strong>","When you shop for life insurance, you’re asked to choose between a term and a permanent policy. There’s a lot of confusing terminology, and different types of permanent policies can be complicated. A term policy is straightforward – it pays out a certain amount if you die during the length of the policy. If you’re considering a permanent policy instead, here are some pros and cons to consider:","<em>Pro: These policies never expire.</em> Unlike term life insurance, which lasts up to 20 years, a permanent policy does exactly what the name suggests and doesn’t expire. It lasts for either as long as you live or as long as you make payments. If you do miss payments, you may end up relinquishing some of the policy’s cash value.","<em>Con: These policies are expensive.</em> When we got quotes, the permanent policies were two to five times more expensive than the term policies. Yes, much of your payment goes toward increasing your policy’s long-term value, but the higher monthly payments may be outside your budget. Keep in mind that factors like age, gender and health help determine your monthly premiums.","<em>Pro: There are savings benefits in addition to policy payout.</em> Term life insurance pays out a set amount if something happens to you during the policy’s term. Permanent life insurance has a savings element that accrues value over the life of the policy. This can increase the death benefit paid out to your beneficiaries, and you may be able to access it in other ways, depending on your policy.","<em>Con: The policies are complicated and confusing.</em> Permanent life insurance is complicated, and it can be hard to comparison shop because there’s a lot of variance between providers. In addition, there are many subtypes, such as whole, universal, variable and indexed universal, that have different ways of building your policy’s cash value."]},"id":"bee90a5a-2237-456b-86c5-edca32fae7c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_331","url":"/best-life-insurance","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-14T14:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-14T14:00:00Z","name":"Best Life Insurance of 2019","synopsis":"We spent 40 hours getting life insurance quotes and speaking to industry experts to find the best life insurance companies for your needs.
