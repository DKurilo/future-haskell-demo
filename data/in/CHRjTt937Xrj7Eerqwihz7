This RC boat is a beast compared to the other radio-controlled boats in our review â€“ nearly three feet long and weighing more than a pound. And it&#39;s designed to help you catch fish up to five pounds (though we didn&#39;t test the fishing capabilities). However, despite its size, the Radio Ranger is surprisingly fast and has decent, though not great handling.","Since the Radio Ranger is so big, it&#39;s more difficult to travel with and handle than the other RC boats we reviewed. At nearly 3 feet, this boat easily takes up a lot of space in your vehicle. It&#39;s made of thick, but light plastic. Despite its size, this RC boat only weighs a little more than 1 pound. When we tested it, the radio had fallen off the underside of the hull and some wires were loose. In order to get it up and running, we reconnected the wires and reaffixed the transmitter to the underside of the hull with some tape. This wasn&#39;t a huge problem, but the setup wasn&#39;t ideal. Also, the screws were loose for the boat&#39;s back wing, causing it to detach from the boat frequently.","After multiple rounds of testing, we gave the handling a B. The size of the boat definitely helps with stability, especially in rougher waters. While it doesn&#39;t have the sharp turning radius and agility of smaller RC boats, it responds well to your directions.","The boat features two propellers and two motors, which allows the boat to reach speeds of 20 miles per hour, though the fastest speed we recorded was 18 mph. Considering the size of the boat, this is plenty fast enough to have fun and stir up some small wakes. The variable speed setting is especially nice, because it provides more control over the boats acceleration than other RC boats.","The variable speed setting is also ideal for trolling or baiting while fishing. While we didn&#39;t attempt to fish with it, the boat comes with a custom fishing pole and the manufacturer claims it can catch fish up to 4 to 5 pounds. You simply thread the fishing line on your fishing pole through the yellow pole on the boat and this allows you to troll with a spinning line behind the boat. You can also use this to take your bait out beyond your casting abilities with a range of up to 400 feet.","One of the best features of the Radio Ranger is the long run time. In our tests, it averaged a 20-minute run time, which was the longest of any boat. Many of the RC boats we tested had run times less than 10 minutes, which is very disappointing. The biggest downside to this 20-minute run time is the very long charge time. It takes over five hours for the battery to fully charge. As such, we recommend purchasing multiple batteries if you want to spend more than 20 minutes on the water.","All the supplies and accessories you need to hit the water are included. Besides the pole, you also get a battery for both the boat and the included transmitter. There is even a plastic display stand you can set the boat on after you finish your runs. RC Fishing World even threw in a bobber, some fishing line and stickers to help customize the look and feel of your boat."]},"id":"1307bf3e-c36c-4961-8b98-0256d77afc93","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4c79d878-4614-4568-8914-86be45d344bb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Radio Ranger is an excellent RC boat, both for an entry-level hobbyist and a fisherman.
