If you ve been handling only cash and checks up to now, you ll need to decide if you really need credit card processing equipment<strong> </strong>and whether you should rent or buy it.","Start by looking at your cash flow to determine if the cost of renting or buying the equipment would justify a credit card lease or purchase. If your business is tight on cash, you may want to rent for the short term. Conversely, if you have a cushion of capital to buy your credit card processing machines outright, you should sit down and work out the lease or buy equation."]},"id":"c63908e3-6e32-4e40-b8d0-ef4f4adaeb13","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Leasing Credit Card Processing Machines"},"id":"50bccbe3-0593-4ddb-b127-c266355d279c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["First up: leasing processing machines. When you choose this option, you ll need a merchant account that allows you to accept credit card payments. The equipment rental company can often set one up for you. You ll most likely be better off renting a credit card machine from a local company so that service will be easier to take care of when needed. Once you ve found a rental company, you ll be offered several choices for processing equipment, including machines that accept both credit cards and debit cards that require a PIN to complete transactions.","Some credit card processing equipment will allow you to process gift cards if you plan to offer them. Many rental companies now provide wireless credit card machines that are useful for small businesses that accept payments offsite, such as at trade shows or outdoor fairs.","Next, ask about the fees you ll be charged for both the leased machine and the transactions. Companies offer a variety of terms, including weekly or monthly rental fees and  transaction fees. The downside to renting is the ongoing weekly or monthly charges. The upside is that the rental company is responsible for all maintenance if the machine goes down, and you re likely to get machine upgrades as they are released."]},"id":"f7b77117-d058-45d3-b4f4-af67dcc2ea21","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Buying Credit Card Processing Machines"},"id":"37520111-83e5-4f3d-beb3-5784bf6b9303","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As for buying, the main expense here is the actual cost of the machine. You can set up a merchant account for yourself and go buy a machine. You&#39;ll still incur per-transaction fees like you would with rental processing equipment, but you&#39;ll own the machine outright.","The downside here is that you are responsible for maintenance if the processing equipment goes down, and if you need to upgrade, you ll have to buy a new machine yourself. Credit card processing equipment comes with a warranty, so read that information carefully to be sure you know how long your machine is covered.","If you re still unsure about which way to go after doing research on leasing and buying, consider renting your credit card processing machines for a short term. You may pay higher fees than you would for a longer rental term, but you ll also gain a clear understanding of whether you want to continue leasing or buy your processing equipment outright instead.","Before you worry about whether to lease or buy processing equipment, make sure you qualify for a merchant account. You ll go through a fairly stringent application process just to set up the account, and you will need that account in place before you can move on to the leasing or buying stage."]},"id":"9acbde54-9bb3-4292-97a5-827043c2ad18","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6148","url":"/credit-card-processing-machines-should-i-buy-or-lease","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-20T18:22:10Z","datePublished":"2011-06-20T18:22:10Z","name":"Credit Card Processing Machines: Should I Buy or Lease?","synopsis":"Are you wondering whether your new or small business would benefit from using credit card processing machines to accept payments?","review":{},"strapline":"Are you wondering whether your new or small business would benefit from using credit card processing machines to accept payments?","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-04-06T17:04:35Z","id":"ygCehTq5DLXY64RKzkvd2A","meta":{"title":"Credit Card Processing Machines: Should I Buy or Lease?","description":"Should you buy or rent your credit card processing machines?
