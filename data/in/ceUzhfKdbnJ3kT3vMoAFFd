This was the slowest time among the models we evaluated.","Unlike comparable 3D Blu-ray players, though, the BDT460 notably includes premium features like 2D to 3D conversion and 4K upscaling at 24p playback. In our hands-on testing, both options provided decent, if not major, benefits. 4K upscaling refers to converting high-definition video in a way that approximates 4K video, while 3D conversion allows 2D content to be viewed in simulated 3D. Our testing setup was built around a 4K and 3D-capable Sony HDTV, active Sony 3D glasses and a copy of the movie &#34;Gravity&#34; that included standard and 3D versions.","The 3D conversion menu gives you a decent amount of control, with options to adjust factors like the simulated depth of field from the 2D source material. In several sample scenes, elements like space debris had decent 3D fidelity, but the quality was still a step behind the original 3D version. Likewise, up converted 4K playback was decent but similarly lagged behind the native 4K content we played. Still, both are definite strengths for the 3D Blu-ray player and provide extra functionality for 4K or 3D HDTV owners who want to get more mileage from their setups."]},"id":"c2e65302-2fd4-47cb-9c52-87ed3d0e55f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"4df1d9bd-f3fc-49a6-b186-e6dfefa43946","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/wPN8KKsZqYjg8fx2QAvJXA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Panasonic has the expected HDMI audio playback standards.
