Frigidaire FAD704DWD <a href=\"/best-dehumidifiers\">dehumidifier</a> extracts as much as 70 pints of excess moisture from the air in small to large areas. The unit is designed for rooms up to 1,400 square feet in size, making it ideal for a damp basement. The unit&#39;s collection reservoir is capable of holding up to 15.3 pints of water. While this larger capacity reduces how often you empty the dehumidifier, it makes the bucket harder to lift and maneuver when the bucket is completely full.","If you&#39;d prefer to bypass using the bucket, this portable dehumidifier allows for continual draining: You attach a garden hose (which you buy separately) to the back port and place the drain hose lower than the unit so that gravity will pull water from the machine. This means you will need to position the dehumidifier either on a counter next to a sink or on the floor near a floor drain. Unlike the best dehumidifiers, this Frigidaire model doesn&#39;t have a built-in pump that draws water from the unit, up the hose and out into a nearby sink or window. However, you can purchase an external drain pump that is compatible with this model.","If the electricity goes off in your home, this home dehumidifier will automatically restart once power is restored using the last settings entered into the digital display control panel. It also has auto shut-off that turns the unit off when the water-collection bucket is full.Â ","There are two important functions missing from this unit that are typically included in the best dehumidifiers. The first is auto defrost. This feature shuts the machine off if the room temperature dips below 41 degrees. This feature protects the dehumidifier&#39;s internal mechanisms so they don&#39;t ice over and stop working.","The second feature that&#39;s missing is a 24-hour timer. This feature lets you program the machine to turn on at certain intervals of time, such as the most humid parts of the day.","The Frigidaire FAD704DWD uses 745 watts of power when in use. This is comparable to other 70-pint dehumidifiers we reviewed; however, other similar-capacity units, like the <a href=\"/sunpentown-review\">Sunpentown SD-52PE</a>, use substantially less power. Still, it is Energy Star certified.","This Frigidaire dehumidifier has a sturdy design. It weighs 46 pounds, but has four caster wheels and a handle to make it more portable and easy to move around your home. It features two different fan speed settings. It reaches a decibel level of 53.4 on the highest setting. This is one of the quietest machines on our dehumidifier review, though you will still hear it when it is running.","If you have any issues with your Frigidaire FAD704DWD, you can contact customer support via telephone, email and live chat. There is a copy of the user guide on the Frigidaire website. Parts and labor are covered for one year. Frigidaire also provides an extended five-year warranty on the sealed system of this dehumidifier."]},"id":"576f0ebd-feb7-47e9-b7a1-c5ce459e3db8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7977d8c6-d549-495e-b8a9-35d64051f074","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Frigidaire FAD704DWD can remove high quantities of moisture for your home quickly and efficiently.
