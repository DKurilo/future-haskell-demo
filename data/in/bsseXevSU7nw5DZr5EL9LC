The Ryobi RY34446 yard trimmer is a good example of what to look for in a weed whacker. This multipurpose yard care tool has a solid design that works with a variety of accessories to help you sculpt your backyard. Ryobi&#39;s comprehensive technical support offers a range of useful tools.","The design of this weed trimmer integrates a 30 cc, four-cycle engine into a lightweight package. This makes the weed eater a breeze to use in most circumstances. A trigger control and an anti-vibration system also help. The only thing that eats into its easy handling is its lack of an adjustable handle. This can make it harder to use the machine if you are above or below the average height.","A bump-feed straight-shaft trimmer head comes with the RY34446, making it easy to add a new length of line with a quick tap on the ground as you work. The trimmer head has an impressive 18-inch cutting reach, which tackles more weeds than a typical grass trimmer. The trimmer head also features a debris shield.","The Expand-It line of Ryobi gas trimmer attachments help you get down to business with your yard&#39;s landscaping. With these optional equipment upgrades, you get access to a wealth of landscaping power tools. An edger attachment allows you to put professional-style edging between your lawn and the sidewalk. These accessories can also tame wayward limbs on your trees, sculpt your hedges into ordered rows and more. This weed trimmer doesn&#39;t have a shoulder strap or sweeper accessories, though.","The support options for the trimmer let you easily get assistance if you have problems. A three-year consumer warranty provides an extra year of protection compared to many of the other gas trimmers in our review, but it doesn&#39;t offer any additional driveshaft protection. Ryobi has abundant service centers, and customer service representatives are available by telephone and email. The trimmer also has a PDF manual available for download."]},"id":"0f4295d2-f7b8-45e3-9baf-80f5d61e4382","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"14e3cbfe-3cd4-487f-933d-01eb9dd3df4b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ryobi&#39;s RY34446 is a mid-range weed trimmer with a good balance of features, such as a powerful engine, a light form factor and strong technical support.
