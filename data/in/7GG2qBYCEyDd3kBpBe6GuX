You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Developed by Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. robotics students, Anki DRIVE is a racing game where the cars think for themselves. Each car is equipped with artificial intelligence, and each one is smart – really smart. They know how to stay on the track, they know how to maneuver and steer, and they even have virtual weapons. Sure to be this year&#39;s hit <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lists/gift-ideas\">Christmas gift</a>, the Anki DRIVE racing system will impress even the toughest sleepy-eyed Christmas-morning critic.","Any age can enjoy the Anki DRIVE racing game, as long as they can work an iOS device. So if your 2-year old has figured out your iPod, and if Grandpa has some coaching on the iPad, the whole family can get involved.","To win in Anki DRIVE, you don’t have to be the fastest car; you just have to take out the competition. When you play against the &#34;computer&#34; or play with friends, engage virtual weapons to drive the competition off the track. Whoever earns the most points wins, which can even be redeemed for upgrades.","Although there are four different cars, you can&#39;t simply pick and choose which vehicle will come with the starter kit. Black and yellow vehicles, Boson and Kourai, are the included AI cars and are specifically engineered as offensive players. Red and blue cars, Rho and Katal, are sold separately and are engineered as defensive racers. For this Christmas, only one oval racetrack and four cars are available, but in the future Anki will unveil different track shapes and special-edition cars.","The free Anki DRIVE app allows you to control speed, changing lanes and the use of weapons via Bluetooth. There are even different modes such as Battle and Practice, and difficulty settings. The Anki DRIVE app is compatible with the iPhone 4s or newer, iPod touch 5th generation or newer, iPad 3rd generation or newer and the new iPad mini.","Along with the first two cars, the starter kit includes a wall charger, charging cases, tire cleaner and the 42-inch-by-102-inch mat racecourse. The mat has infrared signals that your AI cars can read, telling them where the lanes are and where to navigate. Keeping it clean and flat is a key component for better racing games. The app even alerts you when to clean the tires for optical racing performance. Charging the cars is easy and fast – it only takes about 10 minutes – and each comes with its own plastic charging case. Each charge lasts for about 20 minutes, so you&#39;ll have enough juice for multiple races.","If you&#39;re looking for racing games for kids this holiday season, check out the Anki DRIVE system. Even if you&#39;re an older kid, say 30+, you&#39;ll enjoy racing these mini AI cars come Christmas morning and all year long."]},"id":"ed440962-c4cc-4a54-b698-447314f64546","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58080","url":"/anki-drive-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-08T14:00:11Z","datePublished":"2013-11-08T14:00:11Z","name":"Anki DRIVE","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because a newer version, Anki OVERDRIVE, is now available.
