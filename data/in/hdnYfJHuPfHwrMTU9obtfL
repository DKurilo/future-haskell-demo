You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The arrow-shaped cleaning head of the BISSELL PowerEdge Hard Floor Vacuum looks a little odd but proved remarkably effective at cleaning larger debris off bare flooring. This <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\">hardwood floor vacuum</a> cleaner lacks the convenience of cord-free operation and struggled a bit when faced with smaller debris, but for everyday maintenance of your hardwood areas this will work wonders.","While the other units pushed the sawdust around and then off of the hardwood flooring test strip, the PowerEdge was able to sort of corral the mess first and then suck it up. When we poured flour over the test strip to simulate fine dust and similar messes, we found this BISSELL to be somewhat lacking, though. It cleaned up some of the flour but left some behind as well. Other units did a better job of removing the flour without a trace. The PowerEdge was so good on the sawdust, though, and that means it will be great on larger debris that gets spilled often in the average home, including cereal, kitty litter and the like.","There are few things you get to adjust yourself on the PowerEdge. There is just the one switch – on or off – unlike other vacuums that let you turn the brush roll on or off, or adjust suction. This unit is designed to automatically adjust for height, though, so if you are going from a really thick-pile carpeting to hardwood, you will get both surfaces clean. In our cleaning it seemed to do a pretty good job of making those adjustments and cleaning both types of flooring effectively, at least on larger debris. As mentioned, though, it struggled quite a bit on the flour we used to recreate fine dust.","This unit doesn’t compare too favorably in terms of some ease of use issues. It is loud for its size and has no hose or accessories of any kind. This is strictly a stick vacuum with no features to help in cleaning curtains or furniture. Its large dust bin means you do not have to empty it often, and that is convenient."]},"id":"1d1cf1ea-333a-42ae-9d3d-50b17e18c81f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"be016a89-aea6-43a5-9145-569ab6ce59d0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BISSELL PowerEdge Hard Floor Vacuum is great for quick pick-ups here and there, but it is not the type of unit that will handle your whole household of cleaning needs.
