One of its top flat-screen TV wall mounts is the VideoSecu Tilt MF607B, which is capable of supporting a 32- to 55-inch television weighing up to 165 pounds. When your TV is attached to the mount, you can tilt the TV down 15 degrees to relieve any glare or to create a better line of sight. If you choose a fixed position for the TV, the profile is a slim 1.9 inches – just enough room to run cables to and from the TV.","A durable steel construction makes up the VideoSecu Tilt MF607B&#39;s frame. This sturdy material should make you feel at ease when attaching your TV to it. Although sturdy when installed, it seems that getting it mounted to the wall is the hard part. VideoSecu includes the installation hardware you&#39;ll need to install the TV wall mount, but it may not have every piece you will need, but only those for common TV models. The mount&#39;s approved VESA pattern goes from 100x100 to 600x400.","The consensus is that the included attachments aren&#39;t guaranteed to fit your TV, and a trip to the hardware store may accompany your purchase. VideoSecu also includes a full-sized level, although the level is small, and compared to higher-quality levels, it isn&#39;t accurate. If you don&#39;t already have a level, though, it will do the job.","Horizontal adjustment is possible with the VideoSecu MF607B&#39;s rail design. This means that you can adjust the tilt of the screen and the horizontal location of the TV on the mount. For those of you worried you won&#39;t be able to center the mount correctly on your wall due to stud placement, the horizontal adjustment will help with that problem. There isn&#39;t a cord-management system to hide all of those dangling cords, but you can purchase a cord cover from the company&#39;s website. When you purchase this mount on Amazon, VideoSecu includes a free HDMI cable. Up until a few weeks ago, you could only purchase VideoSecu TV wall mounts from a third-party vendor.","You can do exactly two things on VideoSecu&#39;s website: find contact information or purchase a wall mount. Nothing more. There are no online FAQs, installation videos or downloadable user manuals – things you would expect to find. The lack of helpful information is disappointing, as is the absence of a warranty. These two missing elements make this mount&#39;s other fantastic features seem less significant."]},"id":"b46f078c-bf4e-41cd-87f6-9d6417edf282","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ab2aa1f1-ffe5-40df-a6c1-112b80a56ef4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["VideoSecu has a huge selection of TV wall mounts, including stationary, tilted, ceiling and other models.
