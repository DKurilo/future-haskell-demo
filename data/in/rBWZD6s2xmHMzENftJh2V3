You use sensors for your doors and the perimeter of your home, but intruders can enter through the windows, meaning you need to block them as well. Window sensors are small devices you mount to your windows to detect and notify you with a chime or alarm when a window opens. Many sensors are wireless and held in place by a specialized magnet or adhesive that secures them along the window. ","Many window alarm sensors work as an indoor accessory, like the <a href=\"#Ideal\">Ideal Security Wireless Slim Door or Window Sensor</a> and the <a href=\"#Mace\">Mace Slimline Wireless Door/Window Sensor</a>. Others function both inside and outside, like the <a href=\"#GE\">GE Choice Alert Window/Door Sensor</a>. The right sensor for your home depends on how many sensors you need, the type of alert you want when a window is breached, and whether or not you have an existing alarm system in your home.","<strong>Window Sensors: What to Look For</strong>","With so many choices, it helps to take note of a few details and features that make a big difference in your choice. Consider these aspects when making your purchase.","<strong>Sound</strong><br/>The sensor&#39;s notification can come in a variety of alerts. A siren is intimidating, attempting to scare away an intruder before they get any closer. A modest beep or chime keeps your system a little more low-key, alerting you to the entry of a new person but without a severe alarm. Most window alarm sensors are battery-powered and have varying power requirements.","<strong>Size</strong><br/>Window sensors come in an array of sizes. The smaller the sensor, the less likely it is to be noticed by outside parties, keeping your security system well hidden. Sensors range from under an inch wide to over 4 inches wide in order to accommodate a variety of window sizes. Many models hold just one sensor, but some go up to five sensors.","<strong>Setup</strong><br/>You can choose between window alarm contacts that sound by themselves and those that are part of a collaborative system. If you have a relatively small home or an apartment in an upstairs unit, choosing one sensor that operates individually is your best bet. However, a larger property that has many entrances and windows would benefit from an extensive system. All of the sensors featured here are wireless, so they are easy to install, and there are no wires or cords that tangle or are easily seen.","<strong>Location</strong><br/>When planning your security system, you can mount sensors indoors so they are out of the elements and out of sight of potential intruders. However, several models allow you to also place them outside so that you can detect an intruder sooner rather than later.","Protecting your home and family is important, and selecting the right window sensor for your home and budget creates the best possible security at the right price. Make the most out of the newest addition to your house by learning more about window sensors.","<strong>Doberman Security Review</strong>"]},"id":"2756dad0-7488-4907-a8bb-0f1766e26c55","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/TBZefsSWHUdafM6VNfUNyY.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Integrating the Doberman Security Ultra-Slim Window Alarm into your home helps protect it from intruders.

You can place a sensor around the area, such as a window or a door, with the included mounting tape to ensure protection. In order for the sensors to work, this unit needs to be paired with the tattletale base alarm unit. Combining the system with the transmitter provides wireless coverage for up to 300 feet.","The window alarm sensors are 1.25 x 1 x 0.25 inches, so they are small enough to remain discreet. The lightweight design also helps with installation. Each sensor weighs only about a quarter of a pound. Non-damaging adhesive comes with this unit to secure sensors to your walls. A lithium battery is all this unit needs to work, and the battery lasts for up to 10 years.","The window sensors emit a chime sound that rings when a window or door is opened or closed. The alarm emits a louder alert when those openings are breached during an unauthorized entry. A dedicated sensor allows you to check on the status of the device. Features include notifications for low battery, a lost signal or a bypassed sensor or if someone tampers with the system.","A unit this small does not require a lot of power. The function of the sensors and the fact that there is a supervised sensor aids in the ease of use. With a supervised sensor that indicates functions, you are more likely to be sure when there truly is a problem or intruder rather than a system malfunction.","The tattletale Wireless Door/Window Sensor is a highly cohesive unit. The box contains detailed instructions and the items that you need to mount your device. It offers a variety of features and a user-friendly design. However, the price of the unit does not include the base unit needed to receive the alarm signals. Each sensor is also sold separately, which could add up depending on how many doors and windows you need to arm.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"dd941a13-e03b-4eab-8d31-153647eaa18e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10254","url":"/best-window-sensors-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-18T21:51:44Z","datePublished":"2016-11-18T21:51:44Z","name":"Best Window Sensors Review","synopsis":"When setting up a security system for your home, your biggest priority is coverage.","review":{},"strapline":"When setting up a security system for your home, your biggest priority is coverage.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-18T22:08:56Z","id":"rBWZD6s2xmHMzENftJh2V3","meta":{"title":"Best Window Sensors Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
