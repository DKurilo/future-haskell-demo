The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","The Cubify Cube from 3D Systems is one of the most compact, affordable and easy-to-use 3D printers. Not only is there very little setup, but maintaining the machine and replacing cartridges is also straightforward and trouble-free. The Cube also excels in connectivity, making it easy to print via USB cable, flash drive or Wi-Fi. Due to the well-designed compact body and easy-to-use touchscreen and interface, the Cubify Cube is perfect for all-around user-friendliness.","Quality is a major deciding factor when selecting a 3D printer. The Cube allows you to print in three settings for higher quality or increased speed, much like the quality settings on common inkjet printers. We found that if the print doesn’t work properly or the filament doesn’t feed correctly, you can abort the project and save yourself from a wasted print. During quality testing, the printer printed the same object exactly the same four out of five times. On only one of the print trials, the first few layers shifted, the printer corrected and the rest of the object was flawless.","With the Cubify Cube, you do have to buy the manufacturer’s $49 3D printing materials, as this printer is not built for one-size-fits-all cartridges compatible with other 3D printers. However, you do have many different color options in both PLA and ABS, including glow-in-the-dark colors, black, blue, red, pink, silver and more. Discounts are available if you buy more than three, and a great recycling program provides discounts and eco-friendly options for used plastic.","The Cubify Cube is a great 3D printer for home use because of its lightweight design and small structure. At 13 inches tall and 10 inches wide, this 3D Printer will fit conveniently in any garage, office, craft room or shop. Its small size is a space-saving benefit, but it also means you can’t print large objects. The maximum print you can build is 5.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches.","The Cube comes in any of five fun colors: silver, pink, green, blue or white. There is no housing enclosure to protect you from the print head or hot elements on the printer itself, but the plate is cool to the touch and not heated like on other 3D printers. Nevertheless, it would be wise to keep children away while the Cube is printing, and refrain from touching the model or the printer until finished to prevent injury.","The touchscreen menu, found on only a few of the best 3D printers, is a wonderful asset on the Cube. Easy instructions walk you through setting up the Wi-Fi, installing new filament cartridges, and checking settings and the status of prints. Time left to a finished print is displayed right on the screen. You can even check how much filament remains in the cartridge.","This 3D system is backed by a 90-day warranty should any problems arise with your printer. Cubify is easy to reach via email or phone if you have any questions. For the best support, check out the blog, FAQs or tutorial page. We found helpful video tutorials for setting up, using the printer and troubleshooting tips to keep this 3D printer in great shape.","Connecting the Cube to your computer is simple. Once you download the free software, you can plug the included USB cable into your computer to print. Or, use the included flash drive to download files from your computer, then plug it into the printer itself. This 3D printer is also Wi-Fi capable, so you can wirelessly print your creations. We found that in order to print via the Wi-Fi, we had to connect to a unique Wi-Fi signal from the printer itself and could not connect to our office network at the same time. So if you have multiple networks at home or extensive firewalls, printing from the flash drive might be the best solution to free up your computer during print times.","From the Cubify website, you can download software that allows you to modify, create and print 3D models. The 25 included 3D designs are mostly small toys, jewelry and cups; there are many more free and priced models available from the Cubify website. You can also branch out to other 3D model sites, download designs and print them with the Cube. To make sure a design is compatible with the Cube, open the file in the software and save it in the Cubify format.","Everything you need to get started is pre-assembled and in the box ready to go. A starter cartridge of filament, USB cable, power cord, flash drive with a manual and 25 free designs, printing plate, glue, maintenance tools, and the printer itself. All you need to do is plug in the power supply, apply glue to the printing plate, place the plate on the magnetic arm, insert the filament cartridge and press the on button to start printing. Setting up this printer is easy, and simple instructions are right there on the touchscreen should you need any reminders."]},"id":"e5b14bec-505f-4833-a3ef-59db20e11caa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"75dbb910-d08d-4590-b10d-03ef22cadc3f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ease of use is one of the best aspects of the Cubify Cube.
