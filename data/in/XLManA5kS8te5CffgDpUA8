This guide outlines the best STIHL chainsaws available from your local dealer, to help you choose which model would work best for your needs. For example, if all you need to do is some light pruning around the yard, a 16-inch gas chainsaw with a 50cc engine is overkill, while an electric model isn’t suitable for cutting large bundles of firewood in the forest.","As we researched and tested some models, we found that STIHL chainsaws are durable, powerful and worthy of their reputation. Our personal favorites are the MS 170, a light and fast cutting chainsaw that each of our testers could use regardless of arm strength, and the MS 271, a powerful backwoods and farm tool that makes cutting firewood much easier."]},"id":"9b3366b4-6c83-4cb2-b5b9-91818257f70c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Chainsaw Basics"},"id":"80deb280-03c0-4dcc-8a51-072d9d44cb64","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are two main components to a chainsaw: the guide bar and the engine. The guide bar is the portion of the chainsaw around which the chain rotates, and it represents the cutting area. The length of the guide bar is synonymous with the size of the wood it can cut in one pass. Guide bars vary anywhere from 14 to 32 inches in length. Homeowners typically don’t need a guide bar any longer than 16 to 20 inches long. Anything longer than that is for heavy-duty cutting, landing those models in professional territory.  ","The engine provides power. The type of engine that you need greatly depends on the amount of work you want to do and the size of the cutting job. Here are the three common types of chainsaws and the type of work each is used for:","<strong>Gas Chainsaws</strong><br/>Gas chainsaws are by far the most powerful and portable, as well as the most common, but they’re also the heaviest. These engines run longer than battery-powered engines, but are much louder than both electric and battery-powered chainsaws. Gas engine power is measured in cubic centimeters, or cc, and a larger engine equals more power. Larger gas-powered chainsaws are best suited for heavy-duty cutting jobs, like felling medium or large trees and cutting medium to large firewood. A gas-powered saw is what you’ll want for forest cutting, since you’ll be away from any power source. The last thing you want is battery power to run out in the middle of a job.","<strong>Electric Chainsaws</strong><br/>Electric saws are best for yard work around the home. These saws have to be plugged into a power source, so they are not as portable as chainsaws with gas- or battery-powered motors. These saws are less powerful and quieter, and they require no gas mixing or refueling. Plus, they are much simpler to maintain than gas motors. An electric chainsaw is best used for pruning, light firewood cutting and limb cutting.","<strong>Battery-Powered Saws</strong><br/>Battery-powered saws are best for simple yard work. Pruning and trimming small branches is as about as much as battery-powered chainsaws can handle safely. These basic saws are best for the most casual of chainsaw users.","<strong>Price</strong><br/>If you aren’t going to be using your chainsaw regularly, you probably won’t need to go all out with a $500 model such as the MS 150 T C-E or MS 250 C-Q. If you want a chain saw to have around the house for those specific cutting jobs that pop up here and there, you can probably get away with a model like the MS 170, which costs less than $200."]},"id":"5707c55a-c8fa-44ae-813b-1da9f5eb4740","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"STIHL Chainsaws: Recommendations"},"id":"504029cd-4fc0-4693-98ad-54a8f6253df8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Are you going to be doing mostly light trimming and pruning or are you going to be cutting medium sized fire logs?
