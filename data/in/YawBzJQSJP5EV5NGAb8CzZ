PIR, or passive infrared motion detectors, are not only the most commonly used types of sensors to detect motion, they can determine the temperature of objects in a room.","One slight movement or change in temperature in an area of the room triggers the alarm. For this reason, PIR sensors enhance your home security system, adding an extra layer of security throughout your home. However, you must carefully consider the placement of these motion detectors, in order to maintain your highest level of protection.","<strong>What to Account for</strong>","Home security advisors and professionals point out a couple of things you should know before installing PIR motion sensors in your home.","<strong>Secure and Stabilize:</strong> Double-check your sensor s stability. Sometimes false positive alarms can happen if the sensor&#39;s mount becomes loose. If the overall sensor itself moves, it could falsely detect this as movement in the room and trigger the alarm.","<strong>Air Vents:</strong> By placing PIR motion sensors away from air vents, you can ensure that a temperature change from an air vent does not trigger the alarm. Prevent false alarms by aiming the detector away from vents.","<strong>Range: </strong>Know the range of each sensor and do not go beyond it. Motion detectors come in a variety of shapes, sizes, formats, and, yes, varying ranges. Once you know a PIR sensor&#39;s range, you can know the farthest points it can detect and map out your home&#39;s coverage.","<strong>A Comprehensive System</strong>","By selectively placing only a few PIR motion sensors in your home, you provide additional security to your existing home security system. Good places for motion detectors include hallways and stairways. Other great places to add monitoring sensors are windows and doors.","Place a door sensor on both the front and back door. With the ease and speed of entry paramount in a would-be robber s mind, guarding main entryways should be a priority. Install a deadbolt on both doors as well, if you do not already have one. Without one, thieves can kick the door open and gain quick entry. Finally, securing windows and doors with glass-break sensors strengthens your home s defense.","Regularly evaluate your home s total security. What points of access can a thief break into easily? From there, determine your home&#39;s vulnerabilities. These include blind spots. Blinds spots are areas of your not visible from the street or neighbors&#39; vantage point. What spots are highly visible from the road? Do you have valuable items displayed in visible spots? For example, a large flat screen TV that can be seen from the street through your front window may be a beacon to potential thieves.","With all of these helpful tips, be mindful as a homeowner, but also think like a burglar."]},"id":"7a2a8477-fd07-4c29-8ef3-e74116104d92","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9448","url":"/the-best-places-to-put-home-security-motion-sensors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-24T01:42:03Z","datePublished":"2015-04-24T01:42:03Z","name":"The Best Places to Put Home Security Motion Sensors","synopsis":"Most homeowners wonder where the best spot is to place motion sensors within an existing home security monitoring system.","review":{},"strapline":"Most homeowners wonder where the best spot is to place motion sensors within an existing home security monitoring system.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-06T18:44:54Z","id":"YawBzJQSJP5EV5NGAb8CzZ","meta":{"title":"The Best Places to Put Home Security Motion Sensors","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
