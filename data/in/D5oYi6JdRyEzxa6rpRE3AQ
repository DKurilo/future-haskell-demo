However, while there isn&#39;t anything glaringly wrong with the quote process and its agent finder tool is excellent, the company’s low customer satisfaction score is worrying, especially since its interaction rating is below average.","Liberty Mutual&#39;s quote tool received a B grade for overall ease of use. In addition, it earned a B+ for being comprehensive, as it asked 54 questions and displayed an average of seven questions per page. By comparison, <a href=\"/state-farm-insurance-review\">State Farm</a> asked 123 questions, while <a href=\"/american-family-insurance-review\">American Family</a> asked just 14 – Liberty Mutual falls right in the middle.","Since I used my parents&#39; home to obtain quotes, I knew roughly what the reconstruction value should be. However, Liberty Mutual&#39;s quote was hundreds of thousands of dollars under. This is likely because it doesn&#39;t ask many questions to determine what materials your home is made of and its construction quality, both major focuses of State Farm&#39;s quote tool. So, while you can get a good policy to cover your personal property and liability, you may want to question the reconstruction value, especially since it’s the most important part of the coverage. You certainly don&#39;t want to find out you’re only insured for half your home’s value if it burns down.","Liberty Mutual earned a low overall customer satisfaction rating in the 2017 J.D. Power study of homeowners insurance companies. It received an overall score of 799, putting it in the bottom half of the 31 insurance companies evaluated. On a somewhat positive note, it received three out of five power circles in four of the categories in the study, which J.D. Power defines as &#34;about average.&#34; Since insurance companies have notoriously fickle customer satisfaction, an average rating doesn’t mean you&#39;ll have a bad experience. However, it received a below-average score in the interaction category, an evaluation of customers’ experiences with Liberty Mutual employees.","The agent finder tool on Liberty Mutual&#39;s website is very good. You can find local agents and view their personalized pages, which include their availability and contact info. You can also see which languages they speak, how engaged they are in your community and their interests. The only feature missing on these pages is user reviews, which would allow you to see how other clients have enjoyed their experience with the agent.","By most accounts, Liberty Mutual is an average homeowners insurance provider. The size of the company, quote process and most of aspects of its customer satisfaction fall right in the middle. However, its low interaction rating from J.D. Power is a concern."]},"id":"1dbc3f4e-4d24-4c86-ba96-a4034eff64dc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49015","url":"/liberty-mutual-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-03-18T01:48:37Z","datePublished":"2010-03-18T01:48:37Z","name":"Liberty Mutual Homeowners Insurance","synopsis":"With over $120 billion in total assets, Liberty Mutual is one of the more financially stable homeowners insurance providers I reviewed.","review":{"rating":56,"verdict":"Liberty Mutual&#039;s quote and agent finder tools are above average.
