The DWS535 is one such testament to the brand name and proves itself capable of long-term daily use as a carpenter’s best friend. Many reviewers take note that even after using it all day every day, at the start of the next day it still runs just as well as when it was first purchased.","This circular saw is capable of performing a bevel of up to 53 degrees, one of the best angles you can find on the market. It also offers a top-accessible spindle lock, which makes changing blades quite easy. The depth gauge allows you to quickly and accurately change the depth of cut, and when combined with sight lines you can increase the accuracy of your cutting drastically.","This DeWalt comes with a three-year warranty in addition to a 90-day money back guarantee. The warranty provides added financial assurance you need to make a purchase, considering the long-term investment a power saw can be if treated right. Even with a warranty, many consumers find the device proves durable enough to require no repair or part replacements beyond the blades, thanks to the sturdy design of the cord and device itself.","As is the case with worm drive engines, this is not the lightest, most portable circular saw: it weighs nearly 14 pounds. It makes up for the excessive weight with a durable magnesium construction to ensure the machine lasts through excessive use for years. Consumers have even noted that after dropping it on the floor, it still worked like new and had no dents on its exterior.","The DeWalt DWS535 is among the best circular saws due to its design and reputation. It is durable enough for daily use and is designed so well as to run just as well on its 500th use as on its first."]},"id":"a45b5f0d-8735-4676-bf4e-708355f48f40","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57496","url":"/dewalt-dws535-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
