You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sportsman GENTRi9K Tri Fuel Generator is a high-powered, durable and versatile <a href=\"/best-portable-generators\">portable generator</a>. It not only provides more than 9,000 surge watts and 7,200 running watts of power, but also allows you to choose what kind of fuel you want to use. Other portable generators are powered exclusively by propane, natural gas or gasoline – the GENTRi9K can use all three, making it much handier in situations where your preferred fuel type is not available. It also features a control panel with a total of eight power outlets, allowing you to connect devices, appliances, RVs and more. It is also very efficient, delivering 10 hours of uninterrupted power when using gas and five hours using propane on a 50 percent load. And it will run indefinitely when connected to a natural gas supply.","This Tri-Fuel Generator is powered by a 15-horsepower, 420 cc, four-stroke engine that generates 9,000 surge watts and 7,200 continuous running watts. This is enough to power a full-sized RV, household appliances like refrigerators and televisions, power tools and more, which makes it great for camping, generating jobsite power and emergency backup power for your home. As long as you have fuel, you’ll be able to keep your devices and appliances running.","The control panel on the Sportsman GENTRi9K likely has all the outlets you need. You get four 120-volt outlets – which are like the ones found in your home’s walls. It also comes equipped with a 12-volt DC outlet – like the cigarette lighter in your car. Additionally, you get a 120/240V outlet for large appliances and a 120V twist lock outlet that can power your RV. So, no matter what type of plug your devices use, you’ll be able to connect them to this generator.","There are two ways to start this three-fuel generator: with its keyed electric start or with the recoil cord. The electric start option requires a key; that will be your primary way to start generating power. If the key doesn’t work, you can use the recoil cord – you just pull it the same way you would start a lawnmower.","This portable generator has 7.4-gallon fuel tank for gasoline, which should be enough to sustain power for 10 hours on a 50 percent load. You should know that you must use gasoline that is at least 87 octane. You also have the option to connect a standard-sized propane tank to the generator, which will last five hours on a 50 percent load. You can also connect it to a natural gas line that will provide unlimited power as long as the gas flows. The versatility of fuel sources is what makes this generator one of the best picks available.","Portable generators are a great way to keep the power running when the electrical grid goes down or you just need some juice away from traditional power supplies. The Tri-Fuel puts out a lot of power and accepts all fuel types. It’s hard to go wrong with a generator like the GENTRi9K."]},"id":"b0c9858e-cbcb-4fc6-9774-a8e770719f7a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56463","url":"/sportsman-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
