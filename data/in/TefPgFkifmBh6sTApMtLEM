Before reading this, you have probably taken it out for a test run or two. You can only show it off to your friends in a parking lot so many times before you get bored and want to get more use out of your new purchase. The compulsion with every man-child is a need for competition. At this point, you&#39;ll forcibly recommend that your friends and neighbors find a comparable RC car so you can race them. If you&#39;ve spent a good deal of money on your car, you won&#39;t be satisfied with driving it on the gravel street in your cul-de-sac. It&#39;s time to build a track and prove your racing merit.","<strong>1   The Choice Between Professional and Rally Tracks</strong><br/>Different RC cars are built for different surfaces. If you only own a licensed-design sports car with low clearance, you&#39;ll want to focus on smooth, solid surfaces. Some quick options for surfaces may be on a driveway, basketball court or, if you&#39;re desperate, on the street in front of your house. If you&#39;ve spent the money on a RC rally car, you will not be satisfied unless you find a decent-sized dirt patch. The lumpier and more uneven it is, the better.","<strong>2   Design the Track</strong><br/>Now that you&#39;ve decided which track will best fit your car; it&#39;s time to chart out a course. First, have a blueprint drawn up so that the project doesn&#39;t become more work than it needs to. As far as size goes, you won&#39;t need more than a 20-foot by 20-foor area. You can chart out the obvious oval course or focus on hard turns to make it more challenging. If you are racing on a hard surface, you can easily chart out the borders of the track using chalk or tape. On a soft track, you can purchase small garden wall dividers from any home improvement store or even use a garden hose to keep the RC cars on the track. Depending on how many racers are involved, the track should be within 5 to 7 feet wide.","<strong>3   Add Jumps and Obstacles</strong><br/>It&#39;s time to start building. Obviously, if your car is a cheaper model, you won&#39;t want to test its durability and have it go off jumps. Mid-grade remote control cars can fly right over jumps and without being damaged. To add a challenge on a dirt track, build an overpass jump but cut out the middle so that the cars have to scale the jump or fall and be left behind. On hard surfaces, find a few level skateboard ramps and place them a few feet from each other so that each car can land on the declined ramp to help its shocks last longer. If you really want to put in the extra work, add texture to the course with cut areas of Astroturf or carpet in patches.","Now it&#39;s time to race your RC cars. Whether you have spent $2,000 or $20 on your car, you want to get the most out of it. Building a track will give you an added level of fun and competitiveness that will keep your excitement with this hobby fresh."," "," "]},"id":"2e35be3d-7a88-4c42-a3b6-41aa425b8b56","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7689","url":"/how-to-build-the-best-rc-track","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kent-dunn","url":"/author/kent-dunn","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kent Dunn","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EXSnxY8W9sDDg36fM4idRa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-19T15:39:01Z","datePublished":"2012-11-19T15:39:01Z","name":"How to Build the Best RC Track","synopsis":"You just bought the remote control car that best fits your personality.
