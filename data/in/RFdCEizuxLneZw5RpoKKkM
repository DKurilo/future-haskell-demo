Essentially, you have the ability to capture everything that happens on your computer: from applications to video streams and even video games.

It may take some time to explore everything Camtasia has to offer. The interface itself is quite intuitive. Anyone with a moderate level of computer skills should be able to master Camtasia&#39;s basic functions with few to no problems.","The Welcome screen launches the recording tool interface with a single click. From there, you  select the portion of the screen you want to record and click the red REC button. It also allows you to easily pick your webcam and audio options. To make it even easier, Camtasia allows you to program hotkeys, or keyboard shortcuts that allow you to quickly start, pause, and stop a recording. You can also lay down markers and pick regions of your screen to record. If you need something extremely easy to use because you don&#39;t have much experience with this kind of thing, take a look at the <a href=\"/debut-video-capture-software-review\">Debut Video Capture</a> software.","There is no way to schedule an automatic screen recording from within Camtasia&#39;s interface, but there is a way to do it.
