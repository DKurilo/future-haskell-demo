You can create an entire book with a table of contents, index pages, narratives, notes, charts, images, source information and a bibliography. There aren&#39;t themed templates for publication, but you can create customized headers, footers, margins and fonts. You can also personalize charts with color, text, images and shapes. Within RootsMagic, you can publish six types of CSS-styled websites: pedigree charts, group sheets, combo pedigree chart and group sheets, descendant narratives, ancestor narratives and alphabetical narratives.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/61012-rootsmagic-with-macbridge7.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8dh48FKscnpgDV8k24Kg2o.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"8dh48FKscnpgDV8k24Kg2o","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8dh48FKscnpgDV8k24Kg2o.jpg","alt":""},"id":"10aa1747-142e-4bda-a68a-4268a2f38bc1","type":"image"},{"data":{"text":"Citations &amp; Organization"},"id":"959a64be-4571-4373-a418-d245cc08d7c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["RootsMagic offers nearly 400 templates for managing source documentation about people, facts and family trees. Sources can be copied, memorized, merged and listed, and you can apply more than one source to each entry. You can also create your own source templates. Once you complete the information for each source, RootsMagic can format that data into a properly arranged citation. You can also cite media, add a quality rating and store sources in a repository to keep them safe.","In the Windows-to-Mac transfer via MacBridge, some of RootsMagic storage and sharing features were lost. With RootsMagic on Mac, you can’t burn CDs or back up your database to a CD. In fact, most of the backup tools fail to transfer from platform to platform. You can’t save or back up any of your database to Dropbox or Google Drive either. If you like having physical records in addition to storing them on your computer, you will notice the absence of these features.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>","RootsMagic’s support system is mostly online. If you have questions about the software, you can still find a help menu and searchable index, but most of the support is online. If you have trouble installing MacBridge or getting RootsMagic started after installing, there are FAQs and helpful tutorials online to step you through the process. For software that allows you to run a Windows program on a Mac, installation is an easy drag-and-drop process."]},"id":"95caab49-9c3c-4c0b-9cf1-486635eacfbc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d357dc27-85a3-4c3b-a153-06a3afc00601","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["RootsMagic is available for Mac users because of MacBridge.
