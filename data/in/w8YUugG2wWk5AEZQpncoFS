However, this is still one of the top ten best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1286-best-center-speakers.html\">center channel speakers</a> we found in our review. Despite its small size, it is capable of producing a wide range of sound because of some unique design features. Definitive Technology may be a relative newcomer to the audio equipment game, but products like this might help them gain more popularity.","In a home theater system, the center speaker is in charge of the main dialogue and sound effects. A weak center channel speaker can be drowned out by background noise or the soundtrack. The ProCenter 1000 uses one 1-inch pure aluminum dome tweeter to produce high frequencies and two 4.5-inch woofers to battle against being drowned out. The woofers are surrounded by Definitive&#39;s Balanced Double Surround System (BDSS) which supports the cone at two points. This design gives better stability and improved resonance.","The Definitive Technology ProCenter 1000 also has two 4.5-inch pressure coupled bass radiators on the sides of the unit. These are not additional drivers, but they support the woofers and add extra bass to the big sound. This doubles the radiating area of the center speaker without having to increase the size. The result is richer midrange and lower frequencies.","Since it is small in size, this center speaker can easily rest on top of the entertainment center or television. It is five inches deep and it has a built-in foot to keep it stable if you&#39;re resting it on top of a TV. You can also mount the unit on the wall above or below your television.","The ProCenter 1000 has a frequency response of 47Hz to 30kHz. This is an impressive range for a smaller center speaker. Most people can hear frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz, so this can play above what the human ear can audibly perceive. Sometimes supersonic sounds are added to audio to enrich the sound. That&#39;s why higher frequencies are important in a center speaker. Low frequencies, however, are not as important because most of the bass is going to come from the subwoofer.","If you need any support with your Definitive Technology product, you can contact the manufacturer by email or by telephone. You can also view the product manual in PDF form on the site. However, if you need a quick answer to a question, take note that the FAQs page is not in the support section -- it&#39;s in their Learning Center. This center speaker is covered by a 5-year warranty."]},"id":"a5910366-a9b9-4180-8f66-874c5fcc0fb7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"19bcd5b0-f634-4b84-892e-2b2dd956fedd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ProCenter 1000 delivers surprising audio.
