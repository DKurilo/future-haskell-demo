While not every customer that shopped with the retailer during this timeframe was affected, the company offered all its customers free identity theft protection for a year; an expensive proposition necessary to retain customer goodwill.","While breaches at big businesses like Eddie Bauer and Target make the news, small business are not immune from criminal attention. Symantec&#39;s 2016 Internet Security Report said that security attacks against small businesses – defined as 250 employees or less – has increased steadily in the past five years, particularly when it comes to cyberattacks. Hacked credit card fraud is likely to increase to a jaw-dropping $4 billion in 2016, climbing up to $10 billion between 2016 and 2020, according to a study by the antifraud company Aite Group.","Identity theft is a costly business for merchants. The Ponemon Institute&#39;s 2015 Global Cost of Data Breach study noted that companies can spend up to $154 per lost record. A 2016 <a href=\"https://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/downloads/assets/true-cost-fraud-2016.pdf\">study by LexisNexis</a>  found that for every $100 of fraud, the actual cost to the merchant is $240. It also estimates that retailers lose 1.47 percent revenue per year to fraud.","While a <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">reputable credit card processor </a> can offer some protections against credit card fraud, such as EMV-compliant card readers, PCI compliance, and tokenization and encryption technologies, they cannot guarantee complete safety against data theft.

According to a study by the Global Fraud Index, a PYMNTS and Forter collaboration, online fraud attacks jumped 11 percent since the shift.","Even worse, thieves are moving toward account takeovers, according to a study released by NuData Security in August 2015. Rather than simply using the credit card number, thieves are using the information they steal to hijack accounts. Often, they reroute communication from the account so the victim never sees it. Account takeovers increased 112 percent in the first quarter of 2015. What this means to you as a business is that any information your customers put into your system could be a potential inroad to identity theft beyond your store."]},"id":"79bd79d5-fa00-4329-a6f7-9a1163bb876c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"How to Protect Your Business from Credit Card Fraud"},"id":"94e6e872-f52f-4376-b121-a2a0a8a8c8f1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Credit card fraud and identity theft are costly threats to merchants and consumers alike. It&#39;s important that businesses of all sizes practice vigilance in deterring fraud and data theft. Here are some simple steps you can take to protect your business and your customers from credit card fraud:","<strong>1.\tUpgrade to EMV-compliant card readers.</strong> As more businesses adopt chip technology, thieves target businesses that are slow to update their systems. By declining to update outward-facing technology like card readers, you communicate to criminals that your business is less tech savvy, and therefore easier to penetrate. Of additional concern is that until you upgrade your system, your business is liable for any counterfeit credit card fraud perpetrated at your point of sale.","<strong>2.\tGuard Points of Vulnerability. </strong>Unmanned credit card readers, such as ATM machines and self-serve gas pumps are increasingly vulnerable, as they are less likely to get upgraded soon, due to expense and extended EMV deadlines. Make it part of your employees&#39; routine to check these devices for signs of tampering. Learn more about what you can do to deter fraud in our <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">article on ATM and gas pump vulnerability</a> . Also, be sure your employees aren&#39;t a source of risk. Limit their access to sensitive information, train them to spot signs of credit card fraud and focus on security as a part of everyday operations. Learn more about what you can do in our <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">article on employee fraud</a>.","<strong>3.\tChange your passwords regularly and protect them.</strong> Never keep a default password. Changing passwords regularly – and having unique, strong passwords for each account – is one of the best ways to protect your business. In addition to having good password protocols, be sure you compartmentalize sensitive information on accounting programs or credit card processing portals so that your employees can only access the information they need to perform their jobs.","<strong>4.\tSeek eCommerce programs, web hosts and credit card processors that have a strong focus on security. </strong>PCI compliance should be a given for any business doing transactions over the Internet. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocols are two decades old and no longer the standard. As of June 2016, with migration for all industries by June 2018, the Payment Card Industry requires TLS 1.1 or better encryption for all processing companies, including acquirers, processors, gateways and service providers.","<strong>5.\tEstablish best practices for card-not-present transactions.</strong> If your business accepts cards online or over the phone, be sure you and your employees protect customers&#39; sensitive information. Never store credit card numbers on your computer or on paper; if you need to do recurrent billing, your credit card processor should be able to provide a feature that encrypts and tokenizes customer card data so you don&#39;t have to store it. Get more tips in our <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">article about preventing eCommerce fraud</a>.","Although the switch to EMV chip technology has made face-to-face credit card transactions more secure, thieves are refocusing their efforts on retail stores with old equipment, unmanned card readers such as ATMs and fuel pumps, and online stores. Whether your business accepts cards in person or online, it&#39;s important to follow best practices for accepting credit cards so that you can protect your business and your customers from credit card fraud.","<em>Contributing writer: Karina Fabian</em>"]},"id":"d814c947-59f8-4436-8c68-b246791f32f9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10208","url":"/fraud-statistics","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-27T14:18:46Z","datePublished":"2016-10-27T14:18:46Z","name":"Shocking Credit Card Fraud Statistics.
