There also is an option to let you make on-the-fly changes in your program so your exercise sessions will not become dull and predictable.","With the Horizon EX-69 Elliptical, you get workouts that include manual, speed intervals, endurance intervals, peak intervals, cardio burn, muscle toner, strength builder, nature trail, peak descent and mountain climb.","You can monitor your heart by grasping sensors located on the elliptical’s stationary handlebars.","The stride length is 20 inches, which is generally good for people with an average stride length. Unfortunately, the stride length on this elliptical trainer is not adjustable. You can adjust the incline, but it is not automatic – you must do it manually.","This cross trainer provides a flywheel that is only 14.3 pounds, which is quite light for elliptical machines. However, it is good-sized at 73 inches long, 22 inches wide and 65 inches high, and weighs a total of 185 pounds. Someone as heavy as 300 pounds can use it.","The Horizon EX-69 Elliptical provides you with several accessories to make working out less of a chore and more of an enjoyable experience. These include MP3 plug-ins, speakers, a fan, water bottle holder and reading rack.","However, there is no quick start option or locking pin.","The warranty package for this elliptical trainer provides lifetime help for the frame, one year for the parts and one year for labor.
