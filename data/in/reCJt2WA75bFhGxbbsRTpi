However, it can also recover all types of media files from standard hard disk drives. In our tests, it performed well enough to land in the middle of our comparison of <a href=\"/best-photo-recovery-software\">photo recovery software</a>, despite the poor grade for its installation and its vector image recovery rate.","We performed two types of tests on O&amp;O MediaRecovery: a lost file scenario and a reformatted drive scenario. We ran both tests multiple times on different drive types, then averaged the recovery rates. In each test, we looked at how well the software recovered raster, vector, production and camera raw images. It performed admirably with every file type except vector images, which was also the case for <a href=\"/disk-doctors-photo-recovery-review\">Disk Doctors</a>.","The most important feature of any picture recovery software is its success at recovering JPGs, considering it’s the most common photo format. Not only did O&amp;O MediaRecovery 12 rescue every JPG in every test, it also recouped other raster images at an average of 80 percent – well above the category average of 71 percent.","In the lost file tests, the image recovery tool’s ability to recover production images was admirable – garnering a 59 percent success rate, which is also above average. However, it only returned a subpar 19 percent of camera raw images and 0 percent of vector images – well below the rates of the best photo recovery software we tested.","The one significant flaw in its performance was the number of camera raw images recovered – it isn’t able to recognize even half of the file types. However, the software redeems itself somewhat with its fast scanning speed, which was well above the average in our testing, although the recovery speed is a little slower than our average.","The company has a variety of informational resources for this software on its website, including educational articles, a PDF user manual and a few helpful tutorials. You can also contact the company’s technical support team directly via email or phone.","O&amp;O MediaRecovery 12 is a decent photo recovery program overall, and it’s a strong option if you only need to recover JPGs and other raster images. It also records decent recovery rates for production images and has fast scanning speeds, but it leaves something to be desired with its nonexistent vector recovery and muddy installation process."]},"id":"9311fba4-4c34-46e6-8118-0c0648232059","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67321","url":"/o-o-mediarecovery-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-29T17:54:53Z","datePublished":"2015-10-29T17:54:53Z","name":"O&O MediaRecovery 11","synopsis":"O&O MediaRecovery 12 was designed primarily for recovery photos, music and videos from MP3 players, digital cameras and memory cards.","review":{"rating":73,"verdict":"O&amp;O MediaRecovery 12 posted some excellent recovery rates for all file types except camera raw images, but the installation was frustrating.","pros":["In addition to its high recovery rates for raster images, it recovers production images at an above-average rate."],"cons":["In our tests, the installation took longer than it did for most other programs we reviewed."]},"strapline":"O&O MediaRecovery 12 was designed primarily for recovery photos, music and videos from MP3 players, digital cameras and memory cards.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-23T00:00:00Z","id":"reCJt2WA75bFhGxbbsRTpi","meta":{"title":"O&O MediaRecovery 11 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"O&amp;O MediaRecovery 12 is photo recovery software with decently fast scan and recovery rates for raster images."},"products":[{"slug":"oandamp-o-mediarecovery-11","url":"/product/oandamp-o-mediarecovery-11","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","name":"O&amp;O MediaRecovery 11","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","id":"rCZg7yc5PDzSTrFytp2igk","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/tD3tDHa7F6GUDw93wDEkfY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","mimeType":"","name":"450daf021551081bd1afa30341cf7f59.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/450daf021551081bd1afa30341cf7f59.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","id":"tD3tDHa7F6GUDw93wDEkfY","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tD3tDHa7F6GUDw93wDEkfY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"O&O MediaRecovery 11 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"O&amp;O MediaRecovery 12 is photo recovery software with decently fast scan and recovery rates for raster images."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/tD3tDHa7F6GUDw93wDEkfY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","mimeType":"","name":"450daf021551081bd1afa30341cf7f59.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/450daf021551081bd1afa30341cf7f59.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","id":"tD3tDHa7F6GUDw93wDEkfY","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tD3tDHa7F6GUDw93wDEkfY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"O&O MediaRecovery 11 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"O&amp;O MediaRecovery 12 is photo recovery software with decently fast scan and recovery rates for raster images."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/multimedia/best-photo-recovery-software/o-o-mediarecovery-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"photo-software","url":"/hobbies/photo-software","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","name":"Photo Software","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:34:45Z","id":"VW4y9RdMbVZFvSGe6M26Kb","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
