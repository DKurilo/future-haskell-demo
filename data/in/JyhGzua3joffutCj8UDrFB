You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Maytag Centennial EcoConserve line of high-efficiency <a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">top-load washing machines</a> is tied for the lowest estimated annual electricity usage of any of the models we reviewed. Its impeller-style wash system, standard among the new generation of low-water washers, gets clothes clean with as little water and power as possible.","This unit has 11 wash cycles, including cotton/normal, heavy-duty, delicate, casual/permanent-press and bulky/bedding. It can spin-empty without running a full wash cycle, and it can rinse and spin clothing you have previously hand-washed. It lacks the quick cycle many modern washers have, and there is no allergen cycle. It doesn&#39;t have separate dispensers for bleach and detergent, which in other models saves time and ensures precision delivery. These omissions docked the Maytag unit&#39;s score, but if you can live without them, the cost savings will be money in the bank.","The Centennial EcoConserve also lacks an automatic temperature control, but if you like micromanaging your laundry loads, too much automation might get on your nerves anyway. This unit is all-mechanical, with a variety of manual settings to place you in full control of each wash cycle. That makes it hard to entrust your kids with a load of laundry, but it does mean you are in control of how your clothes are washed instead of trusting sensors to do it for you.","This unit really shines in the energy-efficiency category. It makes it to Tier 3 (the best rating) of the Consortium for Energy Efficiency&#39;s Super Efficient Home Appliances Initiative, and its water usage is minuscule. This also means it easily qualifies for Energy Star certification.","Maytag offers phone and email customer support, as well as live online chat for troubleshooting. The company is one of the few that, in addition to the typical one-year parts-and-labor warranty, also offers a 10-year warranty on the motor, which is the most expensive part to repair or replace."]},"id":"54ce59e9-4c1f-42ab-a71b-369245975974","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"845c38e6-1562-410b-b5e2-bd8af707f287","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This top-load washing machine is great for someone who doesn&#39;t want everything done for him or her.
