With an MSRP of $179.99, it’s one of the higher-priced razors we considered, and it would have ranked higher in our ratings if it were more affordable.","The Philips Norelco 7500 has a 50-minute battery life, which is the equivalent of about 17 three-minute shaves. A full charge takes an hour. Though it doesn’t have a corded-use option, its quick-charge feature provides enough power for a single shave.","This shaver has three shaving heads that flex in five directions to follow the contours of your face and neck. The blades are surrounded by comfort rings that have an anti-friction coating to protect sensitive skin and provide a comfortable dry shave. Because it is waterproof, you can use it both at the sink and in the shower, and it works well with shaving gel and foam.","“This is a very good razor,” said one of our testers, who has been shaving with rotary razors for more than 20 years. “Most especially, it was the most comfortable to use I’ve experienced and left me with a very smooth, finished face.”","The other rotary shavers we tested are the <a href=\"/remington-hyperflex-review\">Remington HyperFlex XR1470</a> and the <a href=\"/remington-hyperflex-verso-5-review\">Remington HyperFlex Verso 5 (XR1410)</a>. While the HyperFlex XR1470 has a traditional shape like the Philips Norelco 7500’s, the HyperFlex Verso 5 has a compact, rounded shape that fits in the palm of your hand. We tested a previous-generation model of the Verso 5 during our review of <a href=\"/best-electric-head-shavers\">electric head shavers</a>.","The Philips Norelco 7500 earned the best performance score of the rotary shaver group, but some users say it’s difficult to maneuver around your upper lip.","As we tested its features and accessories, we were impressed with the Philips Norelco 7500’s user-friendly LED display. It has a battery level indicator, a battery low indicator and a travel lock indicator. It also reminds you when it’s time to clean the razor and replace its shaving heads. This shaver is washable under running water, and it also comes with a cleaning and charging station. The solution in its cleaning cartridge is alcohol-free to be gentle on your skin.","While the best electric razors have pop-up or slide-out trimmers for detailing your sideburns and facial hair, the Philips Norelco 7500 requires you to switch attachments to trim. However, the trimmer works well and isn’t difficult to affix and remove. This shaver comes with a travel case and is warrantied for two years. Philips Norelco provides customer service by phone, email and live chat. "]},"id":"2a46c8c1-8ba3-4418-87fe-d1d3261a0364","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70229","url":"/philips-norelco-7500-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-11T18:34:13Z","datePublished":"2018-09-11T18:34:13Z","name":"Philips Norelco 7500","synopsis":"Among the 10 electric razors we tested, the Philips Norelco 7500 is our favorite rotary shaver.","review":{"rating":86,"verdict":"The Philips Norelco 7500 is our favorite rotary shaver.
