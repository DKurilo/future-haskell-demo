After we screened the field of candidates, it comes down to two that are of sufficient quality to merit attention and recommendation: LandlordMAX and Quicken Rental Property Manager.","<strong>LandlordMAX</strong>","<strong>Pros: </strong>LandlordMAX offers features that are on par with the best online property management software.","<strong>Cons: </strong>LandlordMAX is not a personal financial manager.","<strong>Verdict: </strong>LandlordMAX is an inexpensive, effective way to manage large or small property portfolios.","LandlordMAX has a lot going for it and it works as advertised. This property management software runs on Windows and Mac computers. It costs the same whether you manage one rental unit or thousands. Technical support is free, responsive and professional.","It supports the marketing of vacancies by conveniently providing a place to save the wording of classified ads that have proven to be successful. The accounting mechanisms are robust and enforce the controls necessary to keep you from getting into accounting trouble. There are a stupendous number of available reports that convert data into useful information.","LandlordMAX looks good and behaves well in an elegant, no-nonsense fashion. It is not a personal financial manager. It is written from the ground up as dedicated property management software. The developers consciously resist the temptation toward feature creep in order to maintain ease of use and affordability.","The customer base for this property management software is loyal. If you are just looking for an easy and affordable way to organize and account for properties that you own and manage, LandlordMAX is one of the best in its price category.","<strong>Quicken Rental Property Manager</strong>","<strong>Pros: </strong>This software has uncomplicated accounting features.","<strong>Cons: </strong>If you are a professional property manager, you may find this software underpowered.","<strong>Verdict: </strong>Quicken Rental Property Manager is the perfect option for independent landlords that manage and own very few properties.","Quicken Rental Property Manager is property management software for Windows that consolidates rental, business and personal finances for sole proprietors. It is not designed for professional property management. It finds tax-deductible expenses, tracks expenses and income per property, and displays rents paid.","Since it includes robust personal finance features, the software categorizes personal and business expenses to clearly illustrate where money is going. Furthermore, it shows profit and loss, assists in choosing investments appropriate to specific goals and suggests ways to minimize taxes on investments.","You can see a snapshot of expenses by property and compare profit and loss information from each property under management. Tax preparation is simplified because this property management software categorizes personal and rental expenses and prepares a Schedule E report. Intuit provides technical support via telephone, chat and email. The Quicken Live Community allows you to ask questions and receive answers from the hive mind.","The unique strength of Quicken Rental Property Manager lies in its convenient integration of personal finance tools with features that help you to track tenants, properties and profit and loss per property.","<strong>Property Management Software for Landlords: Two Approaches</strong>","If you like the idea of a product that combines personal financial management with rental property management, then Quicken Rental Property Manager would be best. If you already have a method of managing personal finances and you don t want to combine that method with property management functions, then LandlordMAX would be best. In the end, it all boils down to whichever property solution works best for you."]},"id":"13116000-4b08-4bdc-9d55-56db29cdc863","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8241","url":"/offline-property-management-software-solutions","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-09T22:38:24Z","datePublished":"2014-01-09T22:38:24Z","name":"Offline Property Management Software Solutions","synopsis":"If you’ve identified that your property management software needs are best served with platform-specific software (as opposed to online property management services) you may be ready to make a selecti","review":{},"strapline":"If you’ve identified that your property management software needs are best served with platform-specific software (as opposed to online property management services) you may be ready to make a selecti","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-11T19:33:34Z","id":"T6YGSunPATXRt4LJMc7hzX","meta":{"title":"Offline Property Management Software Solutions","description":"If you&#039;re looking for an offline property management solution, here are a couple options worth considering."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:06:19Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Yab2zVN66JSiEgPQRPBZRF.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:06:18Z","mimeType":"","name":"8241-offline-property-management-software-solutions.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/8241-offline-property-management-software-solutions.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:06:18Z","id":"Yab2zVN66JSiEgPQRPBZRF","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yab2zVN66JSiEgPQRPBZRF.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Offline Property Management Software Solutions","description":"If you&#039;re looking for an offline property management solution, here are a couple options worth considering."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Yab2zVN66JSiEgPQRPBZRF.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:06:18Z","mimeType":"","name":"8241-offline-property-management-software-solutions.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/8241-offline-property-management-software-solutions.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:06:18Z","id":"Yab2zVN66JSiEgPQRPBZRF","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yab2zVN66JSiEgPQRPBZRF.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Offline Property Management Software Solutions","description":"If you&#039;re looking for an offline property management solution, here are a couple options worth considering."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/business/articles/offline-property-management-software-solutions/","label":"","tags":[]}
