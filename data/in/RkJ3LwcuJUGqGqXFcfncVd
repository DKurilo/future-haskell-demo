This <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/buyers_guides/camping-lantern-buyers-guide\">battery-powered lantern</a> runs for a long time, and you can hang it up out of the way if you choose.","This camping lantern takes up a small amount of space, yet puts out a surprising amount of light. Measuring 3.4 x 7.3 inches, the lantern comes with three adjustable settings of high, low and strobe. Using the low-level light, you can expect the lantern to operate for 90 hours, while the high setting lets it run for 40 hours. The handy strobe setting helps you find this lamp even in the dark and operates when the lantern is off by blinking every five seconds. This is a useful feature when you are camping or if the electricity goes off in your home.","Constructed of durable rubber and ABS, this LED camping light houses four bulbs that put out 240 lumens. This is sufficient to light up a room or campsite and, sitting nearby, you have plenty of light to read or to cook a meal. The lantern operates using three D-cell batteries. The lantern does not come with instructions on how to insert the batteries, but inserting them is no problem. You simply unscrew the bottom, and it has a pictogram on which way to place them. After you line the arrows up on the bottom, it screws back on.","The camping light comes with two ways to hang it, a feature that is particularly nice for camping. A large handle-type hanger on the top and smaller hook-shaped hanger on the bottom let you hang the lantern from a tree branch or inside your tent. You can also unscrew the cover on the top and leave it off. To be out of the way when not in use, both hangers fold back.","While the weight of a battery-powered lantern may not matter when you have it for home emergencies, it can matter to a camper or hiker who has to haul equipment. This lantern weighs only 12.8 ounces without the batteries.","The Rayovac SE3DLNA Lantern is a small camping lantern with enough lumens to light a room, two ways to hang it and three settings. In addition to sturdy construction, it has a long runtime and a strobe so you can locate it in the dark."]},"id":"66098129-8100-4891-98a6-0b65f8837b22","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65243","url":"/rayovac-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","datePublished":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","name":"Rayovac SE3DLNA","synopsis":"The Rayovac SE3DLNA Lantern provides light for a campsite or a hike and gives you a light source when the power goes out.
