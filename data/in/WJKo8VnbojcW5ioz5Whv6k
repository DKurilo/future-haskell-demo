Two-motor cyclone technology creates powerful suction for use on various surfaces throughout your home. You can maneuver this lightweight canister vacuum easily around your home while vacuuming. If you prefer an upright design, though, consider the <a href=\"/dyson-dc65-animal-complete-review\">Dyson Animal</a>. ","The UltraActive canister vacuum has a unique design that allows it to swivel 180 degrees without snagging on the cleaning hose or power cord. Large wheels get the canister over door thresholds and rug edges with ease. The UltraActive is a deep vacuum designed to move with you easily around the house to help you clean thoroughly even in small spaces and around tight corners. Most canister vacuums are bulky and awkward due to the hose and canister storing separately. The cord and hose wrap around this canister in a tidy and convenient manner, making it easy to store and transport. The cord also protects your furniture by acting as a bumper.","Two motors work in tandem to draw dirt and other particles out of your carpets. One motor sucks in air while the other motor agitates the carpet. The height-adjustable cleaning head lets you clean various types of carpeting. The UltraActive canister vacuum also cleans your hard flooring with a bare floor brush tool. Tools found on most vacuums are also included to assist in the cleaning process: crevice tool, upholstery tool and dusting brush. The dust cup opens with the touch of a button, so you can release the dust and debris collected directly into the trash. If you suffer from allergies, the washable HEPA filter traps up to 99.97 percent of allergens and irritants from the exhaust air as you vacuum, helping keep your air clean.","Electrolux offers this deep vacuum with a five-year limited warranty. This is one of the longer warrantees offered by a vacuum manufacturer. The company’s website gives you the option to contact representatives by phone, mail or email. There is a convenient listing of service providers that is searchable by zip code if you need your vacuum repaired.","The Electrolux UltraActive DeepClean is a powerful deep-cleaning vacuum. Created specifically to maneuver around obstacles and furniture freely, this canister model lives up to its name. The UltraActive DeepClean has various tools to help clean your home thoroughly, and the long warranty period can help you feel confident in purchasing this Electrolux model."]},"id":"6c5621dc-1f86-4428-bbd5-5abf93c20fa5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59995","url":"/electrolux-ultraactive-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-16T21:09:54Z","datePublished":"2014-07-16T21:09:54Z","name":"Electrolux UltraActive","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-07-16T21:09:54Z","id":"WJKo8VnbojcW5ioz5Whv6k","meta":{"title":"Electrolux UltraActive Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Electrolux UltraActive DeepClean is an easy-to-maneuver canister vacuum cleaner.
