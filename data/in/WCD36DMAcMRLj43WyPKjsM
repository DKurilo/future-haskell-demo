My 15 years of experience evaluating and critically listening to speakers was balanced with the input of a panel of evaluators that range in experience from novice to audiophile. Although my final judgements carried the most weight, we felt it was important to consider the impressions of other listeners before rendering our final judgment. Most of my experience evaluating subwoofers is as a studio sound engineer, so I value accuracy and a well-balanced sound stage above loud and startling low-frequency reproduction, and our recommendations reflect that bias.","Our AV lab is set up to react to reflection and phase much like a normal living room would. Speaker manufacturers do a good job of testing their products in controlled environments, but our recommendations are based on our impressions of the products in a real-world scenario.","To gain more insight about how to best supplement the bass in your place, we talked to a handful of engineers and product specialists from <a href=\"https://www.polkaudio.com/\">Polk Audio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.definitivetechnology.com/\">Definitive Technology</a>. One of the most important tenants I took away from that conversation was the idea of properly placing two subwoofers in the room, rather than buying one powerful sub. Every room has its own unique acoustic characteristics, but the consensus among the talented group of professionals I talked to was, the more speakers you have in the room, the less likely you are to have a portion of your entertainment room that sounds bad. One of the senior vice presidents at Polk Audio told me he has five subwoofers in his entertainment room (wouldn’t that be nice?), and the only reason he doesn’t have six is his AV receiver ran out of outputs.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We were able to do a proper side-by-side comparison of 11 different subwoofers by connecting them all to an RCA switcher that was receiving its signal from the subwoofer output on our favorite AV receiver. That setup allowed us to quickly switch back and forth among all the subwoofers in our comparison and gave our survey panel the chance to hear the subtle differences before making their final evaluation. We realize that the RCA switcher may have slightly degraded the output signal coming from the AV receiver, but that degradation would have been consistent throughout the testing lineup.","Once we had everything wired up to do side-by-side comparisons, we connected an Apple TV and a UHD Blu-ray player to the AV receiver to stream the audio and video content. The subwoofers were accompanied by a pair of floor-standing speakers that are a familiar point of reference for us.","We narrowed our list down to the 10 best subwoofers by surveying a panel of evaluators while watching action scenes from the James Bond movie “Skyfall” and “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” The scene we chose from “Skyfall” has a sustained rumbling effect that lasts around 15 seconds, and it pushed the subwoofers’ amplifiers and speakers to their low-frequency limits. The scene from the Star Wars movie has shorter sound effects that highlight a sub’s ability to accurately re-create a wide range of frequencies and force the amplifier to recover quickly.","We did some music testing by wirelessly streaming content, via a Bluetooth connection between an iPhone and the receiver, to see how the subs reacted to a compressed music format. We also played lossless music files and recorded our impressions of each subwoofer’s ability to recreate high-definition bass content. All the movie and music content was evaluated at 85 dB, which is a typical volume for a commercial theater.","<strong>How Much Does a Home Subwoofer Cost? </strong>","Subwoofers are responsible for a very narrow range of frequencies. If there aren’t rumbling effect sequences on the TV, or low drum and bass parts in a musical selection, the subwoofer isn’t doing much. That makes the subwoofer the best component in a home audio system to save some money on without worrying about without significant loss in fidelity. We focused our comparison on subwoofers that cost less than $600 and found the best products in the $300-400 range. We don’t recommend spending more than $1,000 on a subwoofer unless it’s part of a high-end package and you have a theater room with matching acoustic treatment.","<strong>Important Specs to Consider When Buying a Home Theater Subwoofer</strong><br/> <br/>RMS Power<br/>Peak power ratings are not a good indicator of a subwoofer’s volume capability. Instead, you will want to consult the RMS (root mean square) or continuous power ratings to gauge how loud a subwoofer can get. You can always decrease the volume of a powerful active subwoofer, but trying to push an underpowered subwoofer too hard can result in unwanted distortion. ","Driver Size<br/>Larger speakers move more air, which creates impactful bass notes. However, the sound waves are also larger and require more room to get moving. You should consider a driver size that matches the other speakers in your audio system and the size of your entertainment room. Bigger isn’t always better, especially in tight spaces.","Frequency Response<br/>A subwoofer’s frequency response is the range of tones, from the lowest low to the highest high, it can re-create. Subs are tasked with supplementing the low frequencies that the main left and right speakers can’t handle. A subwoofer that can re-create tones below 30Hz and as high as 200Hz have good dynamic range and should be able to reproduce most of the low-frequency content found in movies and music.","<strong>Wireless Subwoofers for Smart Speakers </strong>","The best home subwoofers we tested work well alongside traditional home audio systems that include AV receivers and full-range speakers. Manufacturers of whole-home smart audio systems – like Sonos, Amazon and Google – are making a strong case for replacing traditional systems with low-cost, internet-connected smart speakers. We tested 12 of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Wireless-Subwoofer-Alexa-SUBG1US1BLK/dp/B01HL8LXQ8\">best smart speakers</a> to see how they stacked up against soundbars and traditional home theater systems. Although smart speakers excel at web browsing, smart home control and other voice-activated conveniences, their audio quality doesn&#39;t match that of traditional home audio systems, especially for low-frequency reproduction. Here are some wireless subwoofers that help to improve the audio performance of popular smart speakers.","<br/><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Sub-Powerful-subwoofer-compatible/dp/B0798KPH5X/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Amazon Echo Sub</a><br/>The Echo Sub is compatible with the first- and <a href=\"/amazon-review\">second-generation Echo</a>, as well as the third-generation Echo Dot, Echo Plus and <a href=\"/amazon-echo-review\">Echo Show</a>. It has a 6-inch downward-firing speaker powered by a 100-watt class-D amplifier. The design is simple and looks like a swollen Echo speaker wrapped in charcoal-colored fabric. Because it’s controlled by the Echo speakers and the Amazon Alexa app, there aren’t any physical controls for volume – only a slot for the power cable and pairing button. The Echo Sub is easy to set up with other speakers using the Alexa app and, if combined with a pair of the newest-generation Echo or Echo Plus smart speakers, creates a 2.1-channel system that rivals entry-level soundbar packages.","<br/><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Wireless-Subwoofer-Alexa-SUBG1US1BLK/dp/B01HL8LXQ8/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Sonos Sub</a><br/>The <a href=\"/sonos-review\">Sonos One</a> is our favorite smart speaker for audio quality and overall design. Similarly priced wireless speakers and soundbars can&#39;t match the midrange and treble clarity of the Sonos Sub, but the bass reproduction is lacking compared with that of a traditional home stereo. Luckily, the Sonos Sub is a capable, and surprisingly powerful, low-end companion for Sonos wireless speakers. The two force-canceling woofers are powered by two dedicated class-D amplifiers, and the futuristic design is available in white or black to match your home decor."]},"id":"47af867e-ca74-4c8c-a2fd-ea801af91b8e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_301","url":"/best-home-subwoofers","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T22:42:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T22:42:00Z","name":"Best Home Subwoofers of 2019","synopsis":"We lab tested 11 subwoofers for clarity, impact and frequency separation by watching action movies and listening to music.
