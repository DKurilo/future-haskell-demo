While digital models can be exciting additions to the realm of <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">children’s microscopes</a>, this particular model is not as easy to use as other options, largely because it lacks a lot of the basic equipment and tools needed for any type of microscope.","The optics on this beginner microscope are good in comparison to other digital models, but they&#39;re not very strong overall. In our testing, small objects appeared blurred and indecipherable, and consequently the photography suffered. While the included camera is an advanced optical feature, it works best when focused on a single simple object, which will limit how useful it is for you or your child.","This microscope kit does not include additional equipment. There are no tweezers, blank slides or slide covers, so you will not have a ready-made way to preserve and view anything you might find and want to observe; you’ll need to buy additional equipment. There is also no collection vial or specimen cutter. Even though this is not the only kit to exclude these items, supplementary equipment can make a model more immediately useful and educational for children.","This unit is cordless and includes a carrying case, making it more easily portable than some other digital models.<br/>The manufacturers do a good job of acquainting you with how to use this digital microscope correctly. You can speak with product representatives via live chat on the Celestron site, and the representatives are friendly and quick to help. There is also an email service that responds within 24 hours and a customer telephone service that operates during business hours. Like all Celestron microscopes, the Portable LCD Digital Microscope has a two-year warranty. "]},"id":"f3feae4e-d58a-45ab-aff0-e3f4a88388bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e28d24ab-f767-4221-9e99-908003f874e1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Celestron model is a basic digital microscope with enough support services to get you up to speed with how to use a digital model.
