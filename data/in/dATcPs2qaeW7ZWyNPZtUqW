The earbuds have rubber fins that are meant to rest in the arches of your ears to keep them stable. However, combined with the silicone tips, there is a lot to squeeze in your ears. The earbuds and stabilizers come in three different sizes, but during our hands-on testing, we struggled to keep the earbuds secure and found ourselves adjusting them quite frequently. They were uncomfortable and a little bothersome to wear for extended periods.","The audio quality for these cordless earbuds is just average. They sound a little sloppy, and the audio isn’t as balanced or strong as other pairs of earbuds. They are can get pretty loud though – we measured 60 decibels while listening to an electronica song. When you do find a seal, the earbuds do a good job of blocking out background noise.","BlueAnt claims these earbuds have six hours of battery life, but we were lucky to get half that during our tests. This is a letdown, especially if you have extended workouts or run long distances. It takes just one hour to recharge the earbuds. We also discovered that the wireless Bluetooth earbuds have the shortest wireless range of any we tested – just 55 feet. If you plan to wear the earbuds around the house, you’re better off keeping your phone right by your side. If you set it down on the counter and walk around your house, you’re likely to lose the connection, especially if you walk into another room.","On the plus side, the earbuds have an easy-to-use remote for skipping songs and adjusting volume. They also have a built-in microphone that sounds clear on both ends during phone calls. These earbuds don’t come with a case, but they are sweat- and water-resistant. They have a one-year warranty, and if you have issues with them, you can reach BlueAnt by telephone, email or live chat."]},"id":"142f759d-59ca-4add-83e6-bb92428e26e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c107b07e-d192-4f64-87ef-011e11743c22","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BlueAnt PUMP MINI earbuds fell short in comparison to other wireless earbuds.
