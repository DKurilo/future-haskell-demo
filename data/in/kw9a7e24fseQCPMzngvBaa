The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on </em><a href=\"/best-prepaid-cell-phones\"><em>Prepaid Cell Phones</em></a><em> here.</em>","T-Mobile is one of the Big Four wireless companies that owns its own network. It is primarily a postpaid service, but it does offer a few <a href=\"/best-prepaid-cell-phones\">prepaid options</a>. Though T-Mobile is a notable enough company that it made its way onto our prepaid phone services lineup, it doesn’t offer great value, especially compared to <a href=\"/metropcs-review\">MetroPCS</a>, which is owned and operated by T-Mobile but ranks much higher in our evaluations.","T-Mobile’s ONE unlimited data plan is the best plan on its postpaid service. The company’s prepaid plan of the same name includes fewer perks for the same price, factoring in the postpaid plan’s autopay discount. The only advantage of the prepaid plan is that it doesn’t require a credit check. This is a similar trend across Big Four carriers that also offer prepaid.  If you are an extremely heavy data user, however, T-Mobile’s ONE plan has a higher data cap than most other options at 50GB per cycle.","T-Mobile’s prepaid options are mostly for individual users. Most of its plans do not allow for multiple lines on a single plan, so you need separate accounts for each line of a family plan. This means there are no discounts for family plans, so multiple lines get expensive. Unlike the postpaid branch, T-Mobile’s prepaid offers a few not-unlimited plans with either 4 or 6GBs of data. These are better options than the ONE prepaid plan, as they allow for high-speed hotspot tethering and have reasonable data cost value. They’re good options if you want T-Mobile’s network, but not an unlimited plan. The least expensive prepaid plan costs $45 per month and gives you 4GBs, hotspot tethering and unlimited music streaming.","Overall, T-Mobile’s prepaid division is decent, but pales in comparison with the better value for your money T-Mobile subsidiary, MetroPCS. Still, its limited-data plans could be a good option if you don’t need multiple lines and want to stick with T-Mobile."]},"id":"b6b1e956-a0e3-48dc-9edc-0894fcc213cf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3118","url":"/t-mobile-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-05-19T15:27:10Z","datePublished":"2009-05-19T15:27:10Z","name":"T-Mobile Prepaid Cell Phones","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
