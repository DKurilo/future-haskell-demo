Among other things, we wanted a range of models from name brand manufacturers that have reputations for producing quality merchandise, offer good customer service and give you reasonably long warranties if anything should go wrong.","We wanted to give you a wide enough assortment so you could find what you need, for both gardens big and small. We also looked for models that can handle different tasks, sought out tillers than come fully assembled as well as those you assemble yourself and tried to find a mix of sizes since that will affect your storage needs as well as what you need in terms of performance.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We sought out devices that could undertake heavy work, such as breaking through soil that had never been tilled before along with extremely dense and heavily compacted soil. We also looked for machines that could break up regular soil that was relatively loosely packed, but still needed to be turned and broken up to prepare the dirt for planting. In addition, we looked for machines that could help you aerate soil, work in fertilizer and other additives and generally loosen the dirt so that seeds or bedding plants can take root easily.","We read manufacturer websites, watched user videos to see how people handle these devices and looked at user manuals including the fine print in warranties. We also read user reviews carefully to see how people who have bought tillers feel about the models they have, any problems they encountered and what they liked and disliked about their machine.","We also read blogs and various articles, compared competing machines to see which had the most useful features and chose a mix of gas-powered and electric tillers to provide a wide selection for you. We also choose models that reflect an expansive price range so you can find something that will work for your pocketbook as well as your property.","<strong>How Much Do Tillers Cost?</strong>","A tiller can run you as much as $800 or as little as less than $100. A lot depends on the size of the space you plan on tilling, how heavy your soil is, and if you want a gas or an electric tiller. Heavy-duty tillers tend to be more expensive, costing between $350 and $800, but if you have hard soil or a large space, they may be a better investment. If you have a small garden, you can find a tiller for less than $100.","<strong>Are Tillers and Cultivators the Same Thing?</strong>","Cultivators and tillers are designed for different tasks. Cultivators are designed for mixing up loose soil and a tiller breaks up solid ground. Tillers can dig much deeper into the ground than a cultivator. You generally use a tiller at the beginning and end of a growing season. At the beginning of a growing season it will break up hard-packed dirt so it’s the right consistency for plants to take root in. At the end of the planting season it will till all the leftover growth into the soil so it can decompose naturally.","Cultivators, while they look similar to some tillers, are generally smaller. They are good for mixing up the soil, especially if you’re planting in a field with a lot of grass and weeds. You can use a cultivator to stir in compost and fertilizer and blend the soil before planting. Cultivators help you keep weeds in check so they don’t overtake your garden. You can regularly break up weeds between rows of plants in your garden with a cultivator, saving your back and the extra work of getting down on your hands and knees.","<strong>Tiller Maintenance</strong>","The work tillers do is dirty, so it’s no wonder they get strewn with rocks and debris. To maintain your tiller, it’s important to thoroughly hose off the tines and carefully inspect them to make sure all the debris is removed after each use.","You’ll know it’s time to sharpen the tines when they stop slicing through the dirt efficiently. Before you sharpen them, thoroughly clean the tines by scrubbing them with mild detergent. Grime and debris can scratch the tines if they aren’t properly cleaned before they’re sharpened. Once the tines are clean, use a mill file to sharpen each one individually. If the tiller is small, you can simply turn it over and sharpen the tines attached to the machine. For bigger tillers, you’ll want to remove the tines and fasten them into a vice while you sharpen them.","Be sure to change the oil and air filter at least once a year, preferably at the beginning of the gardening season, so you know you are starting out the season with clean fuel. Consult the owner’s manual for the appropriate grade and amount of oil. Also, either use up all the gas in the tank at the end of each season or add fuel stabilizer to whatever gas remains in the tank. Store the tiller indoors, in a garage or shed, to keep it away from the elements.","<strong>What to Look For in a Tiller<em><br/></em></strong>","Rear vs. Front Tines<br/>A garden tiller’s key component is its set of tines, which are the metal prongs that work and loosen the soil. Their length and position determines how the machine operates and how far you can cut into the soil. In some cases, short tines are sufficient, but for other jobs, you need tines that dig deep. Here are some differences between tillers with rear tines and those with front tines:","<strong>Rear tines:</strong>"]},"id":"4b77fd12-eb9d-436a-ad3e-c3cde577b384","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Machines with their tines in the back typically do a better job of breaking up soil that has never been tilled and cutting deeply into dense, thickly packed dirt.","They have large, treaded wheels and adjustable depth regulators, so you can till to different depths.","Some rear tines are counter-rotating. Because they move counter-clockwise, they give you even more control to handle the toughest dirt. These tillers create the least amount of vibration when cutting through clay and rocky dirt, and they are great for creating new garden beds where they didn’t exist before."],"type":"ul"},"id":"54ab6001-6184-43a1-8615-fc2bb272d080","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Front tines:</strong>"]},"id":"382015dd-2f00-4098-ac58-f078a34b199e","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["These tines sit in front of the wheels and rotate forward.

For many people, the convenience of an electric-powered tiller is obvious: They are simple to start, they will run indefinitely since your electricity is always available and they are handy for smaller-sized gardens. However, the drawback is you will need an extension cord if your garden is farther away from the house and without a power source, you’ll be out of luck. Gas-powered tillers are potent machines that can muscle through tough soil. However, with many of these models, you must mix oil and gas to fuel the machine, and occasionally stop to refuel, which is a chore not everyone likes. Gas powered machines tend to be heavier and harder to push, which could be a problem for some consumers.","As with all tools, electric are generally less expensive than gas-powered. There are a number of economically-priced gas tillers in our lineup, such as the <a href=\"/home/outdoor/best-tillers/earthquake-review\">Earthquake MC43 Mini Cultivator</a>. If you prefer electric to gas you will find good, affordable models, like the <a href=\"/earthwise-review\">Earthwise TC70001</a>, but you won’t get the same power gas tillers provide. ","Functions<br/>Some tillers are great at breaking in soil that has never been tilled before, which calls for a robust machine and strong tines. Others are better at loosening dirt that has been tilled before so you can plant your garden. Different tillers may work better than others at helping you weed and aerate your garden, as well as work in compost and fertilizers.
