DVDs have only been playing our movies for about a decade, and they are also on the decline. However, there is still a wealth of VHS tapes and DVDs in our lives, but fewer and fewer means with which to play them.","The Panasonic DVD Recorder DMR-EZ 48VK is one of the best choices available for keeping your old media library from falling into obsolescence. This DVD recorder has an unequaled array of features that make it uniquely capable, and it offers superb recording and playback of both DVDs and VHS tapes, thus earning it our TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award for our <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD/VCR combo player</a> review."]},"id":"f49f19d7-acf6-4589-90a2-96419cc21754","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"DVD Features"},"id":"d1499f7e-c122-4af7-8967-ca66f1359f9b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/WVMM3K2xtPzbqHazSksu4j.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The first question many people have when purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player is, &#34;Will it work with my HDTV?&#34; The short answer to this question is yes.

Upconversion also eliminates much of the visual artifact and motion blur that occurs when a player stretches a standard-definition image to fit an HD screen.","In addition to providing an excellent picture, the Panasonic DVD Recorder also offers great sound quality. This comes in the form of Dolby Digital sound. Hollywood studios and other professional videographers have used this six-channel sound technology for decades. The inclusion of Dolby Digital sound in the Panasonic DVD Recorder means that you will enjoy the rich sound that the movie or video was shot in.","The Panasonic DVD Recorder also plays and records to most rewriteable disc media, including DVD-R/+R and DVD-RW/+RW, but it can take advantage of the more versatile but less common DVD-RAM format. This format allows the Panasonic unit to offer some limited DVR capabilities called Chasing Playback, which allows you to play an already-recorded portion of a DVD while the remaining content continues to be recorded on another section of the disc."]},"id":"16797539-4080-4c11-810c-969bfd3e57db","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"VHS Features"},"id":"8350474c-6beb-4764-a620-0ae7b2af742b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/5auzQS6wBRR3pJQCMGzFEN.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"For most users, the most critical feature on a DVD/VCR combo is the ability to transfer VHS content to DVD.

The best quality – the XP setting – records an hour of content on a single-layer DVD. The SP mode will record two hours to the same-sized DVD and, frankly, there is no practical difference in the recording quality between the two settings. The LP setting records four hours of content to a single disc, and eight hours of recording are available in EP mode. However, be forewarned that quality suffers drastically if you use the latter modes. The recording lengths for each setting double with a dual-layer disc.","The most useful feature of all may be the device&#39;s Auto Record feature that allows the player to optimize the recording speed based on the length of the program on the VHS tape. The only downside to the process is that you must enter a predetermined start and stop time. For example, if you record a two-hour-and-fifteen-minute movie, the recorder must be aware of that length. The unit will then make use of the entire DVD to record that specified content length, essentially allowing for non-standard record speeds while optimizing quality.","VHS tapes record at three different speeds, and therefore three quality settings, including SP, EP and VP, with SP being the best. As with DVDs, the Auto Record mode is available on the VHS player and we strongly recommend that you use it to make the best recordings possible with the available tape length. This feature is a nice addition, but most users will never use this function since no company has manufactured blank VHS tapes in years."]},"id":"24ff9d30-05e6-44b7-a1fc-08cfe7c41342","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"02626be3-166b-469d-8a66-e854d972dff5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Xk8PnQsoMWC3LYRMBsbPre.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The connectivity array on the back panel of the Panasonic DVD Recorder has every connection option we looked for when we evaluated DVD/VCR combo units.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/48518-panasonic-dmr-ez48vk4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk8PnQsoMWC3LYRMBsbPre.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Xk8PnQsoMWC3LYRMBsbPre","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk8PnQsoMWC3LYRMBsbPre.jpg","alt":""},"id":"a02dfc03-0acc-4fb9-a354-21438f1b4394","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The unit contains both front- and back-panel S-Video and component video connections for connecting other home-entertainment devices.
