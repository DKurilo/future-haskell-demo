Orbit is so compact you may be surprised at how powerful this <a href=\"/best-die-cutting-machines\">die cutter</a> is. This cutter packs a real punch with its 1,000 grams of cutting force. It&#39;s is a fully computerized die-cutting machine that offers easy to use tools. You can cut all manner of materials ranging from sturdy leather to delicate tissue paper. You can also engrave, emboss and draw on a wide range of materials, including such things vinyl, cardstock, fabric, Mylar, craft plastic and chipboard.","The Zing Orbit’s manufacturer, Klic-N-Kut, made sure this newest version includes a number of quite helpful and updated features. These include the ability to cut wirelessly with Bluetooth, a wider range of speed settings, a third pinch wheel to further steady materials, and the ability to cut vinyl scraps shorter than 4 inches to cut down on waste.","Zing Orbit comes with a feature set that allows you to complete a range of craft projects. This upgraded die-cutting machine uses the popular Sure Cuts A Lot software, which you must buy separately. This application is similar to Make The Cut, which is the software previously used by KNK on its older model, the KNK Zing. However, Sure Cuts A Lot offers many tools that are easier to use such as the alignment tools. In addition, you can make your own patterns with Sure Cuts A Lot.","With the Zing Orbit, you are no longer constrained by a stationary design for the pinch feed assembly. Instead, you can adjust the pinch wheels individually to the locations you want and you can use one lever to lift or lower all three wheels at once. This comes with an optional flatbed, which is easily removable, that can hold whatever you are working on at the moment. This also is equipped with multi-colored LED lighting.","The Zing Orbit cuts designs from hard copies as well as your own designs, using a laser inside the machine that aligns with the corner of your sheet. Then, the Orbit automatically scans for registration marks to know where it needs to cut. From there, the nimble blade can maneuver around tight angles and sweeping curves. We recommend this feature for vintage magazines and maps to add a nostalgic pop to your crafts. This die-cut machine can also draw, pierce, engrave and emboss several types of materials.","This die-cutting machine is pretty compact considering everything it does, but it is rather heavy to carry when you want to attend a scrapbooking party. It weighs 12.16 pounds and lacks a handle for easy toting. Its size does have payoffs though. While it&#39;s a bit hard to move, the Zing Orbit has an excellent maximum cutting width, up to 15 inches wide. It also comes in a 24-inch model.","Connecting your Zing Orbit to a Wi-Fi Network is a straightforward, step-by-step process. You can also make use of a USB connection if you’d prefer. If you are used to the old cartridge system, or traditional styles, you likely will face a learning curve with this machine.","This die cutter is built with quality materials and has a lot of cutting power, which means you can use really thick materials, like balsa wood and cork, without any trouble. It can even handle some types of cake frosting and virtually all types of fabric. It can cut through just about anything you could need in the crafting world – rhinestone rubber, stiffened felt, chipboard and much more. Die cutters that provide this much pressure are useful for making custom stamps and stencils.","Good customer service is vital, and Klic-N-Kut does a fine job of that. The manufacturer&#39;s website is organized and informative. You can contact the company by email, and we also got fast and friendly responses on the phone. In addition, the Zing community is active on blogs and social media.","The Zing Orbit is a compact and very powerful tool for making your crafting ideas a reality. It cuts almost any type of material, and it goes well beyond cutting with its engraving, embossing and other capabilities.","<em>Contributing Reviewer: Linda Thomson</em>"]},"id":"0365776f-cc70-4720-9ce4-871ae163442e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Portability &amp; Convenience"},"id":"ebe8ef4d-2210-4308-8111-cc38eae1716b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" "," "]},"id":"886bebf8-06e0-4759-9bd8-3c7b1adf1ced","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Materials"},"id":"a5fa61f2-e2e6-4c07-8c18-ddf6496fb984","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" "," "]},"id":"f7fbe948-f419-4d6a-87c6-b04891d6dcc4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69485","url":"/knk-zing-orbit-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-06-29T16:12:41Z","datePublished":"2017-06-29T16:12:41Z","name":"KNK Zing Orbit","synopsis":"The KNK Zing Orbit is so compact you may be surprised at how powerful this die cutter is.
