The sound machine fits snug in the owl’s belly and has a night light that projects stars on a wall or ceiling in your nursery. The image projector fades between colors to keep your infant’s attention on a calming and consistent object. The lights and sounds run simultaneously or separate of each other and turn off automatically after 30 minutes.","There are ten lullabies and two nature sound profiles. The heartbeat profile and bird song profiles sound natural and realistic, but unfortunately, the maximum volume wasn’t loud enough to properly mask external noises in our sound masking test. The <a href=\"/mybaby-soundspa-portable-review\">MyBaby Sound Spa Portable</a> has a white noise sound profile and better volume range if you need a portable baby sound machine for masking loud external noises.","This sound machine runs on batteries, which adds to its portability. The three AAA batteries are included in the retail packaging and stow away safely in a battery compartment on the back panel of the removeable sound machine. The compartment is secured by a small screw, which makes it impossible for your toddler to get the batteries out and put in their mouth. Bubzi Co also includes a small screwdriver with the Soothing Sleep Owl to help change batteries while you’re on the go. You can’t power the sound machine with an AC adapter, so pack extra batteries for a long vacation.","The Bubzi Co stuffed animal is plush and cuddly. It has a Velcro strap on the back to attach it to a crib or car seat. The stuffed animal is hand-wash only and remember to remove the sound machine first. This is the most expensive baby sound machine we tested but having the combination of a sound machine and light projector along with a cuddly stuffed animal adds to its value. If your infant no longer requires a sound machine to fall asleep, you can remove the sound module and reinforce nap time with the stuffed animal.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Bubzi Co Soothing Sleep Owl combines soothing visuals and high-quality sound profiles in a portable and cuddly stuffed animal. The sound machine has a great selection of lullabies and realistic-sounding nature profiles. It didn’t perform well in our sound masking tests, but still makes a great travel companion."]},"id":"7bf70e4b-7fe8-48a7-95e7-b01254fd95d7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70224","url":"/bubzi-co-soothing-sleep-owl-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-11T12:08:40Z","datePublished":"2018-09-11T12:08:40Z","name":"Bubzi Co Soothing Sleep Owl","synopsis":"The Bubzi Co Soothing Sleep Owl is a stuffed animal with a removeable baby sound machine.","review":{"rating":65,"verdict":"The Bubzi Co Soothing Sleep Owl is a great travel companion with a wide range of calming sound profiles.","pros":["This sound machine doubles as a cuddly stuffed animal."],"cons":["It&#8217;s expensive."]},"strapline":"The Bubzi Co Soothing Sleep Owl is a stuffed animal with a removeable baby sound machine.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-09-21T00:00:00Z","id":"6vGjPmwUV2FTrrbgsbWSjL","meta":{"title":"Bubzi Co Soothing Sleep Owl Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
