Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","DNA Fit is the best fitness <a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA kit</a> for fitness-based genetic information, like diet and exercise recommendations, because it tests the most genes (45), gets you your results in 10 business days and allows you to upload your DNA tests from other popular companies like <a href=\"/23andme-review\">23andMe</a> and <a href=\"/ancestry-com-review\">Ancestry.com</a> to get your health results without the hassle of swabbing or spitting. This DNA kit doesn’t test for diseases, so if you’re looking for a test that identifies genetic markers associated with specific conditions, we recommend the Color DNA test, which can identify your risk for hereditary cancers.","DNA Fit allows you to choose from three different health and fitness DNA tests: fitness and diet, sports, and wellbeing. The fitness and diet test focuses on genetic advice related to general fitness and is marketed towards everyday people who want to live healthier lives. The sports-specific test caters to high-performance athletes (DNA Fit has several Olympians in its test database), and it helps you learn about diet sensitivities and muscle and aerobic potential, which can help you attain peak form as an athlete. The wellbeing test is marketed to people who are looking for personalized general health tips and includes diet recommendations.","When you receive your kit, you use the included cheek swab and return the swab to the company. DNA Fit advertises that you’ll receive your results in 10 business days, almost a week faster than <a href=\"/fitnessgenes-review\">FitnessGenes</a>, the other fitness-based DNA company we researched. To see your results, you log on to the DNA Fit website and access your results through a user portal.","If you’ve taken a DNA test from Ancestry.com or 23andMe, you can ask those companies for your DNA results and send them along to DNA Fit, without having to go through the swabbing process or pay for the packaging and shipping. There is still a cost associated with getting fitness-related results, but it is much cheaper to upload your DNA results this way if you have already had testing done.","This company lists several scientists and researchers on its website who are involved with the DNA testing. You can click on the scientist’s names and read about their credentials, which is reassuring when it comes to dealing with a growing scientific field like DNA testing.","This company is based in the United Kingdom, so if you have questions it can be hard to reach representatives by telephone. However, there is an email form on the company’s website which you can use to get help. There is also a blog which is frequently updated with fitness and training tips and ideas.","If you’re looking for a way to get more out of your workouts or to identify diet restrictions to help your overall fitness, DNA Fit is a great test. Though the company is based in the United Kingdom, the fast turnaround of 10 business days and the ability to process your DNA results from other companies makes this our top pick for health and fitness DNA testing kits."]},"id":"f69bde25-73a5-4635-b312-b0e1c8ecb5ac","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69630","url":"/dna-fit-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-09-26T20:20:47Z","datePublished":"2017-09-26T20:20:47Z","name":"DNA Fit","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":27,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","id":"52snChfQgczKNQTTsitkna","meta":{"title":"DNA Fit (Fitness and Diet DNA Test) Review - How It Works, What I Found","description":"DNA Fit has a fast turnaround (10 business days) and the ability to process your DNA results from other companies.
