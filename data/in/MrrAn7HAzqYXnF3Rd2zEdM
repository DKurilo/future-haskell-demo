You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Infrared thermometers allow home chefs an easy way to measure the temperature of difficult items, such as the temperature of a pan on medium-high, the water temperature of poaching liquids, and the surface temperature of a grill. The Nubee NUB8580 <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">remote thermometer</a> provides an instant temperature readout without needing to touch the heated surface or liquid.","Like most infrared thermometers, the Nubee NUB8580 works in a point-and-shot manner. You simply point the thermometer at the desired surface, pull the trigger and the infrared beam will measure the temperature. A major feature that sets the Nubee NUB8580 apart is the dual laser sight. A majority of infrared thermometers will include a single laser sight to help guide the unseen infrared beam. The dual sights on the Nubee NUB8580 are convenient for helping to get a very accurate target area for precise readings. This is truly an instant read meat thermometer with less than a one-second response time for temperatures.","The LCD screen on the Nubee NUB8580 displays the temperature readout with large numbers. The screen includes a MAX setting that will store the highest temperature readout during a reading and display this information below the main reading. This allows you to continue probing the surface looking for hot zones without having to focus on remembering how the numbers changed. There is also a hold feature that will save the last temperature reading, making it easy for you to monitor the progress of the surface you are testing.","The Nubee NUB8580 has an accurate temperature range between -58 to 1076 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 to 580 degrees Celsius. The thermometer has an accuracy of plus or minus two degrees. The display can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius. This is great for helping chefs to follow recipes without requiring difficult mathematical conversions.","Infrared cooking thermometers are surface thermometers. This means that they are somewhat lacking for testing a meats doneness because they can&#39;t take an inner meat temperature reading like a probe thermometer. Still, for what they can accomplish in the kitchen, they are a very helpful thermometer to have in the house.","A padded carrying case with belt loop is included with the temperature gun. This helps to keep your hands free and provides a storage location for the Nubee NUB8580 as you are going about your cooking. To save battery life, the thermometer includes an auto shutoff after 15 seconds of idleness. There is also a battery indicator informing you of the temperature gun&#39;s remaining battery charge. The Nubee NUB8580 takes a standard 9V battery, and one is included in the packaging.","With the Nubee NUB8580 grill, you have access to oven and liquid temperatures at the press of a button. The wide temperature range is great for any home kitchen, and the dual laser helps you target a precise area for testing."]},"id":"64772e4e-1471-48af-8e8a-571a0f65cc15","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58143","url":"/nubee-temperature-gun-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T20:45:43Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T20:45:43Z","name":"Nubee Temperature Gun NUB8580","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-11-13T20:45:43Z","id":"MrrAn7HAzqYXnF3Rd2zEdM","meta":{"title":"Nubee Temperature Gun NUB8580 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Nubee NUB8580 is an infrared cooking thermometer with dual laser and optical sights for superior accuracy.
