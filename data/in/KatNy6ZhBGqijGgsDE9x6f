It does not have any weatherproofing options and it runs on batteries, which may be an inconvenience. However, it does have multiple sound options for you to choose from.","This camera doorbell has a 0.3MP CMOS image processor and a 60-degree viewing angle. You can view visitors on the 3.5-inch monitor anywhere in your house you choose to install or set it. When the doorbell is pressed, the system will record for up to one minute. It also automatically takes a photo any time the doorbell is pressed and saves it to your microSD card. You can choose whether or not to activate the video mode.","You can see visitors easily in low light with the device’s four built-in infrared LED lights around the lens. These lights automatically detect low light and will adjust accordingly. Any footage you want to keep can be saved to a microSD card. The video doorbell is compatible with cards up to 32GB. You can export footage at any time to a computer.","The product is not advertised by the manufacturer as having any sort of weatherproofing, therefore this product is probably best used in mild climates or anywhere with overhead coverage.  It may not withstand the elements or extreme weather as well as other models specifically designed with weatherproofing in mind.","Installation is easy, as the video doorbell comes with the parts needed to set it up yourself, including metal brackets, screws and a user manual. One potential downside of this product is that it runs on four AA batteries rather than being hardwired into your home’s electrical grid or plugged via an adapter. This means the video doorbell will stop working if the batteries die, though the manufacturer says one set of batteries will last for up to 1,500 uses.","You can choose a new video doorbell tone from over 30 options. The device also gives you the option to toggle the doorbell sound on or off, which adds convenience if you have a sleeping baby or want some peace and quiet. However, unlike some other video doorbell models, there is no intercom function to let you talk to visitors before you open your door to them.","The digitharbor 3.5&#34; video doorbell has the capacity to capture either video or photo, and has a night-vision mode so photos will be clear in any lighting. It&#39;s important to note that the device runs on batteries and is not hardwired to your home’s electrical system, and it lacks an intercom function. However, you can choose your doorbell ringtone and even switch it off, letting you have control of your home&#39;s security and peace."]},"id":"af0dcff3-e8f6-4dde-a350-169c1a60a173","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64456","url":"/digitharbor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-27T21:44:53Z","datePublished":"2015-04-27T21:44:53Z","name":"digitharbor 3.5\"","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
