You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Oreck Touch bagless <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaner</a> effectively removes dirt and is easy to maneuver in tight spaces. Oreck&#39;s airtight sealed system keeps air from escaping, so even with its small 7.4-amp motor, it still has more suction than cleaners with large motors and poorly sealed systems. However, you can&#39;t adjust the suction power to clean finer materials such as curtains.","The Touch moves pollen and dust through four stages of filtration: a pre-filter, a cyclone filter, a closed filter and a HEPA filter. As a result, allergens cannot escape the vacuum&#39;s internal components. That means if you have allergies, this machine will prevent microscopic particles from leaking out of the cleaner into the air of your home.","The upright vacuum is equipped with a roller brush that agitates dirt and hair out of your carpet so the suction motor can lift embedded debris. There are small grooves carved into the roller itself that allow you to fit scissors underneath, to cut away any tangled hair that wraps around the brush. The roller brush also has a power button located at the top of the handle where you can reach it with your thumb. That way you can shut it off if you have hardwood floors you don&#39;t want to get scratched.","Weighing 7.7 pounds, it is light and easy to carry. The cord is a sufficient 30 feet long, so you can cover a lot of ground without having to stop to switch outlets. In testing, we found that the swivel steering feature makes the vacuum easy to maneuver around and under furniture. The handle lies down flat to the ground so that you can reach under the bed.","The Oreck Touch has all of the accessories you need to clean. The tools come attached to the body of the vacuum cleaner, so you do not have to search for them or bend over to reach them. The included accessories are a wand, upholstery tool, dusting brush and crevice tool.","A lever located in the back of the canister opens it from the bottom so the dirt drops directly into your garbage can. This helps minimize the dust cloud you get when you have to dump a container upside down. However, animal hair tends to stick in the canister, so you will still have to remove it yourself.","Oreck has service location finders on its website, as well as email addresses and phone numbers. We were pleased with how easy it is to make contact with representatives by phone. If you need technical help, you can contact a local dealer in your area with knowledgeable in-house technicians. You could also check out Oreck&#39;s FAQs page online. It answers many questions you might have. The vacuum has a five-year warranty, which is very long – just not compared to Oreck&#39;s lifetime warranty."]},"id":"41205803-a1e8-48d9-a220-d59756be4f82","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d21ed635-b1fb-4058-ac2b-90ee3bb86905","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Oreck Touch is one of the most maneuverable upright vacuum cleaners we tested.
