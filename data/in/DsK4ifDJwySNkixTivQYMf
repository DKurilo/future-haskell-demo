The majority of photo only printers only have the capability of creating 4 x 6 inch photos and some can even do a little more but non compare to the B8850. This printer is designed for those looking to make large portrait pictures for hanging on the wall or for professional photographers who want to make their own prints. Aside from large scale prints of up to 13 x 44 inches this printer also delivers outstanding 4 x 6 and 5 x 7 pictures for sharing with family and friends alike. The HP Photosmart Pro B8850 is a simplified version of the B9810 so those who want to print high quality photos can without paying an arm and a leg."]},"id":"14609c0d-f6ce-49c3-ad25-b7baba5bf0db","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output"},"id":"23c30595-8066-443b-b3f2-af0fa72fa95c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Photo printers are designed to have a much higher resolution than inkjets or printers that are used mainly for documents. The HP Photosmart Pro B8850 can print any sized paper in black or color at 4800 x 1200 dpi from a computer and the image looks great. Print 4 x 6 photos as fast as 10 seconds per photo or increase the size up to 13 x 44 inches for banners, welcome home signs and other such projects. The idea behind having a printer that can do such large photo prints is that you donâ€™t have to pay the middle man to do it for you. If professional quality is what you are looking for than purchasing the specific paper from HP is the way to go. The HP Photosmart Pro B8850 is designed for those looking to make a photo business or those who are really into creating large portrait photos for family and friends.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"485a8717-34b5-43e0-a73a-2e7e53aee2b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b9ea5f88-35eb-4e39-af4e-2f722e2114b4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At $549.99, the HP Photosmart Pro B8850 is well worth the money put into it.
