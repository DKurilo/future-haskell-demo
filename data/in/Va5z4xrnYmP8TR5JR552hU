The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The GE Steam GFWS2605FRR front-load washer includes 12 wash cycles and six options, and even includes some specialty cycles. You also have a choice of five different wash temperatures and five soil levels to choose from for each load of laundry.","Aside from having a large washtub of 4.5 cubic feet, which allows you to fit more laundry into one load, this front-loading washing machine has the Energy Star label.  It includes other energy-saving options such as two cold washing temperatures and an eWash option.","Included in the 12 wash cycles are three that really impressed us: a sanitize cycle, an allergen cycle and a power clean cycle. The sanitize cycle is NSF certified and uses an internal water heater to remove 99.9 percent of bacteria that can be on your clothes. The allergen cycle can help remove common household allergens, while the power clean cycle includes extra soak time to help clean heavily soiled laundry.","This front-loading washer also has a steam-assist option, which you can add to some of the wash cycles to help remove stains. This option uses steam to get deep into the fabric to remove stains without damaging the fabric.","You don’t have to worry about this washer being loud and shaking the floor because it boasts GE’s Adaptive Vibration Control. This feature helps the washer remain quiet and stable by using heavy-duty springs, vibration dampeners and a balance ring to offset a load of laundry if it were to go out of balance.","We were happy to see that this GE front-load washer is available in different colors. Aside from the Ruby Red color, it is available in Metallic Carbon and a standard white color. This washer sits at 39-3/5 inches high, 28 inches wide and is 34-2/5 inches deep. Additionally, you can get the optional pedestal drawer so it will stand up higher; however, it will cost you extra.","The warranty coverage that GE offers is unimpressive. You only get a one-year warranty with this front-load washing machine. The warranty covers all parts and labor necessary for one year. The washer tub and motor, which often come with additional coverage, are also only covered for one year.","GE can be contacted for any help and support you need by phone and email. For email support, however, you must first fill out an online contact form on the GE website; they will then contact you via email. GE provides the user manual, FAQs, and tutorials on its website, all of which are very helpful."]},"id":"f1c4567a-0025-4614-bc69-c185d4d1cee6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b7a05c3c-32b0-43c2-bf95-abd878d5ab48","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE Steam GFWS2605FRR front-load washing machine includes a nice amount of wash cycles and options that make it a sufficient washer for just about any kind of laundry you may need to do.
