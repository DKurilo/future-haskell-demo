You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Krups XP1020 <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a> has a long list of features that will help you brew a rich cup of espresso. By making your own espresso at home, you will save money that you would spend at the local coffee shop. By making it yourself, you can also choose how strong you want your brew to be and how much sweetener to add to your cappuccino.","This espresso machine is powered by steam and 750 watts of power. Because it is a little less powerful than other espresso machines we have reviewed, it will take a bit longer to heat up so you can make your java. However, the difference in time is not great. You will still be able to enjoy your cappuccino at home in less time that it would take to drive down to the local coffee bar.","When using this espresso maker, you have the option to make between one and four cups at a time. This is a nice feature to have if you are brewing espresso for friends or family. It is also nice if you just cannot stop at one cup of cappuccino yourself. Because you can brew more than one cup at a time, you will also be spending less money than you would if you were to purchase more than one cappuccino at a coffee house.","When choosing an espresso machine that will offer convenience as well as great tasting lattes, you should consider one that has a removable filter, such as the Krups XP1020. A removable filter will not only help you keep your machine clean by allowing you access to small spaces, but it will also allow you the best access when tamping down espresso grounds. In order to get the best cup of cappuccino, you must tamp the coffee grounds and spread them evenly in the filter. This will keep grounds from slipping through the sides of the filter and into your latte.","A great feature of this espresso machine is that it comes with a dishwasher safe carafe. While many people may not be concerned about having a dishwasher-safe carafe, it&#39;s a handy feature that allows you to quickly clean up after making a rich latte.","If you need to contact the customer service team at Krups, you can do it by filling out an email contact form on its website. However, if you would like to actually speak to someone on the telephone, you can also contact its customer service department by telephone Monday through Friday. We were disappointed that the company does not provide a list of FAQs; however, it does offer product manuals for your espresso machine that you can download from its website."]},"id":"f91e68c8-b1aa-439f-914a-27bde7223f8d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97906f51-2d79-44cb-86c1-81b7dd7acd18","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Krups XP1020</strong> espresso maker is a compact unit that will fit nicely on most any countertop.
