It was only a matter of time before wireless computer speakers<strong> </strong>came around to supplement the functionality of these devices. Now a burgeoning market, there are a great number of wireless computer speakers to choose from. Portable yet high quality, these indoor wireless computer speaker systems are perfect for students, office presentations, working in non-wired locations, mom s with toddlers and even house parties. With a little creativity, the uses of wireless speakers are truly endless.","The impressive features among our top-rated wireless computer speakers are the wizard behind the curtain   the reason present-day wireless computer speakers are as powerful and reliable as they are. We reviewed their main technical features    the components responsible for the speakers  sound. We examined the frequency response, transmitter power, total output power, sound pressure range, and wireless range of each wireless speaker system were noted. We ve also included must-read <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">articles on wireless computer speakers</a>, as well as comprehensive reviews to help you find the system that fits your needs.","Be sure to check out our detailed product reviews, including those for our three top-rated speaker systems: the <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-wireless-computer-speakers/gigaworks-series-ii-review/\">GigaWorks T20 Series II</a>, <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-wireless-computer-speakers/rocketfish-digital-wireless-speakers-review/\">Rocketfish Digital Wireless Speakers</a> and <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-wireless-computer-speakers/aw877-indoor-wireless-speakers-review/\">AW877 Indoor Wireless Speakers</a>.","<strong>Wireless Computer Speakers: What to Look For</strong>","The wireless computer speakers we reviewed are ideal for indoor use at home, school, work and even vacations, and they bring full stereo sound to most average-sized rooms. Mom s concerned with dangerous wires, people with limited mobility, trade-show vendors, families on road trips, and students on the go are just a few of the folks for whom these speakers are great. Top Ten Reviews used the following criteria to evaluate wireless computer speakers to decide which products to include in our review:","<strong>Features</strong><br/>The technical features of wireless computer speakers are the first thing to look for when you are considering purchasing one of the top-notch speaker systems we reviewed. Wireless speakers have components that can make or break their audio quality. These are frequency response, transmitter power, total output power, sound pressure level, and wireless range   which refers to how far you can take the speakers from the audio source and have them still function properly.","<strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br/>We included a miscellaneous category to cover additional features and bonuses you may find with each wireless computer speaker system. We considered a variety of extra features, including: auto tune (a speaker&#39;s ability to find the best radio frequency on which to operate without any further adjustments from you), whether the speaker system comes with a remote control and separate volume controls, whether it uses a USB or non-USB transmitter, whether it has wall-mounting capabilities, and how the system is powered whether it uses an AC adapter, batteries or both.","<strong>Sound Quality</strong><br/>Thanks to advanced technology, wireless computer speakers sound amazing and can transmit audio as clear as if wires were present. And since most wireless speakers will auto tune to the best signal and work instantaneously, all you need to do is physically plug them in and press the power button and you ll have streaming audio in moments. From enhanced bass using BasFXflex technology to impressive balanced treble, wireless computer speakers should sound as great as any wired computer speaker system.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Product documentation and customer service are essential help-and- support features for any wireless computer speaker system that should be provided by the speaker manufacturer. Other help and support features that we included in our review are FAQs, user forums, and whether the product includes a warranty.","The<strong> </strong>wireless computer speakers in our review are guaranteed to transform your world. By providing full-bodied sound that you can bring with you anywhere you go, you ll wonder how you lived without these impressive speakers."]},"id":"c82c7cc8-f79c-47e1-9ac5-abf1cfcf44e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a8924a87-3f20-491f-aefc-cb11e4ee47f3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RNOHDU/?&tag=ttr_wireless_computer_speakers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|762[art|NA[pid|51961[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">GigaWorks T20W</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O7MR5A/?&tag=ttr_wireless_computer_speakers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|762[art|NA[pid|51960[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Control</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00408GUNY/?&tag=ttr_wireless_computer_speakers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|762[art|NA[pid|51966[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Creative T12</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EPYJSQ/?&tag=ttr_wireless_computer_speakers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|762[art|NA[pid|51969[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">IPEVO</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7858869c-afe6-43fc-a0bd-52612fc6e26b","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_762","url":"/best-wireless-computer-speakers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeff-ropelato","url":"/author/jeff-ropelato","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeff Ropelato","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"ZFTp4R9MHcSeWJm9weTSoE","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-01-13T21:28:37Z","datePublished":"2011-09-16T19:17:25Z","name":"Wireless Computer Speakers Review","synopsis":"While laptops, MP3 players and smart phones are great, they can sometimes lack in good audio quality.
