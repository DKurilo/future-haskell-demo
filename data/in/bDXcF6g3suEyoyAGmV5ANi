You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Levenhuk 2L NG <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">kids microscope</a> is great for children and beginners. Kids will love the fact that you can order this in several different colors, including green, orange, pink, purple and blue. However, this children&#39;s microscope does not have to rely on its good looks. The all-metal construction allows this kids microscope to last a long time. The optics are also made of high quality materials.","In addition to slides, this kids microscope kit allows you to view three-dimensional objects with lighting from above the stage. With the three objective  lenses – 4x, 10x and 40x – you will be able to get exactly the view you want of objects from the world around you or prepared slides. This will work well as a microscope for students because it can withstand tough conditions and still perform well.","The controls all operate smoothly, which makes the Levenhuk 2L NG seem more like a serious scientific instrument rather than a toy. This microscope can go cordless using four AA batteries, or you can plug it into a power outlet with the included AC cable. That means your child can develop their own bedroom laboratory or take this unit out into the field for explorations.","However, if you are looking for an all-inclusive kit, this is not it. The microscope itself is high quality and you can always buy  slides and other equipment later, but there are no additional accessories with this microscope. The Levenhuk offers quality views but you will have to find what you want to see on your own. If you plant to use this microscope as a tool for students, and it stays mostly in a classroom without much necessity for moving it, then the lack of accessories might not be a problem. Otherwise, this model feels a little sparse compared to others that include extras like a carrying case.","Levenhuk customer service  is quite good, and the warranty on this microscope is impressive at three years. We heard back from the company quickly every time we emailed or called."]},"id":"660acc2f-2947-46a8-a1f9-0265db71bf1d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6f02e7b5-7a68-4a3e-9a44-af101198dbe6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You don&#39;t get many extras, but the microscope itself is high quality  and is sure to encourage an interest in science.
