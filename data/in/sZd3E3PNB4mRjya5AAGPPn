The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews about </em><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\"><em>Laser Printers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Brother HL-3170CDW Color Laser Printer has many options, including automatic duplexing and the ability to network multiple users to the printer. It can print on media as small as 3 x 5 index cards or as large as 8.5 x 14 ledgers. It can handle different media weight too; although the heavier the paper, the more bend there will be once it comes out of the printer. This printer also has a great resolution of 2,400 dots per inch (dpi) for black-and-white as well as color printing.","The best feature of the Brother HL-3170CDW Color Laser Printer is its ability to wirelessly connect with not only your PC but also with your iPad. You don&#39;t have to transfer images and documents from your tablet to print them. With a push of a button, your accounting graphs or business cards can print straight from just about any mobile electronic device. This printer is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems.","The Brother HL laser printer comes with an installed 128MB of memory. Unfortunately, this is all the memory that the machine can handle, so you won&#39;t be able to expand it. The memory it comes with is enough to hold a few printing projects in its queue and support a decent print time. The HL-3170CDW can print 23 pages per minute both in color and in black and white.","This color laser printer has a decent duty cycle of 30,000 pages per month. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of power to run – 660 watts while printing. The toner cartridges also need to be changed often. The Brother HL color printer uses a lot of power, so your electric bill may increase a bit if you are using this printer a lot.","This laser printer is pretty big and heavy, weighing almost 40 pounds. It can only support the two paper trays that come with the printer, including a multipurpose tray. This means it holds a maximum of 250 sheets of paper.","Brother includes a standard one-year warranty with the 3170CDW. It also has some of the most personable support staff we have worked with. Whether you have a quick question or a long list of troubleshooting needs, Brother&#39;s service staff is ready to help you in every way possible. You can connect with support staff through email, telephone and online chat."]},"id":"e3136e35-8d69-4e45-897e-1482b3569c6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29fc29fe-20dd-4aba-9d44-6a3864fa9238","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Brother HL-3170CDW is not the most cost-effective laser printer out there, it produces quality images.
