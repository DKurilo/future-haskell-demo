Chef’sChoice International Gourmet Egg Cooker 810 makes as many as seven eggs at one time, letting you cook them to different levels. This set also includes a three-egg poaching tray so you can easily make poached eggs.","Our testing produced some mixed results. On one hand, this electric <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a> made wonderful hard-cooked eggs with excellent taste and texture for both the yolks and the whites. However, the machine leaked so much water that it pooled on the kitchen counter and eventually ran down onto the floor. A second test patch produced the same results. If you can overlook the water or keep a kitchen towel on hand, this machine works well indeed, but the leaking would be a deal-breaker for many consumers. If you like the egg-shaped dome of this model, but don&#39;t want a wet countertop, take a look at the <a href=\"/cuisinart-review\">Cuisinart CEC-10</a>.","The Chef&#39;s Choice offers controls that are different from most other egg cookers. For one thing, you get a sliding knob to determine cooking time on the front of the oval-domed machine, which has an exterior of brushed stainless steel. The controls allow you to modify the cooking time to lower than five minutes or exceeding 20 minutes, depending on the texture you&#39;re trying to achieve. You simply add enough water to reach the water level line that is clearly marked in the reservoir, and start cooking.","This is quite different from most other popular egg cookers since your choice of cooking time, rather than the amount of water you&#39;re using, determines the doneness of each egg. You can choose soft-, medium- or hard-boiled, and you can use a separate three-egg poaching tray to make oval-shaped poached eggs.","When this 350-watt electric egg cooker is on, the switch illuminates so you can see the kitchen appliance is heated – and steam rises to cook your eggs. An electronic timer emits an alert when your food is ready to remove from the cooker. There is a handle on one side of the base and another on the lid to help you lift the lid. It&#39;s best to tilt the lid away from you to allow the trapped steam to escape before fully lifting the lid.","This electric egg cooker measures 7.8 inches wide and 7.1 inches high, so it is compact enough to store easily. Clean-up is easy because the plastic parts can be washed in the dishwasher, and you simply need to wipe the stainless steel outside with a damp cloth to get it clean."]},"id":"c4f38e25-5cff-4a40-ba39-5f33a99e31ea","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63186","url":"/chefs-choice-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T19:11:21Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T19:11:21Z","name":"Chef's Choice 810","synopsis":"The Chef’sChoice International Gourmet Egg Cooker 810 makes as many as seven eggs at one time, letting you cook them to different levels.","review":{"rating":78,"verdict":"The Chef&#8217;sChoice International Gourmet Egg Cooker 810 is wet and messy, but the machine is easy to use, clean and store.","pros":["This egg cooker makes great hard-boiled eggs."],"cons":["The machine leaked considerably during testing."]},"strapline":"The Chef’sChoice International Gourmet Egg Cooker 810 makes as many as seven eggs at one time, letting you cook them to different levels.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","id":"33vFTXDkAxzj3UcnSmRwzK","meta":{"title":"Chef's Choice Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Chef&#8217;sChoice International Gourmet Egg Cooker 810 makes soft-, medium- and hard-boiled eggs as well as poached eggs.
