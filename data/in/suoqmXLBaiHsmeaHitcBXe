The phone would be perfect for a conference call in a boardroom or as a desk phone for several employees in an office setting.

This is particularly useful if you don’t like using the speakerphone.","Not only can you pair a headset, but you can also connect up to two cellphones using AT&amp;T&#39;s Connect to Cell technology. There is a USB port on the side of the base you can use to charge your cell phone. After you pair your cell phone, you can make and take phone calls and get text messages forwarded to the cordless handsets. This combination is very useful, as you can charge your smartphone but still have access to its calling features through the CLP99483’s handsets.","Both the handsets and the base have large, illuminated buttons, so dialing is comfortable and easy. Plus the buttons have big bold numbers that are easy to read, making it one of the best home phones for those with impaired vision.","The CLP99483 doesn&#39;t have an alarm like some other cordless phones do, but it does have an intercom so you can page your family members or coworkers.
