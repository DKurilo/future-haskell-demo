After looking at hundreds of cartridges on multiple sites, we calculated the average price you’d pay for ink per page, and InkGrabber had one of the lowest averages; you could save on average about one cent per page. The prices for its OEM cartridges were the lowest we saw.","However, the company doesn’t offer enough inventory or support features to compete with one-stop shops such as <a href=\"/4inkjets-review\">4inkjets</a> or <a href=\"/123inkjets-review\">123inkjets</a>. While the number of brands the service carries is an impressive 135 (the next-highest number is about 80), InkGrabber had only a little more than half of the popular products we searched for to evaluate a company’s inventory. And while there are a few items for 3D printers available, there aren’t nearly enough printing supplies to make it a true resource for bulk purchases.","Most sites allow you to select your preferred shipping option and its cost from a drop-down menu. InkGrabber’s expedited shipping options weren’t available directly on the site. You can contact representatives over the phone to get overnight or two-day shipping pricing and options, which is a bit of a hassle.","Another area where other sites outperform InkGrabber is in return policies. InkGrabber gives you a cash refund if you return an unopened or defective cartridge within 90 days. Otherwise, you can exchange a cartridge for store credit. We prefer stores that offer refunds. The best discount ink cartridge stores allow you a year or two to return cartridges, which makes it easier to buy in bulk.","InkGrabber is refreshingly upfront about the number of pages its ink cartridges print on average. On many sites, remanufactured cartridges’ print capacity is listed in an awkward or hard-to-find place. Prominent placement on the product page greatly simplifies comparison-shopping.","The site doesn’t have a live chat or a social media presence. While shoppers are encouraged to phone or email with any questions, we found that there was little detail in the support areas of the site."]},"id":"bb6638b3-1c55-41fd-ba6b-f100e091c206","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e2e0462-6cea-4063-aee9-74f8b43280ce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["InkGrabber is missing some useful features for buying discount ink cartridges with ease.
