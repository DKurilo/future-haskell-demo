You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Veho 5MP Slide &amp; Negative Scanner is a basic <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">slide to digital image converter</a> and a great option for anyone on a budget. It works with a couple of film formats and allows you to edit your images directly on your computer screen. With basic accessories included, it’s a decent option for those who don’t have a lot to convert.","Compared to the best slide to digital converters, this unit has limited film and slide format compatibility, working only with 35 mm slides and film, as well as 100 film. Many other units can process 110 and 126 slides, Super 8 film and even physical printed photos. If you only have 35 mm media to digitize, however, none of this is an issue.","The slide converter has a resolution output of 5 megapixels, which is the lowest of any device in our lineup. However, this can still boost the quality of your classic images, if even slightly when converting slides to digital. This unit also includes a cleaning brush accessory, which helps you remove any dust or sediment stuck on your slides or film.","The device has relatively few buttons and doesn’t have a display screen or navigation menu like the others do. While that would seem to simplify things, we felt it didn’t in our testing. Unlike every other scanner in our lineup, this one has to be connected to a computer in order to fully function. Without the traditional built-in screen, you have no way to preview or edit your images unless you’re connected. This means that if you don’t have access to a computer, you’re out of luck; additionally, you have to take time to install the software and then learn how it works, which is inconvenient.","The Veho ships with a one-year manufacturer warranty. Veho’s customer service team is available via email, should you ever have a question or problem. There are also a few informational resources available on the company’s website, which are handy as well. The device itself measures 3 x 3.6 x 3.9 inches and weighs just over 1 pound."]},"id":"ec3d3910-e4ee-4c03-b347-8fe2cb4f4946","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2930e1f7-90be-4214-b3b4-255421edb9ea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite the limited format compatibility of the Veho 5MP Slide &amp; Negative Scanner, as well as its reliance on a computer, it’s fine for simple use.
