When looking for a beginner <a href=\"/best-remote-control-airplanes\">remote control airplane</a> that is both exciting and easy to fly, consider the Air Hogs Jet Set. This plane gives you the excitement of an RC jet along with the sensibility of a beginner plane. It&#39;s not as slow as a high-wing trainer is, but you can learn to fly on it regardless. The Air Hogs Jet Set has an internal lithium polymer (LiPo) battery that you can recharge and use frequently. A single charge will give you about ten minutes of flight time. It is best to fly your RC plane outside and in an open area such as a field or park. You&#39;ll also want to fly on mild days with little to no wind, as the wind will reduce your ability to control the Air Hogs Jet Set, as well as cut down on your flight time. The Air Hogs Jet Set is recommended for ages eight and older and makes a great beginner plane.","Air Hogs designed the Jet Set to look like military UAVs. It even has the iconic v-shaped tail seen on the Predator drone. The fuselage and wings are made of a durable foam that is specifically designed to endure several hard crash landings. The Air Hogs Jet Set has two propellers on the backside of the wings, and even comes with an extra set to keep you going if you lose the originals. You can crash a few times and still keep going, which is befitting of a beginner RC plane.","The remote control – known to hobbyists as a transmitter – has an attached port for charging the battery on the Air Hogs Jet Set. You need six AA batteries to operate the transmitter, which then connects directly to the plane. You can charge the Air Hogs Jet Set eight to ten times before you have to change the batteries in the transmitter. This transmitter controls two channels – throttle and rudder. You can control the up and down movement of the plane by increasing or decreasing the throttle. You can control the right and left movement of the plane, as well."]},"id":"a890657e-0056-4eb9-8a8f-d5ee0e4f3089","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5c9002ed-af40-4455-82f0-9e70e7c30db8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want the excitement of an RC jet without the risk and expense, consider the Air Hogs Jet Set.
