Their devices are tough competitors and offer a large selection of features on each device that there is something for everyone to enjoy. The Panasonic HDC-SD60K is an <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HDV camcorder</a>  that has a vast selection of features, but we wanted more than what this Panasonic device offered to us."]},"id":"f50df4db-5505-433f-9712-5a41a81ce03a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"75a3e0b8-e29f-4232-b25b-2af0a01e5f0e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The zoom capabilities on the Panasonic HDC-SD60K were one of the standout features available. The device features a 25x optical zoom and a 25x intelligent zoom. We were impressed with both of the zoom functions and noticed that we didn’t lose any image quality using a stronger zoom rate. The 35.7mm lens available on this camera is a wide angle lens which also enhances the zoom capabilities and lets you capture closer video of your subjects with higher quality.","Also, several advanced features are designed into this HDV camcorder to enhance its video quality. An optical image stabilizer is available to eliminate shaky handshakes or jerky movements. This feature also enhancing the zooming capabilities, because no matter how close you zoom into an object the subject won’t appear to be rocking or moving back and forth."]},"id":"acd11c7b-e55b-4d10-a197-eba41e41c4e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"f951f322-bcec-4b60-b1f4-b44b14996e1d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This HDV camcorder features 16GB of internal memory.

This HDV camcorder allows you to register up to six faces and names in the camcorder’s memory. The device then recognizes the registered faces and automatically changes several settings to perfect the shot with the faces of those six individuals. A bonus feature that we found fun, but not necessary, is the inclusion of those six names displayed on the LCD screen while shooting.","The LCD screen is small on this HDV camcorder but it was the average size we saw on other similar products. The Panasonic HDC-SD60K does feature a switch on the back of the HDV camcorder to switch between three modes: still, video and playback. We liked having an actual control and not dealing with the hassle of a touchscreen.  We did like that there were also several buttons aside from the power button and a large selection of ports and connectors are located on this device such as the proprietary video and mini-HDMI out, USB and an SDVX card slot.","The Panasonic HDC-SD60K is a small device. Weighing only 9 ounces, it is lightweight, which adds to its portability. Also, the device is compact and thin which makes it easy to carry around with you in a backpack, purse or even a large pocket. If portability is a feature you desire, this is a product that is worthy of your consideration."]},"id":"f9b3ce37-b51a-46f0-894c-d0c31d4a60e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"86fe9d53-c1b4-47c2-bb5e-4af15a2d7fa0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We liked the Panasonic HDC-SD60K  and it offers users a nice, compact size, buttons and controls and gorgeous zoom capabilities.
