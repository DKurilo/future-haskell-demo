You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Robo Scooter 3000 by Wolf-Garten is a <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">robot lawn mower</a> capable of mowing your lawn and providing the grass with nutrients at the same time. It does this by mulching the grass as it cuts, dropping the cuttings back onto the ground. This allows your grass to receive extra nutrients over time without damaging the roots and lower surfaces of the lawn.","This robot lawn mower mows your lawn in predefined zones, so it won&#39;t miss certain areas. You do, however, have to set up guide wires for the Robo Scooter 3000 to follow, which entails extra work on your part before you can use the mower. It does mow right up next to the guide wires, though, without leaving gaps.","The Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 300 robot lawn mower mows up to 0.75 acres, with a cutting width of 22 inches. Because of this limit, it’s not suitable for large lawns.","The robot lawn mower weighs 41 pounds and measures 28 x 25 x 12.5 inches. Its body is constructed of plastic, so damage is possible if it runs over thick obstructions like rocks or sticks. As it automatically mows by following the guide wires you lay out, you should ensure there are no obstructions or debris in the lawn before mowing since it is unable to detect these things.","With its built-in rain sensor, the Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 300 robot lawn mower won&#39;t be ruined by water. When it detects rain, it automatically stops mowing and follows the guide wires back to the docking station, placing itself into charging mode. Sudden rain showers may come too fast for the mower, though, so checking the weather forecast ahead of time before using the Robo Scooter 3000 is essential.","The Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 3000 robot lawn mower comes with the charging unit and guidance cable, as well as a pair of quick-change metal blades. It also has a remote control so that you can sit back and manually operate the mower without having to get out in the hot sun. It can run for up to 90 minutes on a single charge before returning to the docking station, and it completely recharges in 90 to 120 minutes.","This model is a good choice if you’re looking for a simple way to mow your lawn. The automatic mowing and remote features make it easy to keep your lawn looking great."]},"id":"7c21a6dd-53df-4a80-aea8-ca0c9ec6e4e2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63710","url":"/wolf-garten-robo-scooter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:11:29Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:11:29Z","name":"Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 3000","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:11:29Z","id":"4ZaJMcoAstiG9uZtF6rxWL","meta":{"title":"Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 3000 Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robo Scooter 3000 by Wolf-Garten mows up to 0.75 acres, with a cutting width of 22 inches, and includes a built-in rain sensor."},"products":[{"slug":"wolf-garten-robo-scooter-3000","url":"/product/wolf-garten-robo-scooter-3000","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","name":"Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 3000","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","id":"xHU8RD3idCPcxLy4NBNRY6","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/AvmJfRyBRjjm9Q2f9DkBnF.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"63682-wolf-garten-robo-scooter-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63682-wolf-garten-robo-scooter-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","id":"AvmJfRyBRjjm9Q2f9DkBnF","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AvmJfRyBRjjm9Q2f9DkBnF.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 3000 Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robo Scooter 3000 by Wolf-Garten mows up to 0.75 acres, with a cutting width of 22 inches, and includes a built-in rain sensor."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/AvmJfRyBRjjm9Q2f9DkBnF.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"63682-wolf-garten-robo-scooter-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63682-wolf-garten-robo-scooter-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","id":"AvmJfRyBRjjm9Q2f9DkBnF","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AvmJfRyBRjjm9Q2f9DkBnF.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Wolf-Garten Robo Scooter 3000 Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robo Scooter 3000 by Wolf-Garten mows up to 0.75 acres, with a cutting width of 22 inches, and includes a built-in rain sensor."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-robot-lawn-mowers/wolf-garten-robo-scooter-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:19Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
