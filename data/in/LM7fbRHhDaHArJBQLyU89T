You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The iDeer Blu-ray Player is compatible with many digital video types and computer operating systems. While it takes a considerable amount of CPU capacity to run, it has audio and picture adjustment options and other small luxuries.","Whether you prefer to use Windows computers or Macs, this digital video player will work for you, although the former is limited to Windows 8. It can play DVDs and Blu-ray discs just as easily as it can a wide variety of digital video files.","This <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-player-software\">Blu-ray player software</a> had no trouble playing a variety of video types in our tests, and it looks great. However, it isn&#39;t the most intuitive software to use. Additionally, it takes quite a bit of CPU usage in order to run, averaging about 44 percent with no other programs running. Despite this, it loads digital videos extremely quickly and takes just seconds to load and start playing a disc.","It has no upscaling capacity, either for HD or 3D, unlike some other players on our lineup. However, with its various audio and picture adjustment options, it makes playing videos on your computer a theatrical experience. It has lossless audio playback, even with headphones, as well as DTS and Dolby support, for the best audio possible.","This player helps you become a great movie critic, as it allows you to connect with your favorite social media sites, such as Twitter, to share what movie you are currently watching as well as your comments on it. It has auto-resume playback, which allows you to pick up watching wherever you left off. This is convenient if you are busy and can&#39;t watch a full movie in one sitting. You can also tweak the picture and audio settings for the best viewing experience and toggle subtitles as needed.","You can contact iDeer&#39;s technical support via email, should you have questions or concerns about the software. It also offers a knowledgebase on its website, where you can read and ask questions about the movie player. However, unlike some other manufacturers, it does not offer tutorials or a forum where you can interact with other users."]},"id":"1f864454-2d3c-4cdc-9013-f5d63b0d1375","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e0512f45-4f38-429e-81c4-8aba8f824bd8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iDeer Blu-ray Player lets you enjoy your entire media library, whether it&#39;s digital or tangible.
