The fact that it&#39;s wireless is a big selling point in this technological age where wireless capabilities seem paramount. It has an impressive range of 30 feet. The downside to such a peripheral being wireless is that it requires battery power. The TopDrive Wireless uses 4 AA batteries, and it is a thirsty wheel. Batteries do not last long at all. This device works directly with PC, PS3 and PS2.","Having a stick shift automatically gives points to the wheel&#39;s design, but without a clutch, it feels like a last minute add-on to the TopDrive Wireless Wheel. The rubberized grip on the wheel helps with the comfort. The plastic casing does not feel sturdy and makes us worry about its durability. It does have a decent floor grip for the pedals, and at over 7 pounds, it will stay in place and not push every time you hit the gas.","There are issues with installation when using it on a PC, which can make it complicated to use and take away the excitement using it for the first time out of the box. Without cables, this wheel and pedal set become very easy to store. The accuracy of the controls varies with every game. While some games work perfectly with it, the steering sensitivity can feel a bit loose with some PC games.","TopDrive Wireless rates highly in terms of customization. You can adjust the pressure and steering sensitivity, which gives appropriate feedback for the roads you&#39;re racing on in the game. The buttons are all reprogrammable, and the pedals adjust to a comfortable level for your foot.","Receiving help and support is difficult. Logic3 is a German company and getting a response on this side of the Atlantic is a process. They do include a user guide to program buttons and FAQs on their website, but getting personalized help by phone support can be daunting."]},"id":"52e51959-da20-42b8-b1f5-001f2e55ea46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f05debfe-0b8d-4b58-9a60-46b2d308a9e4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We were optimistic about Logic3&#39;s TopDrive Wireless racing wheel, particularly because of the wireless aspect.
