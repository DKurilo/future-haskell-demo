You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this service&#39;s information.</em>","Whether you are sending large Word documents or graphics, images and videos, SeeFile has the power to upload and send your large files quickly and easily. This <a href=\"/money/small-business\">online file sharing site</a> is a cloud-based service that specializes in file transfer and management. SeeFile lets you send files of any size, provides excellent tracking features and allows you to access files from any mobile device. Granted, there is plenty of room for improvement on this file sharing site, particularly when it comes to the security of your files. Overall, however, we found that SeeFile provides most of the features and tools you need to share your files with little difficulty.","SeeFile offers three unique pricing plans. Each of these plans provides a different amount of online storage space. For example, the smallest plan available from this file sharing site offers 10GB of storage, whereas the largest plan offers 100GB. One advantage to using this service is that you can store your files on SeeFile’s cloud servers for an unlimited amount of time. There are no automatic expiration dates attached to using this file sharing service.","SeeFile does not place any restrictions on uploading or sharing files. You can download and send a specific file as many times as you desire. You can also send files of any size. Many online file sharing sites place a 2GB limit on files, but this service gives you the freedom to send any size of file you need to, and as mentioned previously, you can send all file types.","SeeFile makes it easy to customize your files using your own corporate identity. Simply save a 100 x 100 pixel image in a preset folder when you&#39;re logged in to your account, and the image will become the standard logo that users see in the upper left corner of every SeeFile page on your site. The company also offers a login page that you can host on your own site.","Even though this online file sharing service has much to offer, we are disappointed by the lack of an MS Outlook plugin. SeeFile does not offer the tools to integrate with this email system, which would make the file sharing process much smoother.","Keeping track of your files using SeeFile is a breeze. This service makes it easy to ensure that the file you send are the correct ones by providing thumbnail images of each file and message previews before the file is sent. You can also receive notifications regarding specific activity that takes place with your files.","When logging in to SeeFile, you must use your password and username. Since the desktop service utilizes your own server, you have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your data is safe because it is stored on your network. There isn’t much more when it comes to security options, which we see as the most significant drawback to the service.","For assistance with using SeeFile, you can use the phone number for customer support that is posted on the company&#39;s site. An online form for email support is also offered. Additionally, FAQs are available as part of the company&#39;s online support. They are located in the Support section, which you can link to from the bottom of the homepage. If you’re looking for an overview of the service, the company provides an online demo and a quick video tour as well."]},"id":"10513189-9a07-45e0-8d8a-160dc0cc62e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"afa439c3-c2a7-4e4d-bb88-7e41420b8583","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SeeFile may not be the most advanced application, and it lacks security options and a few key features, but it still has the capability to send large files with ease.
