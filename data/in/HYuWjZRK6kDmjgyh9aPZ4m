The differences among this manufacturer&#39;s overhead DVD player series models are few, but the most obvious is screen size. You can get a Power Acoustik roof-mounted DVD player for your car in 9 to 14.3 inches. The larger the monitor, the higher the resolution, which results in a clearer, crisper picture.","A few models in Power Acoustik&#39;s flip down DVD player series include swiveling monitors, so you can view the monitor from various angles. You can get a unit that includes an FM stereo transmitter, which allows you to watch a movie and listen to the audio through your car&#39;s speakers. Alternatively, infrared transmitters in all of Power Acoustik&#39;s mobile entertainment systems let you use wireless headphones to pick up the audio from the movie you&#39;re watching. This method lets you listen privately from the back seat while the driver and front-seat passenger aren&#39;t disturbed by loud explosions in an action movie and can continue listening to their own music.","All of the flip down DVD players by Power Acoustik come in three different colors – beige, black and gray – so you can choose the console that best matches your vehicle&#39;s interior. They all come with dome lights, so you don&#39;t have to worry about replacing your car&#39;s interior lights when you install one of these in-car DVD players.","The extra A/V inputs and outputs in all of the Power Acoustik overhead DVD players allow you to connect other media devices. This lets you watch movies in other formats, or from a smartphone or tablet with an internet connection.","You get a limited one-year warranty with the purchase of a Power Acoustik flip down DVD player. If you get a model that you think may be defective, you can return it to the manufacturer for repair or replacement.","Power Acoustik offers a variety of overhead DVD players in its series, but for the most part, the models have the same features. You can get one with a larger monitor that swivels for a clearer picture and better viewing angles, or you can save money by purchasing a smaller unit. Whichever model you choose, a Power Acoustik flip down DVD player can turn your minivan or SUV into an entertainment center on wheels."]},"id":"6315c3b2-c393-4e84-86e9-aad8121774cb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50600","url":"/power-acoustik-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-31T14:26:38Z","datePublished":"2010-08-31T14:26:38Z","name":"Power Acoustik","synopsis":"Power Acoustik's flip down DVD players have many common features, including widescreen monitors, A/V input and output, remote controls, and wireless infrared transmitters.
