You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Maintaining any computer&#39;s health over the course of its life can be time-consuming and stressful. Driver Checker can help you keep your computer running in its optimal state by scanning its drivers and updating them as needed. This <a href=\"/best-driver-update-software\">driver update software</a> is easy to use and has several customization options, giving you more control over your computer.","Driver Checker&#39;s scan of our test computer found 59 of 277 outdated drivers for a success rate that&#39;s barely over 21 percent. It was the worst performing software in our tests. By comparison, <a href=\"/smart-driver-updater-review\">Smart Driver Updater</a> had the best performance, but even it only found 44 percent of the drivers. The second ranked app, <a href=\"/driver-reviver-review\">Driver Reviver</a>, only succeeded at finding 39 percent of the drivers. In other words, Driver Checker&#39;s poor performance is only indicative of an industry of poor performance. That said, Driver Checker provides good information about version details and the source, ensuring that you get trustworthy updates.","This driver software is fairly intuitive. Buttons and tabs are clearly labeled, making the program easy to navigate. Though it has a slightly outdated feel, Driver Checker is decently easy to use with its one-click scan and automatic updates. The software lets you schedule scans, and it can also backup and restore your drivers. It doesn&#39;t download any bloatware or malware; it simply does what it advertises. However, the software is only compatible with Windows 7 and XP, so if you use a more recent version of Windows, it may not work optimally for you, or at all.","It&#39;s especially easy to confirm that the software uses original equipment manufacturer sources (OEMs). Not many of the products on our lineup could guarantee this, despite it being such an important feature for security, which is one reason Driver Checker is one of the best driver updaters. Its exclusion option lets you choose which drivers to update, and it also has an uninstall option, which most of these programs lack, letting you easily delete old drivers you no longer use.","If you have any questions or issues with the software, you can contact the manufacturer&#39;s technical support team via email. However, it doesn&#39;t offer service via phone. You can also explore the myriad of informational resources about the product on the company&#39;s website."]},"id":"5e8463cb-dec5-45df-ab65-359dfddb0bcd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"12173028-939b-41db-91ab-8c8a71f151bd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Driver Checker did not detect most of the drivers on our test unit, but unlike most other options, it only updates with OEM drivers, and it gives you exclusion and uninstall options – a rare and powerful combination.
