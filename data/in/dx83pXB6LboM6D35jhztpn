Better yet, have you even signed the back of your credit card? If not, you may be using an unsigned credit card, and a cashier may one day refuse to accept your card or ask you to sign the back first.","Look at the back of your credit cards and find the signature line to see if you&#39;ve signed it. Now think back to the last time you used your credit card; did the cashier ask to see your card after you signed for your purchase? Perhaps you&#39;ve never encountered a cashier who asked to see the signature on the back of your credit card, but if your credit card is not signed, you&#39;ll likely have to confirm your identity by showing your driver s license.  Every time you get a new card, you should sign it immediately, even though that credit card signature doesn t usually mean much because it isn t used for its intended purpose.","The <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> terminals that are commonly used in department stores are used on a daily basis as hundreds and hundreds of people make purchases and swipe their credit cards or debit cards. As you swipe your card to confirm payment, you are asked to sign within the little box, which then reprints your signature onto your receipt in many cases. This brings up the importance of the credit card signature. Every time you use a credit or debit card, the credit card signature on the receipt should match the signature on the back of the card, and the cashier should compare these two signatures for every card transaction. More times than not, however, cashiers fail to do this.","Your signature on the back of your credit card or debit card should match the signature that you sign when you make a purchase. To follow proper procedure, the cashier should ask to see the back of your card to confirm that the signature you wrote matches the name and signature that is written on the card every time you use it to make a purchase. Since we can t rely on humans to always remember such things, you might think that credit card processing terminals would somehow be able to match a signature on a card to each customer&#39;s signature, but this isn t the case either.","A credit card signature is unique to an individual, just like a fingerprint. The same signature that you write on that pin pad should match the signature on your credit or debit card. Since the credit card processing terminal lacks the ability to confirm and match the two signatures, the cashier should always check the signatures, although again, most cashiers rarely if ever do. Anyone can write your name, but it will never look exactly the same as it does when you write it, which is why a credit card signature is unique and can be used to identify the purchaser.","In an age when we are all so worried about identify theft, you would think that it would be smart for all cashiers to check for credit card signatures on the back of credit and debit cards, and that they would be required to do so. As cardholders, we could be confident that we were making a secure transaction. Furthermore, if credit card processing terminals had the ability to fully match the two signatures, just think how many lost or stolen cards would be returned to their rightful owners and how many criminals unlawfully using stolen cards would be caught."]},"id":"26a46011-b214-4414-89d2-00500721a7b9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6349","url":"/what-your-credit-card-signature-means","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"stephanie-bowen","url":"/author/stephanie-bowen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Stephanie Bowen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"Ekz9StiaJGBnoM6LrpGdL7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-25T18:10:01Z","datePublished":"2011-07-25T18:10:01Z","name":"What Your Credit Card Signature Means","synopsis":"We sign our names almost daily, but do you ever stop to think about your credit card signature?
