The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about RC drones <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-drones,review-2412.html\">here</a>.</em>","The Hubsan X4 H107D is a great <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-drones,review-2412.html\">drone</a> that gives you the feel of flying a quadcopter without breaking your bank account. Add the inexpensive crash pack and you can practice without worrying about replacing a rotor every now and then. The crash pack includes a new shell, four rubber feet, four spare prop sets, two motors, two LEDs and a spare battery.","Among the world’s smallest consumer quadcopters, you can use the palm-sized X4 H107D both inside and outside. Take extra care if the day is windy though; despite its six-axis stabilizer system, this lightweight drone will drift off course in higher winds. And remember, a smaller craft is a bit more sensitive, so you need less gusto on the controls.","Almost ready to fly, the X4 H107D requires just a few calibrations typical of unmanned aerial systems. The package includes a protection ring, usually called a hull. The hull is extremely helpful, especially while you are learning to fly, as it protects both the craft and anything, or anyone, close by. However, unlike other drones, the propellers have to be removed before installing the hull.","Once the X4 H107D is ready to go, 720 x 240p video is streamed to the full-size transmitter’s built-in, 4.3–inch, LCD screen. You can use the transmitter’s controls to pilot this plane while you watch it. However, flying it from the first-person-view (FPV) video on your transmitter screen is a good idea as a drone this small can quickly disappear from view.","The features on the X4 H107D are easy to operate and require very little instruction. Excellent information and support are offered through the online stores that sell this quadcopter drone. The plane is made overseas and the manufacturer’s site contains minimal support.","For both its exceptionally small size and its feature-packed offering, the Hubsan X4 H107D is a solid value for beginning flyers. It’s a fun and easy way to learn to pilot a quadcopter and improve your skills before moving on to a more expensive model."]},"id":"f66457fb-af76-44dd-8298-d146c161ec8e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6d003f4e-b504-4539-8165-d6c95b2a28f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For both its exceptionally small size and its feature-packed offering, the Hubsan X4 H107D is a solid value for beginning flyers.
