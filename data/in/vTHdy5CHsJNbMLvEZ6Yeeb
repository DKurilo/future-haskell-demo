You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The JVC KW-NT3HDT has something that none of the other products we reviewed have: a detachable face plate. This extra feature can help prevent theft and is just one of the reasons that we found this <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">car GPS navigation</a> unit to be among the best in-dash systems available. This JVC in-dash navigation receiver does much more than just navigate; it can help you avoid traffic jams and it can play a variety of media for your enjoyment. The screen is a little small, and it doesn&#39;t have an eco driving function, but we were quite impressed with the performance of this in-dash GPS.","This in-dash navigation unit uses a NAVTEQ map database, which gives you over 6 million points of interest (POIs) to choose from. These POIs are pre-loaded destinations of popular locations, such as restaurants, gas stations, hotels and more. You can personalize your JVC GPS by adding your own POIs. In addition, the KW-NT3HDT will remember the last 50 destinations you have entered.","The 6.1-inch monitor has a touchscreen interface, which is smaller than some of the other in-dash navigation units we reviewed, but 6 inches should be enough for most users. Plus, the front panel detaches from the head unit, so you can keep would-be thieves from breaking into your car. Just slip the slim face plate into the carrying case and take it with you or hide it away.","You can get updates from the GPS using the voice guidance, which gives more general directions, and from text-to-speech which uses a computer program to read the full text on the screen out loud. There doesn&#39;t seem to be an option for voice control of the GPS, which is disappointing, and the in-dash navigation unit doesn&#39;t offer eco-friendly route options. However, this will still satisfy the needs of most drivers.","This is also one of the only in-dash navigation units we reviewed that has built-in HD radio. Other receivers require additional adapters, but the JVC KW-NT3HDT can play HD Radio right from the start. In addition to receiving crystal-clear radio signals, this GPS also uses the HD radio network to get information on traffic, speed limits, weather, news and sports. It&#39;s amazing the kind of information you can get on the go when using the KW-NT3HDT.","The built-in Bluetooth lets you sync your phone to your car stereo, so you can talk hands-free and hear clearly what your caller is saying. This is a great way to help keep your focus on the road. You can also sync up your Bluetooth-enabled media player to this in-dash navigation system, so you don&#39;t have to bring any extra CDs or DVDs on your trip.","JVC features a specific FAQs page for the KW-NT3HDT, and you can always consult the manual, which is available online. Plus, if you have additional questions, you can contact customer support by filling out a small online form or calling technical support. This in-dash navigation system is covered by a one-year limited warranty."]},"id":"b3d5b133-4aed-481a-8c9a-10e87a4559aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"065f81c8-e08f-4c4c-9f70-e79366f9a5d5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The built-in HD Radio alone makes this in-dash navigation unit worth the purchase.
