You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","TomTom currently has three series: Start, Via and Go.  Start is the series for basic low-price personal navigation devices. The TomTom Start 55 TM is the navigation GPS device in this series with the most advanced feature set. Many of these upgrades were only available in high-end models just a few years ago.","This model has a 5-inch resistive screen, which is big enough to see easily when mounted. The plastic resistive screen, combines with a standard resolution of 480 x 272 pixels, keep this device in the low-price category. The resistive screen requires you to physically press the screen to control the display, and it is not capable of scrolling or swiping like smartphones.","The Start 55 TM comes with lifetime map updates, as well as traffic updates for the life of your device. You have four free map updates per year, and the lifetime traffic updates consist of updates from the older, more inefficient system TomTom uses. Most car navigation systems come with these lifetime updates to compete with the smartphone apps that essentially do the same thing.","As this is a more basic model, it doesn&#39;t include Bluetooth compatibility or the capability to accept voice commands. However, it does have a few advanced features, such as a realistic 3D view and lane assistance for intersections, junctions and exits. This model can also speak street names (if you have one of the computer voices installed), but it can&#39;t give directions using landmarks specific to your location. One particularly good feature about this device is the battery life. The lithium-ion battery is rechargeable and capable of up to three hours of life – the highest lifespan of the GPS navigators we reviewed. This battery life really comes into play if you choose to use the pedestrian mode and continue your journey on foot.","To give this model even more appeal, TomTom included the ability to see fuel prices at more than 80,000 gas stations so you can always find the cheapest gas in your area. This model includes this service free for a year, at which point you’ll need to start paying the subscription fee. Furthermore, the Start 55 TM comes with a roadside assistance service that is available 24-hours a day, should you run into any trouble."]},"id":"2a0943dd-3a1e-4feb-aea3-4fd2264bf0fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"15e22ee3-ff8b-4354-8ac8-a44771085bf1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TomTom Start 55 TM is a basic car GPS device with a few fancy features that make it more appealing for the price.
