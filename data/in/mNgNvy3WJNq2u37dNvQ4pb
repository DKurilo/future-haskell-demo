The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use. Top Ten Reviews does not endorse piracy or any other illegal activity.</em>","CloneDVD is a suite of ripping, copying and authoring tools. You can buy the whole suite or just its stand-alone components. CloneDVD DVD Ripper is one of those components. Judged on its own, it is a fine option for <a href=\"/best-dvd-ripper-software\">ripping DVDs</a>. Its easy-to-use interface, quick ripping and conversion speeds earn it a spot in our review of the best DVD ripper software available.","This DVD ripping software has a very modern interface that guides users of even the most rudimentary computer skill level clearly through the process of ripping and converting a DVD. The learning curve with this software is virtually non-existent.","When you rip a DVD, you probably want to make sure that it will play on the device you own. This DVD ripper has a library of preset conversion profiles that will optimize your rip for a number of smartphones, tablets, gaming systems and file formats. Suppose you have a long plane ride ahead of you and you want to watch a few episodes of a TV show. With this application, you just load up the disc, select the episodes you want, set the output profile to iPad (or whatever device you own) and click Start. Within a few minutes, you’ll have a file tailored specifically to your device.","While the library of optimization profiles is great, it’s far from comprehensive when compared to the competition. It has more than 50 tablet and smartphone profiles, which is its strongest category. <a href=\"/aimersoft-dvd-ripper-review\">Other programs</a> we reviewed had more than twice that. It also lacks when it comes to gaming systems, only providing profiles for the PSP and the PS3. In the future, we would like to see an upgrade to Xbox and Nintendo represented, as well as an upgrade to the latest generation of consoles.","Another strong point of this application is that it gives you the ability to edit the video before your rip the content. This is very useful if you don’t want to rip the whole disc. For example, say you want to include a brief movie clip in a presentation. This software allows you to load the movie and trim away any unwanted footage. The integrated video editor also allows you to crop the video image and adjust picture values such as brightness, contrast and resolution. So getting what you want is really quick and easy with this application."]},"id":"fbffe9cd-4372-4c8e-b51a-b2b916986811","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f4800e4d-6ff9-405f-b74e-16e558146a87","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CloneDVD DVD Ripper is a solid application for DVD ripping.
