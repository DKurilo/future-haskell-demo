You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We’re actually a bit disappointed that <strong>USA</strong> fell so far down our list of Internet TV sites. It’s well designed and easy to navigate. And what’s more, it’s a lot of fun! The site is loaded with extra content, ranging from games to webisodes to actor bios and interviews to … that’s right, recipes from characters in the shows. The site is just a lot of fun to explore and discover what kind of unique content you can find.","This sounds great, but the reason that USA didn’t rank higher is because we’re reviewing <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">Internet TV sites</a> here, and as an Internet TV site, USA disappoints. The player is easy to use, there just isn’t a lot of content to watch. There are full episodes of some of the most popular USA shows, but not too many when compared to other sites. Then factor in the fact that the USA site is seriously short on features. USA could have been great, but it just doesn’t have enough to keep your attention.","The popular USA shows all have full episodes available on the USA site. But there aren’t very many episodes for each show, especially if you are looking for episodes from past seasons. Four or five episodes per show is about the limit. It’s a bit aggravating considering that there are so many other extras that the network has thrown in for us.","For instance, the site for every show has games, quizzes and podcasts. But they also have a lot of other specific extras, like recipes, fan art, facts, actor content, message boards and more. It’s things like this that make the site so memorable and entertaining. We just wish that we thought that because there were so many full episodes available.","The USA site is incredibly well-designed and therefore easy to use. The pages aren’t cluttered with ads and promos like many of the other sites we reviewed. And finding videos doesn’t take long either. When you mouse over the “Series” or “Video” links a popout menu drops down and lets you select which show you want to see.","The video player window is very simply designed as well. All the controls and all the other available videos are easily accessible from this screen.","Watching full videos on the USA site usually involves five commercials. This is a pretty average number for Internet TV sites, no not the lowest. The commercials occur at the same points in the show that they would if it was on the air.","There are also some image ads that are visible during the video, though they don’t obstruct the view.","The problem with USA is that it’s woefully short on features. You don’t get anything more than the standard play, pause, volume and fullscreen controls. Other common Internet TV controls, like embed, share and rate the video are absent. You can’t even save your favorite videos to a playlist. The USA site does have message boards and a rudimentary community.","The best way to answer questions or solve problems with the USA site is through the FAQ. You can also contact the site through the email support."]},"id":"8acb4aa0-1074-48d5-b0e3-c4e6b8e06c3a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1178c1f8-2139-499c-b525-c562d7c1eab1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["USA has a lot of fun options, but not very many videos.
