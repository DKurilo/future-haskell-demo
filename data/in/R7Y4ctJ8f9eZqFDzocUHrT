The higher the number of employees, the more difficult it can become to keep track of hours and unpaid breaks. Some time clocks keep track of payroll, benefits and vacation time, which can save the time and the expense of doing it by hand.","<strong>Time Clocks: What to Look For</strong>","Time Clocks give a business an accurate measurement of the exact times that employees work. The clocks come in different types and with extra features. They can range from the standard time-stamp clock to more advanced types that use fingerprints, facial recognition, badges, PIN numbers and barcodes to let an employee check in and out.","Some time clocks are automatic while other models use computer software. Deciding what type would suit your business can depend on many factors. Some examples of time clocks are the <a href=\"#Icon_RTC-1000\">Icon RTC-1000</a>, <a href=\"#Amano\">Amano Atomic Time Clock</a> and <a href=\"#Pyramid\">Pyramid Auto Totaling Time Clock</a>.","<strong>Method of Identification</strong><br/>The method of employee identification used by a company when clocking in or out its employees can depend on the type of business and level of security. Smaller businesses may prefer to use time cards, badges or PIN numbers. Other methods used may include phone or computer entries, passwords or fobs. Larger businesses that have employees with access to potentially sensitive material may prefer fingerprints or eye or facial scans to ensure that the person entering is that employee.","<strong>Number of Employees</strong><br/>The number of employees a company has can help you determine what type of time clock is adequate for your business. Time clocks are available for as few as 25 employees or less for smaller businesses. Larger businesses can find time clocks that handle up to 10,000 employees or more.","<strong>Capabilities</strong><br/>Smaller businesses may only want a time clock that does just records the time its employees arrive and leave. Other businesses may prefer a time clock with expanded features to keep payroll records, monitor vacation schedules and track benefits. In addition, some time clocks deduct for lunch and breaks during the day.","<strong>Operation</strong><br/>Time clocks are available in different operation modes, such as electric or battery operated. Many of them use computer software to keep track of daily entries, and some also come with a battery backup in the event of a power failure.","For business owners with multiple employees, a time clock can keep track of the hours an employee works and, in more expanded models, it can keep track of payroll and benefit records as well as vacation time, lunch hours and breaks for each employee. Choosing the right time clock for your company depends on the time clock&#39;s capabilities, the number of employees you have and the level of sophistication needed for your business.
