Not only can you organize and tag your photos, but you also have access to advanced photo editing tools with this software. While it has more options than many other photo organizers in this review, it wasn&#39;t quite as easy to use as the top three programs.","PhotoDirector only supports four popular image file types: RAW, JPG, TIFF and PNG. It does not support GIF, PSD or PDF files. This lack of popular file support limits your ability to work on and create specific projects. However, PhotoDirector does support several video file types, and you can capture and enhance still images from your videos. You can also import photos from digital cameras and scanners.","PhotoDirector comes with many basic and advanced editing tools such as red eye removal, color adjustment, the ability to work with layers and the ability to create HDR images. You can back up your photos and even set up an automated backup reminder monthly, weekly, daily or each time the product is closed. Unfortunately, this program does not allow you to find and delete duplicate photos, so you will have to manually go through your files and find them yourself. You also cannot organize your photos by the calendar date they were taken, which limits your organizing abilities.","You can easily create slideshows and videos within this program with the possibility of adding music and fade effects. These slideshows can be shared to YouTube directly from within PhotoDirector. You can also share your photos directly to Facebook and Flickr as well as emailing a photo from within the program. This software helps you store your photos online by letting you upload your photos to the CyberLink Cloud for free. You can import photos from a camera, the CyberLink Cloud or from your computer. Unique to PhotoDirector is the ability to post directly to DirectorZone, a social sharing site for users of CyberLink&#39;s Director software series.","CyberLink has many video tutorials on its YouTube channel, so if you are stuck you can watch a video for tips and lessons. When signed in to your CyberLink account online, you also have access to a user forum. CyberLink&#39;s knowledgebase is complete with a FAQs page and customer service representatives reachable by phone and email. This program is compatible with Windows 10, 8 and 7. Unlike most programs in this lineup, PhotoDirector can also work on Mac OS X and 10.8.<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"e9d580ad-4007-408d-a708-1bab54fcd7b1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8caae4fc-48c3-47c1-b077-d88b3edc86fe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["PhotoDirector 8 is much more than just a photo organizer.
