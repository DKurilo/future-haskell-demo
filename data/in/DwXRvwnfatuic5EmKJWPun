You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hamilton Beach Digital toaster has a digital display, a feature normally found on the <a href=\"/best-toasters\">best toasters</a>. The digital display makes it easy to see the options you’re using for your toast. However, the digital shade settings don’t let you customize the toast shade. There is no way of setting the toaster to a level that falls between any of the nine preset shade settings. You would have to stop the toasting cycle with the cancel button if you wanted a piece of toast at any a half level setting.","The Hamilton Beach Digital toaster is available in both two- and four-slice models. The four-slice toaster comes with dual controls, perfect if you want to toast two different breads at once on different settings. Both models have wide slots so you can easily toast bagels or larger artisan breads.","This toaster has defrost, bagel and cancel toasting functions, all of which are standard with other toasters, too. The cancel function allows you to stop the toasting function mid-cycle. This helps you to ensure that your toast doesn&#39;t become overdone. The bagel function toasts only the cut side of the bagel, leaving the heel end tender. The defrost function first thaws the bread and then toasts it to your desired shading. This lets you freeze breads and pastries, increasing their shelf life, and still toast them quickly without waiting for them to thaw.","The stainless steel design and curving lines of this toaster are ideal for modern kitchens. A problem with the Hamilton Beach Digital is the lack of cool-touch sides. This means that the sides of the toaster will become hot during use, so it can be troublesome to program the toaster and retrieve the bread after the toasting cycle, as your risk burning yourself. It does have a hideaway cord and removable crumb tray to help you clean and store it.","The Hamilton Beach Digital has a one-year limited warranty. This is a standard warranty for small kitchen appliances. There are digital copies of all the toaster user guides on the Hamilton Beach site. This is useful, especially if you lose the hard copy that comes with the toaster. Hamilton Beach also provides a toll-free support line and email form to provide answers to any of your questions about the toaster."]},"id":"39bd1c8a-4b41-4e30-814a-70d83c9083e9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d56ae06a-495e-425a-9c9c-45dec3329278","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hamilton Beach Digital provides standard toaster features, along with a few extras generally found on high-end four-slice toasters.
