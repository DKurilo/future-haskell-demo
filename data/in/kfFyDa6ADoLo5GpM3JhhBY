You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With a subsurface <a href=\"/best-pool-alarms\">pool wave detector</a>, the SmartPool Pooleye PE20 is capable of detecting objects, animals and people weighing 15 pounds or more as they enter the pool. The pool alarm mounts to a pool deck or ladder and features a poolside siren for alerts. The adjustable sensitivity allows you to leave the alerts at 15 pounds or adjust it higher to reduce the chance of false alarms. Because it already uses a 15-pound sensitivity, false alarms are rare, but if your children are older than a few years and you don&#39;t have any small pets, then a higher sensitivity does not affect accuracy.","While the Pooleye only features one alarm, it is very loud, meaning that you will most likely hear it inside. If you have a very large house or typically listen to loud music, however, you might not hear it. Because the alarm is built into the control panel, it does have to stay near to the pool, which means that you cannot put it closer to the house to increase the chance someone will hear it.","Mounting options include snap-on attachments for putting the Pooleye on a ladder, but it also includes mounts for concrete if you want to install it on the side of the pool. This takes longer than clipping it onto a ladder, but is a more stable way to install the pool alarm. The Pooleye features an on/off button that anyone can push, making it easy to use the pool without sounding the alarm. However, children who are old enough to figure the control panel out themselves can turn the alarm off on their own. The sensor works with pools up to 18 x 36 feet in size, which is limited, but still enough to work with most home pools. It also works with pools that are much smaller, so you can install it and lower the sensitivity for the same results.","With a water wave sensor, up to 15-pound accuracy and a loud alarm, the Pooleye is a good option for outdoor in-ground pools. However, if you have a large house or frequently listen to music, the lack of a remote alarm is a definite drawback, as is the open control panel. Overall, it works well for in-ground pools and provides adequate protection for most needs."]},"id":"d707a87c-93bd-4985-b0cc-3e697136c7bd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63624","url":"/smartpool-pe20-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-23T20:27:37Z","datePublished":"2015-03-23T20:27:37Z","name":"SmartPool PE20 PoolEye IG","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-23T20:27:37Z","id":"kfFyDa6ADoLo5GpM3JhhBY","meta":{"title":"SmartPool PE20 PoolEye IG Review","description":"The SmartPool Pooleye PE20 is capable of detecting objects, animals and people weighing 15 pounds or more as they enter the pool."},"products":[{"slug":"smartpool-pe20-pooleye-ig","url":"/product/smartpool-pe20-pooleye-ig","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","name":"SmartPool PE20 PoolEye IG","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","id":"YArBu7h9Jq63ZH6miLwg4Y","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ehQtJn6fFRmhLAi89XNtNY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"63596-smartpool-pe20-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63596-smartpool-pe20-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","id":"ehQtJn6fFRmhLAi89XNtNY","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ehQtJn6fFRmhLAi89XNtNY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"SmartPool PE20 PoolEye IG Review","description":"The SmartPool Pooleye PE20 is capable of detecting objects, animals and people weighing 15 pounds or more as they enter the pool."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ehQtJn6fFRmhLAi89XNtNY.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"63596-smartpool-pe20-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63596-smartpool-pe20-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","id":"ehQtJn6fFRmhLAi89XNtNY","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ehQtJn6fFRmhLAi89XNtNY.jpg","alt":""},"title":"SmartPool PE20 PoolEye IG Review","description":"The SmartPool Pooleye PE20 is capable of detecting objects, animals and people weighing 15 pounds or more as they enter the pool."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/family/best-pool-alarms/smartpool-pe20-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:48Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
