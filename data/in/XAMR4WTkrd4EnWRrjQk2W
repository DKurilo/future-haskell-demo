Sometimes the real deal is just as good, or a better choice, especially if you have a responsible child that is serious about photography. The Polaroid if045 is a waterproof digital camera that is durable enough for a child to use on his or her own. Since it has been designed to withstand hard elements and extreme-sport enthusiasts, this camera will be able to handle a few drops and bumps as your child hones in on his or her photography talent.","Since the Polaroid if045 is a real digital camera, your child will be able to adjust settings, such as shutter speed and white light balance. He or she can use the autofocus feature or manually focus before snapping each pic. These are functions that are not included with most kids cameras.","The picture quality of this child&#39;s camera is amazing, with an image resolution of 14 megapixels. The included USB cable makes it easy to upload and share images from any computer, both PC and Mac. This camera can only hold about 14 pictures in its internal memory. It does support SD memory cards if you wish to increase the photo storage capability.","One neat feature of the Polaroid if045 is that is comes with two view screens. The large, 2.7 inch view screen on the back lets you easily see what you will capture in your pictures. The screen in the front lets you take self-portraits and see where you will be in the picture relative to the objects and scenery around you.","The Polaroid if045 has a camcorder mode that will let your child take impressive video. It comes with a playback mode, so you don&#39;t have to wait to relive the fun. This camera requires AAA batteries to run. While other kids digital cameras we reviewed tend to erase stored images when the batteries die, the Polaroid if045 will always keep your images safe, even if the batteries run out."]},"id":"5e804a71-7ed3-4137-9676-c42838541195","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0ceb7163-3066-42e8-a358-7c3125146243","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Polaroid if045 is a good choice for a children&#39;s camera if your child is serious about fine-tuning his or her picture-taking skills.

This camera doesn&#39;t have a lot of internal memory, so it won&#39;t hold too many pictures. However, you can increase the memory with an SD card.
