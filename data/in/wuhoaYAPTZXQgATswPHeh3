However, the scooter’s design makes it a poor option for outdoor use. Not only does it have a low ground clearance, but you also cannot use it for long excursions because of its short operating range and unaccommodating seat and handle.","This <a href=\"/best-power-scooters\">power scooter</a> has an operating speed of 4.25 mph, which is standard for a travel scooter like this one. It has an operating range of 10 miles; this is shorter than the operating ranges of many of the scooters we reviewed but still adequate for running quick errands. It takes between eight and 10 hours for this scooter to recharge to a full battery.","Similar to the <a href=\"/buzzaround-lite-review\">BuzzAround Lite 3</a> and the <a href=\"/luggie-review\">Luggie</a>, the electric wheelchair scooter doesn&#39;t have a high weight capacity, maxing out at 250 pounds. This low weight capacity limits who can ride the scooter and how many additional accessories or items it can carry, although it does have a tiller basket.","This three-wheel scooter makes tight turns with ease. It has the best turning capabilities of all the scooters in our review with a 25.8-inch turning radius. Because it is easy to maneuver and has foam-filled tires, this scooter performs well indoors. You can maneuver around tight corners and between objects, and the tires are easy on flooring.","Additionally, this medical scooter has a low ground clearance and can’t climb steep inclines. The manufacturer recommends the scooter be used on inclines of 6 degrees or less. ADA compliant ramps for commercial buildings have 5 degree inclines; however, residential buildings typically feature ramps with 9.5-degree inclines. This scooter struggles to climb residential ramps and steep hills and inclines, which limits its use outdoors.","The Zip’r 3 Xtra is not the most portable scooter. Assembled, the scooter weighs almost 104 pounds. The heaviest of the five components weighs 35 pounds, and even the battery weighs over 20 pounds. Users with physical disabilities may struggle to assemble and transport such a heavy scooter. Still, you can fold this scooter to make it more compact when transporting or storing it.","This scooter has a less comfortable design than our top-rated mobility scooters. The scooter has a stadium style seat that offers minimal comfort or support. It lacks adjustable armrests, but you can adjust the tiller to suit your body type. The scooter has a standard handle that can be difficult to use if riders have limited hand dexterity.","Zip’r Mobility offers a standard warranty for its scooter. The company covers the frame for three years, the drive train and electronic components for two years, and the battery for six months."]},"id":"3f5e6bb3-f41f-4396-a6e1-1202cd15aae5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b865796d-a2f4-45c9-bb34-ac212beca1f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its tight turning radius, average maximum speed and low ground clearance, this scooter performs much better indoors.
