For example, it is easy to use, lightweight and durable, and it can weigh food up to 11 pounds. In our testing, this scale topped the charts for accuracy and consistency, scoring perfectly in both areas. Its large display and numbers are backlit and easy to read from nearly every angle. With a few minor exceptions, this scale impressed us in every way.","We subjected each food scale we reviewed to a battery of tests, and the EatSmart Precision Pro II’s results show it has impeccable accuracy – it displayed the exact same weight as our control group every time. For our consistency test, we weighed the same items in different places on the scale to see if it yielded different results. The EatSmart Precision Pro passed this test with flying colors – it shows the same weight no matter where you place your food.","The Precision Pro II can weigh items as light as .05 ounces and as heavy as 11 pounds. That’s a middle-of-the-road weight range compared to the other kitchen scales we tested. Also, while 11 pounds is high enough to weigh most ingredients for an average meal, if you often cook large meals, you probably want to invest in a scale that can handle more weight. For example, the <a href=\"/ozeri-touch-ii-review\">Ozeri Touch II</a> can weigh items up to 18 pounds.","This EatSmart scale&#39;s weighing platform measures just a hair less than 20 square inches. Some of its competitors have weighing areas more than double that size, but 20 inches is more than adequate to for home use.","The scale’s power button doubles as the tare button, which you press to zero out the weight of the container you are weighing ingredients in. You simply weigh the empty container, hit the tare button, fill the container and weigh it again. The scale will show the weight of the items in the container and discount the weight of the container itself. You press the second button, marked “unit,” to choose the unit of measurement.","This EatSmart scale displays weight in ounces, pounds, grams and kilograms, which are the most common units used in modern recipes. However, scales that also read in fluid ounces and milliliters are more versatile.","The Precision Pro II is lightweight, round and compact, so it is easy to store. When you first pull the scale out of the package, its display is great. However, after several hours of constant use, the display fades and becomes difficult to read. Even changing the batteries doesn’t solve this problem.","This scale requires two AAA batteries. To save power, it automatically turns off after three minutes of inactivity. This auto-shutoff feature is also handy because you don’t have to remember to turn off the scale while you are busy cooking."]},"id":"1fe211b5-05b6-4c5e-a0a6-b6f135e86ca9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57609","url":"/eatsmart-precision-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-09-25T19:12:59Z","datePublished":"2013-09-25T19:12:59Z","name":"EatSmart Precision Pro ESKS-08","synopsis":"The EatSmart Precision Pro II ranks among the best food scales we tested for many reasons.
