You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Yamaha has been around making audio related electronics for quite a while now. In this <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a> review section we selected two to look at but neither made it to the top. Despite being more expensive, the Yamaha RX-V567 is the lesser of the two. They are nearly identical except for a few missing features on this one like satellite radio. Although we didn&#39;t use price to rate the products in this section, it is still worth mentioning. Had the prices been reversed it would have made more sense. Yamaha definitely needs to make a few changes to  the products in this price range if they want to be more competitive.","As far as general audio performance goes this Yamaha AV receiver stays up pretty close with the leading competition. The signal-to-noise ratio sits at 100dB. The frequency response is nice and broad, ranging from 10Hz to 100kHz. That is about where most are. They say that the human ear can only hear frequencies between 20Hz and 20kHz, and that range is easily covered here.","The amplifier portion of the AV receiver isn&#39;t too bad either. It pulls in about 280 watts and can output 90 watts per channel in a 7.1 surround sound setup. Yamaha&#39;s main competition produces systems that use less power and output even more per channel, so they&#39;ll have to step up their game if they want to stay competitive. Another 10 or so watts of output and at least 20 watts less consumption would place them right up where they need to be.","This AV receiver doesn&#39;t have any satellite radio connection, nor are there any speaker terminals for a second room or zone. Aside from those two flaws, the Yamaha RX-V567 AV receiver has a nice balance of port options. There are of course the basics like AM and FM radio, two optical inputs, two coaxial inputs, two component inputs and one output, the usual group of composite AV inputs and outputs for non-HD purposes and then a set of HDMI ports.","The HDMI is version 1.4 and is &#34;3Dready&#34;. The 3D capabilities aren&#39;t unlocked; you have to install a firmware update to do that. There are 4 HDMI inputs and one output, which should cover your basic HD needs. Those, along with the other ports, are all on the back side of the Av receiver. On the front side there is a section of AV ports as well. On the far left side there is a 6.3mm headphone jack for anyone wanting a solo music session. There is also a 3.5mm jack for your portable devices and a single set of composite ports for video and stereo audio.","Like most of the AV receivers we reviewed, this one isn&#39;t THX certified. It does however support Dolby Digital Plus, EX and TrueHD. On the DTS side of things, it supports DTS Neo:6, ES, 96/24 and HD Master Audio. There is Dolby Pro Logic II support but it isn&#39;t the latest Pro Logic IIz release, only Pro Logic IIx. The difference is minute and unimportant to some. Pro Logic IIz basically just added matrixed front height channels for ambient sounds. It&#39;s an interesting addition since these additional channels add a more realistic 3D sound ambience – and as 3D video grows, people will want the audio to go with it.","Aside from 1080p video upscaling and iPod compatibility, the Yamaha RX-V567 AV receiver is pretty much void of extra features. It has unlockable potential for 3D video, and Yamaha&#39;s own Cinema DSP audio processing is meant to work hand in hand with 3D technology to provide quality playback despite the more advanced process. Also, with their auto lip-sync technology, having video and audio sync problems shouldn&#39;t be a problem.","Although this AV receiver doesn&#39;t come with the option for Bluetooth connections, you do have the option in the form of an adaptor. Yes, it does cost extra to by the adaptor but for some that is a necessity. Bluetooth opens doors to many other things like connecting to your computer or other Bluetooth device like an iPhone or Android cell phone."]},"id":"4feac355-10f7-452d-b556-caa927fe91d1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6a6f8b1b-6ab5-4110-90fc-fb855bedbb5a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Of all the AV receivers, the <strong>Yamaha RX-V567</strong> was pretty much middle of the road. It has some future-proofing with the option to install a firmware update for 3D video processing, but to counter that it has slightly outdated Dolby Pro Logic technology. It&#39;s an interesting mix when you compare certain things like that but for the most part it&#39;s balanced. With a decrease in price or increase in features and performance to match the leaders in this area of audio and video, this AV receiver would be a much stronger competitor."]},"id":"b7dc244b-9c5b-4110-b2ab-70232d53fb52","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50347","url":"/yamaha-rx-v567-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-09T21:02:57Z","datePublished":"2010-08-09T21:02:57Z","name":"Yamaha RX-V567","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":69,"verdict":"It costs a little too much for what you get.","pros":["The Yamaha RX-V567 has a low level of harmonic distortion."],"cons":["This AV receiver lacks some of the nice features that make it more versatile."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-08-09T21:02:57Z","id":"YUfZWCuxNxuYXqAEx4Egoe","meta":{"title":"Yamaha RX-V567 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Yamaha has been around making audio related electronics for quite a while now.
