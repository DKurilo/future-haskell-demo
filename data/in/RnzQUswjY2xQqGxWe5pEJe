Although the overall sound quality is decent, these floor speakers struggle with midrange tone accuracy, especially when listening to jazz and orchestral music.","A removable mesh grille protects the three 3.5-inch drivers and 1-inch tweeter. Removing the grille exposes the orange-colored drivers and gives the appearance of the Supernova 8 some flash. The three 6.5-inch drivers help these speakers produce low tones all the way down to 40Hz. Even without the accompaniment of a dedicated subwoofer, these speakers produce an ample amount of bass to do the job.","After listening to various jazz sounds, we noticed that these stereo speakers struggle with accurate upper-bass and midrange frequencies. In this tonal range, instruments such as piano and stand-up bass sounded flat with no life. The silk dome tweeter produced airy and clean high-frequency tones, especially when listening to jazz music. The highs produced by the tweeter add definition and clarity to the overall sound quality of these speakers and cut through the rest of the sound with ease.","These tower speakers have a piano-black ported enclosure. The two-way binding posts are not bi-amp or bi-wire capable, so you canâ€™t wire individual speakers to a separate power source. Measuring at 42 x 8 x12 inches (H x W x D) and weighing 42.7 pounds, these audio speakers are average in size compared to the rest of our lineup.","The one-year warranty these home stereo speakers are covered by is lackluster compared to many of the other speaker manufacturers that offer up to five years of coverage. If you have any questions concerning your speakers, you can contact Pure Acoustics via email or phone."]},"id":"ab6ded26-0dec-4ae6-bf54-6b1d9597916d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e6403ba0-f3c5-49f6-b976-e08b4725196b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pure Acoustics Supernova 8 are decent tower speakers that produce good sound quality by providing powerful bass tones and clean highs.
