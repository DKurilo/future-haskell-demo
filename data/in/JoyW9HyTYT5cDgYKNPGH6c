But its good looks aren&#39;t all it has going for it. It also boasts an eight-minute flight time, an integrated camera and a great price.","Although we thought the UDI had good handling in most situations, we found that it struggled in wind â€“ sometimes being carried far off course. Most of the time this isn&#39;t a big deal; just make sure you&#39;re flying in open areas to avoid losing sight of it.","Its relatively long flight time is a product of its large 500 mAh battery. While it takes longer than most to charge at around two hours, it&#39;s well worth the extra time. In addition to this, the UDI was the only remote control helicopter to include an extra battery and a two-battery charger. That&#39;s a big plus in our book.","If you&#39;re just learning how to fly <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">RC helicopters</a> and aren&#39;t quite the best at it, you&#39;ll also be glad to know that the UDI has two speed modes: one that&#39;s slower and easier to handle and one that unleashes the full power of your quadcopter. We found that while the slower mode was helpful for learning under ideal circumstances, it made the drone a little more difficult to control in strong winds simply because you no longer have the power to fight against them.","On the underside of this remote control helicopter you&#39;ll find four colored LEDs that help you see the craft in low light and determine which direction it&#39;s facing. It also has an integrated camera, which at this price point is more of a novelty feature than anything. The image quality isn&#39;t anything to be praised, but having a camera at all in an RC helicopter of this price is pretty cool.","The transmitter is good, every bit as good as the other transmitters we tested. It has trim control and a small screen that provides you with helpful information. There&#39;s also a button to capture video footage or take photos."]},"id":"634132c5-5377-4d9f-ba10-15ac9c97dc6a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7efb2791-39b9-4014-a558-c681b48d0124","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The UDI U818A is a solid option for a remote control helicopter.
