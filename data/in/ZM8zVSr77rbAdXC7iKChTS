The original review is below, but check out our current top </em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/kitchen/best-french-door-refrigerators/\"><em>French Door Refrigerators</em></a><em> here.</em>","Most stainless-steel refrigerators are not magnetic. The manufacturer has to add a magnetic layer underneath, and most companies skip on that option. However, you can opt for magnetic black or white French door refrigerators. The Frigidaire Gallery FGHB2866PF is interesting in that it is magnetic in all three-color options, which include black, white and stainless steel.","It is also a spacious fridge, like most of our top-rated French door refrigerators, with a total capacity of 27.2 cubic feet. The total capacity for the refrigerated compartment is 18.5 cubic feet, which is common in refrigerators this size. At 8.7 cubic feet, the freezer could be a little larger, but this is not a deal-breaker.","You may consider this one of the best French door refrigerators around once you see your monthly electric bill. This refrigerator costs only $60 a year to run, according to the Energy Guide established by the U.S. government. The estimated monthly operating cost is a mere $5, which is quite low for a major appliance and, for many people, a key factor in choosing the best refrigerator.","The refrigerated compartment is well lit, with LED lights on the ceiling and the sides of the compartment. Good lighting makes it easier to see into the back corners of your fridge  – essential in a large French door fridge. The four adjustable shelves spread the light around, as they are tempered glass with a protective lip around the edges to prevent spills from spreading. There are three half-width shelves and one quarter-width shelf. The quarter-width shelf folds up against the icemaker to accommodate tall items on the shelf below. One of the shelves  slides back to make room for tall items.","You can control the humidity in the two crisper bins, and something unique to this fridge is that the crisper bins are adjustable. You can move the bins into different positions, allowing you to customize the fridge to your liking. On the flip side, you cannot control the temperature in the full-width drawer. The fridge automatically keeps the full-width drawer at a constant temperature that is lower than the rest of the fridge and is ideal for meats and cheeses.","The right-side door of the refrigerated compartment has four bins, including a covered dairy compartment. The left-side door, however, has limited space. The water and ice dispenser consumes a good portion of the door storage, so you only have two small bins and another half-sized bin. Out of the seven bins, though, you have two bins capable of holding gallon-sized containers.","The icemaker is in the refrigerated section and is connected to the external water and ice dispenser. This icemaker is slim compared to some of the fridges we reviewed, but it still takes up a quarter of the top shelf space. This Frigidaire Gallery model is dual ice ready, which means that you can put in a second icemaker in the freezer for greater ice production. The freezer has two tiers and a total of four bins. The top tier is wire, and it is not recommended that you keep small items in this drawer as they could slip through the gaps.","Unfortunately, unlike the top rated refrigerators, Frigidaire offers an unimpressive one-year parts and labor warranty. Many of the other manufacturers in this price range normally offer warranties on the sealed system or the compressor. You will be out of luck if you run into a problem after your one-year warranty ends."]},"id":"b98cd9fe-3781-4829-a4c1-c2d3432f3002","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7836e899-59ae-47fc-bb21-1465c1045663","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The rearrangeable crisper bins are a terrific feature and add a level of customization you will not find in other refrigerators.
