Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits into our top ten lineup. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The name Panasonic has long been associated with top quality, and the Panasonic DECT 6.0 Plus <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phone</a> series epitomizes the versatility and reliability of these home phones. Of the various models in this cordless phone line, the KX-TG6845B Plus presents a sturdy base station and handset with four additional handsets. If you choose, you can add one more to the standard lineup.","This phone offers the DECT 6.0 technology, which means you will be assured of good sound quality at all times. This home telephone will not cause difficulties with the numerous other wireless devices that are prevalent in private homes, small businesses and various office settings.","One drawback to this otherwise highly useful phone is that you do not get Bluetooth capability, so there is no link-to-cell option. For those wedded to cell phones, this could be problematic, but for others who need cordless telephones for a variety of personal or professional reasons, this might be the best cordless phone system for them.","This phone permits a hearty 10 hours of talk time and a battery life of eight days. You get 18 minutes of recorded message time. Unlike a number of cordless phones on the market, the Panasonic DECT 6.0 Plus phones provide both headset and base speakerphones, which makes hands-free conversations easy while you are busy with something else.","The caller ID is not only visible in big black letters and numbers on the expansive white backlit LCD screen – it is chatty as well. The phone audibly announces who is calling so you do not have to stir if you are not interested in taking a particular call. Call conferencing is easy: you get an alarm with this phone, there is a headset jack, and if you need to round up the family or your employees at work, you can always use the phone intercom.","This cordless phone does not offer a text message alert. However, the phone will forward voicemail messages so you can get them remotely, and the base will alert you if you get a phone message.","The phonebook can hold 100 items, the caller ID can handle 50 items, and if you want to redial, the last five numbers are at your disposal. You can also employ the silent mode when you need a break from calls.","You get a yearlong warranty with this phone, as well as a user manual and a frequently asked questions section on the company website. If you need extra help, telephone and email support is available. You also get the best help and support option – live chat – for fast answers to pressing questions."]},"id":"c992eff1-7419-46f0-98f6-f6237534d2af","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d9738bf5-4ae6-408c-abc0-d8d7f0290cce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This phone does not provide the Bluetooth capability that would make it more versatile.
