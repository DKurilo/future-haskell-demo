You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Most <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> are powered by iOS or Android, so it&#39;s hard to say why one is better than the other. The Samsung Focus S stands apart by using Windows Phone 7.5, an operating system made to connect all Microsoft technologies. As a standalone device, the Focus S is a good beginner smartphone, and when it synchronizes with your Windows computer and your Xbox Live account, it becomes a fluid experience with interesting features.","The Samsung Focus S features a 4.3-inch touchscreen display. The screen is bright and vivid. Unfortunately, this nice screen is housed in a flimsy plastic case. Everything feels like it could break in your hands, and the smartphone&#39;s moving parts quickly start coming loose as you us them. For example, a few presses of the volume button makes it wiggle to the touch.","The Samsung Focus S uses an 8MP rear-facing camera, which excels in outdoor shooting. Outdoor pictures turn out clear and attractive. Once you take the smartphone inside, it loses its visual fidelity. Pictures turn out grainy, pixilated or blurry. The phone&#39;s display is not HD, so don&#39;t expect to be impressed with videos or games.","The speakers are accurate, so you&#39;ll hear conversations just fine, but if you have the noise cancellation turned on, this smartphone makes you sound muffled. When it&#39;s connecting to data, the Focus S has a nasty habit of dropping the connection in the middle of downloads. Once you get used to the smartphone&#39;s quirks, you can overlook its sometimes-poor call quality and data connection, but at first, it&#39;s easy to get frustrated with the phone.","The Samsung Focus S uses a weak battery. Even with minimal use, you&#39;ll want to charge your phone every day. The smartphone comes with 16GB of installed storage space, and there&#39;s no option to expand it with a memory card. If you&#39;re a gamer, connecting with your Xbox Live account, your smartphone&#39;s hard drive will fill quickly.","Windows Phone 7.5 uses a single-core, 1.4GHz processor. For the most part, the phone runs smoothly, but when you open an app, the smartphone pauses before completing an action. Also, the Samsung Focus S has very few compatible accessories, and the Windows app market is much smaller than the iOS or Android&#39;s marketplaces"]},"id":"9a954916-de03-444f-9314-e361e034c9ab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f738d71a-790f-4141-8c02-3aa37de835b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As a beginner smartphone, the Samsung Focus S is easy to use and fluid.
