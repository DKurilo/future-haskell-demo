The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\"><em>wireless earbuds here</em></a><em>. </em>","Outdoor Tech has gained a reputation for making quality Bluetooth devices that are both environmentally friendly and capable of handling the elements. The Outdoor Tech Orcas build on this reputation with a unique feature that you won&#39;t find with other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">wireless earbuds</a> â€“ every purchase includes a dollar donation to the Whaleman Foundation to help with research, education and conservation for whales. So not only are the Orcas one of the top 10 best wireless earbuds, but they also help save the whales.","The battery life is six hours for both music streaming and talking on the phone. This is average for wireless Bluetooth earbuds. It takes two hours for a full charge. It lacks noise reduction technology to filter out background noises, so it&#39;s not ideal for phone calls. The music streaming is average as well. It&#39;s good for working out, but it lacks the quality of the best Bluetooth in-ear headphones.","One of the best features of the Orcas is the comfortable fit. At just 0.45 ounces, these are the lightest wireless in-ear headphones available. You can barely tell that you&#39;re wearing them. The set comes with three sizes so that you can find an earbud that fits snugly in your ear canal. It also comes with two sizes of ear fins, which are optional. The ear fins tuck into the bowl of your outer ear, adding stability for running so that the earbuds don&#39;t pop out. The flat cord between the two earpieces doesn&#39;t allow you to wrap the cord over your ear for even more stability. However, the Orcas are so light that you don&#39;t need that option.","Like the whale, the Orcas are sweat-proof and water resistant, but it isn&#39;t impact resistant or sand-proof. So you have to be careful not to drop it in the sand if you&#39;re running along the beach. It also doesn&#39;t come with a case or a fitness app like the best wireless earphones.","One of the downsides to the Orcas is the lack of support features from Outdoor Tech. While the set comes with a one-year warranty and excellent customer service, there isn&#39;t a FAQs page, glossary or firmware updates for the earbuds."]},"id":"9a949b7b-203e-4ba6-a189-f6af69a5dd7e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4538b26f-5978-4e06-b62f-cef4eaf99939","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Outdoor Tech Orcas are comfortable and light wireless earbuds for running, hiking and workouts.
