We tossed golf balls into the pool, threw a wet jacket in and had somebody get into the water themselves, and the alarm sounded every time. While some pool alarms only picked up golf balls that hit the water mere inches away, the PoolEye PE12 went off no matter where the balls landed, earning it an A+ for accuracy. It got a semi-passing grade of C in our wind test â€“ it sounded after a little prodding with a wind blower, so it is a bit more prone to going off due to weather than other alarms we tested.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"e9ec9e4a-7e30-4151-8c76-6f34d7781107","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63623","url":"/smartpool-pooleye-above-ground-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-23T20:26:54Z","datePublished":"2015-03-23T20:26:54Z","name":"SmartPool PoolEye PE12","synopsis":"The SmartPool PoolEye PE12 is a submerged pool alarm with a slim, discrete design.
