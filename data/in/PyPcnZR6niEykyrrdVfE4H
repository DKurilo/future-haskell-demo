The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","The Mbot Grid II+ is a solid 3D printer for printing quality in a medium-size model. With the included SD card, onboard controls and upgradeable print heads, this printer is an easy-to-use option for beginning or advanced users.","3D printing is really all about speed and quality. The Mbot Grid II+ can print models at speeds between 50 and 120 mm/s which is a nice range to choose from. Slower speeds garner higher quality prints, and faster speeds allow you to quickly print prototypes. Print resolution, or layer height, ranges between 0.1 and 0.3 mm, which is about the thickness of a sheet of copy paper. The speed and resolution is about average compared to other 3D printers, but an 8 x 8 x 7-inch print capacity is slightly larger than most.","The test models were efficiently printed and solidly constructed, but each had minor errors. Lower layers printed much more accurately than higher layers, and surface layers were not completely flat nor defect-free. Bridging however is excellent and our test print printed successfully without supports.","3D printing materials for the Mbot Grid II+ include both ABS and PLA. While Magicfirm, the 3D printing company, sells proprietary filament cartridges, you can also purchase universal cartridges as long as the filament is 1.75 mm. One extruder is included with the Mbot Grid II+, but an extra 3D printer extruder is available as an upgrade, so you can print in dual colors. Very few 3D printers are compatible with dual extruders, so the Grid II+ surpasses a few of its competitors when it comes to color printing.","This heavy metal 3D printer weighs nearly 60 pounds but has a very solid design for high-quality prints. A magnetic print platform makes it very easy to remove prints and clean the printing surface. The plate itself isnâ€™t heated, but the Mbot Grid II+ can print in ABS anyway, just be aware that warping is a definite possibility. Screen controls are also very easy to maneuver, making this printer easy to navigate and control. You can level the print plate, start and stop prints and view the progress and time elapsed during the print job.","The Mbot Grid II+ can print files from either a connected computer or via the provided SD card. With the SD card, your computer is free and untethered during the printing process. The included Mprint software allows you to modify 3D models and print right from your computer. Make sure to check all settings before you export files to the SD card, as the software reverts to the default settings. Also in the box with the printer are a filament cartridge, maintenance tools and a USB cable.","The Mbot 3D printer is manufactured by Magicfirm, a company based out of China. Email support is prompt and easy to contact; however, only an international phone number is provided, so local support is extremely limited. Although a helpful manual is provided on the website, there are no FAQs or tutorials for the Mbot Grid II+ specifically."]},"id":"74aff703-4a4f-4c51-84bb-954a46daea8f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"26c92e44-1132-4922-805b-f1d8c0546e68","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Mbot Grid II+ is capable of printing high-quality and low-quality 3D printer designs.
