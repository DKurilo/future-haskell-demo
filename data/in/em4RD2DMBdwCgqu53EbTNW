Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-baby-video-monitors\">Video Baby Monitors</a></em><em> here.</em>","The biggest selling point of the Summer Infant Best View video baby monitor is that it delivers a clear, secure transmission with very little static or interference. Delivering quality audio and video is, of course, what a baby video monitor is all about, but we also look for several core features in our baby video monitor reviews that this monitor lacks, like two-way talk and VOX capability.","The Best View video baby monitor is designed to enhance usability and video monitoring capabilities. For starters, the multi-camera expandability is particularly useful for growing families or if you want to simultaneously monitor multiple areas in your house, such as the nursery and the playroom, without relocating a single camera. It has a maximum connection range of 400 feet. However, you should be aware that the optimal range is less if the line of sight between the two units is obstructed (e.g., if they are placed in different rooms).","The camera unit has a motorized mount, which allows you to control the camera remotely – pan, scan and zoom – for complete coverage of your little one&#39;s activities. The monitor has five sound lights, which illuminate based on the noise level of the baby. Several lights go on if the baby is crying, as opposed to just one or two if the baby is only cooing. This feature is particularly useful if you are monitoring your baby while vacuuming or in a noisy room.","The design leaves something to be desired, especially compared to the best video baby monitors. It&#39;s a bit clunky and more utilitarian than apt for a nursery, but its functionality makes up for what it lacks aesthetically.","Ideal for nighttime use, the video sleep mode conserves battery power and avoids a screen glow that could potentially disturb sleep. Both the audio and sound lights continue to function normally in this mode, but there are no VOX capabilities to preserve battery power, even when it&#39;s in sleep mode. That said, this video baby monitor&#39;s battery is rated for 10 hours of use. The video is not sound-activated, and you must press the video power button to resume viewing.","In case you have any problems or issues with these baby video monitors, Summer Infant has a customer care department that offers support via toll-free telephone or email during regular business hours (EST). The website is full of helpful resources, including product instructions and general FAQs. In case you experience more serious problems, like a flawed unit, the company offers a one-year limited warranty."]},"id":"268f160c-cf15-45a2-b623-525bfe96f512","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ba50db6a-cef7-4f44-ab21-2d0ccdc24c93","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite a few minor design issues, there&#39;s no question that the Summer Infant BestView is a good baby video monitor with a robust feature set enabling it to perform its most important function of helping to keep your baby safe."]},"id":"7f970b9c-8b94-44a2-a971-e62298e1006f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50779","url":"/view-baby-video-monitor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-22T15:47:27Z","datePublished":"2010-09-22T15:47:27Z","name":"Summer Infant Best View Monitor","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
