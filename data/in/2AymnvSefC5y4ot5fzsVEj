You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","Endless Ideas BV is a Dutch company that manufactures electronics. Its current product line-up is the BeBook One, the BeBook Mini and the BeBook Neo. The BeBook Neo is one of our top <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook readers</a> because though not as popular in the United States, it is one of the dominating companies in the rest of the world. Surprisingly enough  of the big brands here in the States did not really even make it to the world market. A good example of that would be the Kindle. Kindle is a major player here, but got shut down quick in most of the rest of the world. There are a few major reasons why that is and we’ll get into those as we dissect the amazing BeBook Neo.","Unlike many of the other renowned eBook reader manufactures, Endless Ideas has successfully integrated user friendly features like touch screen and open market into the BeBook Neo. The genius of this is to allow for people to easily navigate the vast expanse of the eBook world outside of single store conformity that some eReaders make you use. Unfortunately that does seem to be the standard with many popular eBook readers. The BeBook Neo is here to change that though. We think that many people will find the unique differences of this eBook reader to quite appealing.","To begin lets touch on the physical side of things. The Neo has a comfortable easy to use physical design. It is compact for mobile use but large enough to be functional. There is a Wi-Fi switch looked on the left side for quick power saving while you’re just reading and not browsing the internet or downloading more books. From the top you extract the stylus for touch navigation. The volume control is located on the bottom along with the mini USB port, power /standby button, audio jack for headphones and SD card slot.","The navigational buttons are on the face right below the screen and they are set up as a circular three tier system. The outer tier has your menu button to quickly access the menu of any screen easily. On the same tier it has a previous, next and back button for flipping through pages and categories. The middle ring is for navigating the options in the menus and browser pages. Finally, the center button acts as your basic “enter” button like on your computer keyboard or phone for accessing what you have selected on this eBook reader.","The most prominent physical attribute on this eBook reader is of course the screen itself. It measures out as a six inch (diagonal) screen which is a fairly standard size for eBook readers. The grayscale is a sixteen which means that it has sixteen different shades of gray. How does that affect your reading experience? Well for just text it changes nothing. The nice wide range of 16 shades of gray comes into play with images. That means you get higher detailed cover art for your books and also broadens the spectrum of what you can browse on the internet. With built in Google browsers, not only can you search for eBooks but you can check out your friends online photo collections and view them in portrait or landscape. As a matter of fact, you can do anything in portrait or landscape. It’s not like an iPod where you can rotate and it automatically rotates the display (accelerometer technology) but you do have the option in the menu to change it at anytime you want.","The unique part of the screen is that it has the latest Wacom touch panel technology. Wacom is a worldwide company based out of Japan, with an EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) headquarters in Krefeld, Germany and the American headquarters in Vancouver, Washington. They’re a company mostly known for their graphics tablets used by artists. They also supply most of the graphical &#34;Penabled&#34; input technology used in the majority of tablet PCs.","The integration of this technology brought on a list of extras that you can do on your BeBook. First of all we want to clarify that although this is touch screen, you do have to use the pen to take advantage of the touch abilities. Your finger won’t work. It’s designed that way on purpose since fingers are too big to be as accurate as a stylus pen. Now that we’ve clarified that, you can grab your pen and jump right in to your favorite eBook. Wacom technology allows you to flick through the pages as you read but also annotate. This is especially nice for various reasons. For school books this is great for marking key points that you want to review just before the big test or annotate words you don’t know so you can utilize the “dictionary look up” function that the Neo has. For business you can annotate the key points of your presentation to ensure that you cover everything in your presentation. The list of uses for annotation is endless and on the BeBook Neo it works great.","Along with annotation you also can bookmark and annotate your favorite passages or mark where you left off from last night. In the menu you can jump straight to any annotation or bookmark. When the time comes to remove bookmarks or select parts that you annotated, that function is easily accessed in the same menu. The Wacom touch technology applies to the web browsing and note making features as well, for quick note making and easy browser navigation.","With the included USB cable you can easily copy any eBooks you already have on your computer to the BeBook. The BeBook shouldn’t have any compatibility issues so your entire collection is good to go. It does charge off a USB only so if you’re planning on traveling without your laptop there is a USB travel charger available. As far as accessories go there are also protective sleeves, replacement stylus pens, etc. Aside from dumping your eBooks from the computer to your BeBook you can access a worldwide eBook market via Wi-Fi. There isn’t 3G/4G or Bluetooth but Wi-Fi does the job just fine.","The other meaty difference between this reader and several of the other leading ones is the lack of open source. One of the issues with products like the Sony Reader, Nook, and Kindles are that they all have one big drawback in common. They all are almost exclusive to their own eBook stores save but a few formats that venture outside of their doors. Admittedly these stores are extensive and hold thousands of books but that pales in comparison to global internet sites around the world that the BeBook Neo gives you access to.","Endless Ideas created the Neo to be fully open source so that you can put any eBook on their eReader. They informed us that any source code information is available to the public so that this is possible. This for the most part won’t matter though since this BeBook is compatible with nearly every major eBook format in the world. It also is compatible with the majority of mainstream image formats for the internet browsing side of things.","There was so much to do on the Neo that we never got around to checking out any newspapers, magazines or blogs. However, Endless Ideas assured us that there is plenty of content for those that will want to utilize these features.","The Neo only has 512 MB of internal memory and some people could probably fill that pretty easily but for the average user that much will last a very long time. When you get to the point that you need more memory, you can get up to 16 GB of storage on an external SD card. That should be enough for anyone but you could always have multiples if all else fails.","This BeBook has about the same battery life as all other eBook readers. Most of the leading manufactures fall between 7000 and 8000 page turns. These numbers vary because battery life depends on so many variables. In an optimal environment the Neo got over 10,000 page turns from a single charge but the average user will mostly likely get around 7000 and 8000 unless all you do is read and turn pages. On the flip side though, a big plus for the BeBook, is the quick recharge time. Most other brands take about four hours but the Neo managed to shave off an entire hour and get it down to three. That one hour difference can make a big difference in any time crunch situation but is also convenient for everyday life.","Endless Ideas claims to have “speech to text” so that you can listen to your books but we were unable to find this feature. Perhaps they meant it would be in a firmware update down the road. They do however have MP3 compatibility and since most audio books are in MP3 format, you at least have that.","We couldn’t find any phone numbers available for technical support but there were plenty of online FAQs, manuals and documents. For specialized help they do have email support that is friendly and helpful with any problems that may occur. With the firmware loaded on, we didn’t run into any glitches or other issues that limited or prohibited use. The only user friendly issue really was the very short learning curve of getting to know the menus and navigation, which was barely an issue at all. There is a paperback version of the user manual as well as a file on the BeBook itself to help you overcome the learning curve. It is simple enough that it won’t be an issue really for most people. The only other user friendly issue really was the semi slow response of the controls and navigation.
