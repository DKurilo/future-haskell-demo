You are likely to spend a lot of money on a lot of devices that remain plugged in despite not being used.","Even with a modest video game play figure of 2 hours a day or 14 hours weekly, energy bills can grow to become the size of monthly payments. Worse, with many video game consoles offering various multimedia functions, these figures are likely to be even higher. The Xbox 360 and PS3 are likely to consume 3x as much energy during DVD, HD DVD or Blu-Ray Disc play than DVD, HD DVD and Blu-Ray Disc players alone."]},"id":"37ebc8c5-97dc-442e-a60a-aa4139b4d3ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["*Based on $0.15/kWh billing.","But, there is hope for a smaller energy bill that doesn t involve potential jail time. Best of all, most of these strategies can also extend the life of your video game console, audio and video equipment.","Below are some helpful strategies to conserve energy and reduce your power bill."," <strong>Done with it? Unplug it!</strong><br/>By simply unplugging your video game console when not in use, any and all energy leakage that may have occurred is avoided completely.","<strong>Power Strips</strong><br/>Power strips offer a similar functionality to simply unplugging a video game console. However, they only work if the power strip itself is turned off when not in use. When the power strip is turned on, some energy leakage is still possible, so remember to turn it off and keep it off when not in use.","<strong>Forget the Screensaver</strong><br/>Screensavers are intended to save computer and television screens from residual images and tube or other component burn outs, not save power. Whether the video game is in standby mode or completely turned off, it is still using power.","<strong>Less is More</strong><br/>Other health, social and work concerns aside, longer term video game use can make the hardware components perform less efficiently and consume more power as a result. This not only consumes more than the usual amount of energy over time, but also greatly reduces the life of the video game console.","<strong>Keep it Cool</strong><br/>Like most non-culinary electronics, high heat is a bad sign and generally means poor energy conservation and performance. Most video game consoles have third-party manufactured fans and cooling units to keep temperatures down, but taking other steps like regular dusting and vacuuming can also help maintain cooler temperatures.","By using just a few, or all, of these steps, energy savings are guaranteed and the lifespan of the video game console is generally increased. Best of all, these same strategies can be used for most consumer electronics, potentially saving you hundreds of dollars every year.","<br/> "]},"id":"65510b8f-7aa2-436e-955f-018df2eb1935","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_751","url":"/cutting-the-cost-of-gaming","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"derek-hardman","url":"/author/derek-hardman","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Derek Hardman","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"HTrkgmskHH5fB6s5MxxZSQ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-11-12T00:07:21Z","datePublished":"2008-11-12T00:07:21Z","name":"Cutting the Cost of Gaming","synopsis":"Though parents have a hard enough time convincing kids that lawns do, in fact, grow back and need to be mowed regularly, getting that point across when it comes to turning lights off and keeping windo","review":{},"strapline":"Though parents have a hard enough time convincing kids that lawns do, in fact, grow back and need to be mowed regularly, getting that point across when it comes to turning lights off and keeping windo","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-11-12T00:07:21Z","id":"ZE9T6FAEnAE9H9TBoFQgpm","meta":{"title":"Cutting the Cost of Gaming","description":" Though parents have a hard enough time convincing kids that lawns do, in fact, grow back and need to be mowed regularly, getting that point across when it comes to turning lights off and keeping"},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:50:09Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HPFiN2DEsqm9ye3P9ZRCj9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:50:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"751-cutting-the-cost-of-gaming.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/751-cutting-the-cost-of-gaming.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:50:09Z","id":"HPFiN2DEsqm9ye3P9ZRCj9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPFiN2DEsqm9ye3P9ZRCj9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cutting the Cost of Gaming","description":" Though parents have a hard enough time convincing kids that lawns do, in fact, grow back and need to be mowed regularly, getting that point across when it comes to turning lights off and keeping"},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HPFiN2DEsqm9ye3P9ZRCj9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:50:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"751-cutting-the-cost-of-gaming.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/751-cutting-the-cost-of-gaming.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:50:09Z","id":"HPFiN2DEsqm9ye3P9ZRCj9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPFiN2DEsqm9ye3P9ZRCj9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cutting the Cost of Gaming","description":" Though parents have a hard enough time convincing kids that lawns do, in fact, grow back and need to be mowed regularly, getting that point across when it comes to turning lights off and keeping"}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/articles/cutting-the-cost-of-gaming/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:50:09Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:50:09Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
