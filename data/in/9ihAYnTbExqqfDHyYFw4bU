Sounds interesting, right? While we can&#39;t definitively say consumers have embraced finance technology (fintech for short), they are curious and warming to the idea of making payments using proximity payment technologies. A variety of tech companies now offer technologies that enable wearable devices to process payments. These devices include rings, fitness bracelets, smartwatches and key rings. Banks and financial institutions are becoming compatible with this type of payment processing as these technologies evolve to support consumers’ desire to use wearable fintech devices.","Fintech wearables include such items as rings, smartwatches, even stickers that interact directly with payment processing technologies or alongside a mobile phone. The adoption of fintech has been off to a rocky start, and early adopters are not using these devices as much as industry experts predicted they would, so they may end up being dumped, if only temporarily, for more familiar and comfortable payment methods. In other works, a lot of smart watches are collecting dust until people find them useful enough to wear every day.","Millennials tend to jump on new technologies, while older consumers tend to distrust alternative and &#34;new&#34; payment methods until they&#39;re proven safe. Slowly, though, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/mobile-wallet-guide,news-20666.html\">mobile wallet</a> payments and other payment methods are becoming trusted ways of conducting secure transactions. Once convenience and technology meet, wearable tech will likely become commonplace.","Here is just a sampling of the technologies to watch:","<strong>NFC Ring</strong><br/>Near field communication (NFC) technologies allow proximity exchanges of information; smartphones use this technology to process payments from a mobile wallet. Right now, the ring can unlock mobile phones and smart door locks, and transfer data, such as images or contact information. This is a Kickstarter-funded company that offers a variety of ring styles for roughly $30 to 40. So far, practical application is limited, but in the future, this kind of wearable tech may be able to do some interesting things, such as pay for transactions like mobile wallets.","<strong>Apple Watch</strong><br/>These smartwatches have not caught on like Apple would have liked, but it is still an item to watch. Like other wearable tech, it needs to satisfy a perceived need before it will be widely adopted. Since mobile phones have become so prevalent, wearing a watch has become uncommon. But these watches do more than just display the time: Some versions perform functions previously limited to sports devices, such as tracking running pace and distance or reading your heart rate. While it may be more convenient to look at a watch than to pull out your mobile phone, it has some ways to go before it&#39;s adopted by the masses.","<strong>FitPay</strong><br/>This is a technology that adds contactless payment capabilities to wearable devices. FitPay doesn&#39;t provide the actual device, but rather the platform companies can acquire to add it to their wearable tech. Pagaré is one example. Its added contactless payment technology to the Pebble smartwatch. This is a new company, but with FitPay tech, companies can easily add payment technologies to their devices to greatly increase the odds of consumers using their devices more often. Some experts estimate that nearly 25 percent of millennials do not carry cash, so these types of technologies, if convenient, may take off soon.","<strong>Fitbit</strong><br/>Fitbit is already well known for its wearable fitness technology, but in May of 2016 they acquired Coin&#39;s wearable payment platform. Currently, Fitbit has not yet released a fitness device with contactless payment abilities. But it&#39;s easy to conclude that someday they will utilize the purchased technology.","<strong>bPay</strong><br/>Currently only available in the U.K., this technology can essentially turn nearly any device into a contactless payment device. It can even be applied as a sticker to any flat surface, including the back of a phone. It connects to prepaid accounts to process payments, such as a Visa, MasterCard or debit card accounts. This is a Barclays product, but you do not have to be a Barclays customer to use it. Currently, this tech is low priced and allows people the freedom and flexibility to add it to any device they want to connect the tech to.","While combining wearable technology and payment processing seems like the next logical step for tech companies after such innovations as the Fitbit, additional applications will become more widely available as convenient wearable tech is adopted. With companies such as FitPay and bPay providing simple-to-implement payment technologies, the market will likely discover the best uses for such technologies.","Someday (perhaps sooner than you think), you&#39;ll have a wearable device that provides you with access to your home, office, or gym; allows you to process transactions both online and point of sale; monitors your health (fitness, sleep, heart rate); and offers tools to increase your productivity, such as calendar alerts, password keepers, email alerts."]},"id":"355fc677-f7f2-4816-a1c2-4a229fb586ee","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10212","url":"/fintech-wearable-tech","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"pamela-s-stevens","url":"/author/pamela-s-stevens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Pamela S Stevens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"e9bBMEAQ9LLhA3c2cSq39Z","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-27T16:11:01Z","datePublished":"2016-10-27T16:11:01Z","name":"Wearable Tech + FinTech = Love","synopsis":"Wearable technology that allows you to pay for purchases without using your card or phone?
