It has an auto feed line, so you don&#39;t have to worry about bumping the trimmer on the ground to advance the line. The Greenworks 21052 has two handles to give you more control over the electric trimmer, which converts to an edger. The front handle is adjustable so you can find a comfortable grip and the upper handle is rotatable. This electric weed trimmer comes with a cutting swath of 15 inches so you can make quick work of large spaces. This, however, can be less appealing if you have small spaces you need to trim. The Greenworks 21052 also comes standard with a grass deflector.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/53833-greenworks-2105215.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBnEMX3ZERQKLZfuH4FSgH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"dBnEMX3ZERQKLZfuH4FSgH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBnEMX3ZERQKLZfuH4FSgH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"07dfb181-0a1f-42ff-bbc4-907f039e84f1","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The handle extends to make it easier to use if you&#39;re taller. You can adjust the telescoping boom coupler to lengthen the shaft and give you a more comfortable tool. The shortest the shaft can be is 42 inches and the most it extends is to 48 inches.","The Greenworks 21052 quickly converts into an edger. The edger guide mounts on to the front of the machine to help you follow along the perimeter of your lawn. The guide is pretty standard for this type of grass trimmer.","It comes with a cord retention device so your power cord doesn&#39;t come unplugged from your electric weed trimmer every time you move it. You can loop the power cord over a hook on the handle that helps your power cord stay connected.","The Greenworks 21052 is 7.3 pounds, which is heavy in comparison to many similar electric line trimmers. Much of the weight is in the head of the electric trimmer. The heavier weight may be deterrent for you if you are looking for a lighter electric trimmer.","This trimmer comes with a power switch and a trigger that rotates the string. The Greenworks 21052 doesn&#39;t come with a safety switch. If you have a problem with the electric string trimmer, you can release the trigger to stop the string from rotating. If you&#39;re worried about accidentally pushing the trigger, you can turn off the power.","The pole is straight to enable to you to get into smaller gaps such as under a deck. The curved shafts that sometimes come on weed whackers can make it more difficult to reach such places. All the electric weed trimmers we reviewed have straight shafts. The Greenworks 21052 head tilts in three different positions so you reach the places you need to trim.","The Greenworks 21052 uses standard 0.065-inch monofilament string. You can use the manufacturer&#39;s brand of string. This isn&#39;t necessary, however. As long as you use the standard 0.065-inch string, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem for your electric line trimmer. The Greenworks 21052 uses one string at a time.","The Greenworks 21052 comes with a bonus replacement spool of string. Of all the products we reviewed, this was the only electric string trimmer to include a bonus spool. This is a convenient because it means less time you&#39;ll have to spend obtaining string for your electric trimmer.","Be aware that this electric string trimmer doesn&#39;t come with a power cord. You&#39;ll have to supply that yourself. The user manual has a guide to help you find an extension cord that will work safely with your electric line trimmer. It gives the amp rating and total length of the extension cord they suggest you use. They don&#39;t recommend you use an extension cord that has more than a 12-amp rating. Greenworks also suggests you use an extension cord made for outdoor use, which the extension cord indicates with the letters &#34;WA.&#34;"]},"id":"919bbc05-0a20-49ae-adf2-c2c2330738ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"String Features"},"id":"9c08464e-4f39-4bf6-9a83-976969ca9c87","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/8DBP9L779SaVAnEE3ym8oL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This Greenworks electric weed cutter is tool-less.

If this happens, you&#39;ll need to unplug your trimmer and free the head from the weeds. Be sure to unplug the trimmer to avoid accidently injuring yourself while your fingers are near the cutting string. Long grass and weeds are more likely to wrap around the weed trimmer if you cut it at ground level. You may be able to avoid the problem by cutting down tall weeds a portion at a time.","One of the biggest problems with electric string trimmers in general is how ineffectively the string feeds from the trimmer. When we talked to the manufacturer about this common problem, they said it&#39;s typically because the string isn&#39;t properly wound onto the spool. Their suggestion is to use factory-wound spools to help avoid the problem. Even though the manufacturer discourages it, you can wind your own string on the spool. The user manual gives you some basic directions of how to wind the string on the spool. Since this is an automatic-feed electric string trimmer instead of a bump-head model, the string comes out when you press the trigger in the upper handle. If you try bumping the head of the trimmer on the ground to advance the string, you might damage the trimmer."]},"id":"3bcb34c0-aefe-40d7-a677-138ff4432463","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Warranty &amp; Support"},"id":"d760fe92-3337-4756-971c-a869779e4b75","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/RAk48NS4piZCbxAySrY4xL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Greenworks has knowledgeable customer service for their telephone support.
