The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-car-speakers\">Car Speakers</a> here</em>","The first feature to catch your eye when you see the Pyle PLG series of car speakers is the colors. There are bright yellow, bright blue, bright red and shiny chrome woofers. These woofers are contrasted with black and grey tweeter brackets, which seem overtly stylized. If car audio were a fashion show, these auto speakers would certainly draw the most attention. And for many people, the look of the speakers matters as much as the sound. Unfortunately, the audio quality doesn&#39;t match the style.","The frequency response range for the rear deck speakers is 45Hz to 22kHz, which lacks much of the bass frequencies but is otherwise average. The door speakers don&#39;t fare as well with a range of 85Hz to 20kHz, giving it the most narrow frequency response range among the speakers we reviewed. This was evident with the audio quality. Both speakers didn&#39;t score very high with sound quality. The bass is very thin and lifeless with the door speakers, and both speakers struggled with high frequencies. Still, despite having a lower sound quality than the best car speakers, these are still an upgrade over most factory installed speakers.","The best feature with the Pyle PLG speakers is the power handling. The 6 x 9 speakers can handle 225 watts of continuous power with a peak of 450. The door speakers have a continuous power handling rating of 100 watts with a peak of 200 watts. These are among the highest power handling ratings in our review, which means they are durable and can handle a significant amount of volume.","Another feature to consider is the four- and five-way speakers. Most four- and five-way speakers are designed to split up frequencies and extend the frequency response well beyond 20kHz. These tweeters don&#39;t push the frequency response higher, but they do provide a more balanced audio production than the PLG&#39;s two- and three-way speakers."]},"id":"c9636dd1-05db-49bf-880f-b2d0efb4e5dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8c0a6a82-e42f-44c8-9ab2-4382cbbfc6b0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pyle PLG series of car speakers will definitely turn some heads, whether it&#39;s because of the bright colors or the loud volume.
