Since 2015, we’ve tested a variety of internet-connected products, such as smart locks, video doorbells, DIY home security systems and thermostats. We use these testing experiences as a baseline for our evaluations of other equipment. As time and resources allow, we occasionally test new types of products, but there are still some circumstances for which we cannot conduct in-house tests. When testing isn’t possible, we conduct thorough research using the same standards we apply to our in-house tests, as is the case with smart garage door openers.","Our comparison includes garage door openers from the following manufacturers: Chamberlain, Craftsman, Genie, LiftMaster, RYOBI, Skylink and Sommer. As we selected products to evaluate, we limited the number of models we selected from popular brands such as Chamberlain and Genie as it would be very easy to build an entire comparison for either brand on its own. This allowed us to evaluate lesser-known brands for a more diverse comparison.","We looked over the user manual for each garage door opener and noted any functions that set it apart from the competition. We also checked out customer reviews to get a sense of whether people were satisfied with their openers. Lastly, we did a detailed cost analysis of garage door openers to give you a better idea of how much you should pay.","In addition, we consulted information from industry organizations, including<a href=\"http://www.garagewownow.com/\">GarageWowNow.com</a> from the Door &amp; Access Systems Manufacturers Association (DASMA) and resources from the International Door Association (IDA), which has an extensive list of major manufacturers. The IDA also has a useful<a href=\"https://www.doors.org/AboutIDA/MediaRoom/ConsumerLiterature/ConsumerSafetyGuide.aspx\">Consumer Safety Guide</a> with safety and maintenance tips.","<strong>How We Evaluated<br/></strong>","Due to installation requirements, we don’t conduct in-house testing of garage door openers at Top Ten Reviews. Instead, we research what makes each model unique and worth buying, primarily relying on customer experiences shared on the web through four retailers: Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe’s and Sears. We also read reviews on the manufacturers’ websites.","These sources included more than 5,300 customer reviews as of this writing. Our customer-satisfaction score combines the separate scores with a simple weighted average to retain the value of each individual customer review. This combined sample is more reliable than each source alone.","Crucially, customer reviews provide insight into products’ real-world reliability, their popularity and manufacturers’ customer service. However, there are caveats: Customer reviews are subjective, they’re often limited in scope, they lack technical benchmarks and they’re hard to find on less-popular, or dealer-installed, products.","In our evaluation of garage door openers, we found that Chamberlain is overwhelmingly the most popular brand and highly favored by most customer reviews. These high ratings extend to LiftMaster, which is Chamberlain’s dealer-installed brand. The highest-rated garage door openers in customer reviews were the Genie MachForce Connect, the Sommer Direct Drive, the Genie Chain Drive 500, the LiftMaster 8500W and the Chamberlain B970.","All of the units we evaluated would be acceptable for most people, with the exception of the RYOBI GD126, which has fairly poor reviews. However, we kept this model in our comparison because of its unique modular accessories.","<strong>How Much do Garage Door Openers Cost?</strong>","You can expect to pay between $130 and $300 for a garage door opener, with most models costing about $200. The most expensive openers usually include extra accessories and smartphone controls, though most openers work with a smartphone if you buy a Wi-Fi adapter, such as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews--20\">myQ</a>. The types of garage door openers in increasing order of average cost are as follows: chain, belt, screw, direct drive and jackshaft.","Although you can replace a garage door opener on your own, doing so is more difficult than most DIY projects, so it’s important to follow the installation instructions. If you’re not confident that you can replace the opener on your own, you should consider hiring a professional, and that further increases your costs. You can also expect to pay more if you’re replacing a garage door in addition to the opener.","<strong>Choosing a Garage Door Opener</strong>","Horsepower<br/>If you’re replacing an existing garage door opener in your home, the simplest method for finding the right horsepower is to check the rating of the unit in your garage and get something with equal or higher power. Most homes have single- or double-car sectional garage doors made of aluminum or steel, which is the most affordable type of garage door. These doors are relatively light, so a motor with rating of 1/2 horsepower is more than sufficient. While 1/3-horsepower motors are available, they can wear out faster than those with 1/2 horsepower in such settings, so it’s a good idea to invest a little extra in a more capable garage door opener.","If you have an oversize door; one made of a heavier material, such as wood; or a one-piece door, you should consider getting something stronger. In these cases, look for a garage door opener motor rated at between 3/4 horsepower and 2 horsepower. There’s nothing stopping you from using a 2-horsepower opener on a smaller door, which can make for smoother operation and a longer service life, but high-horsepower units cost more.","Lift Systems<br/>The lift system determines how smoothly and quietly an opener moves the garage door. Residential garage door openers usually use one of five lift systems: chain, belt, screw, direct drive or jackshaft. One is not necessarily better than the others, but each system has its strengths."]},"id":"66e1f17b-f684-484e-92c1-cf2c6b6d7d93","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong> Chain</strong>: A chain-driven lift system uses a durable steel chain, much like that of a bicycle. This type of system is very reliable, but it can be rather loud. It is the most common lift system for garage doors and is generally the most affordable, costing $167 on average.","<strong>Belt</strong>: A belt-driven lift system uses a reinforced rubber belt, which reduces vibration. As such, it is much quieter than a chain-driven system. Belt lift systems are the second most common type and cost around $230.","<strong>Screw</strong>: Screw-driven lift systems attach a long screw to the motor to move the garage door. These systems are powerful, fast and relatively quiet, and they require less maintenance than typical chain- or belt-driven systems. Genie and Overhead Door are two popular brands of screw-driven systems. Based on our research of Genie’s line, you can expect to pay $244, on average, for a screw-driven garage door opener.","<strong>Direct Drive</strong>: Unlike chain- and belt-driven systems, where the motor remains stationary while moving a chain, a direct-drive motor moves while the chain stays in place. Because of this, the only moving part is the gear the motor uses to move while lifting the door. To our knowledge, only one company makes direct-drive garage door openers: Sommer. The company claims that the motors are more efficient and quieter than any other type of opener. However, this is one of the most expensive types of openers we’ve found, costing $286 on average.","<strong>Jackshaft</strong>: This is another type of direct-drive lift system that mounts onto the side of a torsion-spring-equipped garage door; it turns the spring unit directly instead of moving a trolley. This type of opener is very compact and frees up ceiling space. You can’t use jackshaft lift systems with extension-spring garage doors, the most common type of garage door. The unique design makes jackshaft the most expensive type of garage door opener, costing around $400 on average. Both LiftMaster and Chamberlain have jackshaft garage door openers."],"type":"ul"},"id":"d46ae46a-7b12-4d68-95d8-e36958a2f691","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Remote Controls<br/>When you buy a door opener, look for one that comes with the controllers you need. Generally speaking, the remote clips onto the visor in your vehicle. If you have multiple vehicles, make sure you get a unit for each vehicle that uses the garage. Among the units we reviewed, all except the LiftMaster 8500W and the Genie Chain Drive 500 come with two remote controls.","If your car has a built-in garage door control that uses HomeLink or Car2U, you usually don’t need a remote, only a compatible garage door opener. Most garage door opener brands support HomeLink, and a few support Car2U. However, you may need to buy an adapter if your opener lacks built-in compatibility.","Smartphone &amp; Smart Home Controls<br/>A smartphone app can make it easier to use your garage door, and it also lets you check if the door is still open when you’re away from home. If you want to control your garage door opener with a smartphone, there are two options: built-in Wi-Fi or a separate Wi-Fi adapter. Most garage door brands – including Chamberlain, LiftMaster, CRAFTSMAN, Genie, Mighty Mule, Skylink and RYOBI – have models with built-in Wi-Fi, though these are more expensive than base models without Wi-Fi.","If you have an older garage door opener and simply want to add smartphone controls, you can buy a Wi-Fi adapter such as Chamberlain myQ, Gogogate2 or Nexx Garage. These units are essentially universal remotes for garage door openers, so you just program them to control your door to get Wi-Fi functionality.","Integrating your garage door into a smart home system gives you another tool for managing your home. For example, your smart locks, thermostat and lights can react to your garage door as you come and go from your home. Please verify that your garage door opener will work with a smart garage door controller before you buy."]},"id":"6c776a75-fde3-4591-afc9-ec48580ced32","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews--20\">Chamberlain MyQ</a> ($80) is compatible with Nest, Alarm.com, Honeywell, Tend, XFINITY and Wink.

We found that the best garage door openers have a lifetime motor warranty, though 10 years is acceptable in most cases, since units last around 15 years on average.","Lift System Warranty: While some manufacturers, such as LiftMaster and<a href=\"/chamberlain-ultra-quiet-review\">Chamberlain</a>, offer lifetime warranties on belts and chains, you’ll usually get between one and three years of coverage from other companies. They offer shorter coverage because you can often replace the lift system without buying an entire new garage door opener.","Parts Warranty: The parts warranty applies to remotes, wall switches, keypads and other components of the garage door opener. The parts warranty should last one to five years, matching the warranty on the lift system in most cases."],"type":"ul"},"id":"3277436e-5aee-43cd-a374-a136227f9c1e","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Check the manual that comes with your garage door opener to see if there are any stipulations you must meet before you make a warranty claim.<br/>","Keypads<br/>Although each unit we reviewed comes with a control panel for the interior of your garage, not all have keypads, which allow you to type in a code to control the door from outside. While this isn’t an essential feature, it can make it easier to open and close the door as you do chores around the house and yard.","Lighting<br/>You can expect to find two lights in most garage door openers, with newer models often incorporating LED lights. While these lights are sufficient to help you get from your home to your car, they may not be bright enough if you’re working in your garage. Most garage door openers automatically activate and shut off lights using motion detectors and a timer. The length of time the light stays on varies according to how it is programmed. In most instances, you don’t need more than a few minutes from the time you leave the car to when you enter your home.","If a light burns out, follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for the appropriate replacement light bulbs to use, because some LEDs can interfere with the connection between your remote and the garage door opener. You can also buy<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Genie-Garage-Door-Opener-Light/dp/B01IHHVZTW/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews--20\">LED bulbs made specifically for garage door openers</a>, which comply with <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f73b777c789e93dd0c78cbdc639bfdf1&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5\">Part 15 of the FCC rules regarding wireless interference</a>.","Safety<br/>Most garage door openers come with two primary safety features: automatic reverse and infrared beam sensors. These features allow the garage door opener to detect if a person or an object is blocking the door as it closes. Upon detecting something, the motor will reverse direction to prevent an accident. Likewise, these features prevent the door from moving until the obstruction has been removed from the door’s path. A third safety feature, motion sensor lighting, illuminates the garage automatically to help you move between your car and the house.","Security<br/>Garage doors are designed to prevent unauthorized access to your vehicle and your home, so garage door openers have two standard security features: rolling codes and a lock mode. As the name implies, rolling codes change over time. This feature allows the remote in your car to communicate with the opener using a unique verification code each time, thus reducing the likelihood that someone could intercept the code and use it later to access your home. This is also why your neighbor’s garage door opener doesn’t activate when you use your remote.","Lock mode, as the name implies, prevents the garage door opener from responding to remotes and keypads when active. You can activate this feature using the interior control panel in your garage for extra security at night, or while you’re on vacation.","Another helpful security feature uses a timer to close your garage door automatically after each use. You might have to activate this feature on a new garage door opener, but it can add another layer of security to your garage. Among the garage door openers we reviewed, Chamberlain, LiftMaster, Genie and Craftsman offer the timer-to-close feature.","<strong>How Do I Program My Garage Door Opener?</strong><br/>","It’s important to read the manual or watch tutorial videos before installing and programming your garage door opener. Each brand uses its own control layout, so you can expect to find the programming button in the same place on each model of that brand.","For your convenience, we’ve compiled a list with links to each company’s video tutorials for programming and installation:","<strong>Chamberlain &amp; LiftMaster</strong> – You can find video tutorials for both Chamberlain and LiftMaster on the Chamberlain Group<a href=\"https://support.chamberlaingroup.com/s/global-search/%40uri#t=Videos&amp;sort=relevancy\">support website</a>.

These videos cover a variety of topics, such as installation, remote and keypad programming, HomeLink, and Aladdin Connect smartphone setup.","<strong>RYOBI</strong> – RYOBI has a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce_4wJoK8P4\">tutorial video on YouTube</a> that covers the entire installation process, including the programming of the remotes. The video’s description has links to each installation step for quick access.","<strong>Skylink</strong> – Skylink provides video tutorials on its website, as well as<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3jB83dNDLPbP_D2UzpafTcGajiKfApNj\">on YouTube</a>, for installing the garage door opener. You can find programming instructions toward the end of each installation video.","<strong>Sommer</strong> – The Sommer website has a<a href=\"https://www.sommer-usa.com/videos.html\">selection of video tutorials</a>, but the most relevant to DIY installation and programming is the installation video for the Synoris garage door opener at the bottom of the page.
