Luckily, there are tons of programs and tools to help novice and veteran writers alike stay organized and produce high-quality writing. Below, we share a variety of tools to help you through the entire writing process:","For learning how to type. If you hunt and peck at your keyboard, it may be beneficial to learn how to type before setting out to write your best-seller. There are free websites, such as <a href=\"https://www.typingclub.com/\">TypingClub</a>, that teach you the basics of typing, or you can pay for entire courses through sites like <a href=\"https://kaz-type.com/\">KAZ</a>. If you prefer to download a program onto your computer, check out our <a href=\"/best-typing-software\">typing software reviews</a>.","For organizing. Many writers have brilliant novel or screenplay ideas in their heads but never get them down on paper because they find it’s difficult to organize everything. There are programs out there designed specifically to help you organize your entire writing project – including tasks, plot points, character info and everything else relevant to your story – in a single place. <a href=\"https://gingkoapp.com/\">Gingko</a> is one such program. If you want something made for more of a general task management, consider <a href=\"https://www.meistertask.com/\">MeisterTask</a> or <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a>. Once you have all the logistics written out, it should clear the path for you to focus on writing.","For minimizing distractions. Whether it’s a new email or a neighbor knocking on your door, distractions are everywhere, and they are the enemy of writers. Although we can’t help you with nosy neighbors, we can recommend some applications and other tools to help maximize your focus. Browser extensions, such as <a href=\"http://www.mindfulbrowsing.org/\">Mindful Browsing</a>, limit the type of websites you can access or simply remind you to stretch and get back to work. We also recommend using focusing playlists designed to help you stay energized and on task. Websites like <a href=\"https://brain.fm/\">Brain.fm</a> work, as does a quick search on your favorite music streaming service.","For checking grammar and improving vocabulary. Writing a great story is tough enough without having to worry if you misused a word or used incorrect grammar. Thankfully, there are websites ready to help you check your work before sending it off to a publisher. They can check for incorrect punctuation, misused words and spelling errors as well as grammatical errors. Plenty of these sites, including <a href=\"http://www.whitesmoke.com/free-online-checker\">WhiteSmoke</a>, are free, though you can pay for a service, such as <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/grammar-check\">Grammarly</a>, should you wish. Some of these sites can also check for plagiarism, which is handy.","For sharing your work. Once you’ve polished your masterpiece, you’ll want somewhere to post it. If blogging is your thing, check out <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> or <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/\">Blogger</a>. If you prefer to create a website for your portfolio, check out sites like <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\">Squarespace</a> or <a href=\"https://www.weebly.com/\">Weebly</a> or hire a professional website designer to make a custom site for your work."]},"id":"53c935f2-2006-4843-8597-5900981b17b3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"67fce5da-dd4f-4574-8456-954647d8aebf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XWTW7MU/?&tag=ttr_creative-writing-software-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|33[art|NA[pid|54628[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">WriteItNow</a>","<a href=\"https://www.powerstructure.com/products/power-structure\">Power Structure</a>","<a href=\"https://store3.esellerate.net/store/checkout/CustomLayout.aspx?s=STR0962565285&amp;pc=&amp;page=OnePageCatalog.htm\">Storyist</a>","<a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\">Scrivener</a>","<a href=\"https://www.novel-software.com/\">The Novel Factory</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ashley-Software-Writers-Blocks/dp/B078VHB2RC/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Writer&#39;s Blocks</a>","<a href=\"http://www.linkconnector.com/ta.php?lc=017408000010004693&lc_pid=Promo-17401&url=https://www.writersstore.com/dramatica-pro-story-development-software/&atid=creativewritingsoftware&lcpf=3&lcpi=17401\">Dramatica Pro</a>","<a href=\"http://marinersoftware.com/products/contour/?ap_id=Purch\">Contour</a>","<a href=\"https://www.ulyssesapp.com/\">Ulysses</a>","<a href=\"https://masterwriter.com/songwriters/purchase/\">MasterWriter</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5e03901e-5076-4ba4-bd22-f65dc4e34834","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_33","url":"/best-creative-writing-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2005-09-01T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2016-08-04T18:12:08Z","name":"Best Creative Writing Software","synopsis":"You can become a better writer with creative writing software.
