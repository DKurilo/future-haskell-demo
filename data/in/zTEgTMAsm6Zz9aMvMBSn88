Unlike Kinetic bike trainers, Nashbar has no guarantee that their trainers won&#39;t leak, but Nashbar does offer a one-year warranty. Should you want to return the bike trainer after the one-year mark, Nashbar will send you a Nashbar Gift Card with the value of the returned item. When we contacted Nashbar, representatives were kind and courteous, and they worked quickly to answer our questions.","If you&#39;re willing to spend a little more money, you can purchase this trainer with an accessory kit that includes a front wheel riser block, a floor mat to reduce noise and to keep your floor from getting scuffed, and a handlebar shifter to more accurately tune resistance.","The Nashbar Fluid is less expensive than a lot of fluid trainers on the market, and it provides the reliability and stability necessary for a good bike trainer stand. Progressive resistance means that you won&#39;t have to mess with toggles or shifters in order to raise the resistance. Overall, the Nashbar Fluid provides a simple yet productive workout on a sturdy and cost-effective machine."]},"id":"5a5c0f7c-1500-42c9-9d8f-ce23845fb8bc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68567","url":"/nashbar-fluid-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T15:50:31Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T15:50:31Z","name":"Nashbar Fluid","synopsis":"Finding a durable yet low-noise bike trainer at the right price can be difficult.
