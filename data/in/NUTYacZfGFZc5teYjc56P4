The RC helicopter has a single 9.5-inch rotor that can tilt independently in any direction.

At 240 mAh, the battery is bigger than those found in many of the CP&#39;s competitors, but it depletes quicker because it&#39;s driving so much machinery – the tilting rotor, the electronic gyroscope and so on. You can expect to get about six and a half minutes of continuous flight time out of the Super CP. Since it takes about 45 minutes to recharge, you can have fun in short stints indoors all day long, but if you&#39;re planning on a day trip somewhere, it might be worth buying an extra battery or two online."]},"id":"b94301c0-1a21-4715-822a-b5ee011d52eb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Flight Features"},"id":"d749ec56-b4e5-4d26-81d5-18d388999e64","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/afErDpEKFTXSUCud3pvAoP.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Unlike many other remote control helicopters, the Walkera Super CP doesn&#39;t have an external gyroscopic stabilizer.
