The Chill headphones are the most cost-efficient stereo headphones in this line and they are a bargain for the bass quality they provide. We enjoyed the fit and the feel of the lightweight headphones but identified that some users with larger heads discovered that the headphones were uncomfortable, tight and did not properly cover their ears. The headphones have a 40mm driver, 32 ohm impedance and a frequency response of 20 Hz-20 kHz. The cord is 4 feet long which provides a comfortable length for users to move while listening to music.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/5181/stereo-headphon-1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qG92pcmsqStvFqmxLtjjmP.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"qG92pcmsqStvFqmxLtjjmP","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qG92pcmsqStvFqmxLtjjmP.jpg","alt":""},"id":"48ba81d3-33c1-4de4-a672-027252688de9","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>The Tour</strong><br/>These stereo headphones fold into a very compact shape and size for easy storage and travel. They are equipped with a pad on the top of the band so they can rest more comfortably on your head. The Wicked Tour Driver is 40mm, its impedance is 32 ohm, and it offers a frequency of 20-20,000Hz. The cord length is 4 feet long and provides the length needed for you, as the user, to move around while wearing the headphones.","The ear cushions have been designed in a circle and sit on your ears and instead of covering your entire ear. They provide a padded suction around your ear canal which helps them dull outside noise and feel like you are in a world of your own. Depending upon the volume at which you listen to your music, some people around you will be able to hear what you are listening to, but even at a comfortable sound level we were able to listen to music without disturbing those around us. Overall, we found the design to be comfortable and functional for a wide variety of users and purposes. They come in red/blue, blue/red, and black/gold.","<strong>The Reverb</strong><br/>As the most expensive choice in the Wicked stereo headphone line, the Reverb headphones truly deliver the features that attest to their higher price being worth it. The padded headphones cover your entire ear, offer more padding across the top of the band and provide a 6 foot cord which is longer, providing the user with more mobility during use. Like the other two models, the Reverb offers a 40mm driver, 32 ohm impedance and 20 Hz- 20,000 Hz.","Depending on how loud you listen to your music, these will help create a world of your own. While they don t cancel out noise completely, they do a decent job and again, it all depends on the volume at which you listen to music. People around you may be able to hear what you are listening to if you keep the volume at a higher level; we found that if you listen to it on a lower level (unless people intently try to listen) they won t be able to pick up on the sound. The stereo headphones provide a higher quality bass than many headphones and an excellent contrast within the music.","The lightweight design of the headphones allowed us to wear them for an entire work day and never feel the repercussion of having something heavy on our heads. They provided an excellent fit and we were never worried about them falling off. We didn t mind the fake leather/plastic feel and concluded that the headphones are well worth their price.","Each of the Wicked Audio stereo headphones were inspired by graffiti-style art. Whether you are a fan of graffiti or not, most people can get into the designs of the headphones. They are all very affordable and although they do not provide the most powerful sound quality, state-of-the-art design or additional accessories like other top stereo headphones, they provide a decent sound quality and designs that many people will be thrilled with.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"157ec4c2-d2ed-4550-8719-adb14ba298c6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5181","url":"/stereo-headphones-alternative-options","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-jarrett","url":"/author/jennifer-jarrett","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Jarrett","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"to2nPyy7e6PruwriKDDxWG","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-11-16T17:55:56Z","datePublished":"2010-11-16T17:55:56Z","name":"Stereo Headphones: Alternative Options","synopsis":"If you are looking for an alternative to expensive stereo headphones, we suggest you check out an edgy solution: Empire Brand’s Wicked Audio stereo headphones.","review":{},"strapline":"If you are looking for an alternative to expensive stereo headphones, we suggest you check out an edgy solution: Empire Brand’s Wicked Audio stereo headphones.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-05-14T16:51:22Z","id":"xVMsSN3L4evjiqWeHQUnfi","meta":{"title":"Stereo Headphones: Alternative Options","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
