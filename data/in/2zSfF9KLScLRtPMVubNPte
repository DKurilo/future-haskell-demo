But that is not always the case, and the Impecca IMPIWA12KSFP proves just that. It offers a great array of high-tech comfort options, with a price point that’s sure to please even the most frugal budget hunters.","This 12,000 BTU wall air conditioner is perfect for rooms that are 450 to 550 square feet, which equates to a range of about 21 by 21 feet to about 23 by 24 feet. With four-way directional airflow, three cooling speeds and three fan-only speeds, your comfort is highly customizable. The dehumidifier portion can remove about 1.2 liters of moisture every hour, to make sure your room doesn’t retain the muggy quality that accompanies so many summers.","But where this Impecca wall air conditioner really shines is with its added features. This ENERGY STAR qualified unit has a number of functions that will ultimately save you money on your electric bill. The energy saver mode switches the unit to fan-only or off when your preset temperature is reached, and the 24-hour timer lets you program the unit to kick on just before you arrive home from work, for example. And with the auto-restart mode, the unit will turn back on to the most recent settings after a power outage, ensuring that you’ll start cooling off again in no time. There’s also a sleep mode that increases the temperature slightly at night, when the surrounding air typically cools off.","The included “micro-pro” electrostatic fiber filter is made from active carbon, which is capable of eliminating odors, like ammonia, and deactivating others, like formaldehyde. It also traps more common airborne nuisances, like cigarette smoke, pet dander and dust. The Impecca IMPIWA12KSFP is equipped with a “Change Filter” alert, so you’ll never have to remember when to change or clean the filter yourself.","The remote is another convenience; besides being able to adjust the temperature from a distance, it also has a “Personal Mapping Temperature Sensor” built into it, which allows the wall AC unit to pick up the ambient temperature from where the remote is placed, not from a sensor on the unit itself. This wall AC unit operates at just 52 decibels, ensuring you won&#39;t be disturbed by unnecessary noise.","Unfortunately, support options from Impecca are a bit sparse. The product manual is linked from the manufacturer’s website, but the link is broken and doesn’t produce the manual. The customer service help line is available during business hours, Monday through Thursday, and the email contact form promises a response within one to two business days.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"a50c1182-c954-4831-9849-c8970535bd4e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58552","url":"/impecca-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-04T21:51:11Z","datePublished":"2014-01-04T21:51:11Z","name":"Impecca IMPIWA12KSFP","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
