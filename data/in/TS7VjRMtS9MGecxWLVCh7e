The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\"><em>top-load washing machines</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Whirlpool Traditional WTW4850XQ top-load washer has a smaller capacity washtub that other models, but it offers a great combination of wash cycles and settings. It&#39;s also an energy-efficient and quiet washing machine.","The wash basket on the Whirlpool Traditional is white porcelain. This material is generally less durable than stainless steel tubs, but the smooth surface means less chance of buttons or zippers snagging. The capacity is on the smaller end, at 3.4 cubic feet, but you can count on it to handle an average load of laundry.","You can choose from 12 cycles, three soil levels and five temperature settings. In addition to different levels of normal cycles, you also have convenient options for bulky items or a quick wash for when you need to do a fast load. There are also five washer options, including settings like extra rinse, soak and a setting that will automatically put in fabric softener.","This top-loader washing machine also uses Whirlpool&#39;s Fabric Sense. This wash feature will adjust the temperature, time and speed that will work best for a load, according to what cycle and fabric settings you choose.","One of the best features for any heavily used home appliance is an Energy Star qualification. This lets you spend less money and use less energy every year than you would if you were using the same type of appliance without the rating. Running this machine will cost an estimated $15 and use about 144 kilowatt-hours of energy a year. Whirlpool has also built this top loader to work quietly, so you can install it on upper floors without worrying about whether or not you&#39;re disturbing people downstairs.","The warranty for this top-loading washing machine isn&#39;t as great as its other features. Whirlpool&#39;s warranties its top-load washers for only one year. However, you can easily find the warranty information, user manual and other documents for download from the website. Contacting the company isn&#39;t too difficult, either. You have the option of using the phone, an online form or the live chat feature."]},"id":"f8469304-5735-44e2-a785-4ec140fd1453","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0693686d-7961-4438-825d-e41b74738b03","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Traditional WTW4850XQ top-load washing machine has a great balance of wash cycles and options.
