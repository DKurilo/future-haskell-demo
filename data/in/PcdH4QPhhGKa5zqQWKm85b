A land of alpine mountains, ancient dark forests, bustling cities and delicious food. This fascinating country is filled with rich history, culture and natural beauty. <a href=\"/software/articles/mastering-the-german-accent/\">As you learn German</a> words and phrases so you can communicate, you may also want to consider visiting one or more of these five natural wonders unique to this beautiful country.","<strong>Wadden Sea Mud Flats<br/></strong>The northern coast of Germany consists mainly of the Wattenmeer tidal mudflats, the world’s largest unbroken area of mudflats. This costal wetland is a protected national park and is home to more than 3,200 animal species including birds, crabs, mussels, seals and starfish. The mudflats are flooded twice a day when the tide rolls in, between the system of channels and islands, providing fresh food for the animals. In autumn, millions of migratory birds gather along the coast, providing a spectacular view.","There are plenty of attractions and resorts along the coast and you can swim in the sea, walk along the beaches and relax. You can even take a horse-drawn carriage and visit the island of Sudfall. If you are in pretty good shape and have an adventurous streak, you can sign up for guided mud flat walking. These intensive hikes let you walk along the exposed ocean floor, often wading through waist-high mud or water to reach the various islands in the Wadden Sea at low tide.","<strong>Barbarossa Cave<br/></strong>This enormous cave is located near the village of Rottleben in east-central Germany. The Barbarossa Cave is composed primarily of gypsum which hangs from the ceiling and walls much like sheets of wallpaper. The large caverns and grottos cover an area of 15,000 square meters and stretch about 1 kilometer. There are even crystal-clear lakes that are colored with an iridescent green because of the gypsum.","This underground attraction has formed over the past 200,000 years and has daily guided tours. According to legend, Emperor Fredrick I (Barbarossa) sleeps somewhere in the cave and wakes every 100 years and sends his gnome out to see if the ravens have stopped flying around the surrounding Kyffhauser mountains. If they still are, then Barbarossa will return to his slumber. But if the ravens have ceased to fly, then he will wake and return to bring peace and harmony to the world. Emperor or no, this cave is a natural wonder worth seeing.","<strong>Teutoburg Forest</strong><br/>This beautiful forest in northwest Germany holds historical significance to the German people as a decisive battle between the Roman Empire and the Germanic tribes was fought there in 9 A.D. While you can visit the various museums that inform you all about the battle, take some time to explore this beautiful region on foot.","A great choice for hiking in the Teutoburg Forest is the Hermannsweg Trail. This trail is 220 km long, but can easily be broken up into enjoyable day hikes or extended for a few days thanks to easy access from a multitude of access points along the trail. The Teutoburg Forest is divided between two natural parks –TERRA.vita and Eggegebirge – and there is plenty to see and enjoy. The manmade trails are well maintained and the forest is particularly breathtaking in autumn when the leaves change color.","<strong>Breitachklamm Gorge<br/></strong>Carved by the river Breitach over thousands of years, Breitachklamm Gorge is a beautiful natural wonder that has a dual beauty. In the warmer months you are surrounded by green trees and waterfalls, and in the winter you are treated to an ice palace of snow and humongous icicles. Located near Tiefenbach, Bavaria, this amazing canyon is easily accessible and can take the better part of a day to explore if you choose. There is a manmade trail, complete with guard rails, that is easily navigated. Being surrounded by falling water means that you will definitely get wet, and in the summer this is a refreshing way to explore and enjoy the natural beauty of Germany.","<strong>The Black Forest<br/></strong>Last, but not least, the majestic Black Forest can be found in southwest Germany, nestled against the Rhine valley. You can start your journey into this beautiful forest region from Freiburg or from Baden-Baden. While the name alone conjures up visions of dark, spooky trees and gingerbread houses with witches inside, the Black Forest region is home to many vineyards, traditional villages and bright, sunny weather. Finding trails to day hike or bike on is no problem in the Black Forest area, and you can be out among the pines and firs of this legendary forest on no time.","<a href=\"/software/articles/germany-know-before-you-go/\">Your visit to Germany</a> doesn’t have to be confined to just cities and villages. Take some time to look up these natural wonders and try to fit one or more into your itinerary to round out your stay.
