You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Garmin separates its navigation GPS units into three series. The Garmin Nuvi 44LM is a member of the Essential series and consists of the tools and features you will need to navigate to your destination safely and accurately. While it is a basic GPS unit, you&#39;ll find that it has a few advanced features such as lane assistance and a speed-limit indicator.","First off, the screen size on the Nuvi 44LM is on the small side, at 4.3 inches measured diagonally. It has a screen resolution of 480 x 272 pixels. While the images are clear, the display is not as crisp as those on the more advanced models that have twice as many pixels. You can only keep this unit horizontal because it does not have the ability to change orientation.","When you purchase the Nuvi 44LM, it comes with map updates for the life of the GPS unit. You can update the maps four times a year for free to help you keep your maps up to date. This Garmin model does not come with traffic updates. It doesn&#39;t have Garmin&#39;s Real Directions either, which uses landmarks and buildings to help navigate. However, this GPS unit will read street names, making it easier for you to navigate. The Nuvi 44LM has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that charges in the car, but it can last for up to two and a half hours away from a power source. This GPS system also has a slot for a microSD card so that you can load and store other maps and optional GPS navigators&#39; voices.","The Nuvi 44LM is preloaded with five million points of interests, such as restaurants and stores. You can set up to 100 different waypoints. Waypoints are locations that you choose to save to navigate to again. Whether it&#39;s a favorite restaurant or a meeting place, you can save that location to your GPS system for future reference. One of the limitations of this car GPS unit is that you can&#39;t save specific routes. The Nuvi 44LM won&#39;t predict your route based on your driving history like some of the more advanced models will do. Despite these limitations, the Nuvi 44LM can do a few advanced tasks such as telling you what lane to be in when turning and letting you create routes that avoid certain obstacles such as toll roads and ferries. These GPS units also have a speed-limit indicator that will display your current speed and the posted speed for most roads on the map."]},"id":"64140fe0-f7f3-4f22-9d9a-9ed3c1a3d4da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"774399d7-6dfc-4e8d-a64c-8d17359fa348","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nuvi 44LM is a basic car GPS unit in the Essential series, but it still has a few of the advanced features to make it worthwhile.
