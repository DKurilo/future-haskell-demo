The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS Trackers</a> here.</em>","Small enough for a child&#39;s hands, and light enough to not be a burden, the Twin Mask MT-90 is a mini GPS tracker and one of the smallest we looked at. Easily concealed or attached to clothing, this device is less than two inches long and weighs about 1.5 ounces. As a tracking device, the MT-90 is accurate up to 50 feet. This means that in an emergency, when you locate your child, they will be within 50 feet of where the GPS tracker says they are. That is a standard margin of error, but most of the devices we looked at can hone in even closer. Part of the problem may lie in the fact that many GPS devices for children use wireless carriers to help pinpoint a child&#39;s location, and with the Twin Mask MT-90, you choose the wireless network based on which SIM card you choose to buy for the device. This can also help cut down on the cost because you can prepay for the SIM and the MT-90 doesn&#39;t have any monthly fees. The MT-90 can use either the GPS system, or, with a SIM card, the GPS system in conjunction with a wireless network.","In addition to the mediocre accuracy, the Twin Mask MT-90 has an abysmal battery life when you are actively using it. If you choose to follow your child in real-time and set the tracker to update every five minutes, then the internal rechargeable battery only lasts half of a day. This is not much and only makes sense if you are monitoring your child during very specific times of the day. You would be better off programming the GPS tracker to update every hour or so to get more battery life. In stand-by mode, the device will last three days.","Should your child feel threatened or scared, the MT-90 comes with a panic button that when pressed can alert you immediately. You can program five phone numbers into the device and it will send alert messages from the panic button via email and text to all five. The device can send out other alerts as well, such as zone, speed limit and low battery alerts. This device allows five phone numbers to text the tracking device and receive coordinates. The MT-90 is not equipped with a mic or speaker and lacks the capability for two-way speech.","Megastek, the manufacturer, uses a third-party company for the user-interface. While it is web-based, you have to install a plugin in order to use the user interface. The company doesn&#39;t have any smartphone apps, but you can query the tracking device from any phone by text message to receive its coordinates.","Even though Megastek is located in Hong Kong, the company responded swiftly to our emails and was very helpful. Be aware that the company does have a phone number for the headquarters, but it is an international number. Email will be the easiest way to contact the company."]},"id":"1b8d6554-00fc-4820-88b8-ce0651e92e31","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a09128c-0535-45a4-b5c7-4436b82e045c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Twin Mask MT-90 is a mini GPS tracker that is small, easy to conceal and has a panic button that can alert five different phone numbers in an emergency.
