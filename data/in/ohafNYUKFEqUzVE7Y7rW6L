Nothing tastes more delicious than perfectly seared steak, caramelized pineapple, smoked salmon or corn on the cob straight from the grill.","When searching for a BBQ grill there are a lot of options to consider. Size, mobility, fuel type and color are all options to consider. The three main options are generally charcoal, gas and <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared BBQ grills</a>. Here are the pros and cons of each to help you decide which is best for your barbequing needs.","<strong>Charcoal Grills</strong>","Pros: Charcoal grills are some of the cheapest to purchase with many models under $100. These grills are generally lightweight and bring home the delicious open-flame, smoky flavor just like if you were cooking over a campfire. Since <a href=\"/home/articles/gas-vs.-charcoal-which-is-better/\">charcoal grills</a> use briquettes or wood chips to burn, the flame gets really hot, which is great for searing meats, such a steak.","Cons: While these are the least expensive grills, you have to factor in the cost of charcoal. If you are cooking for a large crowd, you will need to replenish coals every hour or so, contributing to the higher fuel costs. Additionally, coal could be hard to maintain depending on weather, and the ashes and grease need to be cleaned up after each use.","<strong>Gas Grills</strong>","Pros: <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">Gas grills</a> use an electric starter, much like gas powered ovens and stoves. This means you don&#39;t have to use an open flame, such as a chimney lighter or match, so you can start up your grill and cook even in inclement weather. This also means you can control the temperature since burners have ignition and temperature knobs. You can also depend on consistent temperatures since you don&#39;t have to worry about continually replenishing coals. When you are finished cooking you simply turn off the unit without any need to clean up ashes and the minimal grease residue left behind.","Cons: Gas grills are a much heftier investment with the cheapest grills beginning well over $100. Additionally, gas can be expensive depending on the supply and demand. Also, some gas grill models take longer to heat up, and some will not get as hot as charcoal grills.","<strong>Infrared Grills</strong>","Pros: Infrared barbeque grills combine the convenience of gas grills with the intense heat of charcoal grills. Using gas to fuel the grill and advanced infrared technology, these grills heat up quickly, then cook meat from the inside out. This locks moisture in giving seared meat the delicious taste enjoyed in most steakhouses. It usually takes less than five minutes for an infrared grill to be ready to go, and many models are self-cleaning for easy cleanup afterwards.","Cons: The biggest disadvantage to infrared grills is the cost. A well-built, quick-heating unit can easily cost close to $1000. Add in all the great extras, such as rotisserie racks and a smoker box, and you&#39;re looking at a grill that costs over $5000. However, most of these grills come with a lifetime warranty, so you can feel confident your investment will last a long time.","Regardless of the grill you choose, the most important thing to remember is to grill safely and enjoy every morsel of shish kebab, BBQ chicken and rack of ribs."]},"id":"7a5901ac-090e-46cf-a79d-4ecdb7e333d2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8483","url":"/charcoal-vs-gas-vs-infrared-grills","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-19T23:17:33Z","datePublished":"2014-05-19T23:17:33Z","name":"Charcoal vs Gas vs Infrared Grills","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This article was last updated September 10, 2015.
