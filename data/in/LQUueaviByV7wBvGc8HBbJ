The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-security-cameras\">Security Cameras</a> here.</em>","AT&amp;T Digital Life, which has acquired the home security company LifeShield, gives you a good set of tools for professional home monitoring security on a 24/7 basis, and the equipment you buy comes with a lifetime warranty. In addition, this home monitoring company offers helpful customer support, although you do not get an email option to contact a representative.","You can remotely control your home security system from within using a home touchscreen control, which is a tablet you can use while you are in the house, or through your computer, laptop, tablet or phone. You can use the last four devices to remotely control your system when you are away from home as well.","You have a selection of three security cameras with this service, as opposed to the four options of most other <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security companies</a>. AT&amp;T Digital Life&#39;s midrange package, Smart Security and Automation, includes an outdoor video camera with night vision. This camera has an impressive night-vision range of 40 feet and can record video or take pictures.","You can choose from two other camera models for an additional price. One of these is an indoor Samsung SmartCam HD Pro with 1080p resolution for HD streaming on a laptop. This shows up as 720p on a phone or other mobile device. The third option is an indoor camera that give you a 180-degree viewpoint of your home&#39;s interior. When one of your security devices detects that something is amiss in your home, it sends you email or text alerts and, in the case of an emergency, also calls authorities.","Unlike some of the best home monitoring camera companies, AT&amp;T Digital Life does not offer image sensors, which capture still images when they detect movement, or pan-and-tilt cameras. With their greater flexibility in movement, pan-and-tilt cameras can give you different viewpoints into what is happening in your home.","The Smart Security and Automation plan offers wireless protection so no intruder can break in after cutting the wires to an older-style security system. This package includes a wall-mount control keypad, an indoor siren, three door sensors, three window sensors, one motion detector, the in-house touchscreen control tablet, a touchscreen door lock, and the outdoor video camera. You get 250MB of cloud storage for your security camera footage, which is a bit lackluster compared to the top-rated products in our lineup. For an extra cost, you can also outfit your house with security devices such as a key fob, a smoke detector, a carbon monoxide detector and a garage door controller.","The monthly monitoring cost for Smart Security and Automation is higher than the average for all the packages we reviewed. In addition, unlike with most home security companies, you cannot get in touch with AT&amp;T Digital Life through email. You do have the option to speak to a company representative by phone. Our experience with phone representatives for this company was quite positive, and there was no waiting time.","This company also has live chat support, which is always a helpful feature, since you get answers to questions so quickly. Our experiences with the live chat service were also positive. AT&amp;T Digital Life also provides your alarm history reports, a FAQs section and tutorials on its website, all of which can help you understand your home security system better. The lifetime warranty on your security equipment rounds out the strong customer support."]},"id":"21382a96-5a7b-4cde-a4f3-e4ed23458af9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fbedcf90-dc24-44fb-9f80-d0123836542a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["AT&amp;T Digital Life costs more than most of the other home security services we reviewed and offers fewer camera options as well.
