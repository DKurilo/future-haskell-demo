PetersenDean&#39;s customer service is very fast and knowledgeable. The warranties offered by this company are stronger than some others we encountered, and the ability to purchase backup batteries of multiple sizes through this <a href=\"/best-solar-companies\">solar contractor</a> is definitely a plus.","PetersenDean currently operates in specific areas of Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and Texas. The company has plans to open more locations in New Mexico, Georgia, South Carolina, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Check to see if services are provided in your area.","In addition to solar panels, this company also installs battery backup to your home. These batteries will allow you to still have power if the grid goes down. There are four different batteries to choose from ranging between 7.7 kWh and 19.4 kWh, but they do not come cheap. The smallest battery costs $18,599 while the largest costs $29,199. Each battery comes with a 10-year warranty, can be programmed by remote and will be monitored 24/7. According to PetersenDean, the battery system does not require homeowner maintenance and can be used by off-grid systems as long as you are conscious of your energy use. If you want to go off the grid completely, you will need to check with your local utility to see if this is an option.","Solar panels come with a 25-year warranty, which is slightly longer than the 20-year industry standard. The company will fix or replace anything that breaks unless you caused the problem. You will also be given a roof warranty of 10-15 years depending on your roof&#39;s current condition. When we asked, PetersenDean told us that every system comes with the ability to monitor solar productivity.","This solar company offers purchase and loan financing options but is opposed to PPAs. The reasoning for not offering a lease is that it costs homeowners more money than any other option and it makes it harder to sell your home since the new homeowners must agree to the terms you put in place. If a new homeowner does not agree to the PPA, you will be stuck with it until the 20-year term runs out.","The FAQs page answers many common questions so you won&#39;t have to contact the company if you don&#39;t want to. Should you want to get ahold of someone, PetersenDean has email, live chat and a phone number. We had a lot of questions for this solar installer, but they were answered quickly, thoroughly and politely.","If you want to be electrically self-sufficient, PetersenDean is one of the best options on the market. The backup battery choices give you the option of finding one that meets your needs. With 25-year solar panel warranties and a roof warranty that spans anywhere from 10-15 years, you can rest assured knowing your system is covered from any natural wear or tear."]},"id":"df6f8645-b747-4a39-9ed0-77f4dc0a1f9d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69380","url":"/petersendean-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-26T13:14:46Z","datePublished":"2017-05-26T13:14:46Z","name":"PetersenDean","synopsis":"One of the most important things for a homeowner with solar panels is the ability to contact the company whenever you need to.
