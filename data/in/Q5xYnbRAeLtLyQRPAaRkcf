This product can travel up to 4 mph, an average speed for electric wheelchairs, and has the ability to climb hills at a 9-degree incline. Additionally, it has an extremely tight turning radius of 19.5 inches, one of the tightest ones we saw. However, this wheelchair doesnâ€™t offer much in the way of features that differentiate it from other models.","This electric wheelchair is an solid option for both indoor and outdoor use. It features a center-wheel drive that allows for easy maneuverability. You can travel distances up to 12 miles on a single battery charge, but other models can last up to 15 miles or more on a single battery charge.","This wheelchair has ground clearance of 2.6 inches, which is average for this type of device. Furthermore, it has the ability to climb hills at a 9-degree incline, which is one of the best inclines we logged.","This motorized wheelchair comes with many basic design features, including a seatbelt and plenty of padding, and it features a back and headrest. You can also adjust the armrests to suit your  height. However, the chair is fairly heavy, weighing approximately 198 pounds, making it one of the heavier wheelchairs we evaluated.","The warranty on the Pronto M51 is comparable to many similar wheelchairs. The frame is covered under a five-year manufacturer warranty, and all electronic components are covered up to one year. The batteries are warrantied for six months. This is a fairly basic warranty compared to the warranty on other models in the industry."]},"id":"d4c54ec2-04ea-4fde-9fb5-8cec1cf17634","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"24405868-2172-475c-837d-72bcd0769524","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Invacare Pronto M51 can help you move around easily whether you are indoors or outdoors.
