The privacy protection program is easy to use and powerful. With all the right features, Webroot Window Washer software is equipped to protect your privacy, but also increase your PC performance by removing clutter. The software has a full arsenal of privacy tools, whether you need to delete your internet browsing activity, permanently delete sensitive files (above government standards), remove clutter or even completely wipe an entire hard drive. And while this privacy program is quite powerful, it’s flexible enough to accommodate your individual needs, easy enough to actually use, and comes with a compelling price tag.<strong> </strong><strong><br/><br/> </strong>"]},"id":"fa9f6153-d44c-4fd5-af7c-835ac185e071","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The software doesn’t just help you stay safe, but is safe itself.

While this feature is only recommended if you are getting rid of your PC (selling or donating), it is very effective. The process involves burning a bootable CD which is then used to permanently clean the whole computer.

If you visit a trusted site often enough and want it to load quickly, you can designate it as safe and the software will keep the cookies around.","The privacy protection doesn’t stop online, but extends to just about everything you do on your computer. From temporary folders to clipboard contents, to recently opened file lists and even media playlists, you can cover your tracks and effectively remove your digital footprints. Webroot Window Washer is actually capable of cleaning your activity from over 470 additional programs and applications.","Normally when you delete a file it goes to the recycle bin, but even after you empty it there are still traces of the file (which can be relatively easily recovered by professionals). To actually remove a file from your system you have to rewrite that area of the computer with random characters, rendering the file unrecoverable. For this the software includes secure and permanent file deletion, appropriately named “bleach.” You can either add bleach to a wash, select files and folders to permanently shred, or right click on any file (spot rinse?) and select the shred option.","When you bleach a file or folder you can overwrite them once or several times. Webroot is quite flexible, allowing you to quickly overwrite three times (DOD 5220.22-M, or the National Industry Security Program’s standard), seven times (National Security Agency level), or use the Gutmann method for 35-times. Going a step further, you can set a specific number of overwrite passes up to 100 for even stronger (read: paranoid) wiping.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"95aa89e4-dc99-4d75-b629-900d4dd9edcf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"164aef1b-0558-4982-b966-6d33bd2f8fdb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Window Washer includes protection and privacy for your PC and internet activity.
