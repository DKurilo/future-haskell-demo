","Vocabulary Super Stretch is designed as a comprehensive vocabulary builder for students in high school, with separate versions for grades 9-10 and 10-11. Therefore, it’s an excellent tool for ACT and SAT prepping. This vocabulary builder uses a three-stage process to improve your vocabulary. It starts by evaluating your current vocabulary, then adds new words. Finally, it tests your retention. In addition to learning about contextual usage, you learn about root words and word origins, and the Merit Text Talker tool helps you pronounce words.   <br />\n  <br />\nAnother way this software helps build your vocabulary is with the Idea Match tool. This teaches you how to match the words you've learned with corresponding synonyms. You highlight words in a paragraph and select the appropriate synonym. This provides both repetition and lateral thinking to retain new words better.   <br />\n  <br />\nThe biggest concern with Vocabulary Super Stretch is the age and compatibility of the program. The interface is easy to navigate due to its simplicity, but the style is hopelessly outdated, as is its system requirements. This program was originally made for Windows 2000, and it requires Windows XP mode on Windows 7 just to run properly. This is disappointing, considering the high price. Similar vocabulary building programs cost just $5 and have much more modern interfaces and far more words. Each set only has 108 words instead of thousands, so it isn’t worth the $80 price tag.

However, we didn’t just use these vocabulary programs to beef up our next review; we worked in each one to find out which features are the most useful. We have the resources to test and compare these applications side by side and spent hours poring over each one to become familiar with how the software works. Because of our testing, we can fairly evaluate each program’s offerings.","<strong>How Much Does Vocabulary Software Cost?</strong>","Vocabulary software varies greatly according to who the lessons are designed for. Some are designed for ESL students, some for high school students. The vocabulary software we reviewed costs between $7 and $80 and contains between 108 to over 1,500 words. However, much of the vocabulary software market features outdated products, made evident by the staggeringly lagging compatibility issues and dated interfaces. This is largely because the market has shifted towards vocabulary building apps for your smartphone, most of which are free.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We searched online for the best vocabulary software and looked at each program’s platform compatibility, specifically checking if it works with Windows, Chrome and Firefox.  We also read forums and online articles to see what actual users had to say about their experiences using each software, and we considered price and the quality of the program’s features to see if the application was worth the investment. Before we started our hands-on testing, we viewed all the available tutorials so we knew how to use each program to its fullest extent as well as to identify any unique features.","As we completed each software’s activities, we kept an eye out for bugs and lag that could eat up too much of your time. We also tested our own vocabulary knowledge to see how well the programs track progress and to find out if the data was helpful and accurately reflected our experience. In addition, we paid attention to how difficult the words in each program’s library are to see which software is best for English language learners versus people preparing for college entrance exams.","We also compared the programs’ interfaces to find user-friendly software. Finally, we checked out each software provider’s support features and preferred those that have a variety of contact methods, including email, live chat and phone options.","<strong>Key Features to Look for in Vocabulary Software </strong>","Number of Words<br/>It’s important to look for software that has thousands of words so you can keep coming back without running out of new vocabulary to learn, but the best programs also organize their lessons well. We found that applications that breaks up words into categories, such as test prep and common words, are most useful because they let you improve your vocab in specific areas.","Games &amp; Quizzes<br/>Familiarizing yourself with new words takes a lot of practice, so look for vocabulary programs that have a variety of activities that expose you to the words in different ways. We looked for programs that focus on using words in context because it’s the fastest way to learn new vocab. However, we also found that software with activities that mimic tests like the GRE and SAT are well suited for students studying for college entrance exams.","On-the-Go Learning<br/>While you can download most of the software we reviewed directly to your computer, you might want to consider the number of devices you can download the software on when you purchase a single license. When you buy a program you can download on multiple computers – such as a home computer and a laptop – you can access lessons in different locations or share the software with family members.","We’d like to see more products sync between devices, which makes it easier to track your progress when you use more than one computer. You might also want to consider an application that comes with a mobile or audio version so you can learn on the go.","<strong>Other Ways to Improve Your Vocabulary</strong>","Using vocabulary software is a great way to start enhancing your lexicon. However, there are other things you can do to supplement the work you do in the program. If you make some or all of these part of your daily routine, you’ll see your vocabulary grow in no time.","Read<br/>If you decide to do only one thing to improve your vocabulary, let it be reading. And don’t limit yourself to one genre – read everything. Let no subject be off limit nor any format. The more frequently you read, the greater your chances of seeing new words as well as familiar words used in new contexts. You’ll also learn about new subjects and make connections between them, which is exactly how you expand your vocabulary and your horizons.","Pay attention while you read. Notice how words are used, how sentences are built and even how rhythm is used to make words flow smoothly in sentences and paragraphs. Think about why the writer chose to use one particular word over another, and take note of how different writers, subjects and styles use words differently.","Use a Dictionary While You Read<br/>This may seem like a hassle, and it certainly is when you read challenging material, but it absolutely pays off. Every time you see an unfamiliar word in a book or article, pause and look it up. Spend a minute letting the definition sink in. Learning what the word means, rather than skimming over it, gives you a better understanding of what the author is talking about. You can keep a physical dictionary next to you while you read or simply look up a word on your smartphone.","Learn a Word Each Day<br/>Another simple way to expand your vocabulary is to learn one new word every day. You can open up a dictionary to a random page and point to a word, or you can download an app or sign up for an email that gives you a new word each day. You can also visit sites like dictionary.com and view their <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/\">words of the day</a>.","Use Your Words<br/>The best way to remember all of the new words you’ve learned is to use them. Once you feel confident you know the word’s meaning and possible contexts, feel free to throw it in a sentence. You’ll feel smarter. Plus, using a more descriptive word may help others more precisely understand what you are trying to say.","Learn Roots<br/>Along with learning new words and thinking about how they fit in the world around you, learn the roots of words. Most English words come from Greek or Latin. For example, the Latin root “bene” means “well.” With that information, when you see a new word like “benevolent” (which means “well meaning and kindly”) you have some idea of what it means. If you learn enough roots, you may know what unfamiliar words mean without even looking them up.","Play Word Games<br/>It may sound silly, but word games like Scrabble and Boggle are great opportunities to use words and learn new ones. You can see what words other people come up with and show off some of the new words you’ve learned recently at the same time. You can also create your own word games to play.","Listen to Stand-Up Comedy<br/>Stand-up comedians have one goal: to make you laugh. Though timing and stage presence are important, their success ultimately comes down to language. If a comedian uses obscure words or their joke setup is too wordy, it’ll fall flat. But if they use words that quickly draw you into their story, odds are they’ll succeed in captivating you and get that coveted laugh to boot.","Comedians spend hours, if not days, testing and reworking their routines to get them as efficient and effective as possible. They want to have original content, or at least provide the audience with a new way of looking at something, because people are less likely to laugh at a joke they’ve already heard. Good comedians are masters of using language efficiently.","Talk to Everyone<br/>This should be a gimme. Everyone in the world has a different vocabulary and has led a life of unique experiences. Talking to people on a regular basis not only introduces you to new words, but like reading, it also sheds light on how others use words.
