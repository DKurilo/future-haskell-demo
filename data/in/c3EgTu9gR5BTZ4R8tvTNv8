While the high-quality video is a plus, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-action-cameras,review-3046.html\">wearable camera</a> is too large and bulky to comfortably wear all day, and the photo quality makes it a poor choice for creating a photo journal.","This device has an HD camera capable of recording at either 720p at 60 frames per second or 1080p at 30 frames per second, depending on which quality you prefer. The wide-angle lens allows you to take close angle selfies, record what you are doing, and take photos of yourself or others with the body camera in a harness. This makes it a good choice for both close and wide range shots.","At just 5MP, the photos are low quality, especially when compared to the quality of video the camera can shoot. This makes this device a poor choice if you mostly want to take stills. The still camera can be placed in special modes, including a burst mode that takes 10 photos in two seconds and time lapse mode that takes two photos per second. A built-in microphone allows you to record music, your voice or a narrative with your video. You can also use GoPro&#39;s included video editing software to add your own audio tracks.","The GoPro HERO wearable camera supports up to a 32GB memory card, which provides plenty of room to record video. Using a microSD card allows you to swap out the card for more storage or change recording channels.","A 150-minute battery life is long enough to record most types of sports but may not be long enough for activities like mountain climbing or hiking where you will likely need to record for longer than a few hours. You can purchase an additional battery or an extender. The battery charges using a Micro-USB, which is convenient for quickly charging anywhere you have power. The waterproof exterior is rated to be submersed up to 131 feet, which allows you to get the GoPro HERO wet or take it snorkeling. The auto low light mode also makes it convenient for use underwater, although it is not rated for consistent underwater use.","At 3.9 ounces, the GoPro HERO body camera is light enough to carry almost anywhere. However, the size is large enough that you cannot clip it onto your clothing like a life camera. It is most conveniently attached to a harness, strap, belt or helmet for use.","With high-quality video and a rugged, waterproof design, the GoPro HERO wearable camera is a good fit as a sports or vacation camera. However, with low-quality stills and a large body, it is not suitable for everyday wear."]},"id":"57f901e7-0937-4014-9544-ad8a3dc4ca41","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64258","url":"/gopro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T19:35:00Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T19:35:00Z","name":"GoPro Hero","synopsis":"The GoPro HERO features HD recording capabilities, 5MP photos and a rugged, waterproof design.
