Don t with just throw a boring hamburger patty on the grill, add some life to it by stuffing it with grilled onions and mozzarella, or use a marinade. Marinades can take your grilled meat to new delicious heights. Marinades are usually made from an acidic like vinegar or lemon juice. Beer is also a good acidic. Try mixing together a Guinness beer, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper, and chopped parsley. Let it stand for 30 minutes for the flavors to blend, then soak your steaks or burgers for at least an hour before grilling."]},"id":"caee69be-756d-42f3-8191-fe98babf79b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/UVshWNYBPLAnRPjHFmQ5T5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4523/top-ten-unique-9.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UVshWNYBPLAnRPjHFmQ5T5.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"UVshWNYBPLAnRPjHFmQ5T5","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UVshWNYBPLAnRPjHFmQ5T5.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4ade8932-a04b-4084-a554-7ee5c2bde1d7","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Seafood</strong>   Most seafood benefit from the smoky flavor of the grill.

You can grill it with or without husks. If you choose to leave the husk on, remember to soak your corn for about 30 minutes in water. Then place cobs on the grill and cook for about 25 minutes on low heat turning once. If you decide to grill the corn with the husk off change the grill temperature to medium high and cook about 13 minutes, turning often. You can add a little variety to your corn on the cob by making an herbed butter or a honey butter to accompany it. I recommend whipping chopped cilantro and salted butter together in a small bowl. Once the cilantro is combined completely, form the butter into a log, wrap with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge until ready to use. This can be prepared 2 days in advance. Remember that you re not limited to just cilantro. Play around with your favorite herbs, you might find something you love."]},"id":"344cd517-6072-4020-a83f-fbb527726dc9","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/5T9WNLKWFpVRhiAPDndfE9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/4523/top-ten-unique-11.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5T9WNLKWFpVRhiAPDndfE9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"5T9WNLKWFpVRhiAPDndfE9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5T9WNLKWFpVRhiAPDndfE9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"2fef01fc-8d3f-4a00-a156-a85d01d1f7f9","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Asparagus</strong> - Many people think you need to wrap your asparagus in tin foil before grilling, I disagree.
