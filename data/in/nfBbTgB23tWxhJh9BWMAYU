As you likely don t have your own printing press at home, you have to rely on the <a href=\"/best-photo-cards\">best photo card services</a> to create the invitations, event reminders and other professional materials needed to relay information to your audience. If you plan to design your own cards rather than pay someone to do it for you, here are some simple tips of things to avoid."," ","<strong>Using Low-Resolution Images</strong>","One of the most common mistakes is simply using a photo with a low pixel resolution. If you re using an image that is 300 by 300 pixels in size and your online photo card creator is asking for an image 500 by 500 pixels, this is going to cause a number of problems. When it&#39;s printed, the image will appear quite blurred due simply to the pixel distortion which occurs when a small image is increased in size. Images cannot be enlarged without causing some degradation to the quality of a picture. Instead, use images that are high resolution as these can be resized to fit smaller image spaces much more easily without a loss of picture quality.","<strong>Writing with Illegible Fonts</strong>","While those elegant and swirling fonts may appear sophisticated, they re quite difficult to read. Use the extravagant cursive fonts with some level of moderation and use traditional and easy-to-read fonts for important information. This will help ensure recipients don t interpret any information incorrectly.","<strong>Including Too Many Fonts</strong>","Including more than two fonts on a photo card can get easily distracting for readers. Apart from making the card&#39;s appearance lack professionalism, it also creates the  ransom note  feel of cut-out letters from a magazine glued to a piece of paper. Too many fonts can make a card s message confusing.","<strong>Printing Cards on a Laser Printer</strong>","While the do-it-yourself or homemade photo cards may be an easy solution, this route isn&#39;t always conducive to a high quality result. It s quite easy to see the uneven edges, paper stock, poor trimming, and laser or inkjet print quality. The quality of your printer can greatly influence how your photo card is received.","<strong>Using Cheap Cardstock</strong>","In addition to using cheap printers, cheap cardstock also creates glaring issues. The quality of the cardstock you use reflects you as a person as well as the importance of the event. If you were to get an invitation to an event on flimsy paper, you likely wouldn t take it as seriously as you would if the invitation were on something that feels sturdier and more visually pleasing.","<strong>Cluttering Information</strong>","When too much information is presented in too small a space, it can really confuse readers. A card or invitation shouldn t attempt to provide every detail about an event. At the same time, it should give recipients the basics.","<strong>Giving Too Little Information</strong>","On the opposite end of the spectrum, minimizing information can also be a detriment. Provide the basic details recipients need to know about an event such as a date, time and address. Sometimes it s helpful to include driving instructions if the destination is tricky to reach.","<strong>Including Weird Textures or Surfaces</strong>","Giving your photo card a plastic or metal appearance may help your card stand out from others. However, most recipients want a simple photo card that won t make them nervous to touch it, handle it, or put it near electronics.","<strong>Designing Unusual Shapes</strong>","Again, while you may want to create a photo card that will stand out, moderation is still your best course of action. When you design a photo card that doesn t fit in a traditional card envelope, then you re likely going to be encountering cost issues.","<strong>Leaving No White Space</strong>","Photo cards don t need to have every nook and cranny filled with colors, pictures, or designs. Sometimes creating a well-organized design means simply breaking up information with a little bit of white space. This is an easy way to give it elegant and professional appearance."]},"id":"36e4e5e5-c319-4ae4-841f-9c44fd814c7f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7755","url":"/http-photo-cards-review.toptenreviews.com","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-goodrich","url":"/author/ryan-goodrich","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ryan Goodrich","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"JiyjX3p6rgLpyZFxn2y77n","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-04T13:45:39Z","datePublished":"2013-02-04T13:45:39Z","name":"10 Mistakes to Avoid When Designing Your Own Photo Card","synopsis":"Online photo cards are increasing in popularity as today’s world continues to migrate to an ever-online environment.","review":{},"strapline":"Online photo cards are increasing in popularity as today’s world continues to migrate to an ever-online environment.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-16T16:53:37Z","id":"nfBbTgB23tWxhJh9BWMAYU","meta":{"title":"10 Mistakes to Avoid When Designing Your Own Photo Card","description":"When designing your own photo cards, it&rsquo;s quite easy to get caught up with including information and imagery.
