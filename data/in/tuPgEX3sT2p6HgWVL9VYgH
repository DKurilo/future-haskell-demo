This gas lawn mower employs a 150cc Briggs &amp; Stratton 625ex, which is a reliable OHV engine that has plenty of power for most yards. You should only need to pull on the recoil starter once or twice to get the mower running. In our testing, it started for us on the first try every time.","If you need to stop the engine and the blades to remove toys or other objects, you can simply release the blade control handle, which is located right below the main handlebar. When you&#39;re done cutting the grass, you can hook up a hose to the wash port to keep it clean of the clippings and muck that tend to accumulate over time.","This is a lightweight, affordable lawn mower that, like many of its competitors, has a 21-inch steel cutting deck. As a front-wheel self-propelled mower, it works nicely over flat terrain. It is fine for hills without too much of an incline, but homeowners with hilly yards should consider some of the top-notch rear-wheel-drive lawn mower brands that will give you more of a push to get up difficult slopes. This mower is hard to push until you engage the automatic drive function. We found that it tended to spin until it found traction, and then the front-wheel drive would kick in and cut effectively.","The Troy-Bilt TB200 also has a tendency to vibrate more than others in our product lineup. Since the grip had no padding, we ended up with hand fatigue more quickly than with other mowers in our lawn mower reviews. This could be a problem for people with small or delicate hands.","On the plus side, you can adjust the height on this mower quickly using two levers that adjust the front and rear wheels together. There is a wash port, so you can clean out under the deck after each time you mow. This is a great feature that keeps grass clippings from building up underneath the deck. However, we found that grass had a tendency to build up around the rear discharge flap. It was hard to clean out all the grass in the nooks and crannies of that area.","The 1.9-bushel bag fills up rather quickly, which can be a problem if you have a big yard. For contrast, our top pick, the <a href=\"/honda-review\">Honda HRX</a>&#39;s bag can hold up to 2.5 bushels of clippings. However, the mower has a detachable side discharge chute that you can use in place of the bag if you want to mulch. This mower does have nice mulching capacity and cuts fairly evenly.","You can reach customer service for this mower by phone or email if you have issues or questions when assembling or using your lawn mower. Troy-Bilt offers a two-year limited warranty for this mower.","The Troy-Bilt TB200 has some nice convenience features like dual-lever wheel adjustments and a detachable side discharge chute. The front-wheel drive gives you much-needed propulsion to mow your lawn evenly, but you may have a difficult time getting traction on uneven ground. The blade control handle lets you stop the blades and engine quickly, and the wash port allows you to hook up a hose and clean out under the deck. This is an affordable mower with good features that cuts grass effectively."]},"id":"1e44338a-cfb4-4b18-8a71-1e6974ff560d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56405","url":"/troy-bilt-tb-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-18T18:53:22Z","datePublished":"2013-05-18T18:53:22Z","name":"Troy-Bilt TB200","synopsis":"The Troy-Bilt TB200 is a self-propelled gas lawn mower that can smoothly and easily maneuver around obstacles such as trees and flower beds, which makes yard work easier for you.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"The Troy-Bilt TB200 is relatively easy to start as well as maintain, but it works best on yards without too much of an incline.","pros":["This affordable Troy-Bilt mower cuts grass evenly."],"cons":["You do not get rear-wheel drive with this mower."]},"strapline":"The Troy-Bilt TB200 is a self-propelled gas lawn mower that can smoothly and easily maneuver around obstacles such as trees and flower beds, which makes yard work easier for you.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","id":"tuPgEX3sT2p6HgWVL9VYgH","meta":{"title":"Troy-Bilt TB200 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Troy-Bilt TB200 self-propelled gas lawn mower is easy to start, moves smoothly around obstacles and is lightweight.
