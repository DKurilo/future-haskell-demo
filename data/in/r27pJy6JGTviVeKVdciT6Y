<a href=\"/best-cookbook-and-recipe-software\">Mac recipe software</a>  allows you to download recipes from other websites to add to this already extensive collection of over 1,000 recipes. This program also allows you to download full cookbooks from TheRecipeManager.com. Once you find your favorite recipes, you can share with friends who also have the software.","Recipes you download from TheRecipeManager.com, as well as recipes included with the software, come with images of each concoction in finished form, which is helpful. The recipes are listed in alphabetical order instead of grouped by meal category in TheRecipeManager. This makes it simple to scroll through the list to get recipe ideas when you just cannot choose what to make for dinner.","However, the search options for this program are limited, so if you can&#39;t remember the name of a dish, you may have to scroll through a long list of recipes before finding the one you want. You can, however, do a search for recipes with specific ingredients if you want to make a dish with ingredients you have on hand.","You won’t be able to narrow the search to such categories as cooking method or preparation time. That being said, you can tag recipes as favorites, which generates them in a convenient location. Once you do find the right recipe, it is simple to scale the serving size by using the dropdown menu on the recipe page. The recipe automatically updates the ingredient list for the new serving size.","This recipe manager for Mac lets you create a menu plan with a simple drag-and-drop method. Once you find a recipe you want to add to a specific day, you can easily drag it and drop it to the corresponding date. Once you save your recipe, it shows up in the calendar. If you decide that you want to move that recipe to a different day, you can drag it from its original position on the calendar to the new date.","This Mac recipe software includes email support in case you run into any issues while using the program. The program&#39;s website also includes a FAQs section and user manual, so you can search there for common solutions to any issue you have. You can also watch video tutorials to guide you through the program, which is rather helpful."]},"id":"f698dad2-9756-481f-9985-ebe992b4618a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"995caf36-b193-4292-82e3-566ac68d170a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TheRecipeManager includes over 1,000 recipes to get your digital recipe database started.
