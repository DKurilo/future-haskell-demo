These tests play a heavy role in our ratings, so we are unable to review products not included in the tests. The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">Antivirus Software</a> comparison here.</em>","Hauri ViRobot Internet Security is full-featured antivirus softwareÂ that incorporates two powerful antivirus engines. Despite its 2011 version number, there is evidence that the software has been updated since that year.","ViRobot did not participate in the most recent tests conducted by independent software lab AV Test, which means that unfortunately we cannot objectively compare it with the products that took the trouble to participate. It did, however, earn a VB100 (Virus Bulletin) award, ostensibly because ViRobot runs the Bitdefender engine, a force to be reckoned with. ViRobot actually contains two antivirus engines: A proprietary engine augments the Bitdefender engine.","The 60 days of continuous testing that comprise the AV Test test suites represent some of the most stringent wringing out of antivirus for PC software abilities, so we look forward to seeing ViRobot participation in future. In any case, it is safe to say that ViRobot&#39;s ability to detect brand new as well as widespread and prevalent malware exceeds that of the antivirus module bundled with Windows 8&#39;s Windows Defender.","ViRobot Internet Security provides more than virus protection. It protects against phishing attempts. It also protects against rootkits, worms, spyware and adware. Furthermore, it scans and filters email to block spam and threats to security. Somewhat unusual for his product category, ViRobot has some PC usage controls to give parents the tools to establish usage boundaries for children. It also includes a file shredder utility, which removes deleted files so completely that forensics software cannot bring them back.","ViRobot includes a firewall. Just how important it is for antivirus software to include a firewall is a matter of debate, since products that don&#39;t include firewalls integrate with the excellent Windows firewall without trouble. Firewall inclusion in antivirus software is, perhaps, a legacy from the time when the Windows firewall was not as good as it is now. However, there is always the psychological security that comes from knowing that your antivirus software and the firewall that establishes the foundation of any PC security are from the same vendor and therefore engineered to cooperate with each other.","The ViRobot Internet Security manual is conveniently posted online along with answers to frequently asked questions. You can check the status of your license online and submit virus samples. Access to customer support representative is via email, which is supposed to be answered within 24 hours."]},"id":"24ed2fb6-a1ae-4117-ba34-0da09d94b735","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0fc7764e-ceb0-4834-b5de-257be1bb34ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Hauri Internet Security is internet security that is much more ambitious than typical antivirus software.
