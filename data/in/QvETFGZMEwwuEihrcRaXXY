Touchstone Onyx 80001 is one of the best electric fireplaces you can buy. Its modern look, dual heat settings and many design and convenience features make a more attractive choice than most fireplaces. Its vibrant flames and log inserts give it a very realistic look, and you can even enjoy the fireplace without the heat features, which will give you the relaxing atmosphere a fireplace can provide any time of the year.","dual heat settings on this <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplace</a> – low and high – allow you to enjoy the fireplace with enough heat to warm up 400 square feet. The heat is dispersed by the built-in fan forcing the heat out through the vent and into the room efficiently.","You can also use this fireplace without the heat and just enjoy the flames. This lets you enjoy the ambiance a fireplace provides even if you have a warm climate much of the year. The flames even have five brightness levels, which is a fun feature to enhance the look.","The high heat feature draws 1,500 watts of power during operation, while the lower setting draws about half of that. The Btu output of 5,118 is pretty standard for an electric fireplace, which means it can heat a large living space quickly and without any problem.","This electric wall fireplace includes realistic-looking flames and log inserts, and the flames are lit with LEDs, all of which makes the unit seem very much like a real fireplace. You can adjust the flame brightness among five levels, from dim to a bright blaze.","This unit weighs 46 pounds, which is heavier than many of the other electric fireplaces on our lineup. It is wider than most on our lineup, too. This fireplace measures 50.4 inches wide, 21.65 inches in height and will stick out from the wall 5.5 inches. Because of the length, you’ll want to mount this unit on a long wall. If you&#39;d prefer a fireplace that sits on the floor, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/duraflame-dfi-5010-review\">Duraflame DFI-5010</a>.","If you’re thinking about mounting the Touchstone Onyx on a wall with a television, you’ll want to make sure to leave at least 2 feet of clearance. This will ensure that the heat from the unit can efficiently disperse heat into the room without obstruction.","We were disappointed to see that this unit didn’t have any touchscreen controls, but that probably isn’t a deal breaker for most. You can control the fireplace options by using the included remote control, which makes it convenient to control the unit from anywhere in the room, or by just using the control panel on the side of the unit. Additionally, the remote control lets you adjust the brightness of the flames.","The timer option lets you set the unit to run and turn off automatically. The timer function can be set from 30 minutes up to 7.5 hours. This setting comes in handy so you don’t accidentally leave the unit on when you leave the house or go to bed.","You also don’t have to worry about it running so long that it overheats. This electric fireplace heater has an automatic shut-off feature that ensures the unit shuts off automatically if it gets too hot, which should prevent fire damage.","The hardware to mount the unit on the wall is included, as are instructions, which is convenient. And there’s not much work to it either. You won’t have to hire a professional to do it; you’ll just need to make sure you have a few tools. All you have to do is attach the mounting bracket to the wall, then hang and secure the unit with the screws.","If you don’t want this unit to stick out from the wall, you can install it into the wall, but it will require that you disable the heat feature. This will allow you to enjoy the flame effect but not the heating element.","The Touchstone Onyx electric fireplace is backed with a one-year warranty. This is a standard warranty among most electric fireplaces. Touchstone does offer an extended warranty option upon purchase, which could add up to two years of additional coverage.","If you need customer service for your fireplace, Touchstone is available in a number of ways. For instance, you can contact the company for help by phone and email. Additionally, you can view the online manual on its website, which is convenient. However, it doesn’t offer a list of frequently asked questions about the unit on its website, nor does it provide help and support by live chat."]},"id":"bfd3751c-3bc3-4c64-b8e8-f160f44b278d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67227","url":"/touchstone-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-14T15:26:36Z","datePublished":"2015-10-14T15:26:36Z","name":"Touchstone Onyx","synopsis":"The Touchstone Onyx 80001 is one of the best electric fireplaces you can buy.
