They offer products ranging from keyboards to ear buds to office products. The Rocketfish Wireless Keyboard and Mouse is the only <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">wireless keyboard and mouse</a> combo Rocketfish currently offers. For the included features and design quality, we think it is priced very reasonably. However, there are some issues in regards to obtaining help and support from Rocketfish that have caused its ranking to decrease."]},"id":"59091de6-e045-460d-82b9-3e94b073010a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Keyboard Design"},"id":"b8f572f8-9a46-4213-8700-bd4968ea9f73","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Once you’ve connected the USB receiver to your computer and turned on both the keyboard and mouse, you should be able to access the computer from up to 32 feet away. The USB receiver doesn’t snap onto the mouse for easy storage, but it is so small (about the size of a small Lego) it would be convenient to leave it plugged into the computer all day every day. The convenient design is also apparent in the one-touch, customizable hot keys located on the right and left sides of the keyboard. From here you can access your favorite files, programs and even webpages. On the back side of the keyboard, you’ll find an on and off switch which is nice for energy saving purposes, but we also like that the keyboard will go into sleep mode when inactive. The laser mouse also has an on and off switch with an automatic sleep mode. Both additionally have a battery level indicator to make sure you are always forewarned when your batteries run out of juice."]},"id":"7054d56b-b97f-4fe4-bcfd-72d6d42b19a5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Mouse Surface Accuracy"},"id":"d8fb783d-ca74-483c-982c-fa5d701de347","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Your wrists and hands are given the upmost care when using the Rocketfish wireless keyboard and mouse.

However, many users complained that when they did get in touch with technical support, the reps didn’t know what they were talking about and sent them in circles regarding everything from basic usage questions to warranty inquiries. Rocketfish includes a one-year warranty with the purchase of their wireless keyboard and mouse, but it is very limited. In the fine print, you’ll read that the warranty doesn’t cover products sold “as is” or with faults, cosmetic damage or commercial use (applies if the product is used commercially, like in a large office).
