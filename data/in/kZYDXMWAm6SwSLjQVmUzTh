You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magellan RoadMate 5330T-LM is a <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> with a capacitive touchscreen and 7 million built-in points of interest. It ships with preloaded maps of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, so you can begin navigating as soon as you turn on the device. Its abundance of features and budget-friendly price make it a good option for any budget.","This GPS system also has lifetime traffic updates. This means it can search ahead for congestion in your planned route and even alter it so you get to your destination in the shortest possible time. Magellan’s traffic service works via a traffic signal built into the GPS. This is a better system than those of several competitors, which rely on Bluetooth pairing with your smartphone to acquire traffic information, a process that costs battery life and dings your monthly data allotment. It also comes with free map updates for the life of the device, which ensures that you’re always travelling the most up-to-date route.","One of the best features this car GPS offers is lane assistance. The feature tells you, in advance of an upcoming turn, which lane to enter, helping you avoid rapid or dangerous lane changes. It also has a speed limit feature, which displays both the speed limit of the road and the speed at which you are travelling. Both of these features can help you avoid an accident or speeding ticket.","The GPS navigator includes 3D buildings, landmark guidance, and spoken street names, which all come together to make navigation easier and more intuitive, especially in a place with a lot of buildings.","Its display screen measures 5 inches and features capacitive touch technology for more accurate and responsive interaction. You can opt to view it in either portrait or landscape mode, and from the screen you can look for the best nearby parking, peruse your address book and access your favorite destinations from the OneTouch favorites menu."]},"id":"e1dd3a02-2ece-4f65-bcf4-d64b3dc48613","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3db6291f-2821-4ec5-aa83-1328e9d81420","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magellan RoadMate 5330T-LM is a solid but basic GPS with all the standard features.
