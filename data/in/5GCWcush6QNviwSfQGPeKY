The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\"><em>Cell Phone Providers</em></a><em> here.</em>","Ting is neither a contract carrier nor a prepaid cell phone provider; rather, the company charges you at the end of each month for the minutes, texts and data you used. Each type of service is billed separately on your statement, so if you tend to use a lot of minutes but don&#39;t text very often, the text portion of your statement will be small.","It can be odd to compare Ting&#39;s cell phone plans to the competition because Ting organizes its service rates into ranges. At the end of the month, the range your usage falls into will dictate the price you pay. For example, if you used less than 100 minutes of talk time in a month, you only pay $3 for those minutes. If you used less than 500 minutes, it will cost you $9 at the end of the month; less than 1,000, $18; and so on. Likewise, you can send and receive up to 1,000 texts for just $5. Spilling over the 1,000-text mark will bring the price up to $8, where it will stay until you cross the 2,000-text mark. Overage charges don&#39;t exist with Ting; you&#39;re simply moved into the next tier for a particular service.","A single gigabyte of data at Ting costs $19 a month, 2GB costs $29 and every gigabyte thereafter costs an extra $15. Overage data is charged per megabyte – $0.015 per megabyte to be precise – so you only get charged for the data you use. Be sure to watch that usage, though – next to the big carriers, heavy data use on Ting can get exorbitantly expensive, especially if your whole family uses the same plan.","For most people, Ting&#39;s prices are excellent, but its best attribute is its support team. In every one of our dealings with its customer service representatives, we were impressed by their friendliness, thoughtfulness, knowledge and attention to detail. Getting in touch with the staff is a cinch, and we never once dreaded picking up the phone.","Its prices are budget-friendly and its support is awesome, but Ting still suffers from a dearth of features. In an age when unlimited talk and text is the status quo, Ting&#39;s pricing buckets, though affordable, can feel constricting. If you&#39;re all about having the latest and greatest devices, buying unsubsidized every year – or even every two years – can get almost prohibitively expensive. Ting has a decent variety of Android and iOS devices ranging in price from around $40 for a new feature phone to over $700 for a new Galaxy Note 3, but it doesn&#39;t offer Windows Phones, BlackBerrys or tablets – all staples of the best cell phone providers we reviewed. Also, though it does advertise business plans for the corporate crowd, they&#39;re identical to the consumer plans in all but name.","Long a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) of Sprint, Ting only had access to the Sprint network. With a recent partnership with a GSM network, you can essentially pick and choose between connecting to Sprint or T-Mobile, depending on which phone you buy."]},"id":"e17b817a-b831-44a2-838f-1334999567aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"146307e5-6d97-4cc9-a03b-2736940a8e26","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its bucket-priced plans and the best support in the industry, Ting simplifies cell phone service.
