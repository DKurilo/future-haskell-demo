The main things that it has going for it over the Acadia are slightly better optics, weighs a little less and the caliber of lifetime warranty. These were enough to give them a decent lead but they will cost you about 50% more than Leupold&#39;s Acadia. Whether or not its worth it is up to you but looking at the specs and features of the two, we gave the win to Eagle Optics.

This is a huge plus for them because of what that does for the viewing experience. &#34;Coated&#34; optics will have at least one surface coated with anti-reflective coating. &#34;Fully coated&#34; implies that every air-to-glass surface is coated. &#34;Multi-coated&#34; optics will have at least one surface that has multiple layers of anti-reflective coating. The best are the ones that are fully multi-coated because all air-to-glass surfaces are coated with multiple layers.","Anti-reflective coatings are applied to help eliminate stray light and improve contrast. Although this more intensely affects star gazing binoculars, no one wants to lose picture quality. Binoculars are similar to cameras that way. You want to be able to capture all the light for the best possible contrast, in order to have to best viewing experience. Fully multi-coated lenses should theoretically eliminate nearly all loss of light and give you the best possible picture quality.","The Eagle Optics Ranger SRT has a close focusing distance of 1.6 meters which is about a meter closer than both the PENTAX DCF CS and the Leupold Acadia. Although binoculars are meant to see things that are far away, having the option of focusing on something close is useful too. For diopter focusing you get +/- 4 compensation. Since one eye on most people sees a bit differently than the other, diopter compensation allows you to adjust the binoculars for both eyes. This makes it so you not only see better but you also don&#39;t stress one eye out."]},"id":"63c76fc0-b9b5-4058-af44-473bd645c177","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Usability"},"id":"313b0762-2ece-490f-bf15-a6180631f9bf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is one distinct difference between this pair of Eagle Optics binoculars and the PENTAX DCF CS. Both are made of polycarbonate but unlike the DCF CS the Ranger SRT doesn&#39;t have fiber reinforcing. Instead it has some aluminum parts that allow for the necessary areas to be stronger and more rigid. It is pretty common to reinforce polycarbonate with another material. Although it is a &#34;thermal plastic&#34; that is resistant to thermal expansion in changing temperatures, it still expands and contracts more than the common metals used to house optics. The addition of aluminum, which almost doesn&#39;t fluctuate at all, is a great addition to these binoculars."]},"id":"7174de40-026f-470e-92dd-2fed3cdc5ff1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"d2dcec2a-9348-44ac-a86c-9c29d4848fad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Out of the three common materials used to make the bodies of binoculars, aluminum, magnesium and polycarbonate, aluminum is the heaviest.
