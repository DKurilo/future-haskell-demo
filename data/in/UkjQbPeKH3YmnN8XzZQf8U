Their Dish Network ViP722k Dual is a DVR that takes recording video to a whole new level.","Not only can you schedule and record live TV, you can record four different stations simultaneously. At your disposal is 500GB of internal storage space – usually equating to 55 recorded hours of television. If that’s not enough space, a USB port is available for external storage. Dish Network’s ViP722k Dual can stream video to multiple rooms and is pliable for parental control and other user-specific settings. It is easy to customize the unit to your preferences.","This DVR supports both high- and standard-definition televisions. Obviously your picture will be higher quality with an HDTV, but the DVR can record television from a standard TV just as easily.","The DVR options are limited to the offerings of your satellite television service. The Dish Network ViP722k can’t access analog channels or even digital cable stations. However, you can hop onto Dish’s on demand video service to watch almost any movie you can think of.","Dish Network’s website is pretty user-friendly, with helpful information about setup, purchase and other general questions. There is a Helpful Tools link which is basically just a FAQs page with interactive support. You can Contact the company via phone, Facebook, Twitter, email or chat any time of day. Dish also gives all of their DVRs a one-year warranty."]},"id":"e452c099-6783-4e8c-bd2c-9b67bd1c1d46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5f0c0b1-dac6-4a06-b3d7-5277efbc3c3f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dish Network ViP722k Dual is a DVR that is specific to Dish Network’s service.
