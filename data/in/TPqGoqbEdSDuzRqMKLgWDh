You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sony HDR-TD30V gives you what you expect from a Sony brand camcorder, shoots video in full high definition 1080p, and at 60 fps. Both specs are on par with some of the best <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD camcorders</a> we reviewed, and they ensure outstanding quality for your video recording. This camcorder offers a 10x optical zoom, which is about average among the cameras we reviewed. A high 120x digital zoom is nice, but be aware that if you use anything much over a 17x digital zoom on this camcorder, it will start to blur and pixilate the video quality.","Although this camcorder does not have an integrated memory, it does have a built-in 3D lens. You can choose to use the 3D recording feature or film in regular 2D, depending on the type of video you want to capture at any given time.  The viewfinder screen also displays in 3D, and you can view your videos on the camcorder without the use of 3D glasses. Having this option is a nice bonus, particularly if you plan to create video in 3D frequently. Be aware,  however, that 3D shooting lowers the video quality slightly, and it drains more of the battery life, which is not stellar to begin with.","Sony&#39;s customer service is  very good. There are a variety of options for help and support, including live chat, phone, email, FAQs and forums. Plus, you can download a user manual in case you can&#39;t find your hard copy. With all of these avenues available for customer support,  you&#39;re sure to find the answers to any questions you have quickly and easily."]},"id":"7a766e41-79f9-45a7-80d7-0ad1ff59b5cf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"85869fe8-1ec3-4eb6-b6ec-479c9de5c37a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When you&#39;re shopping for the best HD camcorders, the Sony HDR-TD30V is definitely one to consider.
