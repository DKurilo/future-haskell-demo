Unlike the Bosch SHXAL05UC, a more expensive Ascenta dishwasher, this model doesn’t have concealed controls. However, when considering the other features like a quiet 50dB sound rating, six different wash cycles, tall tub capacity and nylon racks, we thought these features outweighed the lack of hidden controls and deemed a higher rating. However, the Bosch SHE6AP05US didn’t quite live up to the Samsung DMT800RHS or the GE GDWT160RSS in the functionality category; it is missing both a hard food disposer and a heated dry option."]},"id":"988e6c0f-41ec-4085-82df-fdd643774f49","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Efficiency"},"id":"252a02fb-9f48-4a3f-8587-b6a9b7b4383f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch SHE6AP05UC dishwasher has one of the lowest estimated yearly operating costs, $32, which is probably due to the fact that it is Energy Star qualified and has a special function called EcoSense that reduces energy usage by up to 20 percent.","Additionally, it has a half load option for small loads so you don’t have to waste a normal wash cycle worth of water on a few dishes. While this dishwasher is efficiently chugging away, you may not be able to tell it is on with a sound level rating of only 50dB. Only the Samsung DMT800RHS is quieter, at 49dB.","The Bosch SHE6AP05UC can contain fourteen 5-piece dish sets (equal to 70 dishes), plus silverware, at one time.  That is a lot of dishes. Granted, it may be somewhat of a jigsaw puzzle to get all of the pieces to fit in the racks, but according to Bosch’s website, it’s possible. Once the dishes are all in, you have six different wash cycles to choose from and two different options to compliment the cycles on top of that. Whether you want a quick wash, 30 minutes or less, or have pots and pans that need a major scrubbing, this dishwasher has a setting for it."]},"id":"7e36684c-14d3-4fc6-8bfd-25e8cf51e29d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Cleaning Options"},"id":"c2b67938-a75c-4ce6-bea6-5fef9160884f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Bosch has long been considered a premium brand, and with their hands in everything from automotive technology to thermotechnology to solar energy to home appliances, it isn’t surprising that their products are top-of-the-line. They take their long-standing history and integrate that knowledge into their products. The Bosch SHE6AP05UC dishwasher is a good example of this. Several features are reminiscent of their work in thermotechnology. Take for example their concealed heating element and flow-through water heater. Both of these features are designed to make the dishwasher more energy efficient. By hiding the heating element and incasing it in the bottom panel, heat is radiated through the stainless steel, tall tub drum – conserving energy that may otherwise be wasted. An optimum wash sensor is also built in to add to the efficiency. It determines whether the dishes are clean and will automatically shut down after a certain threshold is met.","Convenience plays a big role in this dishwasher’s design as well. A status indicator located front and center, shows what setting you’ve chosen, remaining time, etc. A child lock is also included to protect your wash cycle from being interrupted accidentally. Finally, a delay start time feature allows you to postpone washing for up to 24 hours."]},"id":"470afc0a-676d-476a-9404-95b360f77e0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Load Flexibility"},"id":"32ed8449-717f-4545-8381-a9d8fca49a04","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For a dishwasher that doesn’t hide its controls, the Bosch SHE6AP05UC is pretty sharp looking.

The façade is a stainless steel finish with a recessed handle below the controls. The nylon racks add to the overall appearance with their heavy-duty construction and adjustable nature.
