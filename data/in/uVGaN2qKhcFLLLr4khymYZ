This disk defragmenter software provides one of the easiest ways to optimize your hard drive.  If there is one disk defragmenter software that is recommend for novice users, Advanced Disk Optimizer would fit the bill. It’s completely guided defragmentation sessions are very simple and easy to use. In fact, Advanced Disk Optimizer basically runs itself.","A user can simply select a hard drive to optimize and click on the okay button to commence a session. No configurations or setups are needed.  However, this simplicity comes at a cost. This program does not allow any type of changes in how it defragments or analyzes a hard disk.  There are no advanced features or options for changing the default sessions. For advanced users or system administrators, this program may be too limited in options for their needs. However, novice users will find Advanced Disk Optimizer a dream to use.","Advanced Disk Optimizer is disk defragmenter software lacks many features and extra settings that can be configured by users. Each optimization session is completely automated which eliminates the need for user interaction beyond hitting the okay button. Advanced Disk Optimizer does a solid job of defragmenting and optimizing file systems on a hard drive. During testing, Advanced Disk Optimizer displayed a real time drive map. The drive map was easy to read and utilized high contrasting colors to mark different types of file clusters.","Advanced Disk Optimizer did a moderately fast job of optimizing both an internal and an external hard drive in two sessions. Both jobs were completed over several minutes with the external drive taking longer to optimize due to a higher degree of defragmentation. The program also did very well in a multitasking situation with other programs running in the background. Opening and interacting with other programs did not interfere with the program’s defragmentation sessions.","The built in defragmentation routines work to both defrag files as well as optimize file locations for faster disk access. Unfortunately, there are no configurable parameters or options for setting boot time sessions. Scheduled or automated sessions that could be set up to run unattended also are not available.","Systweak, the developers of Advanced Disk Optimizer, provide support and help through their website. A tutorial on the basic features of the program along with a FAQs section, online customer support and email are also provided. One noticeable absence was the lack of a built in help system."]},"id":"576c9e68-282b-4be3-a1ba-3cc87e7db4d8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f5351167-a09a-4727-b57f-3c3ff9e06ec8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Advanced Disk Optimizer offers what is arguably the easiest process for defragmenting a hard drive.  No other disk defragmenter software program reviewed offers such simplicity.

It’s so easy to use that probably anyone could use it without any computer knowledge or experience.  The downside to such a design is that computer owners with special disk settings or advanced drive setups including network attached drives find little value in the program. However, for novices and casual computer users, the incredible ease of use and solid defragmentation routines make a winning combination.
