Even so, we have colleagues who edit everything for us before we publish our words online. We know that not everyone has that luxury. While maybe not as amazing as our editor friends, writing enhancement software can help you clean up your spelling and tighten up your grammar so that you can present your best-written self in papers, emails, memos and even tweets.","Our unique knowledge base and expertise puts us in the fortunate position of being able to help you find the best writing enhancement software to fit your needs, writing style and budget. Extensive thought, research and testing went into our product recommendations. We present only the most important information about only the best products, so you can make an informed decision and have confidence in whichever software you choose.","<strong>How Much Does Writing Enhancement Software Cost?</strong>","There are a few ways to get your hands-on writing enhancement software, including one-time downloads and monthly subscriptions. A few programs even come on CD-ROMs. The benefit of a monthly subscription, such as Grammarly, is the software continuously updates as it becomes smarter.  A few subscription programs even offer a free trial to give you the opportunity to check out their features. We recommend spending between $10 and $20 on a monthly subscription and less than $100 for a one-time download or CD-ROM. ","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We started our search for the best writing enhancement software by seeing what was available. We compiled our list of products and started narrowing down the search by researching their specs, features, and reported performance on developer websites and based on user reviews. We were specifically looking for software that enhanced writing generally, not programs created for specific uses, like resume writing, creative writing or screenwriting. Once we had narrowed down the list to the top 15 products, we acquired each in order to do some hands-on testing.","We evaluated these writing enhancement software products based on their editing tools, performance, reference tools, and help and support, and we expand upon each of these categories in each product’s review. To test each program’s tools and performance, we learned the software to assess its ease of use and limitations, and then ran a test paragraph through each one. The paragraph had some obvious and some subtle errors throughout, and we rated the products based on how they responded to these errors.","In every test performed, we strived to mimic typical consumer use as closely as possible so our results would be representative of your own experience. After testing, we combined our research and our test results to pick the top 10 products so that you can find the best writing enhancement software for you, whether your needs are more general or more educational.","Some writing enhancement software is available to use over the internet, which offers more flexibility than products that only work in conjunction with a word processor.","<strong>What to Look for in Writing Enhancement Software</strong><br/><br/>Editing Tools<br/>A basic grammar and spelling check is necessary for writing enhancement software. The best products, in addition to offering these features, have the capacity to catch more complicated discrepancies, including mistakes in context, commonly confused words, numbers and capitalization. Writing enhancement software should also explain why it marks things as incorrect and offer helpful suggestions to make your writing better. The best products work both online and in a word processor.","Performance<br/>Performance is gauged on how well the included editing tools react to errors. It doesn’t matter if a writing enhancement program has a vast array of features if these features do not perform well. The basic grammar and spell-check functions are the best place to start when assessing the value of any writing enhancement software. A product that fails to catch typos or sentence fragments makes you wonder about the accuracy or efficacy of the product’s other features.","Reference Tools<br/>You definitely want to choose writing enhancement software with a dictionary and thesaurus that are regularly updated to include new words and new uses of words. A template library for help with common formats such as resumes and letters is also useful. The best writing enhancement software also included a translator and access to additional resources such as forums and writing tutorials.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Should anything go awry while you use your writing enhancement software, it should be easy for you to find out how to fix it. All products we reviewed provided a customer support email address, but the best products provided multiple ways to get in touch with someone to answer your questions, including phone and live chat options. Written literature such as FAQs, manuals and online forums are also helpful.","<strong>Get Extra Help from Vocabulary Software</strong>","So many online tools are designed to help you craft the best possible piece of writing and then polish it before you send it off. And while writing enhancement software goes a long way to help yo, by fixing grammar and spelling errors, there is another aspect of your writing that is easy to overlook: vocabulary.","The language you choose to use says a lot about you. And your story deserves to be as beautifully crafted as it is interesting; <a href=\"/best-vocabulary-software\">vocabulary software</a> can help you expand your personal dictionary and make your writing more robust. It’s even a helpful tool for English students, and those preparing to take SAT or GRE exams.","Vocabulary software is designed to help you learn new words, experience them in a variety of contexts, and practice using them. The best vocabulary applications are easy and even fun to use. Any writer worth their mettle can use it in tandem with writing enhancement software.
