Whether you re updating your blog followers on your latest recipes or keeping loyal purchasers abreast of your newest tech, a carefully crafted email is an efficient way to connect. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/verticalresponse/\">Vertical Response</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/mailchimp/\">MailChimp</a> have a similar range of features, but their interfaces are significantly different. If you re looking for a powerful email marketing tool, you should carefully consider both options.","<strong>Vertical Response Pros</strong>","Vertical Response makes email creation fast and simple with attractive templates, drag-and-drop email creation and responsive design. You can integrate your efforts seamlessly with Optimonk, Kickbox, Salesforce, Shopify, SurveyMonkey and over a dozen other services. Automated welcome letters and follow-up emails provide prompt responses with minimal effort. Vertical Response generates helpful reports that include information on opened, forwarded and bounced emails. Social media integration can keep you connected across all platforms so you can reach a wider audience.","<strong>MailChimp Pros</strong>","MailChimp offers an intuitive interface that makes navigation particularly easy for those who are new to email marketing. Predesigned templates will get you going in seconds. Those who prefer to code for themselves have the benefit of the Delivery Doctor, which checks your email for any spammy red flags before it goes out. MailChimp also allows you to build custom code using one of the email templates as a reference, which is particularly helpful for those who are new to coding. MailChimp integrates seamlessly with social media as well as Salesforce, WordPress, Drupal and others, getting high marks on <a href=\"/money/small-business\">email marketing service reviews</a> for its flexibility.","<strong>Vertical Response Cons</strong>","While vertical response offers both email templates and a freeform HTML editor, you can t switch smoothly between the two. Some templates are more customizable than others, and beginners may find themselves struggling with a layout that doesn t conform easily to their vision for the marketing campaign. Navigation throughout the site can get a bit tricky. Email reports are only accessible from the main menu, so it can take a few extra clicks to get around.","<strong>MailChimp Cons</strong>","While MailChimp offers the same robust range of reporting features as Vertical Response, it lacks the option to compare message reports. It lets you group email contacts but doesn t have the demographic segmentation that Vertical Response offers either. MailChimp is well known for being one of the most affordable options, but it&#39;s worth noting that prices increase with every 500 subscribers. This will cause your monthly fees to increase quickly as you&#39;re growing. With Vertical Response, you typically don&#39;t move up to the next tier of the plan until you&#39;ve at least doubled your number of subscribers.","Vertical Response and MailChimp are both well suited to small business owners who are looking for an affordable solution to email marketing. They offer a comparable range of features, including analytics that will help you see where you can improve your efforts. The dashboard and layout of the two are where you ll spot the most significant differences, so get a feel for the organization and aesthetics of each to help you make your final decision."]},"id":"42494f80-f41f-4593-920d-69a6e5ed092c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9894","url":"/vertical-response-vs-mailchimp","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-19T23:30:22Z","datePublished":"2015-11-19T23:30:22Z","name":"Vertical Response vs MailChimp","synopsis":"Email marketing is a powerful tool for businesses in nearly every industry.","review":{},"strapline":"Email marketing is a powerful tool for businesses in nearly every industry.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-11-19T23:32:52Z","id":"bcfPi3DcxDbqSegpKfiJDW","meta":{"title":"Vertical Response vs MailChimp","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
