This grill has one of the biggest primary cooking areas of any of the infrared grills we reviewed: 542 square inches. It also is made from stainless steel, so while it&#39;s a bit on the heavy side, it is definitely built to last.","This infrared grill has both propane and natural gas options. It comes with two burners with individual burner ignition knobs for more temperature control. It also comes with a rotisserie rack and a smoker box, both features usually reserved for the top-rated grills. It does lack several other features, though, including a temperature gauge, side burners and shelves. However, because the grill is designed to sit atop your personally designed pedestal, you can choose to include shelving, tables and a lot more around, behind and under your grill.","The grill uses 55,000 BTUs. This means your infrared BBQ grill will be ready to start cooking in just a few minutes. It will also keep the temperature high enough to cook your meat quickly, which helps lock in that juicy taste.","Alfresco guarantees its infrared burners for a lifetime, though additional parts are only covered by a one-year warranty. This grill is built sturdy and tough, so those parts most likely will not need to be replaced for a long time.","If you need to contact customer service at any time, Alfresco gives you lots of options, including phone, email and through its social media websites. User manuals and a FAQs section are both available for you to tap into online."]},"id":"5f0e45bd-5437-4ed8-bf3b-ed85a29898b3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3736bc8b-40f0-4b98-bcfa-508486e9a831","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Alfresco ALX2-30SZ is a table-top grill that is designed to sit on top of your personally designed barbeque grilling station.
