The oven’s delayed-bake and delayed-start functions are selectable via the range’s touchpad electronic controls. Another helpful feature is the frozen-bake function, which lets you to bypass the bother of preheating to cook frozen foods.","The oven on this model also provides a warming mode if you have to delay serving. If you keep kosher and observe Jewish dietary laws, you can use the Sabbath mode, which safely keeps food warm for extended periods so you don’t have to turn on the stove on holy days. The range comes with an oven lock for safety’s sake. You can stash your cookware in the storage drawer beneath the oven. The self-cleaning feature uses high heat to burn off any messes that end up on the oven surfaces. After the cleaning cycle ends and the oven cools, the ash residue can be wiped away.","The oven uses a standard heating method. Unlike a convection oven, which uses a fan to circulate hot air, this Whirlpool range provides the heating element on the oven floor, and the heat rises on its own. Some cooks prefer convection ovens, believing the convection method circulates heat more evenly around the food, but standard ovens can do the job as well. Whirlpool has equipped this model with a temperature sensor that monitors the heat and adjusts the cooking elements to produce even heat for baking.","The easy-clean cooktop has two heating elements that measure 6 inches in diameter and each provides up to up to 1,200 watts for cooking. The two other burners are expandable from 6 to 9 inches in diameter and provide up to 3,000 W.
