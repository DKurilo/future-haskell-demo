You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For serious weather watchers, we recommend the Tycon Power Pro <a href=\"/best-weather-stations\">Weather Station</a>. Though it has a somewhat complicated setup and installation, it’s one of the most durable and accurate stations we tested. The display console isn’t as visually appealing as other stations’, but it provides a wealth of data you can download and analyze later.","Assembling the Tycon Pro Station takes longer than any weather station we tested. Each component needs to be attached separately and connected through cables so the data can be transmitted to the console. Assembling the station isn’t necessarily difficult, but it is time consuming – much more than the others we tested. There are many small screws and pieces that need to be attached. The Tycon isn’t as sleek as other stations, but the result is the same: a tool that tracks the temperature, wind speed, direction, rainfall and light levels.","We tested all the weather stations in a reviewer’s backyard and found that to work best they need an open area. We attached the Tycon sensor to a fence post, but fixing it onto a TV antenna works as well.","We had no problems receiving data at the console once the unit had been constructed. The display isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as others we reviewed, including the <a href=\"/acurite-review\">AcuRite 5-in-1</a>, but it gives you a lot of information and can be customized to display the metrics of your choosing. Setting up the console isn’t as intuitive as others; there’s a lot of cycling through different modes to adjust each section of the console.","For a week we compared the readings from the weather stations we tested against weather reports from Weather Underground and Weather.com. The Tycon was among the most accurate stations, especially during the mornings. Its afternoon readings tended to be a few degrees higher. One disadvantage the Tycon has over the other complete stations is that it doesn’t have an internal fan to cool the thermometer, but it wasn’t as susceptible to overstating temperatures as other stations we tested.","The Tycon Pro weather station is one of the most durable stations we tested. It is rated for wind speeds of up to 112 mph and temperatures of up 149 degrees Fahrenheit, so it is a good choice for extreme climates."]},"id":"57a49b75-5f6f-4641-8707-27184b595716","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69588","url":"/tycon-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-08-28T17:42:13Z","datePublished":"2017-08-28T17:42:13Z","name":"Tycon Power Pro Weather Station","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":75,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","id":"HZc9DShZgwaM3pj9KjeB7S","meta":{"title":"Tycon Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Tycon Power Pro Weather Station is a wireless weather station that provides accurate data on a customizable display.
