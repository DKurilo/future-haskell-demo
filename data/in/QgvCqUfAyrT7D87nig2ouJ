You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Joysway Super Mono X is a very small <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">remote control boat</a>, but its size doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not powerful. The boat is sleek, fast and furious. It runs hard and really rips through the water. Because it rides really close to the water and grasps the surface, it manages to stay pretty stable.","The boat is made of thick, strong plastic. You don&#39;t have to worry about it getting damaged if you crash into something. Reaching speeds up to 28 miles per hour, this RC boat is a solid choice for beginners and even serious racers. Many hobbyists upgrade the propellers and batteries to make the boat faster and have longer runtimes. Its original runtime lasts around 10 minutes.","This little boat is very fun and offers great handling, but  it is very easy to submarine. Since the boat zips through the water so fast, sometimes the momentum pushes forward and the boat will dive into the water, especially after making a sharp turn. Fortunately, the boat will normally recover and pop right back out. A rubber ring borders the boat where the hatch and hull meet. This will prevent water from seeping inside the boat.","Unfortunately, a battery and charger are not included with the RC boat. The required battery takes about 4 hours to charge. To let you know that the battery is low when you are driving the boat, it will temporarily shut off. This nice feature gives you time to quickly get the boat back to shore.","This boat has a 90-day warranty included. You can read reviews, download the instruction manual and watch several YouTube videos of it in action online. Also, it is a common boat among hobbyists, so there is a lot of buzz surrounding it on online forums."]},"id":"3f9c29ce-7e54-4e68-b8fc-3d275c862581","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dce95774-c097-4295-8e46-91913a202c98","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Joysway Super Mono X is a nice radio controlled boat.
