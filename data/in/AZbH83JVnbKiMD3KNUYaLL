It is an extremely capable device, making it a great option for power users who are on the go. It comes with a sturdy carrying case, a remote and the necessary cables to plug it in and quickly get playing. And with its powerful picture and sound capabilities, the EX3260 is a great option for either home or office users.","During our testing, we found little to dislike about the Epson’s picture quality. We evaluated its brightness and color rendering abilities in a variety of lighting environments. Whether we were watching animated content, World Cup highlights or detailed dramas, the Epson didn’t miss a step. In dark and bright viewing environments, images were always clear and detailed and there was never motion blur.","The projector’s performance is notable when compared to the other devices we reviewed – both LED and laser models. In regard to sound and image quality, the EX3260 excelled, earning 100 percent in our tests. The EX3260’s throw ratio of 1.5:1 – the distance from a display versus the size of the broadcasted image – is one of the longest in our review, beat only by the <a href=\"/rif6-review\">RIF6 Cube</a>. It’s designed for projecting to sizes between 30 and 350 feet, which makes projecting tricky if you’re working with a small space.","On its rear, the Epson has a fairly standard set of connections. Along with an HDMI input, you’ll find a USB 2.0 port and a VGA port, and it can mirror connected devices. Oddly, however, there is no microSD slot. And though it has built-in Wi-Fi, the EX3260 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio output, unlike home-oriented mini projectors.","Speaker quality was not an afterthought with the Epson, as it is on most mini projectors. We found the EX3260’s 2-watt speaker to be robust and well-engineered, and it should be able to fill larger rooms without sounding thin or distorted. However, despite being much larger than the other projectors, it only offered the same speaker wattage as the smallest devices. Given its expansive throw ratio, you’d expect even more speaker power to back it up.","From inside to outside, the Epson EX3260 benefits from its strong specifications. It’s missing a couple connectivity options typically found on these projectors, but it has stellar build quality and image quality."]},"id":"e43b198b-b1b6-4265-b3a1-da65b16dfae3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70091","url":"/epson-ex3260-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-09T17:43:12Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T17:43:12Z","name":"Epson EX3260","synopsis":"Although the Epson EX3260 is the largest projector we tested in the mini projector category, measuring 11.9 x 9.9 x 3.6 inches and weighing 5.5 pounds, it’s portable enough to move from room to","review":{"rating":97,"verdict":"The Epson EX3260 is a powerhouse portable projector with stellar features and audiovisual performance.","pros":["It produced the best picture and sound quality of all the projectors in our lineup."],"cons":["It doesn&#8217;t offer USB 3.0 or microSD card connectivity."]},"strapline":"Although the Epson EX3260 is the largest projector we tested in the mini projector category, measuring 11.9 x 9.9 x 3.6 inches and weighing 5.5 pounds, it’s portable enough to move from room to","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-09T17:43:12Z","id":"AZbH83JVnbKiMD3KNUYaLL","meta":{"title":"Epson EX3260 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Epson EX3260 is a powerhouse portable projector with stellar features and audiovisual performance."},"products":[{"slug":"epson-ex3260","url":"/product/epson-ex3260","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","name":"Epson EX3260","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","id":"8qPVLKA9bxhAwP9MsYd6AN","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fgK3xihZvHsij4uCSdRGA9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"97a19a6c0e2694a56c01769dc1c6f942.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/97a19a6c0e2694a56c01769dc1c6f942.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","id":"fgK3xihZvHsij4uCSdRGA9","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fgK3xihZvHsij4uCSdRGA9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Epson EX3260 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Epson EX3260 is a powerhouse portable projector with stellar features and audiovisual performance."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fgK3xihZvHsij4uCSdRGA9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"97a19a6c0e2694a56c01769dc1c6f942.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/97a19a6c0e2694a56c01769dc1c6f942.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","id":"fgK3xihZvHsij4uCSdRGA9","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fgK3xihZvHsij4uCSdRGA9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Epson EX3260 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Epson EX3260 is a powerhouse portable projector with stellar features and audiovisual performance."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/tv/best-mini-projectors/epson-ex3260-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"tv","url":"/electronics/tv","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","name":"TV","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:08Z","id":"hetzCY2dg335aDLYkLr6cG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
