Mounts brand is well known in the TV wall mount industry for its low-price guarantee, which is one reason why it’s one of the most popular and highly rated TV wall mounts on Amazon. As a tilting TV wall mount that costs less than $30, the Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B matches up well with its competitors. It supports up to 165 pounds, much more than the <a href=\"/omnimount-review\">OmniMount PLAY40</a>, and fits TVs as big as 65 inches, has a 1.5-inch profile and provides a 15-degree tilt – all features a model needs to be considered the best tilting TV wall mount. Just like the <a href=\"/arrowmounts-review\">Arrowmounts AM-FM108</a>, installation is simple enough, though the Cheetah user manual could be better and the manufacturer’s website is not much help.","The mount profile is a slim 1.5 inches when in a fixed, flat position, but you can tilt the TV up to 15 degrees forward. The degree of the tilt depends on the size of your TV, though; 32-inchers tilt the full 25 degrees, and 55-inch screens and larger tilt only 15 degrees, which is still more than most tilting <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">TV wall mounts</a>.","On the back of your TV you&#39;ll find standard VESA hole patterns that match this TV bracket. The APTMM2B can accommodate VESA patterns up to 600 x 400, which means it fits most TV brands. Still, it’s important to double-check your TV’s VESA pattern before purchasing a wall mount.","Wrangling up the seemingly endless cords that must be connected to your television is easy with the Cheetah Mounts&#39; cord management system. The wall plate that serves as the base of the mount has an opening that measures 5.2 x 29.6 inches, perfect for taking advantage of a mid-wall electrical outlet. Most professional AV installers recommend having an electrical outlet behind your TV. While some people simply cut a hole in their wall behind the TV and then run cords down to an electrical outlet, this is time-consuming and could be dangerous in the long run. Not all electronic cords are designed to be inside of a wall, and such a setup could start a fire.","To receive assistance directly from Cheetah Mounts, you can contact the company during business hours via phone or email at your convenience. It also has a FAQs page with information regarding navigation of its website and sales questions. Unfortunately, Cheetah Mounts specifically does not provide warranties for its products, though you may get one from the retailer you purchase the mount from. In addition, the website isn’t particularly helpful and is difficult to navigate, and the user manual isn’t that detailed. But as a bonus, the mount includes a 10-foot HDMI cable and a level to help ensure you don’t install a crooked mount.","When it comes down to it, the Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B is one of the most popular TV wall mounts on the market because it’s affordable and it does the job, whether you’re mounting a 32-inch or heavy 65-inch TV. It has a big tilt to reduce glare and provide the best viewing angle. There isn’t much else you could ask for."]},"id":"1dd90fa6-95d6-4507-91fb-71bb44ed9dff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53639","url":"/cheetah-mounts-aptmm2b-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-09-22T03:07:13Z","datePublished":"2011-09-22T03:07:13Z","name":"Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B","synopsis":"The Cheetah Mounts brand is well known in the TV wall mount industry for its low-price guarantee, which is one reason why it’s one of the most popular and highly rated TV wall mounts on Amazon.","review":{"rating":73,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Cheetah Mounts brand is well known in the TV wall mount industry for its low-price guarantee, which is one reason why it’s one of the most popular and highly rated TV wall mounts on Amazon.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-09-22T03:07:13Z","id":"cJgJP6SrwYP54Qid2oeVEM","meta":{"title":"Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B can fit TVs up to 65 inches and support up to 160 pounds.
