You can use them to sustain precise heat levels when preparing a full meal, and many include features that limit the effects of the wind. You can check out the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-camping-and-backpacking-stoves\">Weber Smokey Joe Premium Charcoal Grill</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/product/coleman-roadtrip-lxe\">Coleman Roadtrip Grill LXE</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-camping-and-backpacking-stoves\">Cuisinart Portable Tabletop Gas Grill</a> to see a few models.","For those who enjoy spending time outdoors, a camping grill can help with every meal of the day. They only take a few minutes to set up, and you can use them to heat all kinds of food. As an added bonus, their small sizes don&#39;t take up much trunk space when you pack your car.","<strong>Camping Stoves: What to Look For</strong>","When you want to find a camping stove to use at your campsite, there are a few important aspects to consider. These units often come with propane fuel, but that is not always the case. The number of burners, the available cooking size and the adequacy of wind protection all impact the stove&#39;s performance. Check out each of these features as you research your options.","<strong>Fuel Type</strong><br/>Many campers prefer camping stoves with propane connections. Propane comes in external canisters that can be filled and refilled anytime you need. This fuel source produces a clean flame without adding unnatural flavors to your food. The gas pumps through the unit at a consistent rate, retaining heat levels for as long as you need them.","Wood and coal-fueled camping stoves are less common propane stoves. They do not require tanks to function, but they also lack the fuel consistency that comes with a gas connection.","<strong>Burners</strong><br/>Your camping stove should come with as many burners as you need for regular meal preparation. If you travel with a large family, you may want access to more burners. Those who prefer to travel light may prefer single-burner camping stoves. Extra burners often use extra fuel, but even the largest camping stoves use less fuel than traditional backyard grills.","<strong>Cooking Surface</strong><br/>The size of the cooking surface usually correlates with the number of available burners. Camping stoves with more burners usually have larger overall cooking surfaces than those with single burners, but the available cooking space varies from one stove to the next. In general, you want to find a stove that has more than 100 square inches of space on the primary cooking surface. This gives you enough room to prepare a full meal. Camping stoves with more than 250 square inches of surface space give even more room for cooking, but they take up significantly more storage space than the smaller models.","<strong>Wind Protection</strong><br/>Not every camping stove comes with a way to protect against wind and rain, but these features provide an important role in outdoor cooking. Wind protectors and hoods ensure that the fire stays lit in every weather condition. With enough protection, you do not need to re-light your stove while your food cooks.","Camping stoves allow you to prepare food outdoors. These devices often hook up to external fuel sources, and they come in a wide range of sizes. You can find an option that gives you enough room to prepare your meals without adding too much weight to your pack."]},"id":"9fd8c9a4-8144-4513-b9ba-b1ba5db6e334","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"3d39af01-f779-4312-bc71-178ce28dc899","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z85EZI/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pid|66809[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Browning</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GPEKBPE/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pid|66813[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Coleman</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cook-Air-Tabletop-Grill/1904944.uts\">Cook-Air</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4WWA6/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pid|66815[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cuisinart</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q6QT99A/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pid|66814[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Etekcity</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LA0Z5QS/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pi6d|66812[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Napoleon</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7903732-12165498-1435800199000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FProduct.aspx%3FItem%3D9SIA8742Z12814%26nm_mc%3DAFC-C8Junction-MKPL%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-C8Junction-MKPL-_-SG%2B-%2BCamping%2BCookware%2B%2B%2B%2BUtensils-_-Camping%2BWorld-_-9SIA8742Z12814&cjsku=9SIA8742Z12814\">Olive BBQTek</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHHT0NC/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pi6d|66816[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Primus</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D6LXG42/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pi6d|66817[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Stansport</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RALP/?&tag=ttr_camping-stoves-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1756[art|NA[pi6d|66810[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Weber</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5728b969-7cfa-45b7-9306-b9a7a7911629","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1756","url":"/best-camping-stoves","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-01T21:49:45Z","datePublished":"2017-04-18T18:44:38Z","name":"Camping Stoves Review","synopsis":"Camping stoves help you prepare food when you're staying in the great outdoors so you don't need to rely on your campfire for every meal.
