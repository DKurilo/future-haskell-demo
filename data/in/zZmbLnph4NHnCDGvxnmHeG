The <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">cordless earbuds</a> are very sporty in appearance, and the plastic band that wraps around the back of your neck has a matte black finish. During our hand-on testing, we found that the design feels cheap. The plastic is very hollow and brittle and seems fragile, but it’s still quite flexible. The earbuds are water- and sweat-resistant, making them a little more durable.","The buds themselves are connected to the collar by two short bright blue cords. You put them in your ears just as you would any other in-ear headphones. They are made of silicone and come in three different sizes. It would be helpful if Motorola included even more tip sizes, as some other manufacturers include twice the number of tips. The earbuds are quite comfortable, and although the Surround is the heaviest pair of cordless earphones we tested, we forgot we were wearing them.","The earbuds’ sound quality isn’t very impressive. We found the sound to be muddy. The bass is still punchy, but the midrange and highs are sloppy and not clean at all. Motorola has three different equalizer settings you can switch through by holding both volume buttons, but it doesn&#39;t make much of a difference. The call quality is much better than audio quality. The earbuds would also benefit from being slightly louder. During our tests, we only measured 40 decibels when they were at their highest volume, and the average peak volume is around 60 decibels.","The earbuds have a 12-hour battery life, the longest of any pair we tested. Motorola also claims that its earbuds have the longest wireless range – 150 feet. However, we were only able to keep the earbuds connected to our phone for 85 feet, which is still quite good.","Motorola has fantastic customer support. You can speak with a representative by email or phone. Motorola also offers a live chat option on its website. If you need to send the earbuds in for repair or replacement, they include a one-year warranty, which is standard with most wireless Bluetooth earbuds."]},"id":"9e7b99e5-8f50-48f0-b832-1bcc96b1b129","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1ff7354e-8038-4a76-891a-a55c90031022","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Moto Surround is a comfortable, water-resistant pair of wireless earbuds that wrap around the back of your neck.
