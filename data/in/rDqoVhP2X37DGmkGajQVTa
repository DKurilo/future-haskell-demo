For these less-than-spacious situations, <a href=\"/home/laundry/best-washer-dryer-combos/\">washer dryer combos</a> like the Maytag MET3800XW let you wash and dry laundry at the same time without losing interior capacity. It’s just like having two separate appliances, only stacked to save more room.","The Maytag MET3800XW measures in at about the same size as most other stacking combo washer dryer sets. It is 27.25 inches wide, 71.75 inches tall and 32 inches deep – small enough to fit into most spaces in a home.","The included washer offers 2.5 cubic feet of space and nine different automatic washing cycles for stained clothes and fabrics like wool or delicates. In addition, you can control the water levels used by selecting one of three load sizes, ensuring you don’t use more water than needed. Combined with complex rinse systems, you can rest assured your clothes will get the cleaning they need with each cycle.","The dryer component offers a 5.9 cubic foot capacity, six drying cycles and leverages two technologies, the IntelliDry sensor and the GentleBreeze drying system. The drying system provides a more penetrating drying cycle for faster and more efficient moisture removal without damaging clothes. The IntelliDry sensor monitors moisture in the air and automatically stops the cycle when your clothes are dry. This is especially important to ensure a drying cycle doesn’t run longer than needed, which can damage clothing.","Unlike all-in-one washer dryers, the dryer and washer devices in Maytag&#39;s set are separate and operate just like standalone appliances. The dryer requires a vent in the wall, and the whole combo is powered by a 240-volt cable. You&#39;ll need a specific outlet in your wall designed to power a dryer.","Maytag is a name commonly associated with laundry appliances, and as one of the best combo washer dryer sets on the market, this is an excellent example of the brand&#39;s resilience and quality. When you can’t place a washer and dryer side by side, the stackable combo proves a suitable alternative, offering a compact device that doesn’t sacrifice performance."]},"id":"39cb275b-af59-4e1d-86a2-7fd9a18db81c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58684","url":"/maytag-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-23T15:05:24Z","datePublished":"2014-01-23T15:05:24Z","name":"Maytag MET3800XW","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
