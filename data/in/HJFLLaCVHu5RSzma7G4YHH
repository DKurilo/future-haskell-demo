Small screwdrivers and tweezers are handy to have around the house for many tasks.","Replacing a watch battery or removing a watchband is simple if you have the right tools. In addition, you save the time you would have spent taking your watch to a jewelry store to have the work done, not to mention the money. You can also use these watch tools to repair those old watches you have laying around at home so that you can start wearing them again. Additionally, not all stores are equipped to perform repairs or carry replacement parts, so learning how to change your watch&#39;s battery or make small repairs yourself is a useful skill. This kit is also good for hobbyists or those who collect old watches, because it enables them to do repair work using the proper tools.","The Stalwart watch tool kit contains 16 pieces that include a watch holder block, a Phillips and miniature screwdriver plus three flathead screwdrivers, a spring bar remover, case knife, double-headed hammer, pin remover, pin punches, long nosed pliers and tweezers as well as a case wrench. The watchmakers&#39; tools are sealed in heavy plastic. The kit does not include a case, but the pieces are small enough to store easily in one location. The warranty on this set is 30 days. This kit does not include an assortment of replacement pins, so you are limited with the selection until you purchase replacement pins. The tools are made of metal and plastic for durability. With these watch tools, you can safely remove a watch case back by using the kit&#39;s case knife and watch holder block and change the battery using the tweezers. Removing or replacing watchband pins is simple using the watch holder, spring bar remover or pin remover.","The Stalwart Jewelry Repair Tool Kit contains the tools you need for small watch repairs and saves you time and money instead of having to take your watch to a watchmaker. If you need to put in a replacement battery, change or repair your watchband, you may wish to check this kit out to see if it suits your needs."]},"id":"d7e32a31-545d-4373-96e8-c4ac84336947","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64071","url":"/stalwart-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-09T15:39:14Z","datePublished":"2015-04-09T15:39:14Z","name":"Stalwart Jewelry Repair Tool Kit","synopsis":"The Stalwart Jewelry Repair Tool Kit contains tools to replace your watch battery, remove and replace metal watchband pins or replace a watchband altogether This basic watch tool kit is also useful fo","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Stalwart Jewelry Repair Tool Kit contains tools to replace your watch battery, remove and replace metal watchband pins or replace a watchband altogether This basic watch tool kit is also useful fo","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-09T15:39:14Z","id":"HJFLLaCVHu5RSzma7G4YHH","meta":{"title":"Stalwart Jewelry Repair Tool Kit Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Stalwart.
