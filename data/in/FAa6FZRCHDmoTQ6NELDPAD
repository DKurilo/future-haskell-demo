If you spend $1,000 within the first three months of having this <a href=\"/money/credit-cards/best-air-miles-credit-cards/\">air miles credit card</a>, you receive 20,000 bonus miles that you can put toward your next trip. This card enables you to earn 1.25 frequent flyer miles for every dollar you spend with the card; the miles don’t expire and aren&#39;t capped at a maximum amount.","Although this card lacks many travel benefits, like discounts on in-flight purchases, free bag check, priority boarding and VIP lounge access, it does provide you with concierge service. This benefit can come in handy if you find yourself in an unfamiliar city and need information about hotels, restaurants and entertainment options. Like the best credit cards for miles, this card lets you use the miles you earn to book international flights, and you won’t be confined by blackout dates when you use your miles to book a flight.","This air miles card provides most of the key features that you want to have in place when you travel frequently. When you use your air miles card to purchase flights or other travel fare, you automatically qualify to receive travel accident insurance, rental car insurance, 24/7 roadside assistance and lost luggage reimbursement. Additionally, this Capital One card includes purchase protection, extended product warranty and zero liability.","This air miles credit card offers an 11.9% to 19.9% Variable APR for purchases, which is the lowest APR in our review. It offers an introductory APR and is one of only two air miles credit cards we reviewed that offers this promotion. The same 11.9% to 19.9% APR applies to any balance transfer transactions you make with the card, while a 24.9% Variable APR applies to any cash advances you receive and a 29.4% Variable APR applies as a penalty if you&#39;re late with your payments.","One of the best things about this air miles credit card is that it offers a $0 annual fee, which is rare among travel rewards cards; only two of the other frequent flyer credit cards we reviewed don&#39;t charge an annual fee. Additionally, this card charges no international purchase fee and no balance transfer fee; both of which are commonly attached to many credit cards. However, like many credit cards, you pay a minimum $10 or 3% fee for all cash advance transactions you make with the card.","Capital One makes it very easy to contact it by phone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is important to be able to do in the event that you lose your card and need an emergency replacement card sent to you. You can also contact member support by email or live chat. A number of frequently asked questions are listed on Capital One&#39;s website that may answer many of your questions about your card benefits and account features."]},"id":"567424b0-2eef-40f4-8287-2eb670329ffd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"67c684ee-8037-430a-aa50-d9defdf51d8d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Capital One® VentureOne® Rewards Credit Card is a great option if you&#39;re looking for an air miles credit card that helps you earn air miles and provides an introductory APR promotion.
