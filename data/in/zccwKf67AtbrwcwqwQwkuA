The booster we reviewed is known as the Cell Ranger Stix and is designed to be used in a car, truck or other vehicle. This cell phone booster is by far the easiest to use and set up since the power adapter is also the cell phone booster. The lack of a separate booster makes it extremely easy to move this cell phone booster from one vehicle to another. Get Cell Ranger is quite a small company but does offer a very cost effective and easy-to-use product to end dropped calls while on the road."]},"id":"1bfe47f6-f747-4c64-896e-0d383037b233","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Signal Boosting Performance"},"id":"40a706e4-fb76-4bf3-ba6e-e4cdc30bb58a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When compared to some of the top-ranked products on our site the Cell Ranger Stix is a little less powerful in terms of gain. The midrange gain will not provide quite as much boosting power but in the long run you should still find a boost of around 2 or 3 bars in most areas. The Cell Ranger Stix works on all of the major carriers which is a must for any company looking to compete in this market. Where this cell phone booster makes a stand is that you are able to be six feet away from the booster and still receive an enhanced signal. On top of that multiple users can receive improved service without losing the quality you expect from a product such as this."]},"id":"de531bd9-9d45-42cb-949e-98571a0eb760","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Installation Features"},"id":"714be27c-a53a-4e00-9d0c-81e89e76d697","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The performance output from the Cell Ranger Stix is actually quite a bit better than we would have thought from a booster without a separate internal antenna. We found that when the signal was at least around 2-3 bars that it was more or less doubled. However, if you are in an area with no bars the odds are you will not get much help from this booster. While the company does say you are able to be six feet away from the booster we would suggest something closer to around four feet which is still plenty for everyone in the vehicle."]},"id":"db519d77-d08a-4bbf-aec4-9f514a72e34f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Antenna Features"},"id":"1b1fd648-ff9e-41e4-a8cf-33c5bc03fd5d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cell Ranger Stix is by far the easiest to use since it requires no tricky maneuvering of antennas to make sure you have the best possible connection.
