You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Now having been around for over 100 years, Whirlpool is a household name and trusted as a manufacturer of superior appliances. The WRS series of side-by-side refrigerators offers a variety of interior capacities to accommodate different kitchen needs. The WRS950SIAM is a large <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerator</a> and freezer with adjustable storage space for maximum usage of the already large interior.","Whirlpool WRS models range from 22 cubic feet in capacity to about 30 cubic feet. The WRS950SIAM comes with 29.8 cubic feet, giving 17.5 to the refrigerator portion and 12.3 cubic feet to the freezer, which is the largest freezer capacity in our side-by-side refrigerator review. It also has an in-door icemaker, which frees up even more freezer space.","Within the spacious WRS950SIAM, you can adjust and rearrange the shelves and door bins to accommodate large and tall containers. The four spillproof glass shelves, three of which are adjustable, provide 25 percent more storage space than standard shelves do, and you can store food in the two crisper drawers or deli drawer. Unfortunately, there are no humidity- or temperature-controlled drawers, but you can still keep your food organized. Within the door, there is one fixed gallon bin and three adjustable gallon bins, plus the dairy container for butter or eggs.","The freezer also has three adjustable full-width glass shelves and one full-width fixed shelf. The two full-width baskets and three fixed door bins provide more storage room, and the icemaker being mounted in the door rather than above the shelving provides top-to-bottom storage in the freezer. The ice bin tips out for easy access to ice, and the water and ice dispenser uses a Pur water filter for fresh water for up to six months.","These Energy Star-compliant side-by-sides use an average amount of energy, especially for larger-capacity models. The WRS950SIAM uses an average of 627 kWh per year, costing less than $70 annually. Although these refrigerators are great products, it would be nice to have a good warranty to accompany them. However, Whirlpool offers the bare minimum in warranties, only covering parts and labor for one year, with no additional warranty on the sealed system.","Although the warranty is not something to brag amount, Whirlpool offers good help and support options. On the website, you can find user manuals, answers to FAQs and video tutorials. You can also complete an email form, call the toll-free number or use the live chat option if you need to contact customer service."]},"id":"36c3d309-76f4-437f-b0c1-e82160ee5251","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f602364b-cdbe-4948-ab46-cab9ed553e10","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Whirlpool&#39;s WRS series offers a number of interior capacities.
