Many of these features are found on similar HDV camcorders but Canon seems to get a few things right. This device is a combination of high portability, simplicity and efficiency. It is a dual shot device, meaning it not only captures HD video, but still images as well. It gave us image quality that wasn’t the best we had  seen, but was still fairly impressive."]},"id":"9af258ad-c387-4ab7-81a4-84558c346b2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"19284f11-11cd-4716-9524-436464d15a4b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The dual shot capabilities allow you to capture 3MP(megapixel) images while capturing video. We liked how several features were designed into this HDV camcorder to not only ensure that your captured video is of high quality, but also your still images. A level marker feature is provided on the Canon Vixia HF M32 which makes it easy for the user to keep the device level and make your shots appear more steady. A grid marker, located in the viewfinder, is a feature we found especially helpful as it lets you accurately capture your shots. This makes it easy to capture all of a subject without cutting off desired parts of the picture.","The Canon Vixia HF M32 offers a smart auto mode which analyzes the situation you are capturing video in and automatically adjusts your settings. This feature allows you to have optimal images no matter where you are located. Also featured is Focus Assist. This feature helps ensure your subject is in focus. According to Canon, Focus Assist works by providing a 2x magnification to your images. That magnification is then cancelled when the recording starts.","Several basic HDV camcorder features are included on this device such as the Optical Image Stabilizer, which eliminates blur caused by shaky hand movements. Extra compensation is used at wide-angle focal lengths to also eliminate shaky movements. Instant AF focusing system is offered which improves the autofocus accuracy and speed."]},"id":"1f12e5e0-6965-4b6a-ba57-d638630c23f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"7b7debfc-49aa-49d3-8e73-a4f17c915576","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon Vixia HF M32 features 64GB of flash memory.

We like that there is an external memory card slot available because you will never need to worry about running out of recording time."]},"id":"9dd9fa81-27b2-4b4a-8058-cc8d76201a64","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Editing &amp; Extras"},"id":"384517e6-2bb6-4f9a-92b6-6c2c44054946","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We were pleased to see an option for an accessory shoe which will allow you to attach accessories to the exterior of the HDV camcorder which will improve lighting or audio on the device.
