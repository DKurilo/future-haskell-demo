Clear View performed quite well. In our performance tests on evenness and consistency, as well as on toasting frozen bread and bagels, it’s average score was 92 percent, which is slightly above the overall average of 90 percent. Similiar to the <a href=\"/breville-smart-toaster-review\">Breville Smart Toaster</a>, the Dash Clear View did well on all tests. ","This machine uses a different heating element than other <a href=\"/best-toasters\">toasters</a>. Rather than thin wires stretched alongside the wall, this toaster has two large elements on the bottom of each side. This design allows the bread to toast evenly and with minimal bar marks. The only area where this unit performed below average was with bagels. The bagels we toasted had large visible bar marks, but this issue could be addressed by increasing the power level.","This toaster has the most innovative design among the toasters we reviewed. While most toasters are enclosed by a solid case, this one has a large glass panel on the front. You can actually see your bread getting darker by the second. However, before you buy this toaster solely for the glass, consider that the novelty may wear off. In fact, once the toaster becomes familiar, you won&#39;t need to check the toast. You’ll eventually determine the ideal toasting setting for your bread and won’t really need to check the toast as it cooks anymore. Although intriguing, the design does come with a few disadvantages. This toaster takes substantial counter space with its long width. One and a half feet to be exact. Another disadvantage is its awkward crumb tray. It’s long instead of wide, and it’s accessed from the left side. If the toaster is next to a wall or other objects, you need to move the unit in order to pull out the long tray. The tray also does not pull out as smoothly as the trays on other toasters we tested.","This toaster only has one slot. However, the slot is long enough to fit two slices of standard white bread. If you plan on toasting two long slices at a single time, such as sourdough, then a 2-slice or 4-slice toaster will be quicker."]},"id":"ee850a0f-0292-43c3-b0f5-ed5de53607f9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"69c6db19-7884-4614-b59b-b37d15694f69","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dash Clear is an unusual and eye-catching toaster due to its front viewing glass design.
