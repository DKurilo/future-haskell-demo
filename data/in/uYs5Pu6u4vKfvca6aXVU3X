Its Ethernet component eliminates the need for an additional cable and provides a stronger signal than wireless connections, which helps with live-streaming movies and videoconferencing.","Mediabridge&#39;s cable has stayed up to date with the latest HDMI advancements. It supports 3D, 4K resolutions and advanced color spaces. However, the cable lacks some design components that you see in more expensive cables. For example, this cable isn&#39;t braided, and it doesn&#39;t have any injected gas to act as an insulator, like the <a href=\"/monster-1000hd-review\">Monster 1000HD</a> does.","The cable is not RoHS certified, since it is only necessary in European countries and they do not ship outside of the United States. This is unfortunate, as RoHS certification means that the product does not contain any materials that could be hazardous to you or the environment. If RoHS compliance is important to you, check out the <a href=\"/monoprice-review\">Monoprice Select</a>.","This Mediabridge cable is available in lengths of 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 25 and 50 feet. The 50-foot cable is the only one that&#39;s CL3 safety certified for in-wall installation.","The cable is certified as a High-Speed HDMI cable, which means that it maintains a minimum bandwidth of 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second) and supports advanced audio formats, including Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. It also sustains a 1080p or greater screen resolution. Because the cable exceeds the minimum standards, it can support 3D and advanced color spaces, including sYCC601 and Adobe YCC601. In addition, the cable is HDCP certified, which means it contains the protocol that prevents the unauthorized duplication of copyrighted materials.","Mediabridge offers a lifetime limited warranty with its cable, which means the company lets you return the cable only if it has a manufacturer&#39;s defect. The company offers technical support to its customers by phone, live chat and email.","Like the best HDMI cables, the Mediabridge Ultra Series High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet supports the latest technological advancements in the industry. Its Ethernet channel supports an internet connection for devices that are equipped to receive the technology. It also supports 3D and advanced color spaces and 4K resolutions. This cable is an excellent choice for the price."]},"id":"d654d1e1-9507-4f7c-9546-6c8dbda8d801","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49175","url":"/mediabridge-ultra-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-05T13:30:17Z","datePublished":"2010-04-05T13:30:17Z","name":"Mediabridge Ultra","synopsis":"The Mediabridge Ultra Series High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet supports internet connections with devices that are equipped for the technology.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Mediabridge Ultra Series High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet supports internet connections with devices that are equipped for the technology.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-04-05T13:30:17Z","id":"uYs5Pu6u4vKfvca6aXVU3X","meta":{"title":"MediaBridge Ultra Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Mediabridge Ultra is a cost-effective cable that can handle 4K resolutions.
