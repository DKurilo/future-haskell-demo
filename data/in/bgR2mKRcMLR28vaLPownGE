Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are looking for a portable <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> that is small and can handle only minor printing jobs, the Canon imageCLASS LBP6000 may have what you are looking for. This basic printer offers a small paper tray, a 5,000 monthly duty cycle, and its small and compact size won’t take up much space wherever you place it. This printer does not offer enough power to perform at its best in a busy office but it is an ideal home printer as long as it you don&#39;t use it extensively.","The Canon LBP6000 features a maximum print resolution of 600 x 600dpi (dots per inch) for black and white and color prints. It also offers a monthly duty cycle of 5,000 pages. This means that you can print up to 5,000 pages a month without causing the printer to overheat or causing a serious technical problem. With a monthly duty cycle this low, if you use the printer extensively, you will reach the 5,000 prints quickly. However, if this is just a home printer, the 5,000 prints should not be a problem.","This printer features black and white and color printing speeds of 19 pages per minute. This was surprisingly high for a printer so small and with such basic features. Unfortunately, the LBP6000 does not feature any type of automatic duplexing features. This feature would allow you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper without having to turn the paper over manually.","There are no features on this laser printer that will surprise you. The LBP6000 has a printing tray that can store up to 150 sheets of paper. It can print on a variety of paper types and sizes up to 8.5 x 14 inches. There are no wireless printing capabilities available but there is a USB 2.0 port for connectivity. This laser printer is compatible with several operating systems including Windows 7, Vista, XP and Linux.","This laser printer offers a measly 2MB of installed memory. Luckily, it does come with a one-year warranty. The Canon LBP6000 is also an ENERGY STAR qualified device, meaning it has met certain specifications proving it offers energy-saving features. This device consumes 850 watts during use.","One of the benefits of using this laser printer is the small and compact size of the device. It is only 15.4 inches wide, 14.3 inches tall and 16.9 inches thick. It also only weighs 12.2 pounds, making it easy to move from one area to another. There is no control panel or display screen located on the laser printer so you can’t control any of the printer’s settings directly from the printer. However, even without the display screen, this product’s appearance is sleek and it is a handsome printer."]},"id":"c9d0aadd-102f-4291-9f8d-8f22e9da260d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91330ccb-c866-4c8b-abec-d52b02ad80bd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon LBP6000 is a small and user-friendly laser printer.
