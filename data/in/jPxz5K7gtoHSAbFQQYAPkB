It does an average job of deleting files, clearing browser information and wiping free space. What it does in these areas is unremarkable for users who are seeking results. It has zero options when it comes to cleansing evidence of your Windows activity and the options it has for removing traces from the Internet are limited at best. You are able to wipe files, folders and free space, but the program doesn&#39;t come with the thorough shredding options you can find in other programs. All you can do with QuickWiper is shred files and folders, wipe free space and cleanse evidence of your internet activity. These features are disappointing and could use a lot of improvement. You are also able to log all operations, change the file list and font color, and add or remove a file.","QuickWiper is limited in protecting your privacy because of its lack of options for cleansing traces of your Windows and internet activity. It does have some options for removing evidence of your internet activity, but the list of items it scans is sparse. When you decide to erase items, the overwriting options are nowhere near as thorough as what you would see in other programs. QuickWiper has issues with hard-to-understand menus, loading times and difficulties determining what you&#39;re actually deleting. Computer beginners might have problems using this program. For a program that has a small feature set, Quick Wiper is unnecessarily complex. As it is, it&#39;s a basic program masquerading as something better than it is.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"a8eab8b5-8bbd-44f7-8ed8-5940b93f8cb0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"69df8f71-0dca-456d-91ee-dc4ad5669573","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["QuickWiper<strong> </strong>seems to be in the process of becoming obsolete.
