Although the included 3D design features could be updated, they are still reliable enough to help you enhance your models and creations.","For the most part, bonzai3D has a good number of design tools common to consumer-grade CAD software. Textures, transparency options and lighting effects are all necessary tools you&#39;ll use to enhance the appearance of your models. However, there isn’t photorealistic rendering or animation options to create life-like designs. A house wizard is also missing from this program as well, although a wall tool is present. Overall, the selection of design tools is somewhat lacking compared to comparable programs, but you&#39;ll still be able to find the necessary features to create quality creations.","Since CAD programs are generally used to create complex models, finding easy CAD software can be a challenge. With bonzai3D, you&#39;ll find it hard to maneuver and change your tool palettes. You can add and remove palettes, but when you resize them or your window, they don&#39;t automatically snap or adjust to your workspace. Floating boxes full of components and materials are cumbersome and inconvenient to have covering your designs. There also isn&#39;t a set up manager or a command line.","bonzai3D provides all of the editing tools you could possibly want. Snap tools, text and color editing, and point makers are all included. Also, you&#39;ll have about 180 free models to choose from along with 230 pre-installed components and symbols to add to your designs. Many of the symbols and models are very well designed and lifelike.","AutoDesSys, the company behind bonzai3D, provides many different support options to help you learn and use the software. You&#39;ll have unlimited access to email support, phone support, video tutorials and the in-program manual. We found that representatives answer emails quickly and the in-program help really takes the edge off the steep learning curve.","Computer-aided design software should be compatible with many different programs to foster collaboration. bonzai3D is compatible with many important file formats, including DWG, DXF and DWF. Also, you&#39;ll be able to save in STEP and STL formats and image files for read-only sharing of your designs. This program isn’t compatible with DGN, SKP or PDF files, but not many comparable programs have all of these formats either."]},"id":"a9094ce5-ff78-4677-8272-650aa910e486","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a6e80183-5cd6-420c-833c-4e7217d26b0e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although design tools and a hard-to-use interface might scare you away, bonzai3D has above-average editing tools and support options.
