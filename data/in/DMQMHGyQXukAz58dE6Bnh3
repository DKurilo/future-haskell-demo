You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Offering both prepaid MasterCard and Visa cards, BankFREEDOM presents a respectable level of flexibility to its customers. The terms are identical for both cards, so choosing one over the other comes with no discernable advantage. While all <a href=\"/best-prepaid-credit-cards\">prepaid credit cards</a> come with mandatory fees, BankFREEDOM dispenses with many familiar fees, such as point-of-sale transaction fees, and overdraft fees.","BankFREEDOM is certainly a serviceable alternative to more feature-rich and traditional credit cards. Does it trump or even supplant the advantages that more traditional credit cards offer? Absolutely not, but with a high concentration of low, if not completely free fees, this prepaid credit card is a reasonable alternative for those who are unable to secure credit due to a poor credit history. Enrollment is completely free, as are all point-of-sale fees. Members will also take comfort in knowing they are not subject to any overdraft fees.","Other fees for using the BankFREEDOM MasterCard or Visa are unavoidable. A monthly maintenance fee of $5.00 or more will be charged to your account, should you not meet the monthly minimum load requirement of $500 or more. Members also face a $0.50 fee for ATM balance inquiries. Replacement cards will also set you back $10.00. Bank FREEDOM prepaid credit card holders do, however, have convenient, surcharge-free access to their cash when they use a MoneyPass network ATM. Some of the benefits of the MoneyPass network include:"]},"id":"a3efb50a-8935-41c4-bf6a-a4ea6edbac23","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["No surcharge at ATMs that participate in MoneyPass","Access to thousands of ATMs across the nation","Convenient, accessible locations that include bank and credit union branches, convenience stores, grocery stores, restaurants, discount retailers and many more","Online MoneyPass ATM locator or mobile app to find convenient ATM locations (search by street address, radius, or zip code)"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f4f64177-d0f2-4b9d-945e-5dded8a37407","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Online account management is simple and free with BankFREEDOM cards. One of the handiest online features is the ability to pay bills electronically. There is a $0.49 per transaction fee for this service but that’s not much more than the price of a stamp so it’s pretty much a wash in that regard. Online bill paying is fast and convenient and since the cards are primarily designed to be used with direct deposit, online bill paying is a logical extension. Many consumers who find prepaid cards advantageous don’t have other bank accounts so this presents yet another opportunity to enjoy a common modern banking benefit. BankFREEDOM card users can also elect to receive notification of account transactions and balances by email or text messages.","Purchases with BankFREEDOM cards are limited to $2,000 daily and naturally can’t exceed the available balance on the card. Cash withdrawals from ATMs are limited to $500 per day. These limits are slightly stricter than those imposed by some other care issuers though they’re probably adequate for most users’ needs.","BankFREEDOM prepaid Visa and MasterCards are most beneficial and economical when you arrange direct deposit of any recurring income. This includes not only paychecks, but also government benefits such as social security or welfare payments. Making the deposits is free of charge, and several other fees are waived as well. Tax refunds can also be deposited in this way, which will result in quicker receipt than waiting for a check through the mail. Whether by direct or any other deposit method, the maximum amount that can be deposited to a BankFREEDOM card is $10,000. If a balance exceeds that amount, no further deposits can be made until the total goes below that figure.","Funds can be transferred to a BankFREEDOM card from accounts at banks or credit unions using the common ACH (automated clearing house) connection. BankFREEDOM doesn’t impose a charge for this service, though the transferring institution may. Such bank-to-card transfers are limited to $1,000. Money can also be transferred from one BankFREEDOM card to another without charge, but card-to-card transfers can’t exceed $500. Bank-to-card or card-to-card transfers are further limited to one transaction per day, a total of four transactions weekly, and ten transactions per month.","You can make cash deposits to your BankFREEDOM card by purchasing a MoneyPak at one of the thousands of Green Dot retailers nationwide. They’re located inside a wide variety of grocery, drug and convenience stores and can easily be located online. There is a $4.95 fee for using this service, and deposits can be for as little as $20 up to as much as $500 each. The transactions are also limited to two per day, four per week and ten per month.","BankFREEDOM’s web site is informative and will answer most questions about the program that you likely to have. Their customer service representatives are courteous and informative. We suspect that most of your interactions with BankFREEDOM will be conducted by online account access. There’s also a free automated voice response system available. There is a charge of $2.00 per call to talk to a live representative, but the service is free for customers who use the direct deposit option."]},"id":"e4ea75a9-90d6-441e-85ae-d3ff3bc717cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5bc3bbcb-0881-4577-9257-0f6179503ea3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BankFREEDOM prepaid MasterCard and Visa cards offer a reasonable alternative to traditional credit cards.
