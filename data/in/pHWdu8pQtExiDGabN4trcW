It also has the lowest capacity of any of the products in our upright freezer reviews with 12.8 cubic feet of space. Yet, on the plus side, it is an affordable freezer that gets the job done.","It has three stationary shelves that create four open spaces of various sizes, which will accommodate different-sized containers and foods. It also has five door bins for food you want easy access to. This freezer doesn’t allow you to customize the space. It also lacks a reversible door. In other words, this is not a versatile freezer. If you need variability, you’ll have to find a freezer with a few more features.","More importantly, this freezer lacks convenience features, such as frost-free and auto-defrost capabilities, which are quite common in current freezer models. This means at some point you may need to get out your chisel and start chipping away at the frost or empty the freezer out and defrost it yourself. It also has no interior light so it will have to reside in a room that is well lit so you can see the contents of your freezer. The only feature that could arguably be seen as an extra is a recessed door handle on the side to go along with the big handle in front.","While the price is good, there are other freezers out there in the same price range with better feature packages. With all of that said, there is one very big plus to this freezer and that is its efficiency. The estimated yearly operating costs are substantially less than that of any freezer in our lineup. Because of its pared-down feature package, it uses significantly less energy than any of the other freezers we reviewed. So, while you could argue that this Frigidaire freezer should be even more affordable than it is upfront, it delivers when it comes to overall savings on utility bills. It’s also safe for the environment."]},"id":"dd298f86-6c35-4360-ad63-7e314ddf651d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d1faa3fc-126a-4cf3-8f24-52518d7a95a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Frigidaire FFFU13M1QW is a freezer with basic design and functionality.
