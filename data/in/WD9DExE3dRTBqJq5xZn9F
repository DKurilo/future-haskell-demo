It is FAA compliant and offers rear-facing and front-facing positions. Unfortunately, the car seat does not have energy-absorbing foam or an adjustable headrest. Also, the seat does not recline. It is best used as a car seat that transfers from vehicle to vehicle or on an airplane.","Although the Apt 40RF lacks energy-absorbing foam and an adjustable headrest, it passes federal crash safety tests. It is one of the few convertible car seats that should support any child in its rear-facing position for the recommended two years, securing a child from 5 to 40 pounds and up to 40 inches. Its front-facing position is far less impressive, with a weight range of 22 to 40 pounds and a height maximum of 43 inches.","Like all convertible car seats, the Apt 40RF is not compatible with any strollers or travel systems. Instead, it stays in your car full time. The cushions have thin padding, so the car seat will get uncomfortable for your baby during long trips. Also, it lacks a reclining function, so you have to use pool noodles to get it at the correct angle. It does have two built-in cup holders, so your child can have a drink and a snack on either side. Also, the fabrics are machine washable, so it is easy to clean and care for.","Cosco supports the Apt 40RF with a one-year warranty. You can download a new user manual online. The website does not have a local retailer search function, but it does list the stores that carry each seat. Customer service is available by email and phone, but we had difficulty making contact through either method. Telephone is more reliable, since you can leave a message to have a representative call you back later."]},"id":"1071afc3-fb43-4e46-a086-b5cb0a88ebce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"581df8e6-6a9d-4f03-998a-573be952afe6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cosco Apt 40RF is a great secondary baby car seat, thanks to its low weight and affordable price.
