And in many ways, its size shows. For example, the process of buying a policy and the company’s reliance on agents makes it feel less developed than other providers. However, the company posted above-average customer satisfaction scores.","American Family Insurance&#39;s quote tool is a short form designed to collect your personal information and ask very basic questions about your home, like if you have pets or run a business out of the house. In total, there are only 14 questions. This makes it one of the easiest quote tools to use, but it doesn&#39;t provide you with much information after. By comparison, <a href=\"/state-farm-insurance-review\">State Farm&#39;s</a> quote tool has 123 questions and results in a detailed quote you can purchase on the spot. In reality, American Family Insurance’s quote tool is just an information collector, providing a lead to an insurance agent who calls or emails you.","It’s not a bad idea to get a quote from an insurance agent. Agents are licensed experts in the nuances of insurance, and local agents understand the characteristics and risks particular to your community as well as how they apply to coverages. However, the downside to this short quote process is it does nothing to tell you where American Family Insurance stands compared to other companies. Even if you want to purchase a plan through an agent, it&#39;s better to have a rough idea of how each provider&#39;s policy compares before you start the conversation. It&#39;s easy to whittle the list down to a few insurers, allowing you to have just two or three conversations with local agents rather than 10.","American Family earned a customer satisfaction score of 812 in J.D. Power’s 2017 study. For comparison, the average score of the 31 companies evaluated was 808, so it&#39;s slightly above average. American Family certainly doesn’t have the reputation of <a href=\"/amica-mutual-review\">Amica Mutual</a>, which has earned the award for best customer satisfaction from J.D. Power for 16 straight years. Still, it&#39;s a good bet you’ll be happy with your service if you choose this provider. In fact, American Family received three circles out of five in every category in the study – price, claims, policy offerings, interaction and billing – a rating defined as &#34;about average.&#34;","Despite American Family&#39;s focus on agents in the quote process, its agent finder tool isn&#39;t as developed as other providers’. While it’s easy to find local agents, the agent pages are very barebones. Each agent has a personalized bio and lists their availability, but their page doesn’t display user reviews, languages spoken or community engagement.","American Family Insurance is a relatively small insurance company, though it has plenty of assets to financially handle claims. However, the quote tool doesn&#39;t make it easy to compare  policies with other providers, as it requires you to talk to an agent."]},"id":"eb35cd49-8c50-46a9-b755-dfcc363cc21e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49020","url":"/american-family-insurance-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-03-18T01:48:37Z","datePublished":"2010-03-18T01:48:37Z","name":"American Family","synopsis":"American Family Insurance is one of the smaller homeowners insurance companies in the U.S. with a total asset value of about $20 billion, according to its 2017 financial report.
