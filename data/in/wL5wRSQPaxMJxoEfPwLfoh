You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","All-in-one computers offer a lot of advantages when compared to laptops and traditional PCs. The HP Envy 23-d060qd TouchSmart is a great addition to any home with its elegant design that&#39;s sure to look great in any office or room.","This all-in-one desktop has a powerful processor with high speed, so you can watch movies and play games. Another great feature is the home PC&#39;s touchscreen that makes using the computer more enjoyable.","In general, all-in-one PCs are not ideal for gamers. However, the HP Envy 23-d060qd TouchSmart can handle games fairly well. It&#39;s also capable of syncing with your Windows Live and Xbox Live accounts, making operation between systems dynamic.","The standout feature of the HP Envy 23-d060qd TouchSmart is its 23-inch HD touchscreen. Whether you&#39;re watching movies, reading news on the web or playing games, all of it looks beautiful on this monitor.","Powerful speakers from Beats by Dre supplement this large screen to complete the entertainment package. If staying connected with family and friends is important, you’ll appreciate the fact that the included webcam records HD video for video conferences. Finally, this Envy is one of the few computers we reviewed with a Blu-ray drive standard in the unit.","Like many all-in-one PC manufacturers, HP offers optional features that raise the initial costs, but for the Envy the list of options is much smaller.  All of the essential components come standard with this Envy, and we appreciate seeing a product that gives you everything up front without trying to nickel and dime you later. Of the additional features, you can buy a TV tuner or an HDMI input option. However, these would only be useful if you&#39;re trying to replace your home television. Even without those options, the Envy TouchSmart is a top entertainment hub and a fantastic all-in-one PC.","The only downside of the Envy is its lack of USB ports: There are only two 3.0 USB ports. If you use USB devices, like an external hard drive, flash drive or MP3 player, you&#39;ll have to manage your plugs far more than with other all-in-one PCs we reviewed. Fortunately, this is only a problem if you have several USB-based devices. If you plan on primarily using Windows 8 apps or surfing the web, the lack of inputs and outputs will not take away from the overall functionality of the HP Envy 23-d060qd TouchSmart."]},"id":"ec903812-6447-4a75-a5fe-dbfc29d2c50c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c1d63e39-6565-496f-a78a-b47a24160cf9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Envy 23-d060qd TouchSmart handles any program you throw at it, and as an entertainment hub, this one rivals home televisions.
