This 3D printing service also offers 3D modeling assistance to help inexperienced designers bring their creations to life.","The first step in the process is designing your own product or customizing an existing design. If you’re unfamiliar with 3D design, i.materialise has a team of 3D modelers for hire who can do the design work for you. Designers turn sketches into scale 3D models that can then be printed for personal use or sold in the online 3D printing store. If you prefer to tackle the design yourself, i.materialise supports a number of apps you can use to customize existing designs. This flexibility makes this 3D printing service available to those who are new to 3D design and those who have mastered the art. Design guides, technical specifications and a comparison tool help make the platform accessible.","Once you’ve settled on a design, it needs to be uploaded to the i.materialise website. After you upload your design, you can choose from 17 different materials to make your product. Precious metals, plastics and ceramics are among the options you can choose from. In addition to a selection of materials, this 3D printing company also lets you choose between 90 combinations of different materials and finishes to customize your product. Throughout the process, i.materialise provides technical advice and feedback on how design specifications will impact your product and its price. Then, once your product design is complete, you receive an immediate price quote. There’s no minimum or maximum order requirements.","Once your product is complete, you can sell it through i.materialise’s online store. When a customer buys your product, the 3D printing service creates and ships it directly to them. That means you can manage a virtual storefront without worrying about inventory, invoicing or distribution. Fashion accessories, games, jewelry, art, lamps are among the items on sale in these online boutiques.","3D modeling services and technical advice make i.materialise an accessible option for those who are new to 3D design and printing. However, more experienced developers can also use their preferred software platform to create and sell their creations around the world."]},"id":"bcad613f-0369-4f3b-85eb-b4b29ac8e2b7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66929","url":"/i-materialise-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:54:05Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:54:05Z","name":"i.materialise","synopsis":"The online 3D printing service i.materialise allows users to upload designs, print products and sell them online.
