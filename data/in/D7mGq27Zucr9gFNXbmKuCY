Although it is more known for its cameras, it&#39;s still one of the number one binocular producers as well. Its optics have high-contrast negatives that give you sharp resolution. The sleek Nikon Monarch ATB 8x42 earns a less-prominent place on our lineup because it lacks sharpness for activities such as wildlife viewing.","Out of all the binoculars we reviewed, the Monarch has a surprisingly small linear field of view. Most others ranged between 110 and 140 meters, but these Nikon binoculars only allow you to see 100 meters. A difference of 10 to 40 meters doesn&#39;t seem like much, but we found it&#39;s a big chunk that is cut out of your overall view. &#34;The more the better&#34; definitely applies here.","The Nikon Monarch ATB binoculars also lack fully multi-coated lenses. Although multi-coated lenses are popular, the best option is to put those multiple layers on all the glass-to-air surfaces for the best possible clarity and contrast. Glass-to-air coatings also allow for transmission with the most light, which is a basic requirement for binoculars to perform optimally. Without these lens coatings, the Monarch isn&#39;t a competitive product.","This pair of binoculars has dielectric coating on the prisms, which is a rare feature. The lenses allow the most possible light to transmit and the dielectric coatings provide more than 99 percent reflectivity. This impressive feature makes these binoculars truly superior in terms of lenses, but that is not enough to overcome some of its competitors in other ways.","The Monarch ATB is distinctively portable. It only weighs 21.5 ounces, making it the lightest full size set of binoculars we reviewed. Like the other binoculars we researched, it also comes with a carrying strap, which makes it easier than carrying it by hand, something you should keep in mind as you learn how to buy binoculars."]},"id":"d4df70ea-6584-436a-80e9-77d8b26e6345","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f0d0a7e4-7469-44c3-9984-540dc63fa4ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are some great advantages in the build and coating of these binoculars, but the optics do not quite measure up to them.
