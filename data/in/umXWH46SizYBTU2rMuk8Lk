We felt these flaws were big enough to justify a low rank in our comparison, despite August&#39;s excellence in our other tests. August fixed the issues through software updates, but we couldn&#39;t re-evaluate our scores at the time.","In our latest round of security tests, we found that this version of the August Smart Lock met most of our expectations. In particular, we like the newest August feature: DoorSense, which we think is one of the best security features you can get in a smart lock.","DoorSense brings door sensor functionality to the August Smart Lock so it can track if your door&#39;s open and send you an alert if it&#39;s left ajar. It seems like a simple feature, but it helps eliminate any doubts that your door&#39;s closed and secure.

This is because August Smart Lock is a retrofit that upgrades the deadbolt you already have. It relies on the strength of the existing deadbolt to protect against forced entry and tampering, which often accompany burglars. Similarly, it lacks audible tones to tell you when it&#39;s working, and it doesn&#39;t have a siren to deter intruders from entering your home. It also doesn&#39;t detect when someone tampers with your lock or tries to force the door open.","Aside from security, August Smart Lock is one of the easiest smart locks to use. The lock&#39;s mobile app lets you send permanent, recurring and temporary keys to your guests. This smart lock has an effective auto-unlock feature, which uses your phone&#39;s location to track when you get close to home and unlocks as you approach the door. Similarly, August Smart Lock auto-locks your door.","We found that it takes around 10 minutes to install the August Smart Lock. This is mostly due to an innovative universal mounting plate that works with any brand of deadbolt."]},"id":"a25e454d-98a4-4b9e-a460-40c73184ff9f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/HLpWQAUpuUWrnd8hSzyLne.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60618-august-smart-lock8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HLpWQAUpuUWrnd8hSzyLne.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"HLpWQAUpuUWrnd8hSzyLne","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HLpWQAUpuUWrnd8hSzyLne.jpg","alt":""},"id":"3974a47b-c8b4-4a69-af04-14e669453d9e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The lock comes in two finish options and has an estimated battery life of three months, which is the shortest in our comparison.
