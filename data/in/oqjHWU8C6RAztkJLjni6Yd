The Fisher Price Power Wheels Dune Racer is an excellent way to get your child behind the wheel and learning how to drive. This off-road <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">ride on toy</a> features the Monster Traction drive system, which ultimately allows the vehicle to go on hard surfaces, wet grass and other types of difficult terrain.","The Power Wheels Dune Racer is pieces together with a sturdy steel frame and an open cockpit design that allows up to two passengers, up to 130 pounds. The vehicle has two forward drive speeds, 2.5-MPH and 5-MPH, one reverse speed and a 12-volt rechargeable battery, which means your child will be able to drive for hours.","This dune racer is designed specifically to navigate on rough terrain. It touts big tires with treads that retain traction to keep from getting stuck in wet or overgrown grass, gravel and even mud. The vehicle&#39;s suspension mitigates bumpy terrain like roots, ruts, sidewalk and driveway edges, and garden hoses.","The rims, bumper, and shifter are sleek chrome that magnificently highlights the green plastic exterior. The racer has a pair of metal sidebars for hand supports, as well as &#34;pretend seatbelts&#34; with a simple hook and loop fastener to get your child in the habit of buckling up before driving. The interior of the vehicle is designed with safety in mind and has nothing but smooth contours and rounded edges.","The Fisher Price Power Wheels Dune Racer caters to both beginner and advanced young drivers with its speed system. It has a power lock braking system that will automatically stop the vehicle when your child lifts their foot from the gas pedal. The vehicle has gearshift with the option to lock out the high-speed setting for beginners. If you don&#39;t want your child going faster than 2.5-MPH, this is a handy feature. Although is may not seem like it, there is a significant different between 2.5 and 5MPH.","This dune racer will surely be a hit with your children, who will be able to explore the rough terrain in the neighborhood and learn to drive a safe, simple vehicle. While this is a rather expensive Power Wheels model, unlike our budget pick - the <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">Mini Cooper</a> - it has all the features to keep your child safe."]},"id":"40442eeb-ea64-411e-929a-7b129e47ee17","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55388","url":"/fisher-price-power-wheels-dune-racer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-15T17:14:53Z","datePublished":"2012-11-15T17:14:53Z","name":"Dune Racer","synopsis":"If you've ever seen a dune racer before, you know that those vehicles are built for speed and agility on treacherous terrain.
