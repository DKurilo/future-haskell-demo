Thanks to the continuing advances in our high-tech electronics and communications, including the internet, cell phones, smartphones and MP3 players, we have all kinds of information literally a mouse click or touchscreen away.","Sometimes the constant fluctuations, changes and upgrades happen so fast that it seems impossible to keep up with them. Every day we are bombarded with commercials and ads extolling the virtues of the newest smartphone app, or by little pop-up windows on our desktops that appear when we power up our computers, asking us if we want to upgrade to the latest version of one of our applications.","There are several obvious reasons why these upgrades are necessary; however, there are also some reasons why it makes sense to prudently protect all of your precious data from the proliferation of complex and malicious computer viruses.","<strong>Malwarebytes</strong>  Anti-Malware (MBAM) is one of a number of <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">anti-virus software</a> applications readily available to you, some of which are free downloads. While the majority of anti-virus software is legitimately helpful and effective, some rogue anti-virus software out there can be just as devastating as the viruses they claim to counteract.","Some fake or rogue anti-malware software will display a warning message pertaining to Malwarebytes. A few of these scam anti-virus software providers go so far as to advocate the removal of MBAM. It is easy to fall for these types of scare tactics, but you do not have anything to worry about when it comes to Malwarebytes.","If you do not know what Malwarebytes is, don&#39;t feel bad. Feel lucky that you&#39;ve probably never needed it or anything similar to it due to a virus infecting your computer.<br/>To put it simply, Malwarebytes is an application that was created and developed by the by Malwarebytes Corporation in 2008 that hunts down and destroys viruses and other insidious malware.","There is a free version of Malwarebytes that looks for and eliminates malware, but it needs to be started manually. The MBAM version that you pay for performs scans automatically on a scheduled basis, gives you concurrent protection and has an optional flash-memory scan feature.","Some of the other important features available with Malwarebytes  Anti-Malware include support for Windows 2000, XP and Vista operating systems, fast scanning, full scans for all of your drives and updates to your database that are released at least once every two days. It also provides a quarantine feature to hold threats and then resolve them when it is convenient for you.","So, to be clear, Malwarebytes is a legal and legitimate anti-malware software application. It was created to serve as the replacement for the vendor&#39;s earlier offering, RogueRemover.<br/>Over the years since it was released, Malwarebytes has turned out to be one of the most popular and widely used anti-virus and malware-removal software applications that is made to aid both home and corporate computer users alike.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "," "]},"id":"175082eb-075a-44d8-b06d-89d4764b59ca","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6423","url":"/it-safe-to-use-malwarebytes","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kevin-hanson","url":"/author/kevin-hanson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kevin Hanson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"n2jia7cYUP6qJufA9FCgMW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-10T16:59:06Z","datePublished":"2011-08-10T16:59:06Z","name":"Is it Safe to Use Malwarebytes?","synopsis":"It has been said that we live in the Information Age.","review":{},"strapline":"It has been said that we live in the Information Age.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-10T17:52:15Z","id":"WUiuqCPNYhw8B7NDShW9zB","meta":{"title":"Is it Safe to Use Malwarebytes?","description":"Malwarebytes is one of the most popular and widely used anti-virus and malware-removal software applications for both home and corporate computer users alike."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:55:54Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7sT9UbPx4wSiD9hPnmB9Dm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:55:54Z","mimeType":"","name":"6423-it-safe-to-use-malwarebytes-.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6423-it-safe-to-use-malwarebytes-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:55:54Z","id":"7sT9UbPx4wSiD9hPnmB9Dm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sT9UbPx4wSiD9hPnmB9Dm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Is it Safe to Use Malwarebytes?","description":"Malwarebytes is one of the most popular and widely used anti-virus and malware-removal software applications for both home and corporate computer users alike."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7sT9UbPx4wSiD9hPnmB9Dm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:55:54Z","mimeType":"","name":"6423-it-safe-to-use-malwarebytes-.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6423-it-safe-to-use-malwarebytes-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:55:54Z","id":"7sT9UbPx4wSiD9hPnmB9Dm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sT9UbPx4wSiD9hPnmB9Dm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Is it Safe to Use Malwarebytes?","description":"Malwarebytes is one of the most popular and widely used anti-virus and malware-removal software applications for both home and corporate computer users alike."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/articles/it-safe-to-use-malwarebytes/","label":"","tags":[]}
