The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/services/entertainment/best-sports-tickets/\">Sports Ticket Websites</a> here.</em>","CheapTickets is a fairly lackluster sports ticket company, offering enough features to maintain credibility, yet falling shy of its top-rated competitors. But there are some features to like. For instance, the interactive venue maps are truly spectacular.","CheapTickets sells tickets at a surcharge rate of 15 percent, which is fairly common among online sports tickets providers. Shipping and handling is given at the flat rate of $15, which can prove beneficial over a percentage when tickets are ordered in larger quantities. Speeding the delivery of your order from 2-3 days to 1-2 days costs an extra $10.","CheapTickets offers ticket searches by city and athletic organization. However, athletic team schedules and city searches are neither intuitive nor easy to comprehend, making the service difficult to use. CheapTickets does allow users to sell tickets with a 30 percent broker’s fee, making it one of the pricier online sports tickets companies around.","The range of sports offered is impressively wide. This may not be the best-designed site but you can find pretty much any sporting event you can think of. Cheap Tickets may not have tickets available but we like that they keep things like lacrosse and other lesser-knowns on the radar.","As mentioned, we love the interactive maps offered on this site. This is because lots of sports tickets sites have venue maps but Cheap Tickets offers a lot of detail. When you click on a section of the stadium or other venue that has available seats you get ticket information for that seating area – the prices and quantity. That’s pretty typical. What is amazing are the high-quality photos that also pop up on your screen that show you what your view would look like from the seats you selected. This is not available for every venue on the site but it is such a bonus when it is available. Sometimes it is difficult to picture the orientation of your seats unless you already know the stadium in question really well. If only all venue maps offered the photos.","Apart from the awesome interactive maps CheapTickets is not our favorite for ease of use. The site is very cluttered, with ticket information often hard to find or easy to miss. This site does have a pretty good search function though. Typing in just one word from the name of the city, team or event would yield the game we had in mind almost every time. <br/>CheapTickets offers technical support and assistance in the form of telephone and email support, while also hosting a FAQs section for quick reference to information regarding the services of the site."]},"id":"233b8a2a-2648-49c3-ba4e-1843afc87819","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9e1343d6-37b7-49fa-b593-5f31905783b4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though CheapTickets does in fact sell sports tickets, its main focus seems to be its hotel and travel services.
