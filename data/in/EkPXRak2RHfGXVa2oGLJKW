While this means you don’t have to purchase replacement ink, you can’t print in color with this device. Also, it can be hard to get your hands on the specialty paper it requires, which is similar to the receipt paper most stores use. You need to carefully select between long-lasting and regular thermal paper, depending on how long you want to archive documents, and it may be worth buying the kind that you can write on – because the surface is slippery, it can be difficult to write on normal thermal paper.  <br />\n <br />\nThe battery isn’t included with the printer, but if you choose to buy one, it allows you to print up to 600 pages on a single charge. You can also by accessories, such as a car charger, that give you some additional flexibility.

We’ve run extensive hands-on tests in our lab to evaluate each one’s design, battery power and print quality, and the results allow us to make informed comparisons between the machines.","We test machines and update our compact printer reviews regularly to make sure we don’t miss the newest models that hit the market. Since ink or thermal paper is an ongoing expense when you own a compact printer, we broke down their prices to give you a sense of how much it will cost you to print with the machine over time. We also compared the printer&#39;s specifications to narrow down our selection to the top performers. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","Because portability is important to consider when choosing a mobile printer, we used hands-on tests to evaluate each machine’s weight and size, then assigned it a score. In addition, we researched each printer’s battery life and checked to see if the battery was included or had to be purchased separately, which affects the device’s value. Batteries that print a lot of documents on a single charge fared better in our comparison.","We examined hundreds of sample documents, dozens printed with each device we reviewed. During our tests, we printed the same samples on each machine and compared their output quality, looking for frequency of printing errors such as spotting, streaking or bleeding. In addition, we compared the machines’ print resolution side by side.","After looking at the machines&#39; output quality, we assigned each one a grade based on its performance. Printers that produced readable test with some noticeable errors received a C grade, while with B grades performed about average with only a few errors. We reserved A grades for printers that create easy-to-read text with few to no errors. Most users won&#39;t be satisfied with a printer that earned a grade lower than a C. ","Ongoing ink or thermal paper costs are important to consider when buying a compact printer, so we noted which ones require specialty paper and which use standard 8.5 x 11 printer paper. We also compared the cost of ink for each printer we reviewed – we broke this information down to how much it costs per page to print with each machine so it’s easy to compare the long-term expense of owning each one.","Finally, we looked at the rest of the printer’s features, noting if it includes Wi-Fi and other connectivity options like USB or Bluetooth. Online support is essential for printers these days, and some printers connect to mobile devices with popular cloud programs, while others use proprietary apps. <br/><strong><br/>How Much Does a Compact Printer Cost?</strong>","Compact printers tend to be pricier than all-in-one models because of their size and how portable they are as well as their batteries. The compact printers we tested range from around $75 to just under $400, and the average price of a compact printer is around $250 – a little more than double the cost of an average all-in-one model. However, the priciest compact printers aren’t necessarily the best investment. You can get great print quality and functionality without paying a premium. For the best value, look at models that cost around $200.<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a Compact Mobile Printer </strong>","Printer Design<br/>Generally, the lighter a mobile printer is the better. However, we looked for models that balance features and quality with their compact size. As you look at a mobile printer, check its dimensions to see if it’ll fit inside of the carrier you typically use, like a laptop bag or backpack.","Another important consideration is the battery life. Check to see how many documents you can print or days you can go before you need to recharge the battery. If you have to plug the battery in regularly, it impacts the printer’s overall portability.","Output<br/>Print quality is one of the most important considerations when buying any kind of printer, so we looked at documents printed by each machine under high magnification. Since you likely won’t compare sample documents side by side in person as you choose a printer, we suggest comparing their print resolutions, which is a good indicator of how much detail a printer can recreate in images. The higher the numbers, the better the resolution. Smaller, high-resolution printers usually cost more. So, you may have to compromise on resolution and portability to find something in your price range.","We looked for printers that can standard-size, 8.5 x 11 documents, but the more flexibility you have in your paper choice the better. While all the printers we considered handle standard-size paper, watch for special paper requirements. For example, the <a href=\"/brother-pocketjet-review\">Brother PocketJet PJ723</a> uses thermal paper.","Manufacturers list printer speed in the machines’ specs, but we timed the models we reviewed to approximate their speed in real-world conditions. Based on what you’re using the printer for, speed may be important to consider.","Ink &amp; Media<br/>You want to check to see what types of cartridges your inkjet compact printer uses. If it takes high-yield cartridges, you can usually shave off a few cents per page. Or you might consider a printer that uses thermal print technology like the PocketJet PJ723, though the specialty paper these machines use comes at its own expense.","Pay attention to the printer’s regular output specifications, including the maximum number of pages the manufacturer suggests printing per month, called the monthly duty cycle. Regularly printing above this number can wear the machine down faster and cause damage, so make sure the duty cycle matches up with your needs.","Connectivity<br/>Printers that connect to a variety of online storage and cloud systems are more useful, especially now that so much is stored digitally. Check to make sure you’re preferred cloud storage program is supported by your printer.","<strong>Best Discount Ink Stores </strong>","We spent weeks searching for the <a href=\"/best-discount-ink-cartridges-stores\">best place to buy replacement ink cartridges</a> for printers made by the most popular brands. In addition to price, we evaluated store policies and inventory. We also compared online stores with nationwide brick-and-mortar retailers to ensure the online services are a good value. Here are the best discount ink stores we could find:","<a href=\"/4inkjets-review\">4inkjets</a><br/>This online discount ink cartridge store has OEM and remanufactured cartridges for all the major printer brands, including HP, Canon and Xerox. In case you have problems with the cartridges, the site allows you to return them up to two years after purchase. We found cheaper places to buy replacement cartridges online, but 4inkjets&#39; convenient payment options, large stock of ink and inventory of other printing supplies make it the best place to buy discount ink.","<a href=\"/499inks-review\">499inks</a><br/>499inks doesn’t carry as wide a variety of cartridges as 4inkjets nor does it have as generous of a return policy, but its prices are the absolute lowest. Based on our test results, on average, it costs only 4 cents per page to print with cartridges purchased from 499inks, compared to 6 cents per page with cartridges bought from 4inkjets. This discount ink store also sends monthly coupons that further discount its already low prices. The site is easy to navigate and has an intuitive search feature, but you must pay for shipping on order less than $49.","Costco<br/>You need a membership to shop at this brick-and-mortar retailer, but its ink cartridge refills only cost between $9 and $15, depending on the type of cartridge. Costco teamed up with 4inkjets to offer an alternative to buying discount ink cartridges online. The replacement ink is the same quality offered on 4inkjets, but you don’t need to worry about shipping charges or waiting for delivery."]},"id":"d8ef8c3a-a47c-4ac1-986d-715495ad6ea4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_107","url":"/best-compact-printers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-08T21:42:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-08T21:42:00Z","name":"Best Compact Printers of 2019","synopsis":"We tested each printer to see how well it prints, but how portable it is, how easy it is to use, and how much it costs to maintain and run.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested each printer to see how well it prints, but how portable it is, how easy it is to use, and how much it costs to maintain and run.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-14T19:23:14Z","id":"EkPXRak2RHfGXVa2oGLJKW","meta":{"title":"Best Compact Printers 2019 - Small, Portable Wi-Fi Printer Reviews","description":"We tested each printer to see how well it prints, but how portable it is, how easy it is to use, and how much it costs to maintain and run."},"products":[{"slug":"hp-officejet-all-in-one-250","url":"/product/hp-officejet-all-in-one-250","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","name":"HP OfficeJet All-in-One 250","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"efLjcjZT9u8LNHXcPYFx9C","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"hp-officejet-mobile-200","url":"/product/hp-officejet-mobile-200","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","name":"HP OfficeJet Mobile 200","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"MTZrnSZczBxjYHQHZ7MFYZ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"brother-pocketjet-7-pj723","url":"/product/brother-pocketjet-7-pj723","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","name":"Brother PocketJet 7 PJ723","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"LCfjVpLGjFzu5rRxVorZv5","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"hp-deskjet-3755","url":"/product/hp-deskjet-3755","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","name":"HP DeskJet 3755","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"4Ep39oaFRbwTqdtqk8MD76","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"epson-wf-100","url":"/product/epson-wf-100","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","name":"Epson WF-100","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"HLVE2zzz7UpmjL3mabZihi","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LjRJ2aYFLYncHtna7u2hGh.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO_compact-printers.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/I/0/738072/original/HERO_compact-printers.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"LjRJ2aYFLYncHtna7u2hGh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LjRJ2aYFLYncHtna7u2hGh.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Compact Printers of 2019","description":"We tested each printer to see how well it prints, but how portable it is, how easy it is to use, and how much it costs to maintain and run."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/LjRJ2aYFLYncHtna7u2hGh.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO_compact-printers.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/I/0/738072/original/HERO_compact-printers.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"LjRJ2aYFLYncHtna7u2hGh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LjRJ2aYFLYncHtna7u2hGh.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Compact Printers of 2019","description":"We tested each printer to see how well it prints, but how portable it is, how easy it is to use, and how much it costs to maintain and run."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"printers","url":"/electronics/printers","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","name":"Printers","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:02Z","id":"bYdS7uvxQq3ge9dTcDCt7c","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
