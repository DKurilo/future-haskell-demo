note: A newer version of this product is available. We will evaluate, rank and review the new version of this product when we next update the Meal Planning Software reviews.<br/></em>","Cook‘n Recipe Organizer, developed by DVO Enterprises, is a family-friendly company that has created one of the best <a href=\"/best-cookbook-and-recipe-software\">meal planning software</a> titles in the world, with over three million copies sold, and we&#39;re pleased to award it our Top Ten Reviews Silver Award. Cook’n has been a household name in the meal planning software world since the 1990’s and they have created a smart design for their meal planning tool and their application provides the most detailed nutritional information available for over 10,000 food products.","We were delighted with the huge recipe database that this menu planner can support. Also, when you purchase Cook’n Recipe Organizer, you receive a free download of one of their high-quality cookbooks. Cook’n has published dozens of cookbooks and partnered with Pillsbury and Betty Crocker to provide users with an extensive choice of recipes. You can also download additional cookbooks for an additional price. If you’d like as many recipes as you can get your hands on, you will get up to 40,000 brand-name recipes by purchasing all of their cookbooks. And if you join their Cook’n Club, you will receive a free cookbook download each month.","Another top feature that makes Cook’n one of the best meal planning software packages is their shopping list unit converter. A common problem when adding recipe ingredients to your grocery list is converting what the recipe calls for into units that can actually be purchased. Cook’n does the converting automatically, telling you the exact amount to buy at the store. For example if a recipe calls for 12 cups of marinara sauce, Cook’n will convert the cups into milliliters, telling you what size of jar to buy, and how many."]},"id":"6e1587c1-36bb-4d59-98a5-f3c5917949f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Meal Planning Features"},"id":"c9849e16-43cc-4b3a-93f7-76430d19571c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Creating menus using Cook’n is a cinch. The versatile Menu Labels function gives you complete control of your menu planning strategy. Label your menus by day, week, by course (main entrée, side dishes, dessert, beverage, etc.), or let the meal stand alone. You can easily drag and drop recipes or single ingredients into menu plans.","Cook’n has several enhanced meal planning features that are sure to impress, especially in its latest edition. Many fun cookbooks are available for purchase, including cookbooks for ethnic dishes like Mexican and Italian and cookbooks for managing specific health issues such as diabetes, gluten-free and low calorie diets.","Personalization and style can be added to your menus by using Cook’n’s newest function - menu themes. Their menu themes are bright, colorful menu templates that add flair to your recipes and make meal planning more exciting than ever. Add a fun ocean theme to a fancy seafood menu or add graphics to your daily menus to delight your family or customers."]},"id":"0ec46f6a-c36d-41aa-838a-fdd247d0cfe5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Shopping Tools"},"id":"4d4a2ecc-7781-4b00-90f1-d0edafa2846d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Another detail we love about this excellent meal planning software is their Shopping List function.

Once you’ve finished planning your meal, click the List button at the top of your screen and Cook’n will automatically compile a shopping list for your upcoming meals and combining like items to save money. The function also organizes your list by produce, meats, dry goods, etc. to make your shopping trip quick and painless.","A wonderful and impressive feature about Cook’n is their Brand database. Their Foods area has a huge detailed list of over 10,000 food items; one of the largest found in any other meal planning software. Cook’n has entered the various brand names that are available for any specified food item so you can browse at home before you buy at the store. They also list the price for each product under the listed brand, as well as package size and nutritional facts. This is a function you won’t find anywhere else.
