It is available in three colors and carries a three-year warranty.","This is one of the Clear-Tek blankets manufactured by Doheny&#39;s Water Warehouse. Like most solar pool covers, its material is polyethylene, and it has an underside full of raised air pockets that make it look like a big sheet of bubble wrap. The solar cover is 8 mils thick. It is thinner than most pool covers, but that also makes it light and easy to spread and roll up. While a thin blanket allows more sunlight in than a thicker blanket, it is less durable and less effective at trapping captured thermal energy in a pool. Doheny&#39;s covers this solar pool cover with a three-year warranty.","The air bubbles on the underside of this solar blanket are responsible for the blanket&#39;s ability to keep a swimming pool warm. The air pockets in the bubbles capture thermal energy from sunlight and trap it below the blanket in the body of water. They also insulate the water in the pool from the cooling effect of the air blowing over the surface of the water. By blocking convectional heat loss, the solar pool cover keeps pools heated for longer. This solar blanket captures and traps thermal energy to make a pool warm enough for swimming at night and as the weather gets colder. On average, it can raise the temperature of your swimming pool by 15 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the bubbles on its underside are not the only means by which Doheny&#39;s Clear-Tek blankets can help reduce the cost of heating your pool.","The colors of pool blankets are important to their ability to heat pools. The Doheny&#39;s BlueBlue Solar Cover come in three colors: all-blue, all-clear and a shade of blue that is 50 percent blue and 50 percent clear. The latter two fall under Doheny&#39;s Clear-Tek color schemes. Unlike blue or colored pool covers, clear covers do not absorb much of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, they outperform colored covers at directly heating swimming pools with sunlight. However, some people prefer the aesthetics of blue covers. The <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Leslieâ€™s 5-Year</a> is a blue solar blanket with technology that increases its absorption of solar heat, making it more effective at heating pools than the average blue solar blanket.","The Doheny&#39;s BlueBlue Solar Cover is a thin pool blanket with a short warranty and no UV protection. However, it is lightweight and has air bubbles, and the Clear-Tek clear and blue color maximizes its ability to heat up pools and keep them warm while giving the pool cover a dash of color."]},"id":"f8e7df0a-036d-425e-9d50-e0be8afc86ee","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63262","url":"/dohenys-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:58:19Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:58:19Z","name":"Doheny's 8 Mil BlueBlue","synopsis":"The Doheny's BlueBlue Solar Cover is an oval solar blanket that measures 15 by 30 feet.
