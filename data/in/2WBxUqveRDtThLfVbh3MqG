This product has many benefits, including the ability to travel a long distance on a single battery charge, a lightweight design and the ability to easily climb hills. However, despite these excellent features, it doesn’t offer much in the way of other design and comfort features, like a headrest, that would help it stand out when compared to similar models we reviewed.","The highlight of this product is its long battery life. This power-operated wheelchair can travel approximately 20 miles on a single battery charge, the best battery life we saw out of the electric wheelchairs we evaluated. Additionally, this wheelchair can climb hills at a 10-degree angle.","This electric wheelchair can reach a maximum speed of 3.8 miles per hour, making it one of the slower electric wheelchairs on the lineup. It also has a wide 34-inch turning radius. This was the widest turning radius we recorded for the wheelchairs we analyzed, and such a wide radius can make maneuvering indoors difficult.","The Escape DX is lightweight, weighing only 136 pounds. The frame is made from aluminum, and the chair includes all of the basic design features you&#39;d expect, such as a seat belt, joystick mount and plenty of seat padding. However, it doesn’t feature a head rest, which can be a drawback for some riders. Overall, the specifications are average. The chair measures 36 inches tall, 27 inches wide and 43 inches long.","One of the biggest drawbacks to this product is its warranty. The frame is covered by a three-year manufacturer warranty. By comparison, other wheelchairs are covered for 10 years or more. Heartway covers all electronic components for one year or more, the average amount of time most electronic components are covered for on a motorized wheelchair."]},"id":"e4bc48cf-452b-4725-a261-e3589a0c55b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e7608ac8-2602-4c33-96d7-ccc20c9d21ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Heartway Escape DX is an good option if you want a lightweight product that has a long battery life and can easily climb hills.
