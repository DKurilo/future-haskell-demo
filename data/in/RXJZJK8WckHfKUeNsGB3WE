It’s a comfortable, speedy ride that can take you as far as you need to go. In addition, it’s one of the most comfortable and plush power scooters we reviewed.","This motorized scooter has a weight capacity of 300 pounds, which is the same as the <a href=\"/riderxpress-review\">EV RiderXpress</a> and the <a href=\"/buzzaround-xl-review\">BuzzAround XL</a> - two of the best mobility scooters that we reviewed. It&#39;s a stable ride with four wheels, so you never have to worry about tipping over or being off balance. The seat is also quite comfortable. It’s a deluxe padded captain seat that provides full back support. The seat slides and swivels for added comfort and to make it easy to get on and off the scooter. You can also adjust the height of the motorized scooter’s seat to make driving easy on your knees.","The Sunrunner has a top speed of 5 mph, which is a pretty quick clip. This is more than enough speed to get across a crosswalk or catch an elevator before the door closes.","On a single charge, this mobility scooter can travel a stunningly long 25 miles. This means you can take your wheelchair scooter outdoors all day without having to worry about being stranded. The Sunrunner has the longest range of any electric scooter we reviewed.","One of the nicest things about the Sunrunner is its high ground clearance. At 3 inches, it can easily maneuver over uneven sidewalks and even curbs if need be. Likewise, you can travel across non-paved surfaces without worrying about high-centering on an unseen obstacle or damaging the scooter’s motor.","With a turning radius of 50 inches, the Sunrunner isn’t the best at making tight turns. This is a symptom both of the scooter’s weight and its four-wheel construction. It is, however, more stable and less prone to tipping than more nimble scooters that can make quick, tight turns.","Another benefit of its full-bodied design is that the Sunrunner can travel up steeper inclines than most power scooters.  It can climb an 8-degree grade. This may seem small, but it opens up access to many places that were simply inaccessible before.","This electric wheelchair scooter disassembles easily into four pieces. The scooter weighs 180 pounds with the battery, making it the heaviest scooter we reviewed. This affects how easy the scooter is to transport, and it may be too difficult for many users to assemble or lift on their own. However, if you&#39;re planning on using the scooter outdoors for extended periods of time, the luxury feel and long battery life make it worth the extra weight.","This scooter also has a variety of safety features, such as a headlight to improve your vision at night. There are also rearview mirrors to increase your visibility, so you can see vehicles around you.","A power scooter is a major purchase, so it’s important to buy one with a good warranty. Shoprider offers a one-year limited warranty for the Sunrunner’s frame, drive train and electronic components. The company also covers the battery for six months after purchase. These are typical warranties."]},"id":"0659623b-0355-45c7-be30-0ec73a0c1813","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"754f9878-23e6-4ec7-a418-6cf6d7013fd5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can use this scooter for short trips to the mall, quick errands, long rides to the park and extended time outdoors without having to worry about your battery dying.
