This experience has helped inform many of our conclusions relating to other equipment. We apply exacting standards to each product we test, primarily focusing on performance and user-friendliness. We design our tests to simulate typical consumer experiences.","When, as in the case of solar lights, we do not test the physical product ourselves, we apply the same due diligence to make sure our information and conclusions reflect the mission of ShopSavvy.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We researched 10 solar lights (three of which are no longer available) and evaluated the specifications and pricing of each. Our research to date has taken over 40 hours. In lieu of physical testing, we looked at each product&#39;s customer reviews to find its strengths and limitations. Our final decisions are also informed by years of experience with general product testing and evaluations.<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>What to Look For </strong>","Type of Light<br/>The type of solar lights you buy depends on their intended use. Standalone solar lights work best for small areas that don&#39;t need much light. Strings of lights work best for walkways, though some can be mounted higher near patios. Post- or wall-mounted solar floodlights are excellent options to install near doors and on patios.","Brightness<br/>The level of brightness can vary considerably in solar lights. In general, solar lights won&#39;t produce as much light as ones connected to the electrical grid, but they can be effective in places where you want more ambiance, security and safety. If your focus is ambiance and illuminating walkways, then you don&#39;t need solar lights with high light output, as measured in lumens. However, if you plan to use the lights for security and illuminating walkways, it&#39;s best to choose brighter lights with high lumen ratings, preferably with motion sensors to save on battery power.","Quantity &amp; Range<br/>The number of lights to buy depends on the range of each light and the size of the area you want to illuminate. Depending on their intended use, solar lights can cast light from a range of 2 feet up to 38 feet. Lights with shorter ranges usually come in multi-packs, making them ideal for pathways and near landscaping features. In this setup, you want the light footprint from each unit to extend as far as that of nearby units; whether or not the light patterns overlap comes down to your personal preferences. If you want lights for outdoor parties or security, they should illuminate a larger area, but you won&#39;t need to buy as many.","Batteries<br/>Some solar lights let you change the batteries when needed to extend the life of the lights indefinitely, though this also means you need to buy replacement batteries occasionally. There are also solar lights with permanent batteries that you can&#39;t replace, instead you must replace the whole unit when it no longer works. Lights without replaceable batteries often cost less than the other type, but may be more wasteful.","Adjustable Settings<br/>Although most solar lights have only one setting, some are adjustable to work during the day as well. This is useful in shaded areas such as garages or workshops. However, using a solar light during the day in addition to the nighttime can drain the battery quicker."]},"id":"74c16366-72c6-406a-bbf2-c056e47649d9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_159","url":"/best-solar-lights","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-25T04:55:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-25T04:55:00Z","name":"Best Solar Lights of 2019","synopsis":"Solar lights can be used in a garden, for patio and walkway lighting; as table lamps for outdoor living areas; and as security measures.","review":{},"strapline":"Solar lights can be used in a garden, for patio and walkway lighting; as table lamps for outdoor living areas; and as security measures.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-26T19:44:34Z","id":"ZytDB9Qbboaw7aswXrg4x7","meta":{"title":"Best Outdoor Solar Lights 2019 - Landscape, Pool and Garden Lighting","description":"Solar lights can be used in a garden, for patio and walkway lighting; as table lamps for outdoor living areas; and as security measures."},"products":[{"slug":"sunforce-82156","url":"/product/sunforce-82156","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","name":"Sunforce 82156","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"HNNHNVxgynbZjLrRvPuDya","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"le-lighting-6500001-dw","url":"/product/le-lighting-6500001-dw","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","name":"LE Lighting 6500001-DW","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"446XdNjbGZbWtCAPhBXUEe","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"kenroy-home-keh-60503","url":"/product/kenroy-home-keh-60503","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","name":"Kenroy Home KEH-60503","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"zDz2rpzSaEDrp8jCZKW5od","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"sunforce-82156","url":"/product/sunforce-82156","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","name":"Sunforce 82156","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"HNNHNVxgynbZjLrRvPuDya","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/B2pLsW9qXw2BsRqtrgEB4T.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Solar-Lights-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/N/3/742143/original/Hero-Solar-Lights-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"B2pLsW9qXw2BsRqtrgEB4T","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2pLsW9qXw2BsRqtrgEB4T.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Solar Lights of 2019","description":"Solar lights can be used in a garden, for patio and walkway lighting; as table lamps for outdoor living areas; and as security measures."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/B2pLsW9qXw2BsRqtrgEB4T.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Solar-Lights-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/N/3/742143/original/Hero-Solar-Lights-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"B2pLsW9qXw2BsRqtrgEB4T","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2pLsW9qXw2BsRqtrgEB4T.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Solar Lights of 2019","description":"Solar lights can be used in a garden, for patio and walkway lighting; as table lamps for outdoor living areas; and as security measures."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"patio-and-driveway","url":"/home-and-garden/patio-and-driveway","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","name":"Patio & Driveway","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:16Z","id":"gjj9LfCzhFK29WJH6eTnEk","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
