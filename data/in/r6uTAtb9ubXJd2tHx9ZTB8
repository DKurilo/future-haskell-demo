Whether you&#39;re printing presents or professional prototypes for your company, the Printrbot Plus will get the job done, and done right.","Speed, resolution and accuracy are all aspects in which the Printrbot excels in. 3D printing speeds vary depending on the settings, but the Printrbot Plus can print between 80 and 100 mm per second. Resolution is also excellent at 0.1 mm a layer and 0.1 mm of print tolerance, so each print is produced with high quality.","Printrbot offers some of the most affordable 3D printing materials we&#39;ve reviewed. You can purchase PLA or ABS starting at $30 a spool, much less expensive than that offered by other manufacturers. The Printrbot Plus supports ABS and PLA, and universal cartridges if you prefer to purchase your filament from another source. Only one print head is installed on the Printrbot Plus, so you can only print one color at a time.","Available in either a pre-assembled machine or in a 3D printer kit, this aluminum-and-wood frame chassis supports a heated print platform and a LCD screen. Both features are convenient for ABS or PLA, and computer-less printing.","It doesnâ€™t matter if you have a Windows, Mac or Linux system: The Printrbot and its software will work with all three. Printing directly from your computer via the included USB cable or from a SD card is also straightforward and easy.","Printrbot has a few resources on the website that make it easier to find solutions to any problems or concerns you may have with using your Printrbot Plus. FAQs, manuals, firmware downloads and forums are the best places to look for support. You can also contact Printrbot directly through an online email form, but unfortunately there are no customer support phone numbers. There is a 30-day return period in lieu of a warranty.","Inside the box you&#39;ll find a power supply, USB cable, maintenance tools and a starter filament cartridge so you can start printing your 3D designs right away. For software, Printrbot suggests you download Repetier Host, a free software program for slicing and modifying 3D files optimized for printing. There is a learning curve if you have never worked with CAD or other modeling software, but for experienced 3D printing fans, there are plenty of features to feed your creativity."]},"id":"07125333-8cd5-4924-89f1-cb37aef1e29a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"44ae3d5d-3b62-49ab-ba0c-918675670b91","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Compared to other 3D printers, the Printrbot Plus might seem like a simple, but it really can perform with some of the best.
