The site has far more tutors than students, so there’s always someone online ready to help you with questions you might have. Response time also depends on how difficult the subject matter you need help with is, so make sure you allow plenty of time if you’re working on higher level courses.","It’s easy to pay for <a href=\"/best-online-tutoring-services\">tutoring</a> on Chegg. To use the service, you pay a subscription fee that gets you a certain number of minutes to use over a set period of time, and there are multiple plans to choose from. This is nice because you don’t have to consider individual pay rates or set up different payment methods for each tutor you use.  When you enroll, the system defaults to the basic 30 minutes per week for $15.00 plan. However, on the cheapest plan, each minute only costs 40 cents. The service does have a pay-as-you-go plan, like <a href=\"/tutorme-review\">TutorMe</a>, but the minutes are 75 cents each. ","The system automatically charges you per minute if you go over your session time. There isn’t a drastic increase in fees when this happens, but there also isn’t a stopwatch for you to keep track of the length of your session on the tutoring platform’s interface. During testing, I used my computer’s clock but wished the site had a way to keep track of the minutes remaining in your session on the screen.","Once you set up your account, you can make a subject-specific request for help on the site. Chegg then connects you with tutors who are currently available to help you. Active tutors message you, which gives you a link to their information. Chegg lets you see a detailed profile for each tutor who offers to help you before you begin working with them, which helps you make an informed decision.  Also, because the tutor’s engagement with you is voluntary, you tend to work with people who are genuinely interested in helping you. When I sent out my initial call for help, I was surprised by the number of responses I received from tutors willing to work with me.","After you select a qualified tutor, you arrange a time to meet with them, which you do over the site’s live chat function. Every time I used Chegg, I got help within 10 minutes of putting out the call. The tutors push you to get in a session as quickly as possible because they don’t get paid unless they are in the live lesson suite.","Chegg pays the tutors a flat fee of $20 per hour. Quite a few of the tutors are currently enrolled at a university, though some have already graduated. However, they aren’t required to have teaching certification. The tutors that I spoke with said the hiring process was thorough and selective. They also like working for Chegg because they have flexible work hours, which lets them supplement their income or make some money, even with their ever-changing school schedules.","The live lesson suite is simple to use and navigate. You can text chat or voice chat with your tutor, and you share a whiteboard as well as a text and code editor. In addition, you can share files or create new pages to add information to your lesson. Chegg keeps a record of all your interactions with your tutor inside the suite, so you can see your live chat and review the pages you worked through.","It’s particularly easy to edit word documents or text in the application. However, the tools for working in mathematics could be better – it’s time consuming to create graphs and formulas or work on geometry in the lesson suite. When I worked with a math tutor, they typed out a problem and then used a track pad to help me work through it. This method was effective but required patience on my part.","If you are a parent, you can create an account to manage payment information for multiple students in your household. You can also review interactions between your students and the tutors, which is a good safety feature for kids who are high school age or younger.","The site only releases your username to the tutor to protect your privacy, so you can control how much they learn about you. Chegg also has an ethical work policy – tutors will help you understand concepts but won’t do your work for you.","Chegg’s help and support features are a little thin. While the site has a searchable FAQs page, there’s no way to navigate or read through all of the entries, which is inconvenient if you’re trying to learn more about the site. There’s also limited contact information for direct support. While tutors are available 24/7, you can only reach customer service through email, so you have to wait for a response.","Chegg calls itself a student hub. It’s primarily a textbook retail and rental site, but it also offers online tutoring and support for students. The tutors on the site are happy to develop long-term commitments with students, and the site makes it easy to connect with tutors you’ve worked with before. However, people mainly use the site just every once in a while."]},"id":"8e1d2889-a1ed-4557-a5c1-489f91ad1ecc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68409","url":"/chegg-tutors-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-15T15:40:38Z","datePublished":"2016-09-15T15:40:38Z","name":"Chegg Tutors","synopsis":"Chegg works well for students who are crunched for time and need immediate help.","review":{"rating":50,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Chegg works well for students who are crunched for time and need immediate help.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-15T15:40:38Z","id":"KduuZun7VKHgBeFgBqL6Yg","meta":{"title":"Chegg Tutors Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Chegg&#8217;s tutors are available 24/7, and it&#8217;s easy to find help.
