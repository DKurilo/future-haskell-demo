You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Music and You is a <a href=\"/best-learn-piano-online\">learn piano online</a> course developed and offered by Alana LaGrange.   Her expertise is both classical and jazz based. Lessons include classical piano concepts and other methods that teach music arranging, adding chord variations, playing the blues or hymns.   Students can choose from lessons for beginners to advanced players.   A selling point emphasized is access to lessons 24 hours a day from the website.   This is true of most online sites.   The music for the online format is included with the lessons and you can print them to take to your piano. Print music and books are available for an additional charge.   The lesson format begins with the student reading the lesson, then listening to an audio track to explain the concepts.","Videos are also used to portray some of the lessons and different concepts being taught consisting mostly of screenshots or printed music in a slideshow format with an audio track.   At various times during the video, a window showing an overhead shot of hands playing the keyboard appears to reinforce the concept.   Ms. LaGrange also schedules ‘live video lessons’ that students are invited to join.   Each lesson comes with instructions on how to practice the materials.   Online Seminars also reinforce this subject.","Music and You suggests you record the audio and play-along-tracks to a CD and take them to your piano for practice.   This is time consuming and troubling, especially if either one has the pitch set differently because the sound quality is compromised.   We suggest for higher quality play-along-tracks, choose a computerized product and play along with your MIDI hooked in—like<em> </em>Piano Wizard or Apple’s GarageBand<em>.</em>","When signing up for this online course, you are given several different options to choose from; monthly subscription, packages price for different levels, software programs, or downloading.   If you choose the online options, you can access lessons at any time on the website.   Music and You offers email and phone support. The company has a support phone team for ordering and shipping. Questions pertaining to the curriculum are answered by the founder, Alana LaGrange, during specified times listed on the website.   Questions can also be answered during the online seminars."]},"id":"779e595f-6afc-48fc-956c-ae88762481fb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8fda8c44-32d5-4914-bb36-0ead13169ce5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Music and You </strong>meets much of the criteria suggested in our matrix and is a solid program.
