You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When most people search for a <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof camera</a>, they want something that can handle their vacations. While this may include a visit to the pool or beach, it can also include skiing, hiking or camping. For this reason, we prefer for a camera to be able to handle multiple types of abuse. Unfortunately, the Vivitar ViviCam F526 is not that camera. Instead, it is a poolside selfie camera. With its front-facing LCD viewfinder, it is a great selfie camera, but all other aspects of the camera limit its usage and functionality.","Vivitar did not give this camera much durability. It is among the lightest cameras on our lineup, and it feels like you could crush it with one hand. It should be no surprise, therefore, to discover that it is not crushproof. In fact, it is not freezeproof, shockproof or dustproof, either. This means that it cannot handle below-freezing temperatures, short drops onto a hard surface or a trip to the desert. It is waterproof for up to 10 feet of water, but Vivitar does not clarify how long it can handle these depths.","The ViviCam F526 comes with a 14MP CMOS image sensor, which is a lower resolution than most other point-and-shoot cameras. While it does have image stabilization, it does not have anti-motion blur, so if your subject is moving, your picture may turn out blurry. This is especially frustrating when shooting pictures underwater, where there is constant motion. We took a dozen underwater pictures, and none of them turned out. If the flash was on, the image was completely white. If the flash was off, the camera showed nothing but swirls of color. This is incredibly frustrating if you want to take a picture of your baby’s first swim.","The camera has multiple white balance and picture effect settings that you can turn on before you take a picture. You cannot add these effects or color corrections in the camera’s playback menus. It also lacks Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS tagging, although you can use Google Maps to tag your images in the included photo editing software.","For all of these negatives, the ViviCam F526 has one thing going for it: its front-facing 1.8-inch LCD viewfinder. If you love taking selfies while enjoying life, this camera will help you line up the perfect shot every time. Unfortunately, a second viewfinder does little to make the camera better."]},"id":"6bccf0c2-ec47-4a86-8eb8-c025b985720d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fc0992f8-3d52-4f31-a230-e9017516ade0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vivitar ViviCam F526 is a poolside selfie camera.
