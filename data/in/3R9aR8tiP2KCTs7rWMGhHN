When tested in the early season, Active Junky categorizes it with its training and beginner trail running shoes. It is on the lighter side of trail running shoes at 10.5 oz, constructed with mesh upper and vented midsole to allow your foot to breathe.","For shoe design and fit, Treksta has steered away from conventional trail running shoe design based on a generic foot shape. After taking digital measurements of over 20,000 feet, the company designed a new sole technology. With an emphasis on over-all comfort, its patented NestFit construction cradles the foot without affecting motion or circulation. The three-layer insole is designed to support and contour around while keeping your legs in alignment in order to reduce muscle fatigue, especially over those longer runs. The whole design comes together to promote peak performance during multiple activities, specifically in the case of Mega Wave, for those trail runners with long distances to cover.","Independent suspension technology found in the outsole offers shock absorption and traction, also aiding in the reduction of fatigue. The HyperGrip outsole provided pure traction through mud, over loose rock and across the soft trail of our varying-terrain test course. However, on more compact surfaces we expect more power transfer and energy return than this trail running shoe proved to offer, especially when control and efficiency are essential in long-distance running trail shoes.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments:</strong> The Treksta Mega Wave is a great choice for early season training and the occasional trail runner as it protects your feet to avoid bruising and allows for hitting the trails more often. While Active Junky maintains a bias for Treksta, it is not the best trail running shoe for you if your aim is speed.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Quality","<strong>Best For: </strong>Mixed softer conditions and loose rock across moderate weekly mileage.","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"854559cb-d69b-4bf9-8e4b-5757b246e341","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 10.5 oz","Drop: 6 mm","Stack Height: 24 mm heel, 18 mm forefoot","Upper: Mesh","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber-HyperGrip"],"type":"ul"},"id":"552c9146-3bb0-4044-ae66-f72ac7f3f43d","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background:</strong> Treksta has been designing and creating new technology for outdoor footwear since 1988.
