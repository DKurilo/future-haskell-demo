It’s true that the Ikea Nutid Induction Cooktop is one of the most affordable 30-inch <a href=\"/best-induction-cooktops\">induction cooktops</a> on the market, but saving a few hundred dollars means you’ll sacrifice a few features, and possibly even some functionality.","Ikea is well known among college students and young professionals as a source of affordable, attractive, “stop-gap”-type furniture. It’s meant to look good without necessarily lasting a long time. In this sense, the Nutid cooktop is fairly in keeping with expectations. It offers few of the features found in other higher-quality cooktops, but still has enough to be functional."]},"id":"5f3ab62e-59a6-435c-b40d-ae9350014343","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/GzK2NsvdQncYatCZQUYSo5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The touch control panel, located at the front of the unit, lets you set the kitchen timer, control lock, heat indicator symbol and burner temperatures. As in some other cooktops, you can program the burner to shut off at the end of a timer countdown. A “boost” function is available on three of the four burners to quickly bring liquid to a boil. Conveniently, the four burners all have variable sizes—if you use a smaller pan, only the inner heating element will activate.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57628-ikea-nutid-induction-cooktop2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzK2NsvdQncYatCZQUYSo5.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"GzK2NsvdQncYatCZQUYSo5","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzK2NsvdQncYatCZQUYSo5.jpg","alt":""},"id":"2d23b905-43b2-4f71-973c-10687df577db","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While Ikea certainly doesn’t sell “lemon” product, it should be noted that some customer-posted cooktop reviews for this product were less than positive. A few individuals have reported that the cooktop fails after a short period of time and that repairs, which are facilitated through Whirlpool, are a bit of a hassle. But it’s common knowledge that for every dissatisfied customer who complains on the internet, there often are several—perhaps dozens or even hundreds—who are using the same product just fine.","Ikea recommends that a certified electrician install your induction cooktop for you, and as a result does not provide any installation guides or other such material on its website. Ikea does, however, offer installation services for a fee if you don’t want to search for an electrician. The store also offers delivery service, so you can order online and have Ikea staff both deliver and install it.","Though the Ikea Nutid Induction Cooktop is quite far from being a “buyer beware” type of product, it also is far from being the very best induction cooktop on the market. But if you want the convenience of induction cooking without the financial burden of being a premium cooktop, this remains a reasonable option."]},"id":"14d55836-9772-4090-b3f2-d9fceac5be87","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57656","url":"/ikea-nutid-induction-cooktop-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-02T09:07:56Z","datePublished":"2013-10-02T09:07:56Z","name":"Ikea NUTID","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer a top ten product.
