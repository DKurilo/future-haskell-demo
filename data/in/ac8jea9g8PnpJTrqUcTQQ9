XYZprinting, the da Vinci Jr. 1.0 is a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">budget 3D printer</a> in every sense of the word. This budget option is more cost effective than its competitors but still offers high-quality features such as tetherless printing, on-board navigation and plenty of included filament. If you&#39;re alright with a slightly smaller platform size, the da Vinci Jr. 1.0 is the perfect addition for classroom, office and home use.","For such a low-cost 3D printer, the XYZprinting da Vinci Jr. 1.0 can produce quality models very easily. Although the print plate is only 5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches, its size is still adequate for small and medium models. Auto leveling is convenient and works well. You can calibrate settings from the menu as well, so your printer is always prepped for accurate models.","All of the models we printed indicate that the da Vinci Jr. 1.0 is great for prototyping or fast, fun designs. While the finer qualities, such as a smooth finished print surface, weren&#39;t quite on par with more expensive 3D printers, accuracy was consistent and our models had no major defects.","Above all, this plug-and-play printer was extremely easy to set up. Very little installation is needed and mostly revolved around calibrations and inserting the filament. The Jr. is a smaller version of previous XYZprinting machines with some nifty improvements like a vertically opening door, auto on and off internal lighting, and a glass print plate. Opening the door doesn’t stop your print, which is great if you want to check on your model’s progress. Another design aspect, the navigation screen, makes the da Vinci Jr. 1.0 truly convenient. You can control power and lighting options, as well as start and stop prints from the SD card, and each screen gives you instruction so you&#39;re not flying blind if you&#39;re a beginner.","This pure PLA printer uses 3D printer cartridges from the manufacturer. Since the slot inside the printer only fits the custom cartridges, you can’t use universal or generic filament, that is unless you want to recycle cartridges and rewrap new filament yourself, which can be very time consuming. The good news is XYZprinting has twelve different colors for you to choose from for a very reasonable price. ABS is also available on the website for other XYZprinting 3D printers, but ABS is not compatible with the XYZprinting da Vinci Jr. 1.0 because it does not have a heated print plate. The instructions on how to load filament are inside the machine on a sticker, so you don&#39;t have to remember every time you load a new color or cartridge.","Many accessories are provided with this affordable 3D printer, including software, tools and filament. The XYZWare program is simple to use and allows you to save files to an SD card for completely untethered printing. Maintenance tools and platform tape are also provided to keep your printer functioning and your printed parts clean. Along with the printer, you receive a 600 gram filament cartridge, which cuts the cost down, as filament can be expensive. XYZprinting provides more free filament than many other 3D printing companies. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"a2e37bfa-3a41-462f-a9d5-9c5a13de68ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4afcdd29-6864-45fb-b080-69c3ab01993d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This inexpensive 3D printer is small but mighty.
