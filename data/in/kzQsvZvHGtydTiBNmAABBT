Whether you are planning a formal presentation, a wedding picture slideshow, or you simply want a neat way to share photos through email, creating a <a href=\"/best-photo-slideshow-software\">photo slideshow</a> is the best option. Even better, all you need to create a decent looking slideshow is Microsoft s PowerPoint software.","PowerPoint comes with an inbuilt slideshow creator called photo album, which saves a lot of time and effort in putting a slideshow together. With this feature, you don&#39;t need to keep inserting pictures into individual slides. This can be a lot of work especially if you have lots of pictures you want to include in the album."]},"id":"fb862d4b-e7ed-434f-89d9-a84eebc1a62f","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Below is a simple step-by-step guide you can follow to create your own slideshow. But, before you start, you want to move all of the photos you plan to use into one folder. This will shave off a lot of time and make your work much easier.","1. Open Microsoft PowerPoint. Click the  Insert  button and choose  Photo Album.  The dropdown menu that appears has two options: &#34;New Photo Album&#34; and &#34;Edit Photo Album.&#34; Unless you want to edit an existing slideshow, click  &#34;New Photo Album.&#34;","2. A dialogue box will pop up. Click the &#34;File/Disk&#34; button below &#34;Insert Text.&#34; This should open Windows Explorer, allowing you to navigate to the folder you will be choosing your pictures from.","3. Hopefully, you already have created a folder containing all the needed pictures. Navigate to this folder and start selecting specific pictures. You can hold down the &#34;Ctrl&#34; key on your keyboard and click to select pictures that are not contiguous (i.e., separated). Hold down the &#34;Shift&#34; key to quickly select pictures in a continuous line. If you need all the pictures in a folder, simply press &#34;Ctrl+A.&#34;","4. Once you have all the pictures ready, click &#34;Insert&#34; to go back to the dialogue box. A list form shows all the selected photos. A small box on the right shows you a preview of the picture you have selected.","5. Use the arrows shown to cycle a selected picture either up and down. Click &#34;Remove&#34; to get rid of a selected picture.","6. Near the bottom of the dialogue box, there are a few options you can choose to modify your photo slideshow. Picture Layout allows you to choose what number of pictures show in a single slide and what shape the picture frame will be. You can also leave these options in their default mode.","7. Click &#34;Create&#34; if you are satisfied with the pictures you&#39;ve selected. This generates a presentation. You can then click on the slideshow tab to preview your photo slideshow.","All that remains now is to save the presentation and share it. You can also save and send it via email within PowerPoint. However, before you send it, see if you can make a few more improvements to your slideshow. Specifically, the theme. Click on the design tab and pick out a theme that pleases you and goes well with your photos."]},"id":"df3d06c0-f530-496e-81f5-fe997122e421","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9382","url":"/how-to-make-a-photo-slideshow-in-powerpoint","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-09T16:55:58Z","datePublished":"2015-04-09T16:55:58Z","name":"How to Make a Photo Slideshow in PowerPoint","synopsis":"A picture slideshow is one of the best ways of presenting pictures.","review":{},"strapline":"A picture slideshow is one of the best ways of presenting pictures.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-09T16:57:53Z","id":"kzQsvZvHGtydTiBNmAABBT","meta":{"title":"How to Make a Photo Slideshow in PowerPoint","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
