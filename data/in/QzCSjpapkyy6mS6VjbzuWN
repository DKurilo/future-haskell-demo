You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Fagor is a well-established authority in the realm of home appliances, and their foray into <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">all-in-one washer dryers</a> is a prime example of resilience and reliability. The device combines both a washer and dryer into a single, compact appliance that can immediately switch from washing to drying laundry. With its modern appearance and numerous cleaning settings, this machine will prove itself quite useful in keeping your clothes fresh.","The Fagor FAS361 measures in at 23.25 inches wide, 33.5 inches high and 23.25 inches deep, making it a truly compact washer dryer combo. Its interior capacity is enough to hold a 13-pound load for washing, but only a 9-pound load for drying. Reducing the load during the drying cycle is incredibly important due to the heat condenser that&#39;s used to circulate air. Unless your clothing is able to move about freely, the heated air won’t be able to dry inner laundry layers.","Aesthetically, the appliance is one of the best washer dryer combos on the market. It utilizes a sleek stainless steel exterior shell, complemented by a stainless steel drum. The front of the appliance houses an LCD screen to display information like time remaining in a cycle. As you can pick between 16 different programs for both washing and drying, it caters to a wide range of fabrics.","One issue you may have with the Fagor FAS361 is the amount of time it takes to wash and dry a single load of clothing. This problem isn’t atypical among combo washer dryers, thanks to their  compact design and limited heating capabilities. The use of a condenser instead of a drying vent impacts the amount of time it takes to dry clothes, and the result is never a 100-percent dry load. Depending on the amount of laundry you put in, the device can take up to six hours to fully complete a cycle.","The Fagor FAS361 is a compact and economical combination washer dryer for individuals who own RVs or live in small apartments. It offers many different settings for better cleaning results, though it does take longer to dry than a separate dryer. Nevertheless, it&#39;s well manufactured and will clean your laundry for years."]},"id":"32714cad-a2c5-484d-ae17-bed15aea40f8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58683","url":"/fagor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-23T15:05:19Z","datePublished":"2014-01-23T15:05:19Z","name":"Fagor FAS361","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
