With a useful mix of camping tools right on the axe head, it not only works with a handle, it can tackle a lot of camping chores without one as well. It&#39;s the best axe for survival because it&#39;s so versatile.","The curved axe blade also works like an ulu knife, making cooking chores like chopping and cutting a breeze, and it can also handle shaving wood for making tent stakes. There&#39;s a second knife blade along the bottom of the head and a bottle opener/gut hook along the top. It has an integrated socket, and you can get this axe in English or metric systems to meet your needs. The butt of the head works as a hammer. The KLAX Lumberjack even has a ruler etched in. In all, there are seven tools you can use without ever needing a handle.","The head fits into a convenient pocket made of ballistic nylon. It has a belt loop, making it extra convenient for carrying on your belt or backpack.","Without a handle, you get greater and easier control for several chores this axe can handle. Of course, it makes chopping wood problematic, so Klecker offers a 15-inch handle. However, this nifty survival axe head has clamps for holding the handle in place and thus works with handles of other sizes. The testers at Active Junky found that you can even fabricate your own while on the campsite.","The axe head itself weighs 14.4 ounces, making it an excellent choice for hiking. It&#39;s also a great addition to any survival kit. This camp axe may take some getting used to, however, because of the unusual shape and multiple blades. However, once you get the hang of it, you may find it, as our testers did, &#34;totally practical and perpetually amazing.&#34;","Klecker Knives offers a lifetime warranty, but the website does not list details. Most likely, it covers manufacturer&#39;s defects, but if you have questions, you can contact the company via phone, email or social media."]},"id":"318ed138-3564-426c-8879-22cc6bb89e78","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68364","url":"/klecker-knives-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T19:02:46Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T19:02:46Z","name":"Klecker Knives KLAX Lumberjack","synopsis":"The Klecker Knives KLAX Lumberjack might give you some pause at first because it does not come with a handle, but this unique camping axe is the real deal when it comes to useful tools with cutting edges.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Klecker Knives KLAX Lumberjack might give you some pause at first because it does not come with a handle, but this unique camping axe is the real deal when it comes to useful tools with cutting edges.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-12T19:02:46Z","id":"tay4SjvDqxBrCZwnwAHxuW","meta":{"title":"Klecker Knives KLAX Lumberjack Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Klecker Knives KLAX Lumberjack camping axe is an extremely useful axe head with multiple tools.
