Such a notion might seem reasonable until you examine it more closely. If you share a PC, there is no reason to make it easy for someone else to know your surfing habits and personal identity details. Browsers and operating systems collect personal information as efficiently as a clothes dryer traps lint in a screen. Browsers keep track of address bar histories and cookies. They cache temporary internet files and list the sites you’ve visited and the files you’ve downloaded. Browsers maintain your list of favorite sites and they retain form data so that you can conveniently fill out new forms using the auto-complete feature. There is just no reason for anyone but you to see the details that browsers collect. The idea that you would not need privacy software if you weren&#39;t doing something wrong is a red herring because privacy is the central issue.","The Windows operating system is efficient at keeping track of information that might best stay private. It can display lists of temporary files, run histories and recent files. It keeps files in the recycle bin until you empty it. It knows your Start Menu history. And if you have copied something, it is stored in a clipboard. Even if you could remember every possible place to clean up after yourself, you would not be able to do anything about the file images left on the hard disk after deletion from the directory. So if you sold your PC to someone with sufficient file-recovery savvy, your credit card numbers and passwords would still be available long after you erased the files from their directories. Much could go wrong even though you did no wrong. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"4a89c4ff-b3a6-4973-a0e1-f0db5767ed48","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"c7fe9bd5-25fe-42df-89bf-8f1ed2605657","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/3Wu8VRCB2HoDPqxeEPKSzX.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"We can uncover no glitches in the effectiveness of Privacy Guardian.
