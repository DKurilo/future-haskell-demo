Radio waves carry signals that are picked up by a radio receiver at different frequencies. Every single radio   whether it&#39;s your car radio or the radio on your MP3 player   requires an antenna in order to receive transmissions. Antennas come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, which usually determines the effectiveness of the device. Common radio antenna brands include the <a href=\"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-radio-antennas/terk-review/\">TERK PIB AM/FM Antenna</a>, the <a href=\"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-radio-antennas/stellar-labs-review/\">Stellar Labs Outdoor Omnidirectional FM</a> and the <a href=\"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-radio-antennas/winegard-review/\">Winegard RoadStar Omni-Directional VHF/UHF Antenna</a>.","In cases where your device&#39;s built-in antenna doesn&#39;t pull a strong enough signal, you can purchase an external antenna. Radio antennas are also useful if your original antenna is broken. Several factors affect the strength of your antenna, including where you install it, other devices in your home that might be causing interference and the quality of your receiver.","<strong>Radio Antennas: What to Look For</strong>","When shopping for a new radio antenna, your main goal is finding the maximum signal strength for your device. Note that FM radio signals travel horizontally instead of vertically, so your antenna should be configured to accept these waves. Look for bandwidth span, and you may even consider the types of accessories that come with the antenna. Below are some other important considerations to factor into your decision.","<strong>Classification</strong><br/>One of the most important things to consider when looking for a radio antenna is knowing what you plan to use the device for. AM/FM digital antennas are designed to help you get a stronger signal from local radio stations or pick up stations that are further away. A UHF/VHF radio antenna is used for two-way radios and marine signals. The two differ in the range of frequencies they pull in.","<strong>Reception Patterns</strong><br/>Typically, digital antennas come in two types of reception patterns: omnidirectional and directional. An omnidirectional antenna radiates radio wave patterns in all directions, while a directional antenna refers to a specific direction   such as horizontal or vertical. Specific examples of multidirectional antennas include the whip antenna, the dipole, the mast radiator and the loop antenna. The most common directional antennas include the log-periodic antenna and the corner reflector.","<strong>Frequency</strong><br/>The frequency type of any radio antenna refers to the rate of oscillation of the radio waves. FM radio frequencies are between 88 and 108MHz, while AM stations lie on the frequency range of 535 to 1605kHz. AM radios have lower frequency ranges, while VHF TVs and microwaves have high frequency ranges.","<strong>Power Supply</strong><br/>Radio antennas can be battery operated or come with an AC adapter. Battery power makes the antenna more portable, while an AC adapter saves money in the long run.","With a range of radio antennas to choose from, you no longer have to settle for poor reception. Even with the smallest of designs you can enjoy improved radio reception."]},"id":"8d5d7a96-b136-4e0e-b71c-f5c94cd9223a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"7b42e988-0d37-4282-8641-61524c4bbaa8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.summitsource.com/antennacraft-fmss-turnstile-omni-directional-antenna-dipole-element-outdoor-radio-station-signal-rooftop-local-digital-stereo-reception-aerial-part-p-6056.html?ref=1&gclid=CKvt9eWGjscCFUhgfgodGQkDGg\">Antennacraft</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024484BC/?&tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66392[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cobra Electronics</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZRDTZE/?tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66394[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Opek</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EIOQBM/?&tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66390[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Petra</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L10Q54/?&tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66391[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Pixel Technologies</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055Q5FIQ/?&tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66393[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sangean</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LAHFC4Q/?&tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66395[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Shakespeare</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DHHOZBI/?tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66388[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Stellar Labs</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008V3EE/?&tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66387[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">TERK</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TVNWX4/?&tag=ttr_radio-antennas-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1556[art|NA[pid|66389[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Winegard</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"752aa743-d651-443d-ae52-29fd37a347f2","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1556","url":"/best-radio-antennas","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-23T22:58:51Z","datePublished":"2016-01-28T22:25:37Z","name":"Radio Antennas Review","synopsis":"Radio antennas boost radio signals in the atmosphere, so you obtain clear, undistorted sound from your media device.
