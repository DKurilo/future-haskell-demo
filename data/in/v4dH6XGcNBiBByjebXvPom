You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Some people want a <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> that is powerful enough to replace their computers, but for others, the most important feature of a new phone is its call quality. If you&#39;re one of these others, sick of bigger screens and a slew of apps that don&#39;t necessarily add to the phone&#39;s functionality as a phone, the LG Escape P870 delivers a modest design, great call fidelity and plenty of speed for those times you need to use the internet.","The LG Escape P870 does not rely on flashy design. Instead, the casing is conservative and easy to hold. The 4.3-inch touchscreen display is bright and easy to see. However, if you intend on playing video games or watching movies, this smartphone does not feature HD resolution, so you may begin to notice some of the pixels on finer videos and images.","While most smartphones offer an 8MP rear camera, the LG Escape P870 only delivers 5MP in its rear-facing camera. This makes images dirty and somewhat pixilated. If you intend on shooting pictures to share on Twitter or through text messages, you won&#39;t have any problem with these low-resolution images. However, on higher-resolution platforms like Facebook, or if you choose to print the photos, the images will look grainy.","The LG Escape P870 focuses on call quality. Calls are clear, and no matter how you use the call features – whether in privacy mode, in conference mode or with a Bluetooth headset – you&#39;ll love how easy it is to hear. Unfortunately, the Escape has issues staying connected to the internet, so if you intend on downloading a lot of files or surfing the web each day, you&#39;ll want to look for a phone more geared to internet usage.","The battery of this smartphone is of moderate quality. If you only use the phone to make calls and surf the web on occasion, you&#39;ll be able to have enough charge for the whole day. If you want to hop online throughout the day or watch a lot of videos, the battery will drain much faster, unable to last more than eight hours. The Escape comes with a measly 4GB of installed storage, but this can be supplemented with memory cards","The LG Escape P870 runs on Android 4.0, and its dual-core, 1.2MHz processor keeps everything smooth and quick. For a phone targeted at light users, the processing power is surprising. On the occasions that you do use the internet or want to watch a video, the Escape easily handles your needs. In addition to carrier-specific apps, the only memorable exclusive software for this smartphone is the QuickMemo app. With QuickMemo, you can take screenshots from your phone and write notes or draw directly on the image. Then, you can share your creation with others through emailing, messaging or social networking. This app, like everything about the phone, speaks to the Escape&#39;s practicality."]},"id":"0b8e06a9-008f-4dbe-ad79-68365df10d6c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"929760e4-64e7-48e8-9aff-6c3e8c7eb2d6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG Escape P870 does not aim for great heights as a top-of-the-line smartphone.
