Some companies choose to use solely outsourced HR services, while for some companies partial outsourcing is the better option. The needs of your specific company will determine which outsourcing resources you need and the service that you select. However, here a few things to consider for each option.","<strong>Full-Service HR Outsourcing</strong>","Full-service human resource outsourcing is a good option if you own a small company and cannot yet afford to hire HR personnel. It is also a good option if you have staff in different parts of the world and need HR staff to work with remote employees. By outsourcing these services, a company ensures that it remains in compliance while working with employees and can provide a healthy working environment.","When companies skimp on HR, they put themselves and their employees at risk. A full-service HR company can help you appropriately manage day-to-day HR tasks like reporting misconduct, ensuring work safety compliance and coordinating insurance benefits. They can also work closely with your payroll team to handle compensation. In addition to day-to-day tasks, you can request services like recruiting and employee training.","If you have no HR or an inexperienced HR staff in your company, full-service HR outsourcing is probably your best option. It provides the resources of a full HR staff to oversee your company’s needs without the expense of hiring a whole team.","<strong>Partial HR Outsourcing</strong>","Partial outsourcing is a good choice for companies that have HR staff but need extra help. For example, maybe you have an HR representative to handle hiring and ensure that employment paperwork is correctly filed. However, HR is more than compliance and staff support. It can be an important resource for employee training and development. If you do not have the resources or desire to hire a full-time training specialist, you can outsource this service.","The most common trainings that HR outsourcing services provide include software and processes training, though other options are available. The best HR outsourcing service will work with you one-on-one to determine the training that&#39;s best for your company’s employees.","Other common partial outsourcing services include payroll outsourcing, employee screenings and background checks, employee recruitment, and immigration compliance. If you have a small HR staff that is burdened by workload or inexperienced in certain functions, like immigration paperwork, then partial outsourcing is the best solution for your company’s HR needs."]},"id":"b61f63f1-ce04-43f7-8351-fe14948d88f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"HR Outsourcing vs. Automation Software"},"id":"6e0b1c37-ee11-41f5-94ff-5072fbf3a756","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When determining the best HR option for you, you may wonder if it is better to outsource specific services or to automate them. Depending on your business and its needs, the answer mostly likely falls somewhere in the middle. A little bit of each is a good way to streamline your HR services and maximize productivity. ","HR outsourcing services provide administrative HR tasks and other HR functions on behalf of your company. Though representatives work closely with you to meet your company’s needs, you are handing the reins of certain services over to an outside organization. One benefit of this is that it completely frees up your time so that you can focus on growing your business. However, when you outsource, you have less involvement and control over day-to-day operations, which could lead to a disconnect in the company’s culture.","HR automation services, available as software or SaaS, give you the tools to maintain your HR files securely. These services help you accurately complete hiring and payroll forms that are compliant with employment rules and regulations.","In addition to HR automation services, other services can help your HR team perform at its best. <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Employee scheduling software</a> and <a href=\"/money/small-business\">time card software</a> help HR staff easily track and manage employee schedules and accruals. If your employees frequently receive tips, you may also want to look into <a href=\"/best-pos-systems\">POS systems</a>, which integrate with <a href=\"/best-online-payroll-services\">payroll software</a> to make it easier to track and claim employee tips in your business taxes.","Though some automation and HR outsourcing services would have you believe that you must select one over the other, a combination of the two might be the best answer for your business. For example, if you have a small designated HR team in your company, HR automation software can help them handle a large volume of employee paperwork without being overwhelmed. At the same time, you can hire an outsourcing service to run a hiring and recruitment campaign or provide intermittent employee trainings so you do not have to overburden in-house HR representatives.","There is no one right way to run your company’s HR. If you want to maintain control of certain HR functions, like payroll, but do not want to focus on other areas, like recruitment, then a combination of automation and outsourcing is a good choice.","For some companies, automation services will be all they need, while others may rely solely on outsourcing. However, for many companies, a combination of both works well for meeting HR needs."]},"id":"9dd50705-28fd-4466-87ad-1803dec6a92b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Sensitive Data and Legal Considerations"},"id":"8c7d4c00-2e13-46a1-ad20-d1ebe706904a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["HR is responsible for maintaining employee confidentiality in compensation and personal matters, and for ensuring your company’s compliance with federal regulations surrounding health care, 401(k) plans and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).","Another important function of HR is to ensure your company follows legal processes when hiring, especially when hiring noncitizens. Immigration compliance at both the state and federal level is a complicated process that your HR staff may not have expertise in. If your company frequently hires immigrants, it is important to find an HR outsourcing service with experience in immigration services. This helps to protect your company against unintended violations of immigration law, which can be extremely costly.","The HR outsourcing service that your company partners with should give you the option to select a full-service package or pick and choose which services are best for your business right now.
