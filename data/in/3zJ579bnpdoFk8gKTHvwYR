Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/services/home/best-pest-control-services/\">Pest Control Services</a> here.</em>","Pestbomb is a pest and termite control company that specializes in keeping bugs at bay, no matter the season. The company&#39;s basic services compare to that of our higher ranked services. However, it can be difficult to get in touch with a representative. Also, Pestbomb has a skeletal website that offers the minimal amount of information about its service. If you want details, you have to give this pest control service a call or request a free quote.","You can request a free home inspection from Pestbomb. The inspection is thorough and covers your home from roof to foundation, plus any immediate yard around the home. Pestbomb uses a containment method to eliminate pests without causing risk to humans, pets or the environment. Exterminators also rely on more than just one step in pest elimination and perform return treatments several times throughout the year.","One place Pestbomb falls short is their customer support. It took us a few days to get a reply when we requested a quote via the online form. The company doesn&#39;t have a phone number listed. You can request pest services from any state, and if you live outside the company&#39;s service area in your state, Pestbomb will refer you to a pest control service in your area. This referral process moves quickly, and we found it was easy to work with the company on locating a local service. Pestbomb doesn’t offer 24-hour customer assistance, online account management or a section with FAQs.","If you live within its service area, Pestbomb can have a technician to your house in 24 hours in response to any pest control issues. The service is also guaranteed, right to the very last ant. If at any time you aren&#39;t satisfied with Pestbomb&#39;s service, the company will treat until you are or refund half of what you paid for the initial treatment.","While the company lacks convenient customer support, Pestbomb still covers a large enough variety of bugs and rodents that your home will be clean from pests. The company began in Arizona and started by treating for poisonous pests, such as snakes and scorpions. The process removes pests then prevents them from coming into your home. Technicians return whenever removal needs to happen again. Pestbomb also covers more than 30 common household pests like ants, termites, wasps and rodents.","The entirety of Pestbomb&#39;s website is lacking, especially compared to the best pest control services. There is minimal information about its service offerings, and there&#39;s very little educational content. The company does regularly update the Pest Control News section of its site with industry and service updates. The updates also include tips on gearing up for the upcoming season."]},"id":"2adeeffd-53d8-44ca-85d1-faf4e18ebfa4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3818345a-f400-445c-992b-77a597d924d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pestbomb offers effective, safe and efficient treatments and services, but the website offers much less information than our top services&#39; sites.
