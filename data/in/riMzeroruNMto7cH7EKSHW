The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The LG Extra Large Capacity WM3070HWA front-load washing machine isn’t quite as large as many of the washers in our front-load washer reviews, but its 3.7-cubic-foot capacity washtub will let you put a lot of laundry in at once. It also includes a myriad of attractive and innovative features and a warranty that make it a desirable choice.","This front-loader washer is Energy Star qualified and is only estimated to cost $12 annually and consume 111-kilowatt hours a year. Additionally, it includes a ColdWash option that helps you conserve even more energy.","You have the choice of 12 wash cycles, 11 wash options, five soil levels, and five wash and rinse temperatures with this LG front-load washer. We were disappointed, however, to see no small-load cycle or colors cycle included.","Among the dozen wash cycles are an allergen cycle and a speed-wash cycle, which we were impressed to see. The allergen cycle uses a high temperature to help get rid of common household allergens. The speed-wash cycle can wash small loads of laundry in just 15 minutes.","Some of this front-load washer’s most attractive features are its TurboWash option, steam option and LG’s 6Motion Technology. The TurboWash option can be selected to save 20 minutes on some of the lengthier cycles without sacrificing the washing performance. You can add steam to select cycles to help lift out tough stains that are deep in the fabric. LG’s 6Motion Technology uses six different wash motions during every wash cycle to give your laundry a thorough washing experience.","This LG Extra Large Capacity front-load washer is available in either the standard white color or LG’s Wild Cherry Red color. Both options boast a stainless steel washtub. The appliance is 38-11/16 inches high, 27 inches wide and 29-3/4 inches deep. Additionally, you can get the optional pedestal drawer so that it will sit up a bit higher, but it will cost you a tad extra.","LG offers consumers an incredible warranty for this front-load washer. During the first year, all parts and any labor are covered. Furthermore, for the first 10 years, the washer motor is covered, and the washtub boasts a lifetime warranty.","LG makes it easy to get any help and support you may need from them by phone, email or even a convenient live chat function on its website. For email support, however, you must first submit an online contact form on the LG website and they will contact you via email. LG also provides a nice amount of FAQs, product tutorials and the user manual for this front-load washing machine on its website."]},"id":"34e2c706-da34-4de4-a63c-ace0d42744cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5a5e0687-78c3-4780-8915-7e243eb0b5dc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You get a sufficient number of wash cycles and options to choose from with the LG Extra Large Capacity WM3070HWA front-loading washing machine, and you’ll be able to do a large stack of laundry at once with its 3.7-cubic-foot capacity washtub.
