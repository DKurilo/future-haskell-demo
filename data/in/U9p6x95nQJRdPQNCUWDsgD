It is known for being incredibly detailed with its models. Its HT 2879 RC Destroyer Battleship Boat is one of its most intrinsic RC boats. It is a 1:115-scale replica of a naval battleship. Even though it appears to be something you would just place on a display stand and set on a shelf to admire, it is a fully functioning RC boat that goes up to 10 miles per hour.","This boat runs very well, too. It can even go in reverse, which is rare among RC boats. It has dual propellers, so it has great handling and is powerful enough to tackle some waves if it needs to. It isn&#39;t the fastest or best remote control boat available, but it is still a lot of fun. It is extremely durable, just as a battleship should be. It is really easy to control and is a great boat for kids. It has a nice safety feature in place that disables the motor if it isn&#39;t in water. This can put you at ease when your children are playing with the boat.","The best aspect of this RC boat is the detail and craftsmanship. It definitely will turn heads if you take it to the park or the lake. On the boat is a light-up radar tower, gun turrets and even model helicopters. It is one of those boats that is really fun to look at and truly looks like a warship. Even if you aren&#39;t the one controlling it, it is fun to watch. It has a runtime of 15 minutes and can operate at ranges of up to 250 feet.","This radio controlled boat is 31 inches long and 8 inches tall, so it is quite big for a RC boat. The boat is ready to run, and a battery for the boat and its transmitter are included. The boat only has a 14-day warranty, which is shorter than those of most RC boats. You can find some customer reviews and YouTube videos of the boat in action online. There is no manual or documentation included with the boat, but it is easy to get up and running."]},"id":"4f188d26-132a-429f-adc8-60caece29f4d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7275fcb2-c2e7-44bd-b11e-c99ce57c7850","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The RC Destroyer Battleship Boat is a lot of fun.
