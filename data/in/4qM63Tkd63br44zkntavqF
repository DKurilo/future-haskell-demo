The company lets you be in control of your payments and the amount of your down payment and offers round-the-clock customer service.","When you purchase an automobile insurance policy through Direct Auto, and request an <a href=\"/best-sr22-insurance\">SR-22 form</a>, you will receive quality coverage and helpful customer service to keep you informed of payment schedules and other due dates. The SR-22 is not an insurance policy in itself; this form simply states that you have taken out enough insurance through Direct Auto to ensure you are financially covered in the event of an accident. In most cases you are required to obtain this insurance if you were involved in an accident that was your fault and you did not have enough insurance coverage to pay for the results of the accident. The court can suspend your license if you do not follow the court orders and obtain this certificate. The cost of the filing fee varies depending on your state.","When you are forced to file an SR-22 form, you may be required to purchase additional amounts of liability insurance above the amount required by your state. If so, you will want to obtain as many discounts as possible in order to drive your costs down. Some discounts you might be eligible for include a discount for good credit and a discount for multiple vehicles. If you do not own a vehicle, you can also obtain a non-owner car insurance policy, which would be the minimum requirement for an SR-22 filing.","You need to keep your SR-22 active for as long as the court requires. In most cases this is from three to five years, depending on the severity of your crime. If you move to another state, you will still need to maintain the SR-22 requirements from the state where you received the judgment. Direct Auto can help you keep your SR-22 insurance active and legal in order to keep you on the road.","Direct Auto works with you to find affordable insurance for your circumstances. The company can provide insurance even if you do not have a policy prior to your SR-22 judgment. If you do not drive, the company can help you obtain the necessary insurance and keep the policy active until your requirement is no longer in effect."]},"id":"f66be4e4-b015-47f6-a360-7c635e7385eb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67257","url":"/direct-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-16T20:48:03Z","datePublished":"2015-10-16T20:48:03Z","name":"Direct Auto","synopsis":"Direct Auto offers auto, life and motorcycle insurance regardless of your past history.
