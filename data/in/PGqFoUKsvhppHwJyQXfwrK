The Winco Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer features a classic round design, with easy-to-read temperature zones. If you are looking for a digital display, consider the <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">Maverick CT-03</a>.","This thermometer carries an NSF rating, which means it has been tested and meets international quality and safety standards.","The Winco’s 2-inch dial is easy to read and features readings beginning at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and going up to 400 degrees. The thermometer’s extended tip helps it plunge into the contents of a pot, and the included side-clip can attach the unit to the side of most containers. This allows for space between the thermometer’s sensor and the side of the pot to provide an accurate reading.","A pointed dial affixed to the outside of the thermometer lets you select the temperature you want your candy to reach so that when the inner and outer dial line up, you know with a quick glance that you have reached the desired temperature. This is a handy visual aid, particularly when steam makes the dial numbers difficult to read. On the face of this dial, you will find information on temperature zones for caramelizing and deep frying.","This easy-to-use manual candy thermometer is inexpensive, and like most candy thermometers, it can double in your kitchen as a deep-fry thermometer. Because it has a probe, the Winco thermometer is also appropriate for measuring the internal temperature of meat, poultry or baked goods.","One drawback of the Winco Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer is that this particular model does not offer a fast visual reference for candy temperature stages, which can be very handy when making candy. As a reasonable workaround, however, you can manually set the thermometer’s movable indicator arrow to match the candy-making stage you need to reach. However, you will need to remember to calibrate the thermometer frequently to ensure accuracy when you are making candy. Overall, the Winco Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer is an inexpensive, user-friendly probe thermometer that is a versatile and economical addition to any kitchen."]},"id":"1c59ecd1-9e11-4914-8b84-f3cc71623bde","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63292","url":"/winco-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:09:31Z","datePublished":"2015-03-06T23:09:31Z","name":"Winco","synopsis":"Some cooks prefer a dial-face candy thermometer to a rectangular thermometer for easier reading and handling while cooking.
