You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","After making a splash oversees at the International CES, the YotaPhone 2 is finally travelling across the Atlantic. The sturdy, unassuming device doesn&#39;t look like much at first glance, but you need only flip it over to realize this is no ordinary <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a>. In addition to a standard, 5-inch 1080p AMOLED screen on its front, the YotaPhone 2 has a touch-sensitive e-ink display on its rear cover. That display gives you an entirely new way to interact with your phone.","Like all e-ink screens, the YotaPhone&#39;s secondary display is always on, but only uses power when it updates pixels – something that, comparatively, doesn&#39;t happen very often. You can set it up with a wallpaper that effectively changes the rear cover&#39;s design. You can also activate a customizable notifications center or just leave it on your favorite novel, glancing down and taking in a few pages of fiction to pass the time in an elevator. The display lets you use your phone without consuming almost any power, effectively transforming a lackluster 2500 mAh battery into something that can last for days on end without charging.","Having an e-ink display built into your smartphone is a feature we never knew we wanted. It opens up a bevy of useful possibilities, such as having a basic viewfinder for high-quality, rear-camera selfies. You can check texts in the theater without bothering anyone around you, or just have an always-visible calendar and analog clock atop your desk.","The YotaPhone 2&#39;s e-ink screen is unquestionably fun and useful. Unfortunately, the rest of the device isn&#39;t too exciting. Its 8-megapixel camera is decent, but it takes a bit of time to focus and can shudder through colors as it tries to find the best balance for a scene. Its 2.3 GHz processor can handle apps just fine, but doesn&#39;t offer the same snappy, fluid user experience you get from other flagships. Also, while the device&#39;s overall construction is sturdy, it lacks the aesthetic flair you find in an Apple or HTC phone.","Put simply, the YotaPhone 2 is a top smartphone that deserves a spot in our lineup. While it&#39;s priced in the same tier as the latest devices from Motorola and Samsung, it doesn&#39;t have the power and polish of a true flagship."]},"id":"09e36c63-f370-4ec3-b201-0034220d3f98","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b703158b-3c65-4ca8-bb64-725537b242ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In our reviews of the best smartphones in the world, we&#39;re rarely taken aback by single features.
