The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/kitchen/best-dishwashers/\">Dishwashers</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Maytag MDB4949SDM dishwasher uses high temperatures, steam and spray jets to clean your dishes. Between the heat and water pressure, this dishwasher can clean heavily soiled dishes without a problem.","This built-in dishwasher is not the most energy-efficient. It projects an annual operating cost of $32, which is higher than most of the other units in our lineup. While this dishwasher is certified by ENERGY STAR, it does not have an eco-friendly wash cycle. While this means higher energy usage and costs, the dishwasher has short cycle times, with its normal cycle only running for 111 minutes.","This Maytag dishwasher offers five wash cycles and five wash options that provide you with basic washing capabilities. The unit’s cycles include auto clean, normal, PowerBlast, quick wash and rinse only. Unfortunately, the dishwasher does not have wash zones, nor does it offer a top rack-only cycle. However, you can pair the wash options to the cycles. These include a 24-hour delay-start timer, a control lock, heated dry, a high-temperature wash and a sanitizing rinse.","The integrated dishwasher has adjustable racks and fold-down tines that you can use to alter the interior to hold your oversized and odd-shaped dishes. The model holds up to 12 place settings on two racks. It has three spray arms, as well as spray jets, that effectively clean your dishes. The dishwasher also has a status light that displays the status of the cycle. This Maytag dishwasher locks when it is closed to prevent children from disrupting the cycle.","The tub of this dishwasher is made out of stainless steel. The material not only performs as insulation lowering the noise, but it also serves as a heating element that helps dry the dishes quickly. The dishwasher measures at 50 decibels when it is running, which is louder than most of the units in our lineup. However, the machine still operates quietly enough that you will not notice it running.","This stainless steel dishwasher includes several features that make it convenient and easy to use. With a 24-hour delay-start timer, you can run the dishwasher during off-peak hours and save on your energy bill. This unit also includes a hard-food disposer and a self-cleaning filter. While these increase the noise level of the dishwasher, they make it so you do not have to manually clean food out of the dishwasher.","Maytag provides a solid warranty with this unit. The parts and labor are covered for one year, while the electronics, racks, tub and liner are covered for 10 years. If you need to contact Maytag, the website lists a phone number, email and a link to its live chat."]},"id":"e13c0426-2b59-4aa1-a08f-e70fddaeb1f6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8cde499b-91a0-42ee-910f-492c2ffac45f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Between the heat, steam and jets, this dishwasher will thoroughly clean your dishes so that you do not have to prewash or soak them.
