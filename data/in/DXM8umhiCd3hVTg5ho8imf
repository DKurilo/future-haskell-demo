Each of the burners has its own ignition and temperature control knob, so you can decide how much heat you need depending on the size of your barbeque party. Use one or two for a few dinner guests, or fire up all three and heat the whole 500 square inches for your next neighborhood block party.","While this infrared barbeque grill doesn&#39;t come assembled, the 26 interlocking pieces are a snap to put together. This unit has four wheels for easily moving and positioning it on your back porch. Each wheel has locking casters, so your grill will stay put once it&#39;s in grilling position, or later when it&#39;s stored safely in its corner.","The Saber Cast 500 P comes equipped with the important features of infrared grills, such as a warming rack, under-the-grill storage and a temperature gauge. It even comes with a grill cleaning tool, something not found with every grill. However, it still lacks features found on the best infrared BBQ grills, such as a rotisserie rack, smoker box and hood lights.","This infrared gas grill uses liquid propane to quickly heat up to 24,000 BTUs. If natural gas is more to your liking, the Saber Cast 500 P can be converted to use either source of fuel.","The Saber BBQ grill comes with a five-year warranty on its burners and a year warranty on its other parts. This isn&#39;t very long considering that many infrared grills we reviewed come with a lifetime warranty on its burners, some on the entire grill.","If you need to contact support personnel about your grill&#39;s warranty, help assembling the grill or answers to other questions, Saber does offer a good selection of support options. User manuals and a FAQs section are both available online. If you need to contact someone directly, you can use either telephone or email support. Additionally, Saber has a presence on social media outlets, such as Facebook, where you can get more help and hints for creating the best BBQ."]},"id":"82891575-e297-4cc9-a5ed-4d2d54c84d78","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c73de5bc-e398-4187-834c-bfc5e653cbd1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Saber Cast 500 P is a sturdy, sleek-looking freestanding BBQ grill with the infrared burners that help heat up the grill quickly while keep moisture in food.
