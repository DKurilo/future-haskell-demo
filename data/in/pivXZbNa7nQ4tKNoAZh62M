These PET-film <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1204-best-iphone-7-screen-protectors.html\">iPhone screen protectors</a> are tough enough to protect your phone from typical screen-marring culprits such as keys metal pieces on pen caps. This iPhone screen protector does a good job of blending into the iPhone&#39;s design, but you&#39;ll still be able to tell the phone isn&#39;t naked.","The MediaDevil screen protector will shield your iPhone screen from daily threats such as keys and pens. However, it won&#39;t hold up against razor blades and other sharper objects. The company didn&#39;t disclose how hard or thick the material is. It isn&#39;t as durable as other iPhone screen protectors we reviewed, though.","This remarkably slim material goes on your phone easily. It fits well to the size and shape of the phone. The adhesive doesn&#39;t bind the iPhone screen protector to your phone immediately. Instead, it remains slightly repositionable for a little while. This allows you to get precisely the right fit to your screen. You can work out air bubbles easily during this time.","Unfortunately, since the Magicscreen matches the iPhone&#39;s screen so well, it&#39;s a little bit tricky to remove. MediaDevil recommends that you use adhesive tape on the edges to lift the protector from the screen if you need to remove dust or air bubbles. Attempting to use your fingernails to pull up the edges of the Magicscreen can damage the protector and remove some of the adhesive.","Some manufacturers offer a lifetime replacement warranty for as long as you own the device, but MediaDevil doesn&#39;t even offer a limited warranty. The rest of its customer support, including FAQs and email support, is more than adequate.","You can find an iPhone 6 screen protector or one for the iPhone 4 or 4S. In fact, MediaDevil has several iPhone screen protectors for each phone model. You can choose from glossy, matte and privacy screen protectors."]},"id":"c75e4604-89e5-4ff3-8aeb-3c7da91d1f6b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8b0da1d6-3d8c-4e43-8f4b-3991d4eaa790","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re looking for an iPhone screen protector that doesn&#39;t draw attention to itself, then the MediaDevil Magicscreen will be a great match for you.
