Cooking style, patience for chores like cleaning up and budget vary significantly from person to person, so there isn’t a one-size-fits-all cooktop.","<strong>How We Researched<br/></strong>","Our extensive reading, viewing, questioning and interviewing produced an abundance of information about gas cooktops. For example, we learned about functionality, extras and even what makes a cooktop attractive<strong>. </strong>We compared each model’s specifications against the group, read information on the manufacturers&#39; websites, studied the fine print in manuals, and looked at warranty details to see how long you’re covered if anything goes wrong. We also considered how visually appealing the cooktops are, since they play a prominent role in any kitchen.","<strong>Further Information</strong>","<strong>How Much Does a Gas Cooktop Cost?</strong>","You can spend as much for a gas cooktop as an electric one, but there are gas models out there that are much more affordable. The gas cooktops we evaluated start in the $800 range and go up to about $2,000 – and that is pretty representative of the top-selling brands in the industry. You can find gas cooktops for $500 or less, but they don’t have prime features or as much power as higher-priced models.","<strong>Why Many Cooks Love Gas Cooktops</strong>","Electric cooktops and ranges with glass ceramic burners gained favor when they came on the scene in the 1970s. They heat up quickly, and many consumers liked their sleek, modern appearance. Still, serious food-lovers, home cooks and professional chefs are devoted to their gas cooktops.","Long-time Utah resident Marilyn Pierce, 87, has been cooking since she was 9 years old and has always cooked with gas. She loves the control it gives her over temperature, whether she&#39;s making meals or canning produce in the summer. Although some might disagree with her, she&#39;s also convinced that gas is a safer cooking method.","&#34;I&#39;ve never cooked with anything else, but I have seen what people who cook with electricity have to do if a pan is boiling,&#34; she said. &#34;They have to move it because turning the heat off underneath a pan – if it&#39;s an electric [burner] – it&#39;s still hot. You have to move a big, heavy pan, and that&#39;s reason enough to cook with gas.&#34;","Olga, the author of the blog <a href=\"http://www.olgasflavorfactory.com/\">Olga&#39;s Flavor Factory</a>, also favors gas cooktops. She finds them easy to clean and thinks they offer more cooking space and cost less to operate than electric models. She can also do things like roast a pepper right in the burner flames. And she, too, believes a gas cooktop gives her greater control over heat.","&#34;If you want to turn up the heat or turn down the heat, you can do so immediately with a gas cooktop,&#34; Olga writes. &#34;If you are using an electric cooktop, it will take some time to adjust. If you have something about to boil over, you will need to take it off the burner, or have an ugly spillage on your hands. With a gas cooktop, all you have to do is turn the knob.&#34;","<strong>How to Get Your Gas Cooktop Really Clean</strong>","Many cooks love cooking with gas, but with open flames and spills and splashes, some burned on grime and grease is inevitable. It helps to wipe everything down on a daily basis, but from time to time, you need to do a bit of extra work to keep your gas cooktop clean and attractive.","It’s best to check the user manual first to see if the manufacturer recommends special detergents or surface cleaning creams. You want to avoid using any cleaning product or cloth that may scratch your expensive cooktop.","Generally, the first step is to remove the grates and soak them in a sink filled with hot water and either dish soap or whatever product the manufacturer recommends. An <a href=\"https://homeguides.sfgate.com/clean-cookedon-food-gas-stove-range-28093.html\">article on SFGate</a> recommends a 20-minute soak, but if there is a lot of burned-on food, you can leave the grates to soak overnight. You can then use a mesh pad or a cleaning brush to carefully wipe away the loosened dried-on materials, rinse the grates and dry them. ","As you scrape off burned-on messes on the cooktop’s surface, be gentle and use a plastic utensil such as a plastic knife or spatula so you don’t mar the surface. After that, wipe up what you pried off. ","You can scrub the rest of the cooktop using a cloth and a paste made of two parts baking soda and one part water, then rinse it with clear water and dry. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+clean+gas+cooktop&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS832US833&amp;oq=how+to+clean+gas+cooktop&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3926j1j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#kpvalbx=1\">A video produced by Sears</a> also recommends cleaning the burner head slots with an old toothbrush and clearing any food clogging the slots with a paperclip, needle or piece of wire. You can also use these tools to clean the ignition port, which is on the side and slightly under the burner head.","<strong>Related Guides:</strong><br/><a href=\"/best-electric-cooktops\"><br/></a>"]},"id":"5c152fff-d664-41e6-98f3-7e85d51a470c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-hot-plates\">The Best Hot Plates</a>","<a href=\"/best-electric-cooktops\">The Best Electric Cooktops<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-induction-cooktops\">The Best Induction Cooktops<br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-ovens-review\">The Best Gas and Electric Ranges Overall</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e9734bef-52ac-437a-81bf-24e64ad8cc61","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_53","url":"/best-gas-cooktops","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-02-08T15:01:00Z","datePublished":"2019-02-08T15:01:00Z","name":"Best Gas Cooktops of 2019","synopsis":"The best gas stove tops have a wide range of features and come in a variety of sizes, although 36-inch and 32-inch models are most common.","review":{},"strapline":"The best gas stove tops have a wide range of features and come in a variety of sizes, although 36-inch and 32-inch models are most common.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-11T17:31:40Z","id":"3Bv5JWbbdqUK2p5nHmAEu6","meta":{"title":"Best Gas Cooktops 2019 -
