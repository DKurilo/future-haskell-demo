You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Pyle PLCM7500 <a href=\"/best-backup-camera\">backup camera kit</a> provides you with a wide field of view, night vision and a relatively high-resolution 7-inch display. Although it&#39;s wired design has some drawbacks when compared to wireless options, it remains a solid choice for those seeking a high-quality camera at a good price.","At 170 degrees, this has one the widest fields of view in our lineup. Only the <a href=\"/chuanganzhuo-review\">Chuanganzhuo Backup Camera and Rearview Mirror Kit</a> has a similarly wide field of view. This means that you&#39;ll be able to see more of your surroundings when using your backup camera. Keep in mind, however, that there will also be more fish-eye distortion when working with wider angles.","One of the biggest downsides to the Pyle PLCM7500 is that it is not wireless like the <a href=\"/pyle-backup-camera-review\">Pyle PLCM34WIR</a>, which costs the same but doesn&#39;t require the technical installation. For this reason, installation can be significantly more difficult. Unlike many of the backup camera systems in our review, you must run cables the full length of your vehicle in order to connect your camera to its display. Once installed, however, there is little difference between wired and wireless. In fact,  wired is more reliable and less prone to interference.","Although it&#39;s unlikely that your camera will ever be submerged, and you&#39;ve got bigger problems if it is, the Pyle PLCM7500 is protected with a waterproof housing. This keeps your camera dry and functioning properly even after heavy rain.","At 7 inches, the monitor that comes with the PLCM7500 is larger than any other monitor in our review by a significant margin. If you&#39;ve got a smaller vehicle it might be a little overpowering aesthetically, but practically speaking, you&#39;re only going to benefit from a larger display. This display also has audio and video inputs, so you can use it to display images from a source of your choice.","The PLCM7500 is covered by a yearlong warranty. This is pretty typical for backup camera systems. If you have any issues with your camera, you can contact Pyle via email. Unfortunately, there aren&#39;t phone or live chat options."]},"id":"6fbaf494-fee8-44af-a022-50a0adcee8a0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"555e3898-53fc-4e84-8cc0-df7b8fd0b626","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pyle PLCM7500 is a well-made and capable backup camera with a wide field of view, a large display and a good price.
