Because heat pumps use the surrounding air to heat the pool water, the HeatPro is best suited to locations where the temperature rarely dips below 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

As with all heaters, we recommend also using a solar cover when the pool is not in use to insulate the water to prevent heat loss and evaporation."]},"id":"be791fd0-b924-46a9-b25e-6d5f110fd8fa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"59a878b2-262b-4c76-a55a-8d7d10ccd045","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/4md8b53vP3BtprMTevJSQa.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Hayward HeatPro line of heat pumps has several size options that range from 95,000 British thermal units (Btu) to 140,000 Btu.

This is a number higher than one determined by each manufacturer, and it changes depending on different circumstances. This means the COP isn’t the most reliable metric, but it does give you some idea of the product’s efficiency. Hayward is helpful in that it gives the HeatPro’s COP under different circumstances. For example, the HP21104T has a COP of 5.7 when the ambient temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit with 80-percent relative humidity and you set 80 degrees as your desired water temperature. The COP goes down (higher is better) as the ambient temperature drops.","Because heat pumps rely on the heat in the outside air, most products do not work in temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The HeatPro, however, is available in a low ambient option that works until temps hit 40 degrees.

The HeatPro is built with a rugged UV-resistant, weatherproof exterior to protect against environmental damage. It also features an Ultra Gold evaporator fin that resists corrosion, even in coastal environments, and a titanium heat exchanger that also resists corrosion.
