The underside of the blanket has a row of raised air pockets that make it look like a large piece of bubble wrap.

This solar cover will keep dirt and debris out of your pool while providing passive heat. Its thickness of 8 mils, or 0.008 inches, is relatively thin when compared with many of the pool covers in our lineup, so it can’t trap as much thermal energy.  <br />\n  <br />\nThis solar blanket is affordable and effective at both protecting and heating your pool.

These bubbles also insulate the water from the cooler air blowing above the pool.  <br />\n  <br />\nOne problem with the pool cover is that, while it has the beautiful aquamarine color homeowners love, the blue color somewhat diminishes its effectiveness at heating your pool. It can still potentially heat your pool up to 15 percent, but it does not completely transmit the full spectrum of incident sunlight like clear solar pool covers do. Another flaw is its lack of a UV-protective film. This significantly affects its longevity, as ultraviolet rays split the seams of the blanket and shrink its bubbles over time.","<a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"3e4c46f9-fd8f-4416-ad64-fbc2b47fa144","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best for Above Ground Pools"},"id":"3e767e48-1dff-424a-bce0-1abacb405929","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/TgNNpQGcXqfeuBG9xgkiRN.jpg","link":{"href":"/health/wellness/best-solar-blankets/blue-wave-above-ground-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/K/J/736867/original/Solar-Pool-Covers-Blue-Wave-001.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TgNNpQGcXqfeuBG9xgkiRN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"TgNNpQGcXqfeuBG9xgkiRN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TgNNpQGcXqfeuBG9xgkiRN.jpg","alt":"Blue Wave Above Ground Magni-Clear"},"id":"9388cd54-b49b-4a7b-80f4-98e99cb0babe","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Blue Wave Above Ground Magni-Clear\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Blue Wave Above Ground Magni-Clear</a>","pros":["It’s made of a durable 1,200-gauge plastic polymer material.","The transparent material absorbs sunlight efficiently.","It’s backed by a five-year warranty."],"cons":["It’s not big enough to cover an extremely large pool.","It is harder to move, roll up and store than thinner blankets.","It’s pricey when compared with other solar pool covers in our lineup."]},"id":"0ff695eb-1c61-4254-b2d6-d82662d10203","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Magni-Clear Solar Blanket from Blue Wave is a solar cover designed for above-ground pools.

In our recent evaluation, we spent more than 30 hours doing extensive online research, comparing features on product pages, watching videos and reading customer reviews. We contacted manufacturers and other professionals to get expert opinions about the best solar blankets for different types of pools. ","<strong>How We Researched<br/></strong>","We spent over 30 hours researching solar pool covers online, watching video tutorials, reading customer reviews and consulting with manufacturers to learn everything we can about pool covers to make useful recommendations. We compared features and price points, and we weighed them against what customer reviews and manufacturers said in order to find pool covers that work best for different needs. The companies we contacted had no influence over our assessments of the products themselves. Results of our evaluations were not provided to the companies in advance of publication. ","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying Solar Pool Covers</strong>","Thickness<br/>The thickness of a solar blanket varies from 8 to 16 mils (800 to 1,600 gauge). While solar pool covers don’t have the thickness required to keep pets and small children safe, as some pool covers do, they will keep leaves and dirt from blowing into the pool. All solar pool covers will minimize pool debris, but thicker blankets will retain heat better than thin blankets. Thicker blankets, however, are harder to move and roll up.","Ultraviolet Resistance &amp; Color<br/>People often gravitate to aquamarine and dark-colored solar pool covers because they look good resting on top of your pool. But colored blankets aren’t as effective as clear blankets at allowing the sun’s rays to pass through. A black blanket heats up quickly but isn’t as efficient as clear blankets at allowing the heat to be absorbed into the pool because it blocks the sunlight. Since a solar blanket spends significant time in the sun, a stabilized blanket with solar protection and UV resistance will last longer than one lacking those features.","Size &amp; Fitting<br/>The size of your swimming pool is an important consideration when shopping for a solar cover. An undersized blanket is better than leaving your pool completely exposed, but it’s obviously preferable to find a blanket that covers the entire pool. Measure your pool at its widest and longest sections before buying a blanket.
