You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Driver Navigator is <a href=\"/best-driver-update-software\">driver update software</a> that can scan your computer and help you install some of the correct updates. However, it never returned a thorough scan in our tests and isn&#39;t the easiest software to use, which is why it scored low on our lineup.","Driver Navigator is one of the less thorough driver programs we reviewed. Out of the 277 outdated drivers on our test PC, it only identified 69. By comparison, <a href=\"/driver-checker-review\">Driver Checker</a> was the only app that performed worse, finding 59 drivers. That said, even the best performing app, <a href=\"/smart-driver-updater-review\">Smart Driver Updater</a>, only found 126 drivers, so none of the products are very successful. On a positive note, you can click on existing and new drivers to get more information about their sources and version details.","Though the program is basic and more or less does what it advertises it can do, it&#39;s not very easy to use. Unlike the best driver update software on our lineup, Driver Navigator makes you open and install all updates by yourself; it does not automatically do it, though it does download the updates for you with one click. You can also schedule scans to run periodically. If you&#39;re worried about an update not installing correctly, the software can create a backup of your system&#39;s drivers and even restore them if necessary.","After testing the software, we were happy to see that it did not download any malware, bloatware or ads onto our test computer. It may not be the best driver update software, but it only does what it advertises, with no unwelcome additions. It also allows you to verify that the updates the system recommends installing are from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).","The software&#39;s manufacturer, Easeware Technology Limited, only provides a few technical support options. Whereas some developers offer multiple ways to contact their support teams directly, Easeware only offers contact via email, which naturally involves a waiting period. However, there is a scant FAQs section that may answer some questions you have."]},"id":"5f514dfa-0769-48e5-9265-50b0153b1184","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c001b35f-1c20-4004-a2e7-daa238bd491c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Driver Navigator gives you a general idea of what drivers on your computer are out of date and lets you backup and restore them.
