This program is designed for individuals who already have the basics of the English language down but still want to improve and become more fluent in the language. It uses reading, writing, listening and speaking methods to help you more easily learn English as a second language.","Exceller has two options to help you learn. This learning English software&#39;s English Tutor provides a variety of exercises such as multiple choice, reading and writing, reading comprehension, and filling in the blanks to help you gradually become a more advanced English speaker and understand English grammar. The program gives you encouragement for even partially correct answers and offers feedback on the exercises you complete.","In case you feel stuck or need help with an exercise, there are hint buttons that can guide you toward the correct answer. The English Tutor option from Exceller is not only available for individual users but also for schools or colleges. You can purchase licenses in bulk if needed.","Another option for learning English from Exceller is its numerous apps. This company provides a handful of apps for your mobile devices that help you learn English no matter where you are, as long as you have your mobile device with you. Each app is designed for a different part of the English language, such as reading, vocabulary, present tense, past tense or pronouns. You have to purchase each app separately for help in each specific area. However, this is a nice benefit if you are only looking for lessons targeted toward a certain aspect of the English language.","Exceller doesn&#39;t provide tons of customer support options if you have questions or concerns. There are email and telephone options to contact a support representative, but there are no FAQs or other support resources on the company website to answer any additional questions you may have.","Exceller provides some strong options for learning English as a second language. If you want some help in only a few areas of the language, the apps are worthwhile, but if you want to become fluent and proficient with English grammar, the Exceller English Tutor is worth your consideration."]},"id":"5e6429ad-e3b9-4478-9d7d-e532927d7881","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68454","url":"/exceller-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-26T14:58:51Z","datePublished":"2016-09-26T14:58:51Z","name":"Exceller","synopsis":"Exceller is a web-based learning English program to help you perfect the English language and become a better communicator.
