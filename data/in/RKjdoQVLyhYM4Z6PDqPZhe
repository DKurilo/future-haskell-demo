You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hamilton Beach 40729 <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a> is similar to an Italian-style espresso maker in that it uses a 15-bar pump to heat up the water for your cappuccino. It also comes with 1100 watts of power that will heat up your water in a matter of a few moments. This espresso machine also comes with a removable water tank that is easy to fill.","If you are a cappuccino lover, you will appreciate the features of this appliance. The first thing we noticed when reviewing this espresso machine is that it comes with a 15-bar pump. This is similar to how commercial espresso machines are set up. The number of bars equate to the amount of pressure that is used to force the water through the espresso grounds to produce a cup of great java.. This appliance also offers 1100 watts of power, which means you will not have to wait long for the machine to heat up for your cup of steaming cappuccino.","This device also comes with a removable drip tray that will make cleanup less of a chore. In addition, this machine offers a heated cup-warming plate. This will ensure that you always have a steaming cup of espresso at your fingertips. Moreover, this cappuccino makes comes with an illuminated on/off switch that will serve as a safety warning to your family that the machine is hot.","This appliance offers a removable water reservoir. We would have liked to see the reservoir hold more than two cups of water at one time. However, because this espresso machine can only produce up to two cups of espresso at once, we feel that this is suitable. But if you are someone who plans to make larger quantities of cappuccino, be prepared to spend more time in the kitchen with this appliance.","One of the features we do like about this appliance is that it will allow you to use ground espresso in the removable filter, or you can use espresso pods. By using the pods, you will no longer have to worry about measuring out the ground espresso and tamping it into the filter. This is an added convenience anyone who is on a timeline will appreciate.","Hamilton Beach&#39;s website offers plenty of help and support to make sure you know how to best use your new appliance. They offer a toll-free telephone number where you can speak to someone in their customer service department. What we really like about this is there are different numbers for different products, so you do not have to worry about discussing your espresso machine issues with someone who specializes in cordless vacuum cleaners.","Also available on their website is their email address for customer support as well as their physical address. They also offer a list of FAQs, and there are use and care guides available for download. Additionally, you can register your product on their website and find out about important information such as recalls."]},"id":"acd3b081-442d-4099-8215-f5900f91a2f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1116794-7bed-43fb-b6f4-8c754289c23d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Hamilton Beach 40729</strong> is a great commercial-style espresso machine.
