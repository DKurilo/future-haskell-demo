However, mobile credit card processing is changing things by making it easier and cheaper for small businesses to accept cards.","Square is one of the top <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">mobile credit card processing services</a>. Square makes it possible for you to accept most credit cards anywhere. Square card readers plug into your smartphone headset jack or connect via Bluetooth and work on any iOS and Android device. It encrypts data and doesn&#39;t store credit card information on your phone. Square accepts most credit cards and deposits funds quickly into your bank account. Although Square has many benefits, it may not be ideal for all companies.","<strong>Why is Square So Popular?</strong>","Square&#39;s popularity as a small business payment processing solution can be attributed to its ease of use. It is extremely user-friendly and the hardware is inexpensive. When you sign up for Square, you receive, at no cost, the Square magstripe reader, which connects to your smartphone&#39;s headset jack. Its Contactless + Chip Reader (which accepts EMV chip cards and mobile wallets, like Apple Pay) costs $49.","The Square app allows you to manage your business right from your phone. You can send receipts via email or text messages (which include taxes, tipping and discounts), view sales reports and manage your inventory, all within one app.","Furthermore, you don&#39;t have to worry about paying monthly statement fees or meeting certain minimums. However, Square&#39;s processing and transaction fees are a big reason why this service will either hinder your business or help it grow.","<strong>Square&#39;s Fees &amp; Rates</strong>","As mentioned before, Square does not charge a monthly fee. You will also not be charged any fees for activation, downloading the Square app, early termination, chargebacks or refunds. Additionally, there are no fees for long periods of inactivity.","However, Square charges a 2.75 percent processing fee for every swiped transaction. This means that a $100 transaction would incur a $2.75 charge. If you manually enter a credit card number, you will be charged a 3.5 percent fee along with an additional $0.15 charge, costing you $3.65. For online invoice payments and eCommerce transactions, Square charges a 2.90 percent fee along with an additional $0.30 charge, so that $100 transaction would cost you $3.20.","While these seem like fairly steep fees, they are similar to other services. For example, to use Capital One&#39;s mobile credit card processing service Spark Pay, you pay 2.65 percent plus $0.05 per transaction on its Go Plan. For keyed-in transactions, you pay a 3.7 percent fee. Or, if you choose the Pro Plan from Spark Pay, your fee per transaction drops to 1.99 percent plus $0.05 per transaction, but you pay a $19 monthly fee.","PayPal Here, another mobile credit card service, is also similar to Square and charges 2.7 percent for every credit card swipe and 3.5 percent plus $0.15 for keyed-in transactions. Like Square, these companies charge no monthly, activation or cancellation fees.","<strong>Software Fees to Be Aware Of</strong>","Where you may incur more fees and charges is if you enroll in Square&#39;s software-based tools. Square offers additional business services that you can add to your credit card processing, such as payroll, employee management and email marketing.","Although these services can be convenient, the additional monthly charges can quickly add up. For example, if you add payroll, you pay $30 each month for each employee. You can also add on employee management software for $5 per month per employee. Email marketing costs $15 per month, loyalty program management costs $25 per month, and online appointments cost between $30 and $90 per month.","<strong>Will Square Benefit Large or Small Businesses?</strong>","Overall, Square is comparative with similar mobile credit card processing companies when it comes to its transaction fees and rates. The difference in transaction fees is minimal and unless you have several extremely large transactions, you may not see much of a difference between the different services. However, if your monthly sales exceed $3,000, you may want to look for a standard credit card processing service that offers lower processing costs, even though it will charge a monthly fee.","Square is a mobile credit card processor worth considering and is ideal for smaller businesses or individuals since you won&#39;t have to worry about the monthly charges and fees that other credit card processing companies require. Also, companies with sales numbers that vary each month can benefit from this service since there isn&#39;t a monthly minimum that you have to meet in order to avoid a fee. However, before you jump on the Square bandwagon, take a look at your sales each month and spend time crunching the numbers to find out which credit card processor is the best fit for your business."]},"id":"190eca71-699a-4836-9d9b-980f1919ba80","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10304","url":"/are-squares-credit-card-processing-fees-too-expensive","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-29T18:59:24Z","datePublished":"2016-11-29T18:59:24Z","name":"Are Square's Credit Card Processing Fees Too Expensive?","synopsis":"As a small business owner, you may have resisted accepting credit card payments due to equipment costs and fees or because it seemed difficult to set up.","review":{},"strapline":"As a small business owner, you may have resisted accepting credit card payments due to equipment costs and fees or because it seemed difficult to set up.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-29T19:02:32Z","id":"jas53roSjso55hdwjcnz2Q","meta":{"title":"Are Square's Credit Card Processing Fees Too Expensive?","description":"Square is a popular option for processing credit cards.
