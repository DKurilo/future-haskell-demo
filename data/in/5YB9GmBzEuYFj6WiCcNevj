If you&#39;re a kid, it’s the coolest <a href=\"/best-remote-control-airplanes\">remote control airplane</a> you can get your hands on. With an age range from 10 to 12 years old, the Air Hogs Sky Stunt is perfect for teaching kids how to fly, but it&#39;s not limited to  them. It&#39;s also a great way for you to learn to fly while pulling off basic stunts. The plane comes fully assembled – all you need to do is charge the internal battery. The plane will fly for about 10 minutes on a single charge. On windy days, however, that flight time drops significantly. This RC plane moves fast, does stunts and has a 300-foot range, so it is best to fly it outside in a large field or park.","Air Hogs based the Sky Stunt’s design on actual stunt planes. It looks great with a nice paint job and sticker set. The Air Hogs Sky Stunt is quite small. It has a 10-inch wingspan, but is still powerful enough to perform loops, corkscrews and sharp edge turns. The entire plane  is made of a durable foam that can withstand numerous crash landings. The Air Hogs Sky Stunt comes with two extra propellers, but once those are gone, you&#39;ll have to purchase a new Sky Stunt, as you can&#39;t buy replacement parts. However, the Air Hogs Sky Stunt is so inexpensive that you get your money&#39;s worth before having to replace it.","The Air Hogs Sky Stunt comes with a remote control, or transmitter, that needs six AA batteries to operate. This two-channel transmitter controls the throttle and the rudder. This means  you can control the power to the propeller, as well as the left and right turn capability. The button on the top of the transmitter controls the stunt aspect of the plane. When you press the stunt button, it increases the throttle and pulls the Air Hogs Sky Stunt into loops and corkscrews, as well as  stalls and quick turns. To charge the internal battery in the Air Hogs Sky Stunt, you only need to plug it in to the terminal on the transmitter for about 30 to 40 minutes before you can start flying."]},"id":"2fe3724b-540b-43ac-95b9-dfce38502ffb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"de543682-d5a3-4b8b-9c35-add3b007cb69","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a great beginner RC plane and is best when flown outdoors in wide-open spaces.
