I&#39;ve owned and tested almost every brand on the market, investing anywhere from $20 on a Skullcandy Ink&#39;d to as much as $499 on the Shure SE535. Earphones have become so much a part of my appearance that people often mistake them for hearing aids, earrings or necklaces (when they&#39;re not in my ears). It&#39;s safe to say I am a connoisseur of earphones. ","For me, a proper pair of earphones is as important as a comfortable pair of shoes. Above all, it needs to sound flawless and fit comfortably for hours of listening. However, one of the issues I&#39;ve come across in recent years is the question of whether I should go with <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">wireless earbuds</a> or stick with wired earbuds.
