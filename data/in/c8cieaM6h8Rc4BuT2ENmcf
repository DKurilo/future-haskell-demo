The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on <a href=\"/best-wireless-routers\">Wireless Routers</a> here.</em>","Of all of the wireless n routers for home users on a budget, the On Networks N150 WiFi Router is perhaps the most basic, with the fewest number of features. Nevertheless, it would work well for you if you need a router for a dorm room or an apartment and you do not require fancy features such as parental controls or the ability to set up a guest network.","<strong>Attributes</strong><br/>The On Networks N150 WiFi Router has a theoretical speed of 150Mbps. It supports IEEE 802.11b/g/n at 2.4GHz. It also supports 10/100Mbps Ethernet, with one LAN port and two WAN ports. The software includes Quality of Service so that you can control which priorities this wireless internet router assigns to various classes of multimedia streams. In other words, you can set it up to remain jitter free during video streaming while allowing it to lag somewhat for email and basic web browsing, for example.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>Although it doesn&#39;t have some of the security features that the best wireless routers we reviewed have, the On Networks N150 provides the essentials. It has a NAT (Network Address Translation) firewall, which is a form of firewall that lets a local-area network hide its internal IP addresses. The router supports legacy wireless device security by providing WEP encryption. However, if you want to use legacy devices and WEP, your data-transfer speed will be limited to 54Mbps. The On Networks router also supports state-of-the-art encryption and Wi-Fi Protected Access. However, the N150 is nothing fancy. There is no support for parental controls, or an option to create a guest network.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong><br/>The On Networks N150 entry-level router is as easy to use as any of the best home wireless routers on our lineup. There is a web interface to control the settings, and you can install and configure the router without using a CD. Wi-Fi Protected Setup lets you configure and secure client devices by pressing a single button. Universal Plug and Play makes it easy to connect multimedia players. The installation guide and manual contain clear instructions and useful graphics.","<strong>Help and Support</strong><br/>Support is free for the first 90 days, and you can access support by online chat and email. The warranty covers the device for one year."]},"id":"f9ac3167-1d91-4ffb-9325-28fb08caa35e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"41de4151-e046-409d-b370-55e6b0f84131","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Consider the On Networks N150 WiFi Router if you have a dorm room or apartment and you don&#39;t need a router with parental controls or a guest network. The N150 is great for those who are on a budget. If you need maximum performance, you shouldn&#39;t even be looking at a wireless n router because ac routers are now available. However, if you don&#39;t want to spend the money to buy an ac router and then to upgrade your laptops, tablets and smartphones to take advantage of the speed increase that comes with an IEEE 802.11ac router, the N150 is an affordable way to manage wireless, at-home internet access without spending hundreds of dollars on equipment."]},"id":"bec57a42-041b-4ba4-a5e0-6feabd32b6a0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57377","url":"/on-networks-n150-wifi-router-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-09-04T18:42:04Z","datePublished":"2013-09-04T18:42:04Z","name":"On Networks N150 WiFi Router","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
