It’s a relatively affordable program, but its benefits don’t stand out compared to those offered by other services.","The Basic Auto plan costs about $59 a year, or close to $5 a month. There’s also a $15 sign-up fee, something no other roadside assistance service charges. If you switch from AAA or share Better World Club with three friends, however, the company will waive the fee. You must pay an additional $35 to add another person to the basic plan, and you can add up to three additional people.","Better World Club’s basic plan has standard benefits. You get 5 miles of free towing, which is comparable with most other basic plans we reviewed, though <a href=\"/good-sam-roadside-assistance-review\">Good Sam</a> offers unlimited towing. With this plan, Better World Club also reimburses you up to $50 for a locksmith and covers the cost of fuel delivery, though you have to pay for the fuel.","The basic plan includes trip interruption reimbursement, something most low-tier plans don’t cover. So, if you’re in an accident far from home, Better World Club reimburses you for food, lodging and car rentals, up to $500 per incident and $1,000 per year. The Premium plan increases this limit to $1,500 with a max of $750 per incident.","Better World Club’s Premium plan costs $95 a year, or nearly $8 a month. It costs $49 to add another person to your plan, and you can add up to three more people. The Premium plan includes 100 miles of free towing and $100 worth of locksmith reimbursement. If you run out of fuel, you can have it delivered, and Better World Club provides 2 gallons free.","One of Better World Club’s drawbacks is you only get four service calls each year. That’s about average for the industry, but some roadside assistance programs offer unlimited service calls.","Better World Club also offers bicycle roadside assistance, with 30 miles of free transportation if your bike breaks down. This service costs $39.95 annually."]},"id":"e98a079d-beb9-45d8-875f-0c4ef3dd7cf0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53679","url":"/better-world-club-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-09-25T18:11:11Z","datePublished":"2011-09-25T18:11:11Z","name":"Better World Club","synopsis":"Better World Club is an earth-conscious roadside assistance service.
