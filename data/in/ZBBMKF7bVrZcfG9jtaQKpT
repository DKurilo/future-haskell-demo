Just in the last year and a half we spent more than 130 hours researching. We evaluated 30 refrigerators, which we narrowed down to the 10 best, in a predetermined price range, to include in our lineup. We did extensive online research, comparing product pages and looking for specific standout features in different models.<br/><br/>More expensive models, which we also evaluated in depth, have some extra features, like door-in-door access that lets you quickly access snacks and save energy by limiting the amount of cold air that escapes. Smart features, which allow you do things like check the temperature from your smartphone, are also understandably more common on those more expensive models. In our comparison we went with models priced to make them more accessible to a broader section of the population. <br/><br/>We went to stores to look at these models closely, test capacities and get store representatives’ opinions about the best models and best features. As questions arose during research we contacted manufacturers to get answers. We reached out to other professionals and industry insiders to broaden our perspective and understanding with their expertise. Our in-depth research is reflected in our comparison chart and detailed in our reviews to help you make an informed decision about the best side-by-side refrigerator for you."]},"id":"5b284950-1a31-4389-8037-01d6158fc774","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How We Researched and Evaluated <br/></strong><br/>When considering side-by-side refrigerators, we looked for the standard features and options, such as adjustable shelves and a water and ice dispenser. We also examined some features that are useful bonuses, such as temperature- or humidity-controlled drawers and space-saving icemakers.<br/><br/>We also checked the flexibility that you get from the refrigerator&#39;s design and the adaptability of the interior space. Although there is always a set amount of space in each refrigerator, its capacity can be expanded in a sense if you get a number of adjustable shelves and different sizes of bins. Adjustable shelves are important so you can accommodate food and containers of all sizes. Many models include humidity-controlled crisper drawers, and some include temperature-controlled drawers. Some side-by-side refrigerators also include a deli or snack drawer for smaller items, and a few models include a can or wine rack for beverages.<br/><br/>Energy use was another important consideration in our evaluations since fridges operate night and day, seven days a week. The best side-by-side refrigerators are Energy Star compliant, which means they are about 9 percent more energy efficient than models that meet the minimum energy efficiency standard. The annual cost of running the fridges in our comparison ranges from $73 to $86.<br/><br/>Only four models in our lineup are Energy Star compliant, and this could make a difference in your electricity bill. This might seem small at first, but since you will probably keep a refrigerator for years, the  differences add up, and perhaps more importantly, Energy Star-compliant fridges have less of an impact on the environment. Some models offer a door-in-door feature that is nice for energy conservation since you can access common foods without opening the full door.<br/><br/><strong>How Long Should a Refrigerator Last?</strong>"]},"id":"edd4d043-773c-44e7-b03c-d8d3eb655e0e","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We asked experts this question, namely Vaughn Johnson, brand manager for Maytag, and Elise Barsch, social media manager and copywriter for iFixit. Johnson didn’t give a specific number of years, but said the expected life of a refrigerator will depend on usage, environmental conditions and other factors. Johnson suggested people should always check and follow your appliance and product use and care instructions.<br/><br/>Barsch sited Wirecutter and other sources in estimating that refrigerators should generally last 10 to 15 years. “Research done in Europe suggests that refrigerator lifespan has decreased over the past couple decades  – down from an average lifespan of 20 years in 2000,” Barsch said. She said that while refrigerators don’t last as long as they used to, they are more energy efficient. “Fortunately, legislators in Europe are working to make sure refrigerators are not only more energy efficient while in use, but also more repairable over the course of their entire lifespan,” Barsch added."]},"id":"89aee093-1aad-4f25-9fb6-0f05e953ce51","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What Else Is Important to Look for in Side-by-Side Refrigerators<br/></strong><br/>Certain less crucial items might seem like a luxury to one person but could be a deal-breaker for another. Among other things, we examined these features:<br/><br/>Conveniences<br/><br/>The water and ice dispenser is a helpful feature. All the models in our review include one mounted on the exterior of the freezer door, providing crushed or cubed ice as well as filtered water. On the inside, the icemaker may be mounted above the shelving area, which means it extends into the freezer compartment and uses up some of that storage space. Conversely, it could be contained in the door, which gives you more freezer storage space. In addition, we looked for such things as a door-ajar alarm to warn you if you forget to close the doors, a quick cool feature to pump extra cold air when it is needed, and spillproof shelves that are easy to clean.<br/><br/>Pricing<br/>Side-by-side refrigerators are among the most expensive fridges. The least expensive fridge in our comparison is about $900 and the most expensive is $2,400. When we looked at top sellers from Home Depot, Lowes and other big retailers, the majority of these fridges stayed in this price range.<br/><br/>Warranty &amp; Support<br/><br/>All manufacturers offer a warranty on their appliances, but not all warranties are created equal. The bare minimum in warranties covers parts and labor for one year. Many manufacturers offer an additional warranty on the sealed system, including the compressor. Five- to seven-year warranties are common, and a 10-year warranty on the sealed system is excellent.<br/><br/>Refrigerators are not generally appliances you need much help with, but it is good to know that the manufacturer offers support when you need it. Online access to a user guide and knowledgebase or FAQs page is helpful when you have questions. Every company has a telephone or email option so you can contact customer service, and some have live text chat."]},"id":"0366ff49-f4c5-4a68-b8fe-afbb789b61cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related
