They also appreciate its straightforward user interface and how it tracks workout distance at up to 1/100 of a mile, which is a more precise measurement than on most other ellipticals. It’s the only <a href=\"/best-elliptical-machines\">elliptical machine</a> we reviewed that folds for storage, and it has more workout presets than any other elliptical we reviewed. It also has an energy saving mode.","This elliptical machine would have scored higher in our review if it didn’t lack some important features. Unlike the best ellipticals we evaluated, the Evolve 5 isn’t Bluetooth enabled, and it doesn’t incline. Also, it doesn’t have a cooling fan or adjustable pedals, and its display screen is smaller than average. You can only store one user profile.","The Horizon Evolve 5 has a 23-pound flywheel and a 20-inch stride length. Weighing 181 pounds, it’s one of the lighter ellipticals we reviewed, and it has one of the most compact footprints. It can accommodate users weighing up to 300 pounds, and its step-on height is 10 inches.","“I like that it was stable and didn’t squeak,” one of our reviewers said. “I also like the cushioned plastic handle material.”","The Evolve 5 has 20 levels of electronically adjustable resistance, and it features Horizon Fitness’ SixStar Frame to promote proper posture, reduce hip and back strain and protect your joints as you exercise. Its moving and stationary handlebars are ergonomically placed, and it has pulse grips to monitor your heart rate.","The Evolve 5 isn’t a complex machine, and it’s designed more for fitness than for show. Its console doesn’t have sound effects like those on the <a href=\"/bowflex-review\">BXE216</a>, and it doesn’t have a touchscreen like the ProForm and NordicTrack machines we reviewed. It does have a tablet rack, built-in speakers and a water bottle holder, and it’s <a href=\"http://www.passportplayer.com/\">Passport</a> ready for Virtual Active workout programming. It also has <a href=\"https://viafitness.com/en/\">ViaFit</a> connectivity.","This elliptical’s console has a 6.25-inch blue backlit LCD screen and provides workout feedback to monitor your calories, cardio, distance, heart rate, resistance, RPMs, speed, time and even the watts you generate as you exercise. Its 39 onboard workouts give you programs for distance, step workouts, intervals, performance and calories. Custom and manual programs are also available.","Horizon Fitness offers free shipping on the Evolve 5, with delivery inside your front door. Its assembled dimensions are 69 x 28 x 69 inches (length, width and height), and professional assembly options are available by quote. The Evolve 5 comes with a lifetime warranty on its frame, three years on parts and one year on labor. Customer service is available by phone and email."]},"id":"f5f82fd8-d1f7-41e6-9cd7-b0241cb43739","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70060","url":"/horizon-evolve-5-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-27T18:49:39Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T18:49:39Z","name":"Horizon Evolve 5","synopsis":"Our reviewers like the Horizon Evolve 5 because it’s sturdy and stable.","review":{"rating":61,"verdict":"The Horizon Evolve 5 is a sturdy, folding elliptical machine designed for use and storage in small spaces.
