This scooter comes standard with some popular features like an agile three-wheel frame, a quick five-piece disassembly and a three-year limited warranty. You’re sure to get the value for your buck with a scooter designed specifically for comfort and safety.","The Zip’r 3-Xtra handicap scooter is the lightest weight scooter offered by the Zip’r Mobility manufacturers. This design makes disassembly, storage and transport easier. This scooter doesn’t have any annoying wires to disconnect, so disassembly takes less than a minute. When fully assembled, the Zip’r scooter meets the standards in the scooter industry, offering a maximum weight capacity of 250 pounds and an average speed of 4.25 MPH. Even though it’s not the fastest mobility scooter out there, it still gives you a speed comparable to many other devices.","While you’re paying a lot less for this power scooter, it doesn’t mean you’ll be missing the safety features offered with other scooters that cost twice as much. The Zip’r 3-Xtra scooter comes standard with popular safety features such as non-marking, flat-free wheels; headlights and a tight turning radius. To maximize the comfort aspect, the padded chair is adjustable and can fit larger users. You’re also gifted the additional comfort of four extra inches of legroom over other models.","The Zip’r 3-Xtra scooter has a heavy-duty design, making it perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. Were an issue to arise with the device’s wiring or hardware, each scooter comes standard with several warranties. First is the three-year warranty on all structural frame components, including platform, seat post and frame. The second warranty is a one-year warranty on drive train components, such as transaxle, motor and electronic components. While both warranties cover many elements of the device, it’s important to note that the battery is not covered under either.","If you’re wanting a mobility scooter that meets your needs, both indoor and outdoor, and won’t cost you an arm and a leg, the Zip’r 3-Xtra scooter is a popular choice with a history of high performance. It is significantly cheaper than many other mobility scooters on the market, though the scooter doesn’t skimp on the features that make it worth buying. Everything from a lightweight easily disassembled frame, to a tight turning radius and extra legroom make this scooter so popular."]},"id":"f8ff18c1-5966-42a0-bb7c-8e1e11a27bac","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59642","url":"/zipr-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-04T13:32:17Z","datePublished":"2014-06-04T13:32:17Z","name":"Zip'r 3 Xtra","synopsis":"Topping the list as one of the cheapest mobility scooters on the market, the Zip’r 3-Xtra scooter doesn’t force you to sacrifice any of the top features just because of a smaller price tag.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Topping the list as one of the cheapest mobility scooters on the market, the Zip’r 3-Xtra scooter doesn’t force you to sacrifice any of the top features just because of a smaller price tag.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-06-04T13:32:17Z","id":"5wmPW87KvLKTjG3UHQNbg9","meta":{"title":"Zip'r 3 Xtra Mobility Scooter Review - Pros, Cons, Verdict","description":"The Zip&#8217;r 3-Xtra is a lightweight mobility scooter with a low price point that still comes with all the features you need.
