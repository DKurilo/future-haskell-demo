Losing a copy of your DVD isn’t as bad. By using this <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copy software</a> application, you can stop worrying about your DVDs getting ruined or lost. Make copies of them and ensure the originals are safe and sound at home. Wondershare DVD Copy for Mac, from the fine folks at Wondershare, is a great option for maintaining that peace of mind. Wondershare DVD Copy for Mac has a clean interface and quick DVD burning performance.","This Mac DVD copy software application doesn’t waste time with unnecessary glitz and glamour. You are presented with a simple interface that kindly asks for you to insert your DVD to copy. Next you decide the kind of file you would like to convert that DVD to, whether it’s a physical disc, ISO file, Video_TS, or DVDmedia file. Then you click “convert.” Aside from this, through the meager preferences window, you can have the application shut down when it’s finished and show you where it put the file once it’s complete. You won’t find a lot of points of interest with this application; remember it really isn’t for drooling over like some other applications. This software application is meant to reliably and swiftly help you back up your DVDs. Thankfully, you won’t be disappointed. Creating a DVDmedia file for a 76-minute feature film took about 20 minutes.","Compressing your movies shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem. This software will write your movies across similar types of discs: DVD-9 to DVD-9. Also, this application has the ability to compress your movies on DVD-9 discs down to DVD-5 discs, meaning that those double-layer discs can be fit onto single-layer discs without any quality loss.","As stated above, this Mac DVD copy software application provides you with four options: physical DVDs, ISO files, Video_TS or DVDmedia files. You don’t really need any other options outside of these four if you simply want to back up your DVDs. If you want to then turn around and put your movies onto your iPod, you will need an additional application. The image and sound quality of the test-burns were all exceptional. The archiving potential makes this application highly recommended.","This application had one of the fastest burn times of all the Mac DVD copy software applications we reviewed. The options are few but thorough enough for an undemanding user who just wants to make backup copies.","Through the website, any questions you may stumble on can hopefully be cleared before contacting the developers. They have FAQs, tutorials and a user manual for you to wade through. The information is all pretty standard, but considering the software, it’s not a surprise. If these are not answering your questions, feel free to fill out the online form and get a hold of the developers."]},"id":"a68c2b20-d05d-4b23-a9c6-6decc40d1f36","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1daf2c7-3afc-476b-9597-f11f2295efd7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It can be a bit difficult to write a review for an application that is so easy to overlook considering all the options for this Mac DVD copy software application.
