It offers a comprehensive range of features, although it lacks versatility and maneuverability.","This gas <a href=\"/best-tillers\">tiller</a> features a 208 cc Cub Cadet engine with electric start, which is somewhat cumbersome, requiring you to plug the machine into an electrical outlet, start the engine, then disengage the power cord. The engine delivers ample power for the majority of tilling tasks. With the tiller&#39;s weight of 257 pounds, when it performs heavy-duty tilling, there is little bounce or vibration. However, the weight does mean that this rotovator is hard to maneuver and is not ideal for those seeking a lightweight tiller that requires minimal physical exertion.","With 13-inch stamped steel, self-sharpening tines, the Cub Cadet RT 65 E needs minimal tine maintenance and the tines remain in optimal condition for a long time. The rear tines rotate in dual directions, maximizing performance by providing fine soil structure in a single pass.","You can make use of the adjustable depth bar to till up to a depth of 7.5 inches, allowing you to render even heavily compacted or virgin ground to a very fine structure and improve drainage. The width is fixed at 18 inches, limiting the versatility of this garden tiller, as you cannot till between narrow rows.","Although this tiller lacks a front bumper, it does have a full rear-tine shield, offering protection from the tines and from flying soil and debris. The adjustable side shields allow you to till closely to plants and garden buildings without damaging them with the tine blades or loose debris. The split-loop handle offers less control than plow-style handles, but the height is adjustable, allowing you to find a comfortable tilling position that reduces strain on your back.","For extra traction and stability, the Cub Cadet RT 65 E boasts 16-inch pneumatic tires with deep agricultural tread, helping to keep the machine steady even in unfavorable conditions. The heavy-duty counterweight at the front of the machine increases stability, improves balance and helps to hold the machine steady as you till, reducing bounce and ensuring an even till.","For general garden maintenance and cutting new ground, the Cub Cadet RT 65 E is a solid tiller. Although it is well balanced, it&#39;s a heavy machine that lacks maneuverability and has a fixed tilling width, limiting its versatility."]},"id":"e4338130-1997-4888-928c-517112391370","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62705","url":"/cub-cadet-rt-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T17:09:18Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T17:09:18Z","name":"Cub Cadet RT 65 E","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
