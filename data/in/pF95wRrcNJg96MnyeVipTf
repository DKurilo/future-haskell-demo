You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","A large screen on a navigation GPS device offers more on-screen options. However, bigger screens are not always better. When is the screen for your navigation system big enough to offer a clear view without affecting your line of sight through the windshield? The TomTom VIA 1605 TM has a 6-inch screen - the largest offered by TomTom - and it has an improved screen resolution of 800 x 600 pixels. The device has a big enough screen to see clearly at a glance, but is still small enough to be unobtrusive. The full potential quality of the screen is lost, unfortunately, on the resistive plastic screen. A glass capacitive screen would have better suited this upgraded screen resolution. TomTom did compensate for this, though, by making the icons and buttons large enough to see and to press. The device has an integrated mount that allows for the VIA 1650 TM to be mounted to either the windshield or the dashboard using a suction cup for stability.","The VIA 1605 TM comes with lifetime map and traffic updates. TomTom releases updated maps four times a year, and if you purchase the VIA 1605 TM with an outdated map, you can load the current one free. This device doesn&#39;t have TomTom&#39;s advanced HD traffic, but the traffic updates offered free for the lifetime of your device are useful all the same. Unfortunately, this navigation system is lacking important hands-free features like Bluetooth and speech access. You can&#39;t issue voice commands and you have to touch the device to change anything, so make sure you have all of your settings correct and you have your trip planned out before you start. While this model can speak street names to help you out when driving, it doesn&#39;t use landmarks specific to your location to make it easier to find that important turn.","The VIA 1605 TM comes preloaded with seven million points of interest (POIs). These POIs can be anything from a restaurant to a bank. With seven million POIs, you&#39;re bound to find what you are looking for in the database. The best GPS units will have more POIs, but the POIs the VIA 1605 TM has are comprehensive. This model does not have the capability to take multiple destinations and sort them into the most efficient path, but it does have an option to choose the most fuel-efficient route. You can also use this device to guide you on foot."]},"id":"cc22d7dd-b41a-478d-91b0-f45c11543c43","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4832ad8c-bb95-4603-b5f5-17108f6528d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The VIA 1605 TM has a large screen size that is just shy of obnoxious, and the resolution has been upgraded to near-HD quality, but the plastic resistive screen hinders the improvements.
