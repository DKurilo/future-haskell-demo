Bakery Chef can mix, blend, knead and whip to perfection any ingredients you put into its 4-quart stainless steel bowl or 5-quart glass bowl. This is a pricey but potent <a href=\"/best-mixers\">stand mixer</a> with 12 speed settings, a strong motor and several robust attachments.","It excelled at our bread dough test, easily kneading enough bread dough for two loaves in 10 minutes. The result? We got smooth, shiny and stretchy dough that was just right.","The Breville did just as well mixing ingredients for chocolate chip cookies. We used the standard paddle attachment, instead of the extra paddle beater that has rubber scraping edges, to blend the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients, and it did this smoothly and easily. A handy splash guard helps keep things less messy when you&#39;re adding different ingredients, although the pour spout was smaller than the spout on the KitchenAid Artisan. However, one drawback for the Breville&#39;s splash guard is that once an attachment is in place, the guard can slide on only with the smaller metal bowl.","You get a whopper of a whisk attachment with the Breville that was bigger than any mixers we tested. We put this balloon whisk to task whipping 4 ounces of room-temperature egg whites. Our tests showed this whisk injected enough air into these egg whites to create enormous volume as well as stiff peaks in 3 minutes and 28 seconds, which beat the four-minute deadline we set and was bested only by the KitchenAid Artisan, which did the job in just three minutes.","Along with the sturdy standard attachments – dough hook, paddle and whisk – this mixer comes with a flexible edge beater that gets to every side of the bowl and a handy plastic spatula that&#39;s narrow enough to reach between sections of the paddle. One drawback is that although the Breville Bakery Chef comes with first-rate attachments, you don’t have the option to buy any other attachments for this stand mixer.","One outstanding feature we really liked is an overhead light within the Breville that clearly lights up the bowl so you can see the ingredients inside and how well blended they are. In addition, you get a digital timer than counts up or down, so you can set it and do another kitchen task and, with a glance, see how things are progressing in the mixer.","This mixer does many tasks well, but unfortunately all this power and versatility comes with a price tag that is about 17 percent higher than our top-ranked <a href=\"/kitchenaid-artisan-review\">KitchenAid Artisan</a>, which also is a strong and versatile mixer.","If you run into trouble, you can contact Breville by phone or email. Its user manual provides instructions and is chock full of excellent cooking and baking tips, but rather oddly for a mixer manual, offers no recipes."]},"id":"b6adffd5-babe-4333-9257-c313219fb15f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69913","url":"/breville-bem825bal-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-08T15:53:59Z","datePublished":"2018-05-08T15:53:59Z","name":"Breville The Bakery Chef BEM825BAL","synopsis":"The Breville Bakery Chef can mix, blend, knead and whip to perfection any ingredients you put into its 4-quart stainless steel bowl or 5-quart glass bowl.
