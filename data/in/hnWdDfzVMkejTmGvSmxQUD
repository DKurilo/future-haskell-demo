ACXT 1035R FLT has all the main features we look for in <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">walkie talkie sets</a>, as well as extra capabilities and durability, which make it a solid choice for an outdoor walkie talkie.","Among the Cobra models we tested, the ACXT 1035R scored the best on our range test – but not by much, and the scores aren’t very impressive. Our testing found that, while the ACXT 1035R is excellent over a half-mile and mile distance, when the range increased to a mile and a half, the unit dropped a significant number of characters in our test and had very spotty reception.","The Cobra comes with rechargeable batteries and a charger. If your rechargeable batteries die, you can use three AA batteries to power the device instead. The Cobra 1035R FLT also has a micro-USB port built in to the unit, so you can charge these walkie talkies on-the-go with a micro-USB cord.","The Cobra 1035R FLT includes an LED flashlight for navigating in the dark. The only drawback to the Cobra’s LED light is that it is located at the bottom of the unit. That means you can’t set the unit down and have the light illuminate your area. However, if you run into trouble the light can blink an automated SOS signal.","The 1035R FLT has access to NOAA emergency weather channels. You can scan the weather frequencies to get current weather conditions and alerts.","This walkie talkie has a few features that help it stand apart from others we reviewed. In addition to its IPX7 waterproofing, it also floats, so if you drop the radio in a lake, it won&#39;t sink to the bottom. Finally, it includes a recording feature called &#34;Rewind-Say-Again.&#34; This feature is constantly recording the last 20 seconds of any incoming message, so if you miss something, you can quickly play it back with the press of a button.","This walkie talkie radio is one of the heavier units that we reviewed, but it excelled in our grip test. There are rubber grips on the sides and bottom that help the unit feel secure in your hand. This is an important feature if you plan to make use of the walkie talkie’s weather resistance; it is easier to hold when wet.","One other great feature is the Cobra’s adjustable, alligator-style belt clip. The clip opens to almost a 45-degree angle, which makes it easy to attach to the straps of a backpack or the front of a coat.","Through its website, Cobra offers a variety of support options. You can quickly access FAQs and download a user manual from the support pages. If you need personal help, support agents are available by email and telephone. Cobra only offers a one-year warranty on its walkie talkies, but this is common among the models we tested."]},"id":"ab81ffa2-af95-449a-a832-ce30c2949111","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"61a2b2cb-3df4-45f8-a405-6cd3c6c3fa3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cobra ACXT 1035R FLT includes several emergency tools to help you while you are camping and hiking, and it is waterproof.
