The theme can be based on a particular region (e.g. Italian wines, French regional wines, etc.), color scheme or style (think contemporary or vintage).","Aside from bottles of wine, determine what complimentary accessories to include in the basket, such as stemware or bottle openers. Look for convenient, stylish items the recipient does not already have at department stores and upscale home retailers.","You can also include food items that complement the types of wine you selected, like cheese, crackers, dark chocolate or truffles.","Find a basket or other container that enhances your chosen theme. Keep in mind wicker baskets aren t your only option; metal and wood baskets or boxes can also make beautiful, complementary containers.","Choose a type of basket filler that also embellishes the theme. For example, matching napkins or bar towels make great fillers or you can opt for traditional basket fillers like tissue paper or colored straw packing.","When it comes to assembling the basket, start with the basket filler, followed by the wine bottles. Accessories and food items should be placed in last, arranged in order by size, from largest to smallest.","Use clear cellophane wrapping or a cellophane bag to wrap the basket; this allows the recipient to clearly see what is in included in the basket.","Complete the look and seal the cellophane with a big, flowing ribbon that matches the colors of the basket.","Don t forget to attach a small note with the recipient s name letting them know who the gift is from."],"type":"ul"},"id":"e8efacba-73bc-4dfa-b877-7b79731ebe91","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Whether your boss is retiring or your best friend s birthday is coming up, a personalized wine gift basket is the perfect way to celebrate any occasion!
