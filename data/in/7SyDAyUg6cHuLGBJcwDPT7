The company ended all monitoring services for this product effective June 30, 2016. Link-Mobile is providing full refunds for equipment purchased in the last 12 months. For more information, please contact Link-Mobile.</em>","Link-Mobile is a <a href=\"/best-gps-medical-alert-systems\">GPS medical alert system</a> offered by Care Innovations, a joint company formed by Intel and GE. This GPS unit is different from other comparable systems as it is made of two pieces: a communication clip and a wristband. The clip fastens onto a belt or in a purse. It supports two-way communication and is the means by which you speak with monitoring center staff or your emergency contacts.","You wear the wristband at all times, and it acts like an emergency pendant. There is a button on either side of the wristband, and it vibrates when you press both buttons and send an alert. The wristband is equipped with fall detection and will automatically send out an alert when it detects you or your loved one has fallen.","Care Innovations differs from other comparable services in its service packages as well as its hardware setup. The base service plan is the Personal Plan. With this service, when you or your loved one presses the help button on the wristband, the system sends out a notification to your emergency contacts for help.","The second level of service, the Personal with Escalation plan, also initially sends out alerts to your emergency contacts through text or email. If none of them answer the alert within four minutes, then the notification goes to the company&#39;s 24/7 response center. The highest-level plan is the Professional plan, which functions more like other comparable services. All alerts go directly to the emergency response center, and your emergency contacts receive an email about the incident.","This company is one of the few to offer a web portal, which is included with the Personal Plan. Through the web portal, you can set up your emergency contact list and settings associated with each contact to determine who gets certain notifications and whether the alerts come through phone, email or text message. You and your loved ones can track the location of the device as well as the total number of steps and overall activity over time, which is an extra feature not offered by many other comparable systems.","Link-Mobile has several upfront fees in addition to its monthly subscription fee. You purchase the unit upfront, and out of the comparable GPS medical alert devices that you must purchase, it is the most expensive. You also pay an activation fee as well as a shipping and handling fee."]},"id":"3bfd36b0-2044-4d17-9cf1-0dc5612ef9c9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"74ea8c0a-4866-4929-998d-dbaeb8b32822","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Link-Mobile offers several unique and useful features for those looking for a GPS medical alert unit.
