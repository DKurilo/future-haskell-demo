It has the classic “rabbit ear” design that was popular in earlier decades. This isn’t a flat design that is easily mounted to a wall or hidden behind the TV. It is an outdated design that has to be placed conspicuously on a table or countertop. Although unappealing, it is inexpensive compared to others.","The HDTV antenna looks outdated, but it doesn’t perform like an outdated piece of technology. It is in fact an HDTV antenna with the ability to pick up UHF signals and transform them into high-quality television channels on your TV. It is not amplified, so there isn’t an additional power source that needs to be plugged into a wall. Since it isn&#39;t amplified, it doesn’t have the scanning range that amplified models boast. The Insignia antenna scans for channels in a 40-mile radius while amplified models like the <a href=\"/terk-review\">Terk OMNITV20 FLAT</a> scan up to 50 miles. This lack of range can result in you missing out on a few channels, depending on your location.","For our first signal quality test, we connected the indoor HDTV antenna to a TV in our office. Our office building is surrounded by large buildings and some tall trees. These structures pose as obstacles for uninterrupted TV signal. Finding the best place for reception was a bit difficult since the antenna only comes with a 5-foot attached coaxial cable. That doesn’t give you much slack to find the best reception spot in your home. After we found the sweet spot for reception in our office, we were able to receive 22 channels. Some of the channels we received such as CBS and ABC were great HD quality, but we were unable to pick up PBS, and the majority of the shopping networks experienced bad reception.","In our second test scenario we connected the HDTV antenna to a TV in a second floor apartment with no surrounding obstacles around the building. Here we were able to receive 26 channels. The additional channels were subchannels from some of the major networks. We still weren’t able to pick up PBS but we did receive NBC, albeit with considerable breakup in the signal. Even though we picked up a few more channels, it is still a far cry from the 39 channels that the <a href=\"/antennas-direct-review\">ClearStream Micron</a> was able to capture. Please note that the number of channels you receive will vary upon your location.","The Insignia Fine Tuning Indoor HDTV antenna is covered by a one-year warranty.
