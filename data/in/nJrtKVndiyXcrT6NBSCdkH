However, this state-of-the-art system from Samsung has four upward-facing speakers to take advantage of Dolby Atmos and DTS:X object-based codecs along with two side-firing speakers, two satellite surround speakers with upward firing drivers, and a wireless subwoofer. If you add up the cost to get a Dolby Atmos-enabled AV receiver, seven surround speakers and a subwoofer, it can easily surpass $1,600. The subwoofer and surround speakers connect to the sound bar automatically, but keep in mind that the surround speakers need to be plugged into a power outlet. ","<strong>Dolby Atmos Sound Bars </strong><br/><br/>The number of movies, AV receivers and streaming devices that support the newest vertical sound codecs, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, has grown significantly over the last year. So has the list of compatible sound bars. Some sound bars have upscaling technology to simulate vertical facing speakers, but a growing list of products now include dedicated speakers to transmit object-based material. Here are a couple of our favourite sound bars with dedicated vertical facing speakers.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-SB46514-F6-Wireless-Subwoofer-Surround/dp/B07GTQWMYQ?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Vizio SB46514-F6 - $999</a><br/>We are huge fans of Vizio sound bars because of the incredible price-to-feature ratio. The SB46514 continues that trend by offering a 46-inch bar, two satellites with upfiring speakers and a 10-inch wireless subwoofer. Unlike more expensive packages with Atmos speakers, the satellite speakers in the Vizio system aren’t wireless - they connect to the subwoofer with color-coded cables. The SB46514 has an HDMI input and output, or if your TV doesn’t have an HDMI ARC output, you can connect to the sound bar with an optical cable. Unfortunately, this system doesn’t allow you to control the volume for the height channels, but the SmartCast app connects the SB46514 to your home Wi-Fi network, and the durable remote has controls for switching inputs and sound modes.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-YSP-5600-Music-Sound-Dolby/dp/B016B44AP4?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Yamaha YSP-5600 - $1599</a><br/>This Yamaha sound bar is bulkier than most because the enclosure houses an astonishing 44 beam drivers, including 12 vertical facing speakers and two 4.5-inch woofers. The YSP-5600 has four HDMI inputs and an HDMI ARC output, so we suggest connecting all your audio and video peripherals to the sound bar, instead of relying on your TV. This is one of the few sound bars that support both of the vertical sound codecs, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, though the DTS:X codecs are falling behind Dolby in terms of compatibility. The height channels are adjusted either automatically with the supplied calibration mic, or manually to optimize the surround effects for your seating position. ","<br/><strong>HDMI ARC: The Best Connection Option for Sound Bars  </strong>","If your TV was manufactured after 2009, it most likely has an HDMI ARC connection. The ARC portion of that protocol stands for Audio Return Channel, and it allows for two-way communication between the sound bar and TV with a single HDMI cable. Connecting your sound bar to your TV with an HDMI ARC connection lets you control the volume with your TV remote and automatically turns the sound bar on when the TV is on. You can also use the HDMI ARC connection to send sound from your TV to an AV receiver if you have a traditional surround sound setup.","Using an HDMI ARC connection doesn’t require a specialized HDMI cable, but you may need to change your TV settings to allow two-way communication. Go to the Settings menu on your TV and find the Audio Settings. In that menu, enable HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) and use the same remote you currently use to control volume and power.","An HDMI connection between your TV and sound bar moves audio information faster than a digital output from the TV, but like a digital connection, the HDMI standard doesn’t allow for transmission of HD audio standards like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. We are anxiously awaiting the arrival of HDMI 2.1 with eARC, which has support for full-resolution audio signals like Dolby Atmos.","<strong>HDMI eARC: The New Audio Standard  </strong>","The new HDMI 2.1 standard announced at CES in 2017 allows for more robust video and audio transmission through a single HDMI cable. The most important upgrade in terms of home audio and sound bars is eARC. I spoke to Marty Wachter, Director of UX &amp; Technology at Sound United, about how soon this new HDMI standard is going to start affecting audio peripherals. He told me we are at least a year away from HDMI eARC connections becoming a popular feature, and probably two years until it is an industry standard.","Currently, the only way to send vertical sound codecs, like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, to a surround speaker setup is via a compatible A/V receiver. There are still very few sound bars that support vertical sound codecs, and if you use a television as the connection hub, the HDMI ARC connection only sends stereo audio and compressed surround sound codecs. The HDMI eARC upgrade makes the TV a worthy connection hub because it can send uncompressed surround sound from a stream box, Blu-ray player and any other source connected to the television.","If you are currently in the market for an audio upgrade but you’re nervous about missing out on the future of surround sound, don’t hold your breath. The next generation of A/V receivers, sound bars and televisions are years away, with the first wave of products significantly more expensive than the current offerings. ","<br/><strong>Preset Audio Modes: What’s the Difference? </strong>","All the sound bars we tested have at least a couple options for preset audio modes to maximize the EQ and, in some cases, volume settings for a specific type of content. I talked to John Crisco, Director of Engineering for Sound United, about what those settings are and how to best utilize them.","Music Mode<br/>John told me the music preset is “the most natural audio preset.” Music mode doesn’t significantly boost or cut bass or treble frequencies, which makes it a good setting for most dialogue-based television shows too. This setting is optimized for conventional two-channel stereo – the format for most music recordings. If you use your sound bar mostly for listening to music and watching TV, the music mode is the best audio preset option.","Movie Mode<br/>The movie preset offers the most dynamic range of all the audio modes. This setting boosts bass response and dialogue volume and has the widest sound stage of all the audio modes. Sound effects don’t get compressed, so explosions and other loud effects are startlingly loud and impactful, just as the sound engineers intended. To take full advantage of movie mode, connect the sound bar to your television through the HDMI ARC port instead of using the optical input.","Night Mode<br/>This is the newest and most helpful audio mode on our favorite sound bars, like the <a href=\"/polk-review\">Polk Audio Command Bar</a> and the <a href=\"/sonos-review\">Sonos Beam</a>. Night mode is the perfect setting for watching movies and TV while you fall asleep. The dialogue frequencies are boosted, but the dynamic range is reduced. Compression is more evident, so the loudest sounds, like sound effects, are less startling and the quietest sounds, like whispering dialogue, get pushed to the forefront.","<strong>Important Features to Look for When Buying a Sound Bar   </strong>","Wi-Fi vs Bluetooth<br/>There are two wireless connection options available on sound bars. Some have Bluetooth, others have Wi-Fi and the best have both. I asked Robert Goedken, the general manager of Yamaha’s AV division, what the best way to wirelessly stream high-fidelity content is, and he responded, “Wi-Fi offers greater range, better stability and supports transmission of higher-resolution audio content. Most people already have Wi-Fi in their homes, so it makes sense to use it to stream content to their sound bar.” We prefer sound bars with Wi-Fi connectivity for high-fidelity audio and Bluetooth connectivity for ease of use.","Subwoofer<br/>Most the sound bars we tested come with a wireless subwoofer, and those that do connect to them automatically, so they are easy to set up. If you want theater-quality audio, a subwoofer is an important component. In addition, you may want to consider a sound bar that has separate volume controls for the subwoofer if you live in an apartment or house with thin walls so you can turn the bass down to keep your neighbors happy. ","<strong>Sound Bar vs. Soundbase </strong>","Sound bars and soundbases have the same easy setup and connectivity options, but there are a few significant design differences. Instead of sitting below and in front of a TV like a sound bar, soundbases sit directly under the TV. For that reason, soundbases have a weight rating that typically ranges between 50-150 pounds. Because soundbases are designed to hold heavy televisions, the enclosure is also very heavy and isn&#39;t suited for flimsy furniture.","A soundbase houses larger speakers and more of them. A higher number of speakers doesn’t necessarily equate to better audio performance, but larger speakers move more air, which makes bass-heavy sound effects more impactful. Most sound bar packages come with wireless, external subwoofers, but our favorite soundbases have subwoofers built in, which saves floor space in a small entertainment room. Soundbases bridge the gap between sound bars and a more complicated home audio system built around an AV receiver.","There are far fewer options for soundbases compared to the number of sound bars. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Playbase-Theater-Streaming-Music/dp/B01MSEPNIO/?&amp;tag=ttrsoundbar-20\">Sonos PLAYBASE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fluance-AB40-Performance-Soundbase-Soundstage/dp/B01MTEHUCO?&amp;tag=ttrsoundbar-20\">Fluance AB40</a> both have optical inputs that easily connect to your TV with a single cable. The Fluance soundbase also has an aux input and Bluetooth connectivity. To wirelessly stream music and podcasts to the Sonos soundbase, you connect it to your home Wi-Fi network and use the intuitive Sonos mobile app to control audio settings and organize music streaming services.","<strong>Sound Bar Test Tracks </strong>","We are lucky enough to have the equipment and space necessary to perform true side-by-side comparisons of multiple sound bars. In our many years of testing speakers, we&#39;ve used a long list of songs to evaluate a variety of important audio characteristics. Here are some of our favorite songs for evaluating sound bars and other home stereo equipment:","<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvKbBkiYN9Y\">Beck - Morning</a><br/>We use this song to test stereo imaging and midrange clarity. Beck’s vocals are mixed wide and placed perfectly in front of a subtle but accurate acoustic guitar track. If your home stereo equipment is doing its job, you should feel like you are completely surrounded with pleasant vocals, swirling percussion and lively guitar tracks.","<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd36JPyBGhY\">The Rolling Stones - Sympathy For The Devil</a><br/>This is another good song to evaluate the depth and width of stereo image. The intro has hard-panned drums and percussion that serve as the base for a complex arrangement. Mick Jagger’s vocals seem loud when first introduced but fade into the mix when the piano track and backup vocals join in. A well-tuned speaker should give each track an equal and balanced spotlight so you feel like the band is on stage in your entertainment room.","<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iYgf6PWYK8\">Bela Fleck and the Flecktones - Flight of the Cosmic Hippo</a><br/>If you want to test a subwoofer&#39;s limits and accuracy, this is the perfect song. It is widely recognized among audio industry professionals as a benchmark test track for low-frequency clarity. Victor Wooten’s fretless 5-string bass is mixed well amongst the twangy banjo, harmonica and piano tracks. The bass solo in the middle of the song culminates with a slide down the lowest string that rumbles the tummy and shouldn’t show any signs of flabby bass or port noise on a good system.","<strong>More Home Theater Guides: </strong>"]},"id":"e69c1329-b290-45d0-bb3c-eece04e04c04","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">The Best Audio/Video Receivers</a>","<a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">The Best Surround Sound Speakers</a>","<a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">The Best Floor-Standing Speakers</a>","<a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">The Best Home Theater Subwoofers</a>","<a href=\"/best-universal-remotes\">The Best Universal Remote Controls</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5bc9fc6b-6d4b-43d4-80b5-c3d28038cc45","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"5c2a7157-559c-46b2-85a9-ee4ba103ed08","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/polk-review\">Polk Audio Command Bar</a>","<a href=\"/yamaha-soundbar-review\">Yamaha YAS-207</a>","<a href=\"/jbl-review\">JBL Bar 2.1</a>","<a href=\"/sonos-review\">Sonos Beam</a>","<a href=\"/vizio-soundbar-review\">Vizio SB3621n-E8M </a>","<a href=\"/focal-dimension-review\">Focal Dimension </a>","<a href=\"/klipsch-review\">Klipsch RSB-6</a>","<a href=\"/lg-soundbar-review\">LG SJ8</a>","<a href=\"/sony-soundbar-review\">Sony HT-CT390</a>","<a href=\"/q-acoustics-review\">Q Acoustics M4</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"81b904ba-0e93-4f45-b92e-e56d79391db8","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_22","url":"/best-sound-bars","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-12-17T15:49:00Z","datePublished":"2018-12-17T15:49:00Z","name":"Best Sound Bars of 2019","synopsis":"We tested a bunch of affordable sound bars and ranked them from best to worst based on their audio quality, connectivity and convenience.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested a bunch of affordable sound bars and ranked them from best to worst based on their audio quality, connectivity and convenience.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-07T17:24:18Z","id":"nJrtKVndiyXcrT6NBSCdkH","meta":{"title":"Best Sound Bars of 2019 -
