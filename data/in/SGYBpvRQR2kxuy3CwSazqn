The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-binoculars\"><em>binoculars here</em></a><em>.</em>","Steiner has made some excellent binoculars, and the Safari series is a great addition to its lineup. There are great advantages to having a set of such cutting-edge binoculars, but you do need to consider a few drawbacks before you commit to choosing your go-to pair.","These are some of the best compact binoculars for seeing objects that are located across a wide swath of land. The Steiner Safari has an eye distance range of 56-72mm, which is impressive for a set of binoculars with a magnification of 10x42mm. The light width, however, is a little less than strong at 4.2mm, so you will need to know whether or not it is important to you to be able to see farther in the evening. The minimum distance, 6 meters, is also comparatively weak even for non-rangefinder binoculars.","The build and design look very ahead of their time. Rather than having a flat border around the eyepieces, the Steiner Safari has soft rubber linings that fit along the side of your face. The binoculars are designed to still be eyeglass-wearer friendly, so you will not have a problem seeing magnified objects through the lenses of your glasses. The essentials of the best binocular design are present as well, since the Steiner Safari is tripod-adaptable and waterproof. Rubber armor protects the binoculars, and there are snug lens caps for when you need to store them in a backpack or suitcase. The one big drawback of the Steiner Safari’s build is that it lacks polycarbonate housing. This might account for why the binoculars weigh so much more than other binoculars we reviewed.","The portability of the Steiner Safari is probably going to present the biggest issue for you. Even though this pair does not look very large at all and is on par with most average-size binoculars, the size conceals the fact that these binoculars are far heavier than almost any other pair on our lineup. It weighs 748 grams, and carrying an object this solid and heavy up a mountain might not be a very appealing prospect. Even though it comes with an adjustable carrying strap, having it around your neck would also be a strain over long distances.","Steiner has wonderful support services for both its buyers and its potential customers. The Steiner website has instructional videos and clear photography, which will be very helpful if you are not overly familiar with the anatomy of a pair of binoculars. There is also an excellent Frequently Asked Questions section, which covers everything from specific models to general repairs. A lifetime warranty is part of every Steiner product’s purchase, and you can register your binoculars easily on the site. Email and business-hours telephone services are also available if you have any questions about your products, but the telephone option is usually faster."]},"id":"3dcd0663-bde1-4a47-be25-9b380a2b61ab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ebb905c1-8b47-408a-ad85-e7ba70f3fe0c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Steiner Safari has its perks, but there are some things you will want to consider before you make the step of buying a pair.
