The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"/best-photo-editing-software\">Photo Retouching Software</a> here.</em>","Retouching a photo is a balancing act. Too much interference and your model starts to look like a plastic doll. Too little and your client is unhappy because you didn&#39;t improve them enough. Perfect Portrait 2 Premium is good photo retouching software that gives you the essential tools you need to find the perfect retouching balance to create beautiful portraits and get professional results.","Perfect Portrait 2 Premium is stuffed with enhancement features, including over 100 preset filters to choose from. The presets are sorted by women, children, groups and men. This categorization helps you choose a preset quickly, instead of searching through the whole collection. If you find a preset that you like a lot or find yourself using quite a bit, you can select it as a favorite for easier access. Perfect Portrait works a lot like Photoshop in the sense that you can add layers to your image to create the perfect effect.","When you open your photo, the software automatically scans the picture and detects specific faces and places retouching points around the eyes and mouth of each person in the photo. The points are completely moveable, and although the software places them closely to where they need to be, you should check them each time to make sure they are placed in the optimal place.","You can also place a mask over the areas that you don&#39;t want to be enhanced. Use the Perfect Brush tool to select the areas you desire. The Perfect Brush function much like a combination of a healing brush and the selection tool from a high-end photo editing software suite. You can select the size, opacity and feathering radius. This flexibility enables you to make the Perfect Brush the right tool for any image enhancement job.","The color correction ability of this program is very effective. The slider controls allow you to adjust the warmth, color and amount of correction with ease. Another feature we are impressed with is a drop-down box with selections that provide a range of natural tones based on the model&#39;s ethnicity. This feature is very helpful and reduces the time spent searching for complimentary skin tones.","While Perfect Portrait is fun, powerful and easy to use, it does have a few limitations to take into consideration. This photo enhancer does not have the capability to slim or adjust facial features, nor does it have a makeup application. This means that you will need to make sure your models have their makeup done with the right colors you want or you will have to use another program to alter colors. Fortunately, Perfect Portrait can be used as a versatile plugin for Photoshop, Aperture and Lightroom, so if you use those programs for photo manipulation, Perfect Portrait makes a great add-on.","Perfect Portrait has excellent help and support options on their website. They have over 10 online video tutorials to aid you in perfecting your portraits. If you are unable to find an answer to your question in the knowledgebase or in the tutorials, One Software provides support by email or phone. Unfortunately, there is no available live chat option."]},"id":"d6742b91-612a-46dd-b366-efa877ec1f97","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7d4aea2f-c501-4c37-bf12-7d68d545458e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Perfect Portrait is a great photo enhancer and it can make your life as a photographer a lot easier.
