Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Imagerie is a very easy-to-use <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac photo editing software</a> app from adnX (formerly Apps4Mac) that has enough features to get quality picture editing done, but not so many as to confuse those who are new to an app like this. More advanced users may find the features are limited, but adnX’s goal with this app is to make it appealing to beginners. In fact, Imagerie&#39;s purpose is to help those who don’t necessarily do high-end edits and are new to Mac photo editing software.","This Mac photo editing software is very easy to use, and beginners will have little trouble getting started with making basic edits. The user manual is well written, and it isn’t full of complicated jargon.","Importing photos is as easy as selecting File, Import – or simply clicking Open and choosing the picture you wish to edit.  If your Mac has a webcam, you can also use Webcam Capture to directly shoot stills and import them into Imagerie for editing. When you select a picture to edit, Imagerie will open the entire toolset; this means that instead of a group of photos opening in the app, the software opens each picture individually with all the tools. This can cause a lot of clutter on the screen.","There are plenty of tools that allow you to perform quality edits, including cropping, re-sizing and editing the color and brightness/contrast. You can also create  layers, masks, and text, as well as add filters, edit bit map files and much more. You can do quick edits of the levels, or dive deeper and do even more precise editing. An inspector is available to make adjustments to the image or canvas.","While the editing tools are plentiful, they are also quite basic, and more advanced and pro users may shy from this Mac photo editing software. But that’s not a bad thing; adnX built this app for the non-professional user who doesn’t need  three manuals and a college degree. This isn’t a carbon copy of Photoshop Elements, but it is a quality, simple Mac photo editing software app that gets the job done.","There aren’t many share options in Imagerie, such as direct uploads to Facebook, Flickr, etc., but you can email a photo or upload images to an FTP server straight from this Mac photo editing software app.","You can output to several different formats, most of them common. When you&#39;re creating a new file, if you choose Save As, the software will create a .imagerie file, a format that can only be opened in this Mac photo editing software app. However, if you select Export, you can choose JPG, PNG, JPG 2000, TIFF, BMP, GIF and ICNS file formats.","There isn’t a built-in organizer, but you can use iPhoto, part of Apple’s iLife which ships with many new Macs, as the default picture organizer and set up Imagerie as the editor. You can also use iPhoto to share directly to Facebook, Flickr, etc.","Imagerie comes with a few help and support options, including a user manual and a FAQs section on their website. We’d like to see some tutorials to further help users get started with this Mac photo editing software app.","If you need support, you can contact adnX by telephone (there are numbers for customers in both the U.S. and France) and email. You can also submit a report for support or connect with them via live chat. If you go with live chat, keep in mind they’re based in France (English and French), so check their site to see if they’re available."]},"id":"5195ece4-cd10-45c6-a29b-1e9ca0501b9c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4493628f-4016-4475-b785-3650fab45e1b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, Imagerie is a fairly easy-to-use Mac photo editing software app that allows beginners and casual users to do basic or even intricate image edits and creations.
