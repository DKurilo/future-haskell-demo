It can charge the battery faster and charge more of your devices simultaneously, but its solar charging performance is substandard. Of the products we tested, the PLOCHY battery’s single 1W solar panel collected the least energy on both sunny and cloudy days.","<strong>Performance</strong>","We set all the solar chargers out on both sunny and cloudy days for four hours, connected them to identical smartphones and let them charge the devices until they shut off. The top-performing X-Dragon charged the phone to 73 percent on a sunny day and 60 percent on a cloudy day, while the PLOCHY only managed 11 percent and 10 percent under the same conditions. Of course, the <a href=\"/x-dragon-review\">X-Dragon</a> has the advantage of having four solar panels to the PLOCHY’s one. Even so, the best single-paneled charger managed to charge our test device over three times more than the PLOCHY, with 37 percent and 35 percent. The PLOCHY isn’t built to primarily charge with solar power, but if you need a high-capacity power bank that can charge up to three devices simultaneously and has a solar option for emergencies, it can get the job done.","All of the solar power banks we tested are meant to charge primarily from a wall outlet, using solar as a backup. Most of the devices charge via a microUSB input port. The PLOCHY has a bit more flexibility, with both microUSB and Lightning input ports. Because of its large capacity, it still takes a while to charge via outlet, about 11 hours, but a full charge can power up your phone several times.","<strong>Features/Design</strong>","The PLOCHY battery has one more port than the rest of the power banks we tested. Its three USB ports can output a combined max of 4.5amps. It also has dual input ports, with one microUSB input and one Lightning input. Our iPhone-using testers appreciated the Lightning option, as it eliminates the necessity of carrying around a specific cord just to charge the power bank.","Compared to other solar power banks we tested, the PLOCHY lacks a few features that would make it easier to use. It has only one indicator light that glows or flashes different colors depending on whether it’s charging or not. The PLOCHY power bank is also missing a flashlight feature, which is present on almost all the other products we tested. It isn’t water, dust or shock resistant. Finally, there is no convenient way to attach the PLOCHY battery to a bag strap.","While the PLOCHY solar power bank is a decent power bank, its slow solar charging performance puts it at the bottom of our list of recommendations for solar phone chargers. It’s fine as a large-capacity power bank with multiple output ports and a last-resort solar option, but there are better products available, such as the Dizaul solar power bank, which also has a large battery capacity but charges much faster."]},"id":"76d863b3-2553-4ae8-aa94-78c4c929dd15","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70051","url":"/plochy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-20T16:46:08Z","datePublished":"2018-06-20T16:46:08Z","name":"PLOCHY 24000 mAh","synopsis":"The PLOCHY 24,000 mAh solar power bank has more input and output ports than most of the products we tested.
