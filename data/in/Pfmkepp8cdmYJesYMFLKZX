The <a href=\"/best-space-heaters\">industrial electric heater</a> warms air up to 95 degrees Fahrenheit from 0 degrees but the unit is not energy efficient.","A low-intensity infrared heating element allows you to quickly heat small spaces of up to 600 square feet. The infrared industrial space heater is rated for a maximum output of 19,110 BTUs per hour. It also features an adjustable thermostat with high and low settings. The low setting is 45 degrees Fahrenheit while the high setting is 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Overheat and discharge protection allow the industrial space heater to shut off automatically in case of an emergency. The heater&#39;s wire grill also protects small children from being burned. Tip-over protection means that the space heater cannot fall over unless it&#39;s pushed. The durable metal body is small and compact enough to fit into most work spaces, yet is strong enough to withstand being frequently moved.","A built-in carry handle makes this space heater easy to move from room to room. The electric model weighs just 20 pounds, so most people can lift it. The 6-foot power cord allows you to plug it in and around most small areas. A handy cord storage compartment means that you can pull out as much of the cable as needed and leave the rest of the cord inside of the heater.","At 11.5 inches square, this industrial space heater is small enough to set up on tables, in corners or other out-of-the-way locations. This makes it a good fit for heating small offices and warehouse areas or garages that might not have a lot of storage space. The electric motor also makes it suitable for use in other areas with no built-in ventilation. While this heater uses an infrared heating element, it uses a fan for air distribution, allowing you to warm small areas as quickly as possible. However, it does not feature an automatic fan control, which means that air begins to circulate as soon as you turn the industrial heater on.","With a small portable design, adjustable heating and a capacity for heating 600 square feet, the Dr. Infrared is a choice for heating small areas such as offices, warehouses, garages and homes. However, it does feature a fan, which means that it is not suitable for outdoor use."]},"id":"4d568c68-483a-4ee2-9c2a-8725b8872542","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66819","url":"/dr-infrared-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-04T20:59:20Z","datePublished":"2015-09-04T20:59:20Z","name":"Dr. Infrared DR988","synopsis":"The Dr. Infrared DR988 uses infrared heating with forced air via a fan to offer variable heating for indoor spaces.
