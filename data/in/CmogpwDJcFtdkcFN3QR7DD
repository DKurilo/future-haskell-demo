You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Brother MFC-7360N is a <a href=\"/best-all-in-one-printers\">laser all-in-one printer</a> with exceptional wireless connectivity and print speed. It lacks the ability to print in color, though, which is a deal-breaker for some businesses.","This is a true four-in-one printer, with printing, copying, scanning and faxing functionality. It has an automatic document feeder, which means you can easily scan multi-page documents. Unfortunately, this MFC-7360N lacks automatic duplexing. This means it can&#39;t print on both sides of the page unless you feed the page back into the printer.","Laser printers are almost always faster than their inkjet counterparts, and the MFC-7360N is no exception. It prints at a blistering 24 pages per minute, which is fast enough for even paper-dependent midsized businesses. It also prints at a resolution of 2,400 x 600 dots per inch, producing high-quality, professional documents.","Among the multifunction printers we reviewed, the MFC-7360N stands out for its wireless connectivity. For Apple users, this printer supports AirPrint, which means it accepts documents from Macs, iPads and iPhones. For Android and Windows Phone users, this printer supports the Brother iPrint app, which lets you send print jobs to any printer on the same network as your device. For Windows desktop users, you can either connect through USB or print wirelessly, as your computer will see this printer as an available device.","This printer has a 10,000-page monthly duty cycle, which means it&#39;s appropriate for small or medium businesses&#39; workloads. This is one of the better workloads among printers we reviewed. Because it uses toner instead of ink, you&#39;ll also get a lower cost per page compared to comparable inkjet printers.","One of the best aspects of a Brother printer is the exceptional customer service associated with the brand. We were impressed with the customer service representatives we interacted with, and Brother offers a one-year warranty."]},"id":"bb7164d6-278a-4f3f-bcf8-5d2c8c212a0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8ad16ad8-ec9d-429d-a138-7fff383d81cf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Brother MFC-7360N Laser is a well-designed all-in-one printer that suffers from two flaws: an inability to print color and a lack of automatic duplexing.
