It communicates with GPS satellites to determine its location, and then transmits that information via T-Mobile&#39;s cellular network to your tablet, computer or smartphone.","This tracker is a small gray box that weighs just over 2 ounces. It&#39;s about 2.5 inches tall and looks like a garage door opener. It relies on T-Mobile coverage, so you&#39;ll want to make sure you&#39;re going to use it in an area covered by T-Mobile.","Like most of its competitors, the SpyTec GL-300 has a zones feature. This feature allows you to designate geofences, or areas that will trigger an alert when the tracker enters or leaves. It also has a speed limit feature, which triggers an alert when the tracker goes over a specified speed. This makes it a good unit for tracking the habits of teenage drivers.","This GPS tracking device has a variable fee structure, meaning the more you pay, the more interval options you have. At the basic level, you can track the device up to once every minute. At the most advanced level, you can track it up to once every five seconds. Tracking a device at such a quick rate should not be a huge priority for you, unless you plan to track a lot of cars. An update interval of around one minute should be sufficient if you plan to use this device to keep track of people who are on foot.","Perhaps the greatest strength of this tracker is its outstanding battery life. An accelerometer inside the device turns it off when it&#39;s not moving, to improve battery life. At one-minute intervals, the GL-300 lasts for an outstanding two weeks of use. This is on par with the best battery life we&#39;ve seen in a GPS tracker.","However, you do trade a bit of appearance for that large battery. The GL-300 is a bit bigger, more conspicuous and less visually attractive than some of its competitors.","SpyTec has excellent customer support. We especially appreciated the online chat program featured on its website."]},"id":"c91b753a-17cc-4582-afd5-4d88c4802d74","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1b214906-4698-4d2b-a8c1-22e27cbf508a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GL-300 is a well-made device that you can use as a GPS tracker for kids, but it is a bit expensive to use.
