We were particularly interested in accuracy, since undercooked meat can be a source of foodborne illness. However, we also checked how long it takes each thermometer to display a readout, the range of temperatures it can measure, its probe length and how readily the manufacturer’s customer service team responds to issues.","In addition, we created an ease of use score for each thermometer we tested based on our overall experience using it. We took into consideration how easy it was to turn on the thermometer, get readings, change settings and enable alarms. For example, folding probe thermometers power on automatically when you unfold them, so you can measure your food&#39;s temperature immediately without fiddling with buttons or settings. On the other hand, one thermometer we tested needs to pair with your smartphone over Bluetooth – compared to other thermometers, it takes longer to set up since you must use your smartphone and an app to get temperature readings.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We tested meat thermometers by baking chicken breasts of similar thicknesses in a gas oven set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. We considered the chicken cooked when it reached 165 degrees Fahrenheit, since most food experts agree that’s the ideal internal temperature for cooked poultry. The testing environment was a medium-size kitchen with a stable room temperature.","We used a stopwatch to find out how long it takes each thermometer to display a full temperature readout, not just an initial response. We repeated this test multiple times and averaged the results. Based on our results, the best meat thermometers display full readings in less than 10 seconds. On average, it takes around 14 seconds, but the slowest thermometers take upward of 20 seconds to display a full reading.","Of the meat thermometers we tested, two have built-in temperature presets and presets for the ideal temperatures for poultry, beef, fish, lamb and more. On these two devices, we used the poultry settings.","<strong>Expert Advice </strong>","Food Network chef and cookbook author Ina Garten uses instant-read thermometers all the time. &#34;The secret to using them is to stick them in the side of whatever you&#39;re measuring so you know when it reaches the center,&#34; she told the online publication &#34;Eater.&#34;","Besides when cooking meat, using a good meat thermometer is essential when smoking meats since there are so many variables involved, according to Kennedy Speirs, general manager of BBQ Pit STOP of Layton, Utah. Cooking meat generally is a straightforward process, and thermometers help ensure the proper level of doneness and food safety, he said.","However, smoking meat can involve substantially different times and requires accurate temperature monitoring to ensure you get the best moisture and texture, Speirs said. “You can have two briskets, side by side, the same weight, the same size, and one will require 5-7 hours of smoking and the other 14 hours,” he said. “It’s really hard to predict.” Variables include the meat’s marbling, the altitude, the ambient temperature and even the lifestyle of the animals whose meat you’re smoking.","“You really need a good digital thermometer if you want to get into smoking,” Speirs said. “They are paramount in the smoking world.”","<strong>What to Look for in a Meat Thermometer</strong>","Accuracy<br/>It’s essential to get an accurate temperature readout so you don’t end up with undercooked meat that could potentially give you foodborne illnesses. To a lesser degree, it’s also important to not overcook foods since they become dry and unappetizing.","Speed<br/>Although seconds are not going to ruin a special meal, you undoubtedly would appreciate having a meat thermometer that gives you a readout quickly. If you’re making a special meal, it’s typical to have other foods to attend to, so a meat thermometer that can quickly gauge temperature is helpful.","Ease of Use<br/>If you don’t use your meat thermometer often, it can be frustrating to try to figure it out before a dinner party or holiday meal. Check out the meat thermometers we found to be simple to use and save yourself a lot of headaches.","Price<br/>We tested meat thermometers ranging in price from $12 to $99. As we probed pricing, we found $20 to be the average amount consumers plan to spend. These thermometers generally have simple designs. More expensive devices have additional features such as programmable buttons and water-resistance, attributes that can be handy but are not often necessary."]},"id":"62e67df0-fa90-48ad-8097-c11e5b495a79","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8561bb70-bb7d-4f98-8864-778d4b322a02","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">CDN ProAccurate DTQ450X</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">ThermoPop by ThermoWorks TX-3100</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">Taylor Pro 9842</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">iDevices Kitchen mini</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">CDN ProAccurate TCT572 Folding Thermocouple</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">Polder Stable-Read THM-389-90</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">Lavatools Javelin</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">EatSmart Precision Elite Thermocouple</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">Thermapen Mk4 Thermometer</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">Supreme Home Cook Touchscreen</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8f851ed4-b8a4-4c55-bf42-fa73c18164eb","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_283","url":"/best-meat-thermometers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-08T17:45:00Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T17:45:00Z","name":"Best Meat Thermometers 2018","synopsis":"We baked similar-sized chicken breasts in a controlled environment, checking internal temperatures and timing each thermometer’s readout.","review":{},"strapline":"We baked similar-sized chicken breasts in a controlled environment, checking internal temperatures and timing each thermometer’s readout.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-08-08T16:54:12Z","id":"sSZZSjNz3aeVvCvthrchZ7","meta":{"title":"Best Meat Thermometers 2018 -
