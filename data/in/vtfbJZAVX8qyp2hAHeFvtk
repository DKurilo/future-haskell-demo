This means that the head units are mechless and do not have CD players. The 758DBI is the flagship model of the single DIN models in the DI series. The 758DBI is also unique among the car audio head units we have reviewed in that it has a slide-out iPod docking station.","This head unit is powerful and loud. The 758DBI has the highest peak power rating at 320 watts of all the other head units we reviewed. It also has clarity, even at higher volumes, but only lacks in the fullness of the sound. The downside to this head unit is that it doesn&#39;t have much room to expand, with only one pair of RCA outputs. It also has only four preset equalizer curves, which limits how much you can customize the sound in your car.","The 758DBI digital media receivers don&#39;t have a CD player, but they do have Bluetooth capability and an iPod docking station that allows full iPod control. Along with the docking station, you also have an auxiliary port, a USB connection and an SD card slot, which are all located on the faceplate. The Boss Audio 758DBI is capable of playing MP3 and WMA files.","The detachable faceplate is easy to conceal because it is only the button portion that separates from the faceplate. Removing that portion makes the head unit incomplete and useless to thieves. This head unit also comes with a remote control that you can use to navigate the menus, mute the sound, and even answer and disconnect calls.","Boss Audio lists several telephone numbers and email addresses, along with the company&#39;s physical address. An alternative would be to contact the company through Facebook and Twitter. The Boss Audio 758DBI comes with a one-year warranty, and you can find a copy of the user manual on the support page."]},"id":"0d05c27b-d69a-4324-bb58-59d0f915b92d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d12cde1e-2296-4f20-9a37-e6a4cf8220d5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iPod docking station, while useful, does not make up for the lack of expandability or customization options with the Boss Audio 758DBI.
