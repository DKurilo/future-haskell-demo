The Neutron <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-running-shoes\">men&#39;s trail running shoe</a>, new for 2016, is a bright and light shoe that weighs in at 9.7 oz with the breathable upper mesh allows and reliable Vibram outer sole.","Vibram, as discussed in our Merrell All Out review, is a leader in rubber outer sole technology, providing impressive grip, traction and control for the shoes that utilize it. Neutron contains Vibram Megagrip for traction on wet, dry and rugged surfaces. The deep lugs are arranged with bidirectional orientation on the forefoot for optimal traction as well as lining the perimeter of the sole for better balance and stability.","Active Junky found the Scarpa Neutron worked well in two specific testing cases: training to avoid injury or training to recover, and running places some may deem sketchy. With solid ground feel that still provides a cushioned step, the outsole with 6 mm drop promotes joint and foot protection for alpine runs. Being a lightweight trail running shoe, it would also speak to those looking to fast pack.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments: </strong>The unique combination of agility and stability made running Neutron a, well, refreshing experience as did the uppers’ breathability. Vibram treads seemed to be nearly gyroscope-controlled in recovering from rolling stones – without a need to look down at the electric-colored shoes. Even after the Active Junky tester pounded them into thick mud, the outsoles retained enough traction to negotiate quick switchbacks on unconsolidated trails.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Quality","<strong>Best For:</strong> Multi-sport training in tandem with injury recovery and prevention, fast-and-light outings attached to variable (and marginal) terrain","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"f729dc65-7835-4057-8651-0afd8ca35fce","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 9.7 oz","Drop: 6 mm","Stack Height: 22 mm heel, 16 mm forefoot","Upper: synthetic and mesh","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber-Vibram"],"type":"ul"},"id":"9e5a3e39-f20f-4137-b58a-69357b9bd559","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background: </strong>Scarpa, whose name is an acronym with Italian roots, got its start in the late 1930s when the best shoe makers in the area came together to create better footwear.
