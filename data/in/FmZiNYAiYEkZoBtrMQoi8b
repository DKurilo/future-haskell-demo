As we stated in our review for August&#39;s other smart lock, the addition of DoorSense open door detection is one of the best innovations to come to a smart lock. We hope a similar feature appears in competing smart locks in the future.

Since almost all physical security comes from the deadbolt, we recommend attaching August Pro to an ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 or Grade 2 lock for the best chance to improve your security. Even so, this lock doesn&#39;t detect tampering or forced entry.","August Smart Lock Pro is easier to use than any other smart lock we tested. The mobile app walks you through the installation process, which takes about 10 minutes. It helps you set up guest access, auto-lock and auto-unlock. For more insights on the app, see our <a href=\"/august-review\">August Smart Lock</a> review, since both locks use the same app.","The thing that differentiates the August Smart Lock Pro from the base model is its added <a href=\"https://support.august.com/\">smart home compatibility</a> through Z-Wave and HomeKit. August Smart Lock Pro can also communicate with and function alongside other smart home products such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, Nest, IFTTT and Wink.

However, these other premium locks have the advantage of built-in keypads, which make them better for app-free guest access.","While you can add a wireless keypad to the August Pro, that&#39;s going to cost $79 more. We tested the keypad and like how well it works, but it doesn&#39;t bring much to the lock for that price.

The warranty only lasts one year, which is shorter than Nest x Yale&#39;s and Schlage&#39;s two- and three-year warranties respectively, but average for smart locks. The August Smart Lock Pro kept the classic round shape of previous August models and has two finish options: silver and dark grey.","The cost of the August Smart Lock Pro is the biggest barrier to it topping our rankings. The version we tested, August Smart Lock Pro + Connect, which comes with the August Connect Wi-Fi adapter, is $279, over $100 more expensive than the industry average of $175. Only the Nest x Yale is as expensive.
