The Haier HLP23E has only one water inlet valve, where several of our other portable washing machines have two for the option of stationary installation. If you only need to use your washer portably, one inlet valve is perfect. However, you may need to purchase further plumbing material if you want to put your washer in one place permanently.","This unit has four automatic water levels. Depending on your load size, determine how much water you need, from extra low to high. Remember to proportion your detergent accordingly, as a little goes a long way even in a high cycle.","You will have to resort to distributing detergent by hand, as there are no dispensers for detergent, softener or bleach in this portable washing machine.
