You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Oreck Revitalize is a <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaner</a> with a two-tank design that allows the clean and dirty water to remain separate. We got good results with this machine, although we hoped for better. The tank holds half a gallon of liquid. A 16-ounce bottle of Oreck’s Elite Carpet Cleaning Solution is included in the package.","Assembling this carpet cleaner was quick and easy; it took less than five minutes. Once we had it out of the packaging, we simply inserted a detachable handle into the top of the unit and locked it into place. When we mixed the solution with water in the tank, it was ready to use.","This is an attractive, lightweight carpet cleaner at 16 pounds. It’s easy to push and carry from room to room. It’s also relatively compact and won’t occupy too much space in your utility closet. This rug shampooer did an effective job of cleaning the carpet during testing. Its lightweight design, however, does make it feel somewhat less sturdy than the best carpet cleaners in our lineup.","More importantly, its performance was behind much of the competition. During testing, we did before and after spectrometer readings, and this machine lightened the carpet by 65 percent. Although this is a noticeable improvement, it&#39;s below average when compared to the best machines we tested. It didn’t clean as deeply as the best cleaners. However, you can get a deeper clean by taking more time over the problem areas and scrubbing those areas multiple times. Given that it is also the most expensive cleaner in our lineup, we would have hoped for better results.","The tank capacity on this cleaner is only 2 quarts, or half a gallon, making it the smallest tank of any machine in our lineup. This is big enough to clean roughly 50 square feet of carpet before you have to refill, depending on how dirty your carpet is. The dirtier your carpet, the more you will have to refill the tank. As with most of the products in our carpet cleaner reviews, this cleaner has a two-tank design, so it stores the clean water and solution in one tank and the dirty water you extract from the carpet in a separate tank.","On the plus side, it comes with an impressive four-year warranty, which is the best in our lineup. This will bode well if you have any problems with it down the road. Oreck has an informative website and a toll-free number you can call if you have questions. Support representatives are available during regular business hours Monday through Friday and reduced hours Saturday."]},"id":"8bda0871-8ae6-4434-b4d1-6ccb76709dd6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d18bb6b3-204b-423b-97a2-743881f41495","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Oreck Revitalize is an attractive, compact machine that does an effective job of shampooing carpets, but you may have to work a little harder than you would with other machines to make your carpet shine.
