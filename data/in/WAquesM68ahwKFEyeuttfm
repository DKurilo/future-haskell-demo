The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Maytag Maxima XL MHW6000AW front-loading washer may lack the sleek and shiny look that other front-load washers on our lineup boast, but what it doesn’t lack is a large-capacity washtub, a nice set of wash cycles and options, and energy efficiency.","You get 11 wash cycles and 10 options to choose from for each load of laundry you do. Additionally, this front-loading washer has five wash and rinse temperatures to choose from. However, we were disappointed to only see three soil level options available, which is less than most front-load washers include.","As it is Energy Star qualified, this Maytag front-load washing machine is estimated to cost $13 to run and consume 125-kilowatt hours every year.","Within the 11 wash cycles it includes, this Maytag front-load washer includes a PowerWash cycle and an allergen cycle, both of which we were happy to see included. The PowerWash cycle works to tackle tough stains with extra cleaning power and a thorough rinse. The allergen cycle can remove up to 95 percent of common household allergies and pet dander that often gathers on clothing and other fabrics.","You also get a NSF-certified sanitize option with this washer that helps remove up to 99.9 percent of household bacteria with a hot wash temperature and steam. We also like the six-hour Fresh Spin option, which when selected, tumbles the laundry load every 13 minutes when you don’t move them right to the dryer, keeping the load of laundry fresh.","We were slightly disappointed to see no prewash option included with the 10 options this front-load washer has, but it doesn’t make this Maytag front-load washer a bad choice.","This front-load washer is 38-3/4 inches high, 27 inches wide and 32-15/16 inches deep. You can get this Maytag front-load washer in either standard white or its Granite color. Additionally, the optional pedestal drawer is available for an extra cost.","You can receive help and support from Maytag by phone, email and even a convenient live chat function on its website. Maytag also provides the product user manual and some FAQs on its website for your reference."]},"id":"59efbb9e-368f-4444-bb9f-80603cf8c6d2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"60ca2848-23db-4199-8e5a-36ae2ea6cdad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag Maxima XL front-load washer is an Energy Star qualified appliance, has a 4.3-cubic-foot washtub and includes a nice set of wash cycles and options.
