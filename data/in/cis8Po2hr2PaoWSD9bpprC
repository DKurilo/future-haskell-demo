You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Zojirushi NP-HBC10 induction heating rice cooker is the most advanced <a href=\"/best-rice-cookers\">electric rice cooker</a> available to consumers. Like many of the best rice cookers, the model uses fuzzy logic to cook rice to perfect consistently, but it also includes an induction system that evenly distributes heat for excellent results. Lesser rice cookers can give you crunchier rice on the edges and softer rice in the middle, but the results from this Zojirushi model are consistent.","This electric rice cooker is made of stainless steel and is egg shaped. Most cool-touch rice makers like this one offer a locking lid, but few are removable. The Zojirushi Induction Heating Rice Cooker’s smooth black lid is removable, making it easier to clean than attached lids. The digital display in front is simple and intuitive, and it houses settings for white rice, brown rice and even mixed rice. It includes additional settings for sushi rice, porridge, soup or baking, and it offers you the added flexibility of choosing whether you’d prefer your rice regular, soft or hard. The delay timer has two settings, allowing you to choose when it cooks and for how long.","One setting offers a unique way to cook brown rice. Brown rice has gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is only activated after soaking the brown rice at 104 degrees for two hours. GABA is believed to lower blood pressure, improve kidney function and relieve stress, and the Zojirushi is the only rice cooker on the market with a GABA brown rice setting.","You should keep in mind that induction heating takes extra time. The Zojirushi makes flawless rice, but the cost is a much longer cooking time. Plus, if you opt to use the GABA brown rice setting for the added health benefits, it will add an additional two-hour wait before your rice is ready. Also be aware that extra features make the price higher than more basic models.","The Zojirushi NP-HBC10 rice cooker makes fine restaurant-quality rice. The level of precision is impressive, and the multitude of features are unmatched by other brands. This model has much a higher price tag than more basic models, but the additional cost gives you advanced features and capabilities."]},"id":"e5d92787-7e16-4e22-a6cd-5f0c399d0d4b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60299","url":"/zojirushi-np-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-22T20:27:34Z","datePublished":"2014-08-22T20:27:34Z","name":"Zojirushi NP-HBC10","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been has been discontinued.
