You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","<strong>Xfinity</strong> is an <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">internet TV site</a> run by Comcast. Xfinity helps you find your favorite shows. If you enter your location and the type of TV provider you use, Xfinity tells you what&#39;s on and when. It&#39;s great tool for finding entertainment, whether it&#39;s on your computer or on your TV. Only a lack of support features and a few other missing features kept Xfinity from moving into award-winning territory in our review of internet TV sites.","Xfinity pulls the majority of its content from Hulu. There are shows from most of the major networks, although you might not find every episode from your favorite show. Often, there are only episodes from the most recent season, or just a random sampling of episodes. This internet TV site has some shows that even hearken back to the black-and-white era.","One of the advantages Xfinity has over Hulu is content from the ABC network. Xfinity allows you to watch some of your favorite shows from ABC, although you will need to download the special ABC player to watch it. Nothing of the sort is required to watch the other videos.","Xfinity also contains multitudes of content besides full episodes. Even if you can&#39;t find full episodes of a particular show, there are bound to be a few clips for you to watch. There are movie trailers, actor information, movie reviews and even show schedules to help you find which shows are on your actual TV, as old-fashioned as that sounds – what with internet TV sites popping up everywhere.","One of the virtues of Xfinity is the simple design of the site, which makes it easy to navigate and find what you&#39;re looking for. The main page identifies the most popular shows available to watch, which are currently on the air, along with a list of the most-watched videos on the site.","The advertising model on Xfinity is similar to that of other internet TV sites. There are video commercials that interrupt your shows at intervals. Usually, they are 30-second ads just like the ones you&#39;d see on television. The one advantage, of course, is that you only have to watch one commercial per break.","Most of the standard features you expect from an internet TV site are present on Xfinity. A great search function is pivotal to helping you find your videos. Once you find the video you want, Xfinity provides all the details about the episode.","Additionally, Xfinity makes recommendations of other videos and information pages that will help you learn more about the show you&#39;re watching or the actors in it. These extra information pages are actually one of the most interesting aspects of Xfinity because they make the site more than just a video player.","Xfinity allows you to embed videos on other sites or recommend them to friends by email – all from the viewing pane. You even have the ability to save a video to your list of favorites, although this involves creating a user account on the site."]},"id":"883ab6ce-fa1b-4e42-9910-482472094292","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e425585-4f70-4cd0-88f6-928436671e4d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Xfinity</strong> is a great site with a lot of great content.
