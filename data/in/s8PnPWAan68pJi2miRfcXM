You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","A mid-tier shiatsu massager, the Heated Shiatsu <a href=\"/best-foot-massagers\">Foot Massager</a> is lightweight and portable. The portability factor and easy controls make it a simple machine to operate.","Weighing in at 3 pounds, the Heated Shiatsu Foot Massager weighs very little, so it is easy to transport. It measures 11.75 x 11.75 x 8 inches, so it is small enough to fit inside a suitcase or bag and doesn&#39;t take up much room for storage. The soft interior lining is a thick fleece that is gentle on the skin and traps heat to increase warmth. It is removable via a zipper and is machine washable for easy cleaning. With a fleece exterior, this model looks more like a giant slipper than a traditional foot massager machine. Because the foot space is one large void rather than two small ones, people with wide feet can use this model comfortably.","Inside the machine are two rotating nodes that target specific acupressure points on the soles of your feet to help relieve tension and stimulate circulation, helping to improve blood flow. The nodes are designed to mimic a shiatsu-style massage. Although it does have a heat setting, it has no massage action for the tops of your feet and has no other massage action than the dual-rotating nodes. The heat setting can be used in conjunction with the nodes or can be used alone to gently warm the feet. There are no intensity options, so you cannot increase the pressure or depth of the massage action. The only massage intensity available is light. This is a good option for those with sensitive feet but not for those who require a deeper, more intense massage.","The Heated Shiatsu Foot Massager plugs into a power outlet, restricting where you can use the device. To negate the need to bend over to manipulate controls, this device has a tethered remote control. The tether prevents you losing the remote control.","For a portable foot massager, the Heated Shiatsu Foot Massager is a good option. If you need a light massage for your feet and want a remote control to work your foot massager, this could be a solid option for your needs."]},"id":"290b58fc-6d9d-48f0-9be5-c4781a8c8c5a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63302","url":"/hammacher-schlemmer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T14:34:14Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T14:34:14Z","name":"Hammacher Schlemmer Heated Shiatsu","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-09T14:34:14Z","id":"s8PnPWAan68pJi2miRfcXM","meta":{"title":"Hammacher Schlemmer Heated Shiatsu Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Heated Shiatsu Foot Massager from Liteaid is soft, portable and easy to use.
