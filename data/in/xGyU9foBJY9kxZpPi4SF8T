But if you&#39;re looking to replace your cable box with something better, the Hauppauge may prove disappointing.","The biggest complaint we have about the Hauppauge DVR is its lack of internal storage space. When you want to record live TV or live game play, you have to connect the unit from your cable outlet, to your TV and then to your computer. Your computer’s hard drive then becomes the storage unit for recorded content. You will need about 2GB of storage per hour of recording at the 5Mbps setting and roughly 6GB per hour at the 13.5 Mbps setting.  That frankly sounds like a lot of space, so you&#39;ll likely want an external hard drive for all of your recorded shows. Ever stranger still is the fact that Hauppauge requires you to purchase a remote control separately.","The Hauppauge HD PVR isn’t compatible with Macs out of the box. You can use software through third party vendors as a work around, but at an additional cost. It is compatible with most everything else: PCs, HD and SD TVs and most cable providers.","Accessibility is not Hauppauge’s strongest feature.  You can access digital channels through your cable provider and free, over-the-air channels, but you can’t access any online streaming applications like Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Instant Video. It seems as if this unit’s focus on capturing live video game play has left out other content options.","Support for the Hauppauge HD PVR comes mainly in the form of online resources. There are several areas on the website with FAQs, software downloads and connector diagrams. You can also contact support via email and phone. Hauppauge has the best warranty on the market, guaranteeing the product with a two-year warranty."]},"id":"dbd72289-7736-4377-9a4c-b37fcd495685","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b19a4e27-c915-4c56-b7cc-aece07ac0370","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We wish so many things were different about the Hauppauge HD PVR.
