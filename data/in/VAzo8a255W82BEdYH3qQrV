This helpful and easy-to-use <a href=\"/best-mac-landscaping-software\">landscape design software for Mac</a> boasts an object library of more than 4,700 objects – although many are for home construction – as well as a plant library that includes more than 3,800 types of vegetation. You also get a plant guide to see whether certain types of vegetation will flourish in your area.","One of the easiest ways to picture your new yard is with the photo import tool. This is an excellent choice if you just want to work on your yard and have no aspirations to do a home remodel at the same time.","This landscaping software for Mac offers a PhotoView tool, so you can import a photo of existing property to get started fast on your landscape designing. From there, you use the drag and drop tool to import garden plants, trees, hedges and flower beds, as well as create and configure swimming pools and a large variety of fences in different styles and materials.","This Mac landscape design software can help you layer in items from your actual environment in other ways. The Background Importer tool and the Plant Importer let you insert your own photos or portions of your own photos, so you can see how real elements would figure into what you see. If something that you thought would look good turns out to be ugly in your yard design, you can just get rid of it and replace it with something else.","This might not be the <a href=\"/punch-landscape-design-review\">best Mac landscaping software</a> to buy if you have no idea what you want in your yard. There are templates for home remodeling, but not so many pre-designed plans for garden, yard and exterior layouts. This heavy emphasis on home interiors and exteriors does make it a bit frustrating if you are primarily focused on redoing your landscape.","The good news is you do get deck and patio samples as well as tools that make it easy to design from scratch. The IntelliDeck feature automatically follows the shape of your house as you sketch it out, so you can quickly generate a deck, even one with a complex shape, without much effort.","You have the option to design in 2D or 3D with TurboFloorPlan Home and Landscape Deluxe. Both are helpful for different things in landscape design, so it is nice to have a choice. The 3D viewing capability is great, but unfortunately, when you are looking at vegetation, plants are displayed in 2D even if you are using the 3D viewing capability.","You get some decent customer support if you run into problems with this landscaping software for Mac. You can email or call the company, watch hundreds of helpful instructional videos, and check the website’s community forums to see if others have found solutions to the problem you’re trying to address. Unfortunately, you do not get an online manual or a FAQs section on the website. However, there is a 30-day refund guarantee, so you have a month to get your money back if you are unhappy with this product.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>TurboFloorPlan Home and Landscape Deluxe tends to favor home renovations over landscaping, but it still offers plenty of tools that are quite helpful and easy to use, such as its deck design capability. You also get a generous selection of plants. In addition, this software gives you the opportunity to incorporate many real elements into your designs, so you can get a true look at how your yard or garden will appear if you decide to proceed with your exciting new plans."]},"id":"a0a77faf-0b90-4009-bcf6-b3ea04118d6c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69259","url":"/turbofloorplan-home-and-landscape-deluxe-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
