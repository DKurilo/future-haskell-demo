Although it makes a variety of accessories for multiple platforms, like steering wheels and microphones for PlayStation, Xbox, and Wii, gamepads are only available for PC setups. These third-party controllers are reasonably priced but still offer reliable quality as well as some advanced features. You can choose between wired or wireless models, with wired ones having a 6-foot cable. You won&#39;t find audio passthroughs on these controllers, however.","<strong>What to Look for When Buying Gamepads</strong>","Whether you&#39;re a console gamer looking for a new controller for your favorite system or a PC gamer who wants to forego the mouse and keyboard, when seeking out a new gamepad, it needs to be the right fit.","When it comes to consoles, some gamers only choose gamepads and peripherals from the manufacturer. Others use a third-party controller as a backup, while others choose a third-party device as their main controller for a variety of reasons, including price, feel and functionality. Here are some considerations when shopping for gamepads:","<strong>Compatibility</strong>","Not every gamepad is compatible with every system, so make sure you choose a model that&#39;s compatible with your gaming system. If you play on different consoles, or on both a console and PC, consider a gamepad with dual compatibility. This can save you money and improve gaming performance (or button speed and precision, due to muscle memory), even if you switch between your two gaming setups regularly.","<strong>Connectivity</strong>","You can choose between USB, plug-and-play wired gamepads or wireless models. Wired controllers are often favored by pro and semi-pro gamers because they tend to be more reliable, responsive, and they don&#39;t suffer from data loss or signal interference. However, the difference isn&#39;t really noticeable to most of us.","With wired gamepads, while there&#39;s no signal disruption, you are tethered to within a few feet of your console or PC tower. Therefore, it&#39;s important to choose a wired model with a long enough cable so you can sit far enough away from your setup and play comfortably. If you prefer wired headsets over wireless ones, look for gamepads with an audio passthrough, as well as ones with audio controls.","<strong>Functionality</strong>","As long as the gamepad has the right buttons for all the basic commands required by the games you&#39;re playing, it&#39;s adequate. However, to get the most out of your gaming session, consider a controller with an extra programmable face and shoulder buttons and triggers. And, if you go for a gamepad with savable profiles, you&#39;ll be able to program the extra keys to perform additional commands or combos and save each profile for playing specific games.","<strong>Comfort</strong>","The shape and design of a gamepad is crucial. It should be shaped to fit comfortably in the hands and remain comfortable even for long gaming sessions. Your hands should remain in a healthy position, and your fingers should be able to reach all the buttons and triggers without contorting or overextending. Opt for models with comfort grips, well-spaced buttons and gently curved construction."]},"id":"5610d8a3-46fb-46ce-b383-433dd5741e7d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f1edc224-2149-4137-b279-8a05cee8fa95","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZKNT18/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68549[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Afterglow</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0106XFCPI/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68550[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Hori</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033WFJFS/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68548[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Kinobo</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAHYQY/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68545[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Logitech</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PC4YR76/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68551[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Mad Catz</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QRKWLA/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68544[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Microsoft</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SN1QEGW/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68552[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Nintendo</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0177G3QV4/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68543[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Razer</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015AARJI/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68546[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JABA5C/?&tag=ttr_gamepad-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|908[art|NA[pid|68547[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Thrustmaster</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"847bed8e-b436-41e5-b5c7-205e079e0fe7","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_908","url":"/best-gamepads","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-11-08T17:07:58Z","datePublished":"2016-10-19T16:38:00Z","name":"Gamepad Review","synopsis":"Crush your enemies and battle your way to the top with a feature-packed, comfortable gamepad for your PC or console.","review":{},"strapline":"Crush your enemies and battle your way to the top with a feature-packed, comfortable gamepad for your PC or console.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-05-10T23:39:10Z","id":"KWSxRNCxovLmL3wfzCiLdR","meta":{"title":"The Best Gamepads 2017 | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Quickly compare several gamepads.
