If you’re unsure what you want, you can use the website’s “build your own” swim spa, which is a feature we really found useful. This way you can play around with systems, colors and accessories without feeling pressured by a salesperson. If you want you can also live chat with a customer service representative online. We did this and got the answers we were looking for within seconds. <br/>If you’re going to build your own pool you do have to know a little about the terminology and what you want in a swim spa, as it asks you to select which liner you want and which coping system, for example. The liner is the style and color of the inside of your swim spa you’ll be able to see through the clear water and the coping system is essentially how the edge of the spa is bound together and sealed. Because we could see the prices online we didn’t technically ask for a price quote, but a customer service representative contacted us six days later anyway.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"33631db2-e2cc-4f85-912b-5cd110b26ca9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64246","url":"/endless-pools-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T16:23:47Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T16:23:47Z","name":"Endless Pools","synopsis":"The swim spas available at Endless Pools have propeller-powered swim current, so it’s going to be rather strong and consistent.","review":{"rating":65,"verdict":"Endless Pools is our best budget pick because you can build your own swim spa online and see roughly how much it&#8217;s going to cost you right up front.","pros":["You can build your own spa online and see the MSRP."],"cons":["There aren&#8217;t many swim spa accessories for sale."]},"strapline":"The swim spas available at Endless Pools have propeller-powered swim current, so it’s going to be rather strong and consistent.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","id":"DNgwSPGnAFTXmRFuy8MRHK","meta":{"title":"Endless Pools Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Endless Pools offer swim spas models that meet the need of those wanting an open water feel.
