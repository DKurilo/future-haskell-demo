It takes decent quality images and has a 50-foot infrared flash, which is about average for the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-cameras\">trail cams</a> we reviewed.","There is a serious flaw with the HD-7. Unlike most game cameras we reviewed, which have at least a 50-degree field of view, the HD-7 captures a 35-degree field of view. This means that you&#39;ll lose 30 percent of the width of the image compared to other trail cams. It&#39;s easy to imagine a scenario in which that 30 percent prevents you from seeing deer or other wildlife that a different camera would detect.","The detection zone of the HD-7 has 50 feet of range, which should be sufficient if you place the HD-7 in a good location. However, its detection angle is matched to its field of view – 35 degrees – and thus its detection zone is one of the weakest among the trail cameras we reviewed.","The SPYPOINT HD-7 features a trigger time of less than a second, which is fast enough to capture almost any animal mid-frame. However, its recovery time is 10 seconds, slower than most of the wildlife cameras we reviewed. It&#39;s possible that, with such a long recovery time, the animal could wander out of the HD-7&#39;s detection zone before it could take a second image. To combat this, you can set the HD-7 to burst mode, and it will take two to four images per trigger. However, this can become frustrating, because you will fill up a memory card much more quickly than if you were shooting in single-shot mode.","The HD-7 has sufficient functionality to be a feeder camera, because the 35-degree detection zone is not an issue if you know precisely where the wildlife is going to be. However, it does not offer a time-lapse mode, which might be problematic if you want to monitor activity around your property at specific times."]},"id":"823d1998-5140-4d0b-bc7d-4ca0d499f3e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1968e31c-0881-48b8-8d48-13980346733e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ultimately, SPYPOINT misses the mark with the HD-7.
