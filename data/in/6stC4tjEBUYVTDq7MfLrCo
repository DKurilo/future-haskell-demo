The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">Floor Standing Speakers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The Premier Acoustics 8.12 Titanium Series tower speakers are big and powerful. This set of floor standing speakers can handle up to 400-watts of power and have large drivers to push low frequencies easily. In fact, these tower speakers drive more bass than any other speaker we reviewed.","You’d be hard-pressed to find a pair of stereo speakers that can match the amount of bass these Premier Acoustics can handle. Built into the side of each speaker is a 12-inch long throw woofer. Other stereo speaker systems may require an extra subwoofer to obtain low-bass prowess, but these speakers seemingly have a subwoofer built into each speaker. At low volumes it is apparent that these speakers can drive bass without a problem. When listening to dubstep, it was instantly apparent that these floor speakers have no problem reproducing bass tones. Even at low volumes you can feel the frequencies reverberating beneath your feet. The bass was punchy, deep, and never loose or muddy.","The bass-driving capabilities also serve as one of its drawbacks. Accompanying the 12-inch long throw woofers are two 8-inch long throw drivers and a single 1-inch tweeter.  Having such large drivers doesn’t help high-frequency production. When you turn the volume up, the low end can drown out the detail of your music, especially within the midrange spectrum of music. This became apparent when listening to Radiohead’s “Subterranean Homesick Alien.” This song has really low-end tones, warm midrange and sharp high-end frequencies. When all frequencies are going full-steam during the chorus, the overpowering low-end bass swallows the midrange. The sound never becomes muddy, but detail is lost.","The 1-inch tweeters surprisingly do a good job cutting through the bass to give your sound some air and depth. The saxophone in Dave Brubeck’s “Take Five” is airy and decisive, and the ping of the ride cymbal maintains definition and accurate representation.","These speakers are as big as they are powerful. Each speaker weighs 64 pounds and are 44.6 x 10.35 x 16.5 inches (H x W x D), making them the largest speakers in our lineup. Each speaker is covered by a five-year warranty."]},"id":"f3fbc3ce-f319-4d00-846a-4c9879563907","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9ca88664-259a-403d-add9-e7aeb1c3e413","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You don’t need to accompany these tower speakers with a subwoofer to fill the void from missing bass.
