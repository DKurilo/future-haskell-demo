You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frigidaire FFWC35F4LB is a free-standing, single-zone <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-wine-coolers/\">wine cooler</a> that can cool up to 35 standard-size bottles. It&#39;s 3.9 cubic feet and cools using a frost-free, compressor-type cooling unit. This wine refrigerator could be called “black-on-black.” It has a black door frame, black cabinet and black wire shelves. It is designed to maintain temperatures between 41 and 64 F. The unit weighs 79 pounds and is available with free shipping.","One detail to take notice of is that the description shown under the image of this wine cooler on the Frigidaire website is not for this model. A quick comparison of the images makes it obvious. This unit does not have wood shelves or dual zones. If you have had good experience with other Frigidaire appliances, you may want to consider one of the upgraded wine cooler models over this version. The Frigidaire FFWC35F4LB does not have the best user reviews, and we suspect that it will be discontinued soon. However, currently it is still available and we wanted to explore it to see if it could be a good low-priced option for our readers.","A few positive qualities of this wine fridge are that it can be locked and the door is reversible. The legs adjust so you can level the unit, and the bottom shelf can hold odd-sized bottles. The door window is tinted to protect your wine, and the shelves slide out. Additionally, if set at the lowest setting, it can chill your sparkling wines to a favorable serving temperature.","On the other hand, there are a few things we did not like about this unit. First, it does not include stainless-steel detailing like most units do to help match other popular appliances. Second, it does not have digital controls. You have to adjust the temperature with a knob similar to what many regular fridges provide, which is difficult to set to an exact temperature. It also does not include attractive blue LED lighting like most wine coolers do nowadays."]},"id":"92f2e512-5ca4-430e-853a-082381b04463","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6482d14d-a77b-4204-bdb7-3c45a707ee22","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Since appearance for an appliance such as this matters, we cannot rank this wine cooler high on our list.
