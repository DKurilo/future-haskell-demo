It is a probe-in design with a touchscreen component that allows you to actively monitor the temperature of meat as it cooks. Though this design sounds good in theory, the layout of the interface and button labels proved difficult to navigate in our testing. Other than this small inconvenience, the device is quite accurate and valuable in the kitchen.","If you’d prefer even greater simplicity and ease of use, take a look at the <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">EatSmart Precision Elite Thermocouple</a>.","This two-piece meat thermometer consists of a touchscreen digital display and a metal probe attached with a lead. It isn’t an instant-read meat thermometer, which means it’ll need to be inserted throughout the duration of cooking. This allows you to continuously monitor the internal temperature of meat.","The touchscreen of this food thermometer is illuminated by a blue backlight, though this light only turns on when you touch the screen. From this screen, you can select a preset for the type of meat you’re cooking and the level of doneness you want to achieve. You can even set a timer to alert you when the meat reaches the desired temperature. Navigating the screen’s interface can be a challenge, however. We found the setup to be less than intuitive, and we had to frequently reference the instruction manual to properly set up the thermometer.","While the response time to its initial estimate was just seven seconds, it took more than 30 seconds to achieve a fully accurate reading. However, this device is intended to remain inserted into a piece of meat throughout cooking, which means it continuously updates temperature readings and you won&#39;t have to wait for a new reading each time you want to check the temperature. This thermometer has an accuracy of within 2 degrees. It comes with the longest probe of all the thermometers we tested, measuring at 7 inches.","The Supreme Home Cook Touchscreen Thermometer adds a modern touchscreen design to the traditional meat thermometer. However, the interface proved confusing and its backlight turned off frequently during our testing. Once you become familiar with the device, you will be able to monitor food as it cooks so you always know the temperature status, whether you&#39;re grilling on the stove, barbecuing on the grill or roasting in the oven."]},"id":"7f5f692a-574b-4332-8cc7-a19ee3cfdbc4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67437","url":"/supreme-home-cook-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-17T22:18:02Z","datePublished":"2015-11-17T22:18:02Z","name":"Supreme Home Cook Touchscreen","synopsis":"The Supreme Home Cook Touchscreen Thermometer offers a unique design that sets it apart from other meat thermometers.
