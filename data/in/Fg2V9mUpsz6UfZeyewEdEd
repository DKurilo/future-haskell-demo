Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Garmin GTU 10 is a quality <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS tracker</a> that allows you to monitor the whereabouts of your child, teen driver or even your pet that tends to run away. You can set up email or text message alerts, or monitor their location from your computer or smartphone. The only issue is a lack of tracking history past a week, but this GPS tracking device is a solid option to ensure your loved ones are safe while traveling.","The GTU 10 from Garmin is a small GPS tracker that you can use to monitor where your child, teen or pet is. It’s ideal if you want to make sure your child gets to and from school or a friend’s house safely, or to monitor your teen as they are starting to drive on their own. If you have a dog or cat that tends to run away, you can also connect this GPS tracking device to their collar to see where they’ve gone.","The GTU 10, which looks like a computer mouse, can be monitored from your Mac or Windows PC or smartphone, and you can also set it up to send alerts by email or text message since you can&#39;t constantly monitor your child, teen or pet. If you don’t have a smartphone, the text messages are an excellent way to receive alerts while you’re away from your computer.","If you want to mount the device to your car’s dashboard, there is a velcro strap with adhesive that can be attached to both the GTU 10 and the dashboard. That makes it easy to mount it to the dash and remove it when you need to. One small note about attaching it to your pet’s collar: Garmin advises that you use a special case to protect the device, since your pet doesn’t have a problem with getting dirty or wet.","You’ll need to plug the GTU 10 into your computer via mini-USB to USB, and from there you will need to register and activate the GPS tracking device at Garmin’s site. The user manual has instructions for doing this and for further setup of the GTU 10. It’ll take about two hours to charge the GPS tracker, and the battery will last at least 24 hours and up to 10 days, depending on use and frequency of notifications.","You can monitor your tracking history for one day with the standard tracking feature. The deluxe version lets you monitor your history for up to 20,000 reported tracking points for up to seven days. It may seem like a lot, but the GTU 10 will report at specific intervals that you determine, and they do add up.","The Garmin GTU 10 GPS tracker allows you to track your teen, child or pet easily from your Windows PC or Apple computer, or from your smartphone with the Garmin Tracker app, which is available for the iPhone and Android devices. You can also be alerted, as mentioned above, by email or text message.","It’s easy to set up and use, and you can either monitor the latest tracking points on a map, with general alerts notifying you where the GPS tracking device is. The other option is to set up a geo-fence, which is an area you designate your child or teen can travel in, and they agree upon. It can be a basic route to school or a friend’s house, and if they exit the boundary, you’ll be alerted. You can also set it up so you receive an alert when they get to the agreed-upon location, or when they leave.","The GTU 10 is fairly easy to use, whether you’re accessing the tracking features from your computer –Windows or Mac – or from your smartphone with the mobile app. It’s not difficult at all to set up virtual zones via geo-fencing, which we explain below in Tracking. The device is small and can be attached to your child’s backpack, your car’s dashboard or your pet’s collar. You should also let your child or teen know you’ll be tracking them with the Garmin GTU 10, as you don’t want them to think you’re secretly spying on them.","Garmin offers several help and support options for their GTU 10 GPS tracker, including a user manual, video tutorials in their learning center, a FAQs page, a searchable database of support and troubleshooting tips, and a page on their site with more product information and documentation. Plus, they offer direct contact with their tech support division by email or telephone, in the event you need further help."]},"id":"64416bdb-0fad-4da0-bff1-87e786541643","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d0a18640-1ff4-4ea1-9369-05e782ccdd15","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Garmin GTU 10 has enough features for you to keep track of your child, teen driver or runaway pet.
