In this way we were able to see how the programs functioned in the real world. We got reactions from disappointed and frustrated children who were unable to access favorite websites with questionable material and were locked out when their allotted computer time was up. We also downloaded the programs onto our office computers and ran tests on it in a lab environment.","Our testing allowed us to see how easy it is to install and use each program to monitor activity on various devices. We could test to see how quickly each program notifies us of flagged activity and the amount of lag time on the host computer. This helped us narrow the 19 programs we tested to the best 10. We confidently recommend all of the programs in our lineup as powerful tools for keeping your children safe online.","<strong>Other Standout Features in Parental Control Software</strong>","<strong>Anti-Cyberbullying</strong><br/>One of the biggest threats online today is cyberbullying. Most of the time, it happens through private messaging or on social media. You can use parental software to view messages your child receives and the sender’s contact information. This is helpful, but it may take days to find out about it through a message or by checking the browser or chat history in your parent portal.","<a href=\"/surfie-review\">Surfie by PureSight</a> has features specifically designed to recognize, stop and block cyberbullying. Surfie quickly runs a virtual background check on your child’s contacts to screen for cyberbullying history. When it detects that someone has threatened or demeaned your child, it automatically ends the interaction and notifies you. You can then review the data and communicate with your child to decide what steps to take from there. It’s a powerful feature that stops potential cyberbullying quickly.","<strong>How much does parental software cost?</strong><br/>Approximately half of the parental software programs we reviewed require a yearly subscription and the other half are a one-time purchase. The subscription-only options cost around $50 per year, while the other programs are on average $50 period. The number of devices you can monitor at that price varies, but the best parental control programs come with a minimum of three and don’t require a separate license for the parent portal or monitoring app.","<strong>How do I set parental controls on the internet?</strong><br/>Several internet browsers, including <a href=\"/mozilla-firefox-review\">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href=\"/google-chrome-review\">Google Chrome</a> and <a href=\"/safari-review\">Apple’s Safari</a>, have some settings that allow you to block specific websites by adding the URL to a black list. You can also set the security to low, medium or high and the browser will automatically block websites that fall into those general categories. However, parental software is much more effective and easier to use to filter internet content.","Good parental software includes internet filters that make it easy to block websites and content you deem inappropriate. You can block websites in categories such as pornography, drugs and alcohol, and violence. The program will not allow your child to access any website that falls under the categories you select. The best parental control programs have additional filter categories for online games, social media sites and instant messenger programs.","<strong>Can you put parental controls on YouTube?</strong><br/>The quick answer is yes! There are several parental control programs that let you block YouTube entirely so your child can’t watch videos on the site. This is done by either selecting a preset filter category for video or social media pages, or by adding the YouTube URL to a blacklist within the program.","Other programs, like <a href=\"/norton-family-review\">Norton Family</a>, let you block chat applications, even within social media pages. This lets your child watch videos but not see or comment on them. <a href=\"/net-nanny-review\">Net Nanny</a> has a profanity masking feature that blocks out vulgar connect, even in videos, so your child can’t see or hear them. There are a handful of parental control apps that set content blockers based on your child’s age. These programs, like <a href=\"/surfie-review\">Surfie</a>, allow your child to watch age appropriate videos on YouTube while blocking the mature ones."]},"id":"c9cfc4b0-0470-4e28-814e-a2d1bb774c4d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0a5e6c10-d36c-42da-9dc3-c4989ccf214b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7874&awinaffid=103504&clickref=ParentalSoftware&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qustodio.com%2Fen%2Ffamily%2Fpremium%2F\">Qustodio</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8900250-12343040 \">Norton Family</a>","<a href=\"http://surfie.puresight.com/v2/src/Languages_Localizer/Gui/Support/OnlineBuy/purchase.html?langId=9\">Surfie</a>","<a href=\"http://www.netnanny.com/products/netnanny?pid=602-6&utm_source=purch&utm_medium=link\">Net Nanny</a>","<a href=\"http://www.witigo.com/products/witigo-parental-filter-for-windows\">Witigo</a>","<a href=\"https://www.cleverbridge.com/920/cookie?affiliate=1454&x-at=ParentalSoftware&redirectto=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cleverbridge.com%2f920%2f%3faffiliate%3d1454%26scope%3dcheckout%26cart%3d97944\">SpyAgent</a>","<a href=\"//intego.7eer.net/c/13013/293914/3086?subId1=ParentalSoftware\">ContentBarrier</a>","<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Cty0dj6o3sg&offerid=225718.10000065&type=3&subid=ParentalSoftware\">WebWatcher</a>","<a href=\"https://www.nchsoftware.com/childmonitoring/index.html?ref=toptenreviews0219\">Verity</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"cd4031c3-bb47-4ef4-90b5-36d35bcd57aa","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_544","url":"/best-parental-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-17T19:38:58Z","datePublished":"2017-08-01T21:38:01Z","name":"Best Parental Software","synopsis":"Children can use the internet to learn, but well-known dangers may make you want to ban it altogether.
