This company produces high-quality car video and DVD players with monitors measuring 9 to 19 inches. These roof-mounted DVD players include helpful features such as remote controls, USB and SD inputs, infrared transmitters for wireless headphones, and dome lights.","This series of overhead DVD players has models that include swivel capabilities, so you can turn the monitor left or right for a better view. Most of the Pyle Audio units have an anti-skip mechanism, which prevents skipping in your movies, even on a bumpy road.","Some of the Pyle Audio flip down DVD players include built-in speakers along with infrared transmitters. The built-in speaker lets everyone in the vehicle hear what&#39;s playing on the screen, while the infrared transmitter lets passengers use wireless headphones so the rest of the crew in the car isn&#39;t disturbed by the movie&#39;s audio.","Pyle Audio&#39;s flip down DVD players generally replace the dome light that is installed in the ceiling of your car between the front and back seats. This could be an issue, but Pyle Audio includes dome lights with its overhead DVD players, so you aren&#39;t left in the dark. Many of these roof-mounted DVD players also include a built-in FM transmitter so you can listen to the audio of the movie through your car&#39;s speakers.","The extra inputs on most Pyle Audio flip down DVD players let you turn the mobile movie player into a complete entertainment center. You can plug in your MP3 player, phone or gaming console to listen to your own music collection, stream videos or movies using an internet connection, or play video games on a long road trip.","All of Pyle Audio&#39;s flip down DVD players include a one-year warranty that protects you from defects either in labor or parts. If you get a unit that doesn&#39;t work, you can send it back to the manufacturer for repair or replacement.","Pyle Audio makes several different flip down DVD players in its mobile entertainment series. These overhead DVD players have widescreen monitors that range from 9 to 19 inches, and they include features such as extra inputs, dome lights and built-in speakers."]},"id":"4f77daa4-379e-46c3-bb0f-070a1bb0b295","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50599","url":"/pyle-audio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-31T14:26:28Z","datePublished":"2010-08-31T14:26:28Z","name":"Pyle Audio","synopsis":"Pyle Audio is the manufacturer of a series of flip down DVD players.
