The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/beauty/best-electric-razors/\">Electric Razors</a> here.</em>","The Panasonic ES-LT41-K is an electric razor that offers you the option of shaving wet or dry. Because you can choose to shave in the shower or make a quick pass over your beard at the sink, this razor is a versatile choice. This razor also offers a variety of convenient features. The blades of this electric shaver are easy to clean, and there&#39;s a rechargeable battery with a long life and a lengthy charge. It also has  a lockable power switch and an LCD display that will let you know what percentage of charge the razor has left and when it’s time to clean the blades.","The floating blade system features three hypoallergenic blades powered by a linear motor at 13,000 cpm (cuts per minute). The design means this shaver delivers a fast shave that won’t tug and pull on individual hairs, so there will be less irritation on  sensitive skin. The Nano Blades,  or inner blades, sit at a 30-degree angle, which provides precision, and a pivoting head will help produce a close shave.","There is a pop-up trimmer on the back of the razor that makes it easy to clean up sideburns.  You’ll get a clean cut with the 1.25-inch wide trimmer.","The lithium-ion rechargeable battery reaches a full charge in an hour, and will last for about two weeks (assuming you spend about three minutes shaving every day). The razor helps you keep  track of the charge on the illuminated LCD display, which also will indicate when it’s time to clean your electric razor.","Cleaning the razor only requires you to remove the stainless steel foil, press the power button for a few seconds, which activates the sonic vibration cleaning mode, and then hold the shaver under running water. The cleaning mode will turn off automatically after 20 seconds.","There are several travel-friendly features, including a travel pouch and a locking power switch. If you lock the switch before you pack the razor, it won’t accidentally flip on in your luggage, which will prevent an accidental battery drain. Also, the AC 100-240V charger works in the United States and internationally, so you can get a comfortable, close shave no matter where your travels take you.","This affordable, lightweight electric razor has a limited warranty that will cover parts of the razor, including the rechargeable battery, for two years."]},"id":"4eb852e0-ebab-4892-8bbe-b0817960baaa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58051","url":"/panasonic-es-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T20:01:59Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T20:01:59Z","name":"Panasonic ES-LT41-K","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":24,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-30T20:01:59Z","id":"3LypgzybcgXTcLirdyJWVh","meta":{"title":"Panasonic ES-LT41-K Electric Razor Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
