You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This <a href=\"/best-electric-razors\">electric razor</a> provided a very smooth shave during our testing. However, it did irritate the tester&#39;s face a little bit. The tester also had to shave over the same area three or four times in order to get a close shave, which was a little more than the best razors.","Along with the little irritation, we found that the chin was a bit of a problem area. It seemed to take more passes to get a close shave, and it hurt more. We were a bit annoyed to find that although this razor has a precision trimmer, it isn&#39;t a built-in trimmer. You have to attach it by first pulling off the shaver head and putting the precision trimmer on, which is a little inconvenient.","You can use the Philips Norelco 7700 rotary electric razor to shave wet or dry facial hair, meaning you can use this razor with shaving cream or in the shower. It has 50 minutes of cordless running time on a full battery charge, which is more than the majority of electric razors out there.","It takes this electric razor one hour to recharge, which is pretty standard. It also has a quick-charge option, which allows you to plug it in for a few minutes in order to get enough power for a single shave, but it doesn&#39;t have a corded option that allows you to use it while it&#39;s plugged in. If this is an important feature for you, the <a href=\"/philips-norelco-7300-review\">Philips Norelco 7300</a> is a similar rotary razor with a corded option.","The unit includes both a charging dock and a cleaning station, making charging and cleanup convenient. You also get a travel pouch with this unit, which is a nice bonus.","This electric razor measures 7.2 inches long, 2.5 inches wide and 2.3 inches high, which is about standard for a rotary shaver. It weighs 2 pounds, a bit heavier than most electric razors, but during our testing it felt normal in the hand and the controls were easy to access.","You get a two-year warranty on this Philips electric razor, which is the coverage you see on the majority of the best electric shavers for men. Philips provides customer support by phone and live chat on its website. You can also refer to a handful of FAQs on the website."]},"id":"d132345e-c476-4a65-a968-16270da48d5f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"edfedca5-3d17-436c-8d5c-5e06d99852dc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips Norelco 7700 electric razor for men is a good option for a shaver that has rotary shaving technology.
