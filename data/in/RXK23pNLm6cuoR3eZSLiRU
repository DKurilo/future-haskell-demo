Flame Houston MFE5050BK fireplace features dual heat settings and vibrant, realistic flames that you can adjust with a remote control. In addition to its modern and sleek design, it has a handful of convenience features that make it an attractive choice.","This wall-mounted <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplace</a> has dual heat settings – low and high. This is standard for electric fireplaces. On its high setting, the fireplace draws 1,500 watts of power to operate, which is standard.","This unit has a Btu output of 5,200, so it heats your living space fairly quickly. It&#39;s designed to heat up to 400 square feet, so a living room or common room is the perfect place for it. You could even install it in an office waiting room. If you want a fireplace with a stronger heating capacity, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/duraflame-dfi-5010-review\">Duraflame DFI-5010</a>.","Along with Moda Flame&#39;s two heat settings, the fireplace has a no-heat setting. This setting allows you to enjoy the ambiance a fireplace can provide without the heat. The flames are lit with LEDs, and the fireplace has log inserts and glowing embers, which make the fire seem more realistic.","The Moda Flame Houston is 50 inches wide, so it only works well on a long wall. It also measures 21.65 inches high and sticks out from the wall 5.5 inches, which is pretty standard. It weighs 39 pounds, which is relatively heavy for a wall-mounted fireplace, but it is also fairly wide.","If you plan on mounting this on a wall above or below a television, you&#39;ll want to make sure to leave a minimum 36 inches of space. This clearance is necessary for the built-in fan to push the airflow from the vent to disperse into the room efficiently, and so nothing combustible is in the way.","The mounting hardware is included, which is nice, and you don&#39;t have to hire a professional to mount the unit on your wall for you – you just need a few tools to get it done. There aren&#39;t touchscreen controls, but you can use the remote control or access the control panel on the side of the unit to turn it on and adjust the heat and flames. The remote control makes it easy to control the heat and the flames from anywhere in the room.","This electric wall fireplace has a timer and an automatic shut-off function, which both add convenience and safety to the unit. The timer allows you to set the fireplace to only operate for a certain amount of time, after which it turns off automatically. You can set the timer from 30 minutes to 7.5 hours. The automatic shut-off feature ensures the fireplace doesn&#39;t overheat, as it turns off if it starts to get too hot.","You get the standard one year of warranty coverage with this wall electric fireplace. Moda Flame doesn&#39;t offer live chat on its website, which is often the fastest and most convenient way to get customer service, but you can contact the company by phone and email for help. Additionally, you can access the product manual on its website and view a list of FAQs, which is very helpful.","The Moda Flame Houston MFE5050BK electric heater fireplace is sleek and modern. You get a loaded feature set with adjustable LED flames, realistic log inserts, a timer, automatic shut-off, and a remote control to turn it on and off and control the heat and flame settings from anywhere in the room. It heats up a large living space quickly and efficiently."]},"id":"cf3e6643-2c0d-4b46-86fc-059fb7346de7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67228","url":"/moda-flame-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-14T15:28:16Z","datePublished":"2015-10-14T15:28:16Z","name":"Moda Flame Houston MFE5050BK","synopsis":"The Moda Flame Houston MFE5050BK fireplace features dual heat settings and vibrant, realistic flames that you can adjust with a remote control.
