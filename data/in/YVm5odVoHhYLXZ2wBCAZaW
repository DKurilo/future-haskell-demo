Despite being a 5.1-channel system, its audio performance isn&#39;t as strong as the other home theater in a box systems, but this model does play CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs.","The HT-J4500W&#39;s five included speakers are shaped like tiny cubes. You get a center speaker, two front speakers and two surround speakers that each measure 5 inches wide and 4 inches tall. Together, their frequency response covers a range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The best speaker systems can emit sounds measuring in at 50 kHz. The subwoofer, which weighs six pounds, isn&#39;t very powerful. However, this budget home theater sound system will more than likely sound better than your television&#39;s built-in speakers.","This home theater system lacks multiple ports for connecting video game consoles, cable boxes or streaming systems. It only has one HDMI output, but no additional inputs. It does support Bluetooth for wirelessly streaming music. Despite offering Bluetooth connectivity, however, Samsung has neglected to support Wi-Fi with this model. You can connect it to your wireless router with an Ethernet cable, but it is a bit of a hassle. So if you&#39;re going to watch movies with this unit, it more than likely will be with the onboard disc drive.","Setup itself isn&#39;t too difficult since Samsung has color-coded labels for the speakers, speaker cable and ports on the back of the receiver. Since the speakers have unique connectors, you&#39;ll only be able to use them with the included receiver.","Samsung has an array of support options available in case you need some help or need to submit a claim. You can reach the company by telephone, email, social media and even live chat. This home theater speaker system has a one-year warranty if you need to get a speaker or the receiver serviced."]},"id":"3e1f7e6c-f0bf-4232-8068-4f17642f8c45","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"479b9b19-bd99-46c2-8827-04d23e1bf049","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are a lot better home theater in a box systems available, but if you are on a budget and are looking for something with a relatively easy setup, the Samsung HT-J4500W may be the answer for you if you are upgrading your home theater system.
