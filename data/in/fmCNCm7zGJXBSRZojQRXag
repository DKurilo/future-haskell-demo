It offers full 1080p HD video resolution at up to 30 frames per second and takes pictures with its 8MP lens. When streaming at full HD, however, there are times that the frame rate drops, creating odd hiccups and glitches. Also, it is missing several features that we look for in webcams. Still, if you need a simple webcam but expect high-quality video and pictures, the Brother NW-1000 is a good option.","As mentioned above, the camera sometimes runs into issues when streaming 1080p video. If you run into this problem, it&#39;s easy to change the resolution to 720p. You still have an HD picture, but if someone is viewing from a high-definition display, you&#39;ll look slightly pixelated.","The biggest problem with the Brother camera is its lack of extra features. For the same price, you can get a webcam with the same resolution as well as light-correcting technology, one-click social media uploads and face tracking. The NW-1000 lacks all of these. It does have noise reduction, though, and its dual built-in microphones give you a full sound. It also has automatic focus, but without face tracking, the camera focuses on movement rather than on your eyes.","What makes this HD webcam so great for desktops is its large size and thick stand. While it doesn&#39;t swivel from left to right, the long cord means that you can turn your monitor if needed.","This one of the few webcams that is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers. It also comes with a two-year warranty. If you do run into problems, you can browse the FAQs or download a replacement manual. You can also contact Brother by email and phone, although we had trouble getting in touch with anyone."]},"id":"38970ea2-300d-4b15-a278-134f4ee468e8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e47901da-0ce1-48c1-b628-9caa9cd283ac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Brother NW-1000 is a great desktop webcam for its image and video quality, it lacks many of the features that we look for.
