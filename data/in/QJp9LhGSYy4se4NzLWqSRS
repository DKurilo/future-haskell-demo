Four jumbo-sized bags that each measure 40 x 30 inches can give you about 80 percent more room for different household items than standard vacuum bags. This can help you with bulky comforters and quilts, flannel sheets, puffy jackets and those seasonal clothes that are still good but need to be safely preserved from dirt, dust, moths and moisture. All those things can cause fabrics to deteriorate and often create unpleasant smells that are hard to eliminate.","You also get storage versatility with a container of the SpaceMax Jumbo space saver bags since they can hold just about any soft item. These work well with a vacuum cleaner hose, and you can compress soft clothes and bed linens by as much as 80 percent in size, which frees up space in other cluttered bedrooms and closets. And since these are transparent, you can easily see what&#39;s inside, so if you need something, you don&#39;t have to open bag after bag to get what you want.","Once you&#39;ve sucked the air out of a filled bag, you can make it airtight because these bags are designed with a double-zip seal. To help you, the opening for the vacuum hose offers a triple seal valve so your efforts with the vacuum hose will really pay off. You can compress filled bags quickly and easily, and these sturdy vacuum seal bags will stay safely shut.","Although these work great for home storage, you also can use them for traveling if you need to flatten clothes so they fit into your suitcase. This is especially useful if you&#39;re taking quite a few outfits with you on your journey.","You get a nice extra with this purchase â€“ a hand pump that can remove plenty of air from the bags when you are in the process of repacking. This takes more work and time than a mechanical vacuum, naturally, but it can do the job well and you can get a great deal of compression and a true vacuum seal. This is a great help if you&#39;re someplace where you have no access to an electric vacuum cleaner with a hose. If you are unhappy with these bags, you get another benefit, namely a 100 percent money-back guarantee.","For all-around usefulness, the SpaceMax Premium Jumbo Vacuum Storage Saver Space Bags are helpful multi-purpose storage containers that hold plenty and seal well."]},"id":"7916df62-ea36-45bb-9fb0-bead7fa181c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69599","url":"/spacemax-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-09-06T20:01:25Z","datePublished":"2017-09-06T20:01:25Z","name":"SpaceMax Premium Jumbo Vacuum Storage Space Saver Bags","synopsis":"We think the best thing about the SpaceMax Premium Jumbo Vacuum Storage Saver Space Bags is the fact that they can help anyone who admittedly is a packrat de-clutter the house quickly and with little effort.","review":{"rating":98,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"We think the best thing about the SpaceMax Premium Jumbo Vacuum Storage Saver Space Bags is the fact that they can help anyone who admittedly is a packrat de-clutter the house quickly and with little effort.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-09-06T20:01:25Z","id":"QJp9LhGSYy4se4NzLWqSRS","meta":{"title":"SpaceMax Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The SpaceMax Premium Jumbo Vacuum Storage Saver Space Bags are quite large, hold a good deal of soft goods and come with a strong seal.
