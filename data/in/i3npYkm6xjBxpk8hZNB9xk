You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Krups F230 Egg Cooker prepares eggs in multiple styles using a steam method. Once it&#39;s done cooking, this <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a> keeps your food warm while you make the rest of your meal.","With the Krups F230 Egg Cooker, you can prepare eggs within their shells using the plastic and metal accessories. When the cooker is heating, you use the dial to select the setting you need. At the end of each cooking cycle, the electric egg cooker emits an audible signal. You can either take the eggs out or switch to the warming setting as designated on the front of the cooker to keep them warm until you are ready to eat.","This gadget allows you to make several types of eggs with the included trays. The set includes two poaching trays that you can use to prepare a pair of poached eggs for eggs Benedict or create individual omelets within the two-pocket accessory. You can also use the trays to make scrambled eggs. Also included with the set is a short power-supply cord. The length reduces the risk of it becoming tangled with other cords.","During use, the device needs an even, heat-resistant surface. With up to seven eggs cooking in the electric egg cooker, you can prepare snacks for the week while you work on other things. The 400-watt motor keeps your omelets, poached or boiled eggs warm while you finish making the rest of your breakfast. After each use, the cooked eggs must cool for 30 minutes to prevent it from automatically buzzing due to the heat level.","This machine cooks eggs using steam created by a heated water reservoir, halting the cooking process after the water evaporates. With the included egg piercer, eggs of all sizes cook well. The clear plastic lid allows you to view your food as it slowly cooks. The water level determines the length of time they cook.","After cooking, you must wash each piece immediately after it is cool enough to handle. The base cannot be submerged in water, but the trays and accessories can. Instructions for appropriately descaling the cooking dish are included. This model comes with a two-year warranty, and details are included in the manual.","The Krups F230 Egg Cooker is a midpriced gadget that is simple to use with understandable directions. With additional pieces to accommodate other recipes, the appliance is easy to clean after cooking."]},"id":"b5310c4f-969f-4d2a-892c-58091029c662","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63182","url":"/krups-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T19:10:12Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T19:10:12Z","name":"Krups F230 Egg Cooker","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-03T19:10:12Z","id":"i3npYkm6xjBxpk8hZNB9xk","meta":{"title":"Krups F230 Egg Cooker Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Krups.
