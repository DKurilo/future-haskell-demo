In addition to these services, eTutor provides resources for international students, gifted students and adult learners.","First and foremost, eTutor offers customers a secure site. This is something that you should look for in any online company before signing up. In addition to this, the company has tutors available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This is extremely convenient because students can log in and obtain help whenever they need it, and they can fit the help in around their extracurricular activities and responsibilities.","You or your child can also work one-on-one with a tutor for help on a homework assignment, a particular subject or just one question. This company provides tutors for grades K-12. This is convenient if you have children in different grade levels. Your child can also prepare for the SAT through this online tutoring company, and even take practice tests. Everything your child works on with eTutor is completely private and confidential. This gives you the confidence to allow your child to work independently.","To utilize this site, you will need to create an online account for your child. While there is no whiteboard feature, there is a chat room and a bulletin board that your child will use to communicate with the tutor. There is voice chat available as well so your child can clearly understand what the tutor is trying to convey and vice versa. These tools make it easier for your child to understand the assignment or lesson the tutor is teaching.","Pricing depends on the grade level, and eTutor offers discounts for enrolling more than one student and for paying for more than one month at a time. You have the option of paying with a credit card, a check or PayPal. You simply choose the package you want, complete the information regarding the subjects your child needs most help in, pay for the service, and then your child is ready to get started.","There are a few different ways that eTutor offers good customer service. First, there is a FAQs section available on the website, so you can easily check there to find answers to questions without even having to contact customer service. If you need to speak to a representative, you can use the phone numbers or connect with them on Facebook and Twitter. There is also a blog where you can receive valuable information about the company and about how your child can use eTutor to bring his or her grades up.","This company offers homework help in varying subjects for all grades and ages. Whether you&#39;re looking for help with one problem once in a while, with homework every night or with a whole subject, it&#39;s easy for your child to receive the help needed. The online chat makes it simple for you or your child to communicate with the tutor. With flexible payment options that allow you to select the plan that is best suited to you, you don&#39;t have to worry about paying for services or tools that you don&#39;t need. You select precisely what you feel is most helpful for you and your child."]},"id":"cd0eb1a6-eb86-4181-a86f-69f67ad41050","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50878","url":"/etutor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-27T21:21:49Z","datePublished":"2010-09-27T21:21:49Z","name":"eTutor","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
