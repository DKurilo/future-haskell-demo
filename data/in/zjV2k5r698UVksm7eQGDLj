The design improves the wear of the tire’s treads and overall handling by enabling more contact with the road. The wide tread includes four circumferential grooves for channeling water out from underneath the tire. This plays a critical role in preventing hydroplaning.","The tire’s construction also includes silica, which ensures that the tread remains stable for a better grip and retains some flexibility to mold against the shape of the pavement. Within the tire itself is two steel belts reinforced by nylon for increased strength and durability. The polyester cord chassis also ensures the tire’s overall ride quality and handling for its tread guarantee up to 70,000 miles.","The Firestone Precision Touring is a low cost, all-season tire that ranks among the top echelons of mid-range car tires. It offers traction on wet, dry and light snow surfaces. The rounded shoulders of the tire, combined with its deep grooves for dry traction and cornering grip provide a high level of steering response for a safe and enjoyable drive.","The Firestone Precision Touring offers a smooth and comfortable ride, though it does create some road noise at times. This noise becomes noticeable as the treads wear down, though they will remain quiet for the first few years of use after you’ve purchased them from tire store. Beyond this, the steering and handling of these tires is stable enough to instill confidence in any driver for navigating all weather conditions and terrains."]},"id":"058e1be4-9101-4cdc-b478-5623b405d4d6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58239","url":"/firestone-precision-touring-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-19T20:23:10Z","datePublished":"2013-11-19T20:23:10Z","name":"Firestone Precision Touring","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
