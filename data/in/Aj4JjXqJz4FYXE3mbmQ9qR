You can make professional-style drinks, including lattes and cappuccinos, at home using this versatile <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a>.","Be aware that when you make espresso with this device, you will need to be in charge. It is not the automatic variety, but instead it uses manual controls for the water. This gives you precise control, but you give up some of convenience of the automatic functionality.","This espresso maker uses bar-pump pressure, which is used by the best espresso machines because it draws out the best flavor from the coffee grounds. This model also presents an auto purge function in which your espresso machine brews espresso, steams milk and then flushes the system so it is ready for the next shot.","You can put your Breville Duo-Temp to use brewing either ground coffee or the time-saving, pre-packaged espresso pods. This machine comes with three filter cups so you have a variety of brewing choices: one shot, two shots or a pod-brewed espresso.","In addition, you get a nice number of other accessories, including a tamping tool to press coffee grounds properly before starting the brewing process, a measuring tool, cleaning tools to help ensure that the machine does not get clogged and a stainless steel frothing mug.","Unlike other espresso makers we reviewed, the Breville Duo-Temp offers a handy internal storage tray so you can keep the filters, tools and other items nearby and won&#39;t need to dig around in a kitchen drawer looking for them when you are longing for some tasty brew. The drip tray and water reservoir are removable, but unfortunately they will need to be washed by hand since they are not dishwasher safe.","You do not get an automatic shut-off function with this espresso machine, so you will need to be certain that you have turned it off for safety&#39;s sake. However, there is a standby mode for when the machine is not in use.","Breville provides numerous customer support options that can be quite helpful. If you run into trouble or have questions, you can contact the manufacturer by email or call the company number during regular business hours.","You also get instructions with illustrations for using your machine, ideas for cleaning and maintaining it for maximum performance, demonstration videos and access to the company&#39;s Facebook page. This espresso maker is supported by a one-year warranty, which is an industry standard for espresso machines."]},"id":"286b1a29-eacd-425f-96b5-4efad3f3a4ef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d83e2f32-ae58-4663-a696-a2dc5d4018ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The variety of espresso drinks you can brew with the Breville Duo-Temp will please family members and guests.
