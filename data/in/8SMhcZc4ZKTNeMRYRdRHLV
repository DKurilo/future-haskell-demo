Among other things, it is designed to be an always-handy front-loading device, which makes it just right for locations under kitchen cabinets or any of those out of the way spots in your kitchen.","Whether you are putting in coffee grounds or pouring water into the reservoir, of this coffee maker, everything is easily accessible through a front opening. In addition, all controls are located on the front of the device below the carafe so everything is easily within reach.","The DeLonghi DCF212T brews into a 12-cup glass carafe on a non-stick hot plate. It has a strength setting, termed the &#34;aroma button,&#34; which offers more robust coffee, although you must be patient if you are desperate for a cup of rich, strong brew. Stronger coffee requires a slower brewing process than usual, involving a time-release technique with the device releasing hot water onto the coffee grounds at 30-second intervals to draw out the fullest flavor and aroma.","One thing you can do to ensure coffee is ready when you need it is make use of the device&#39;s 24-hour programmable digital timer. Some coffee drinkers turn up their noses at preparing the grounds and water the night before, but die-hard caffeine lovers enjoy waking up to the smell of delicious coffee. You also can quickly get a cupful while the pot is brewing with the brew pause feature.","If you are the forgetful type, this coffee maker offers an automatic shut-off after two hours.","A unique aspect of this drip coffee maker is that it provides a storage area that warms coffee cups for you, which is always welcome, especially on a chilly morning.<br/>Unfortunately, this drip coffee maker does not have a built-in water filter. This means you will need to rely on tap water, or bottled water to get the best results if you live in a community that has the misfortune of  dealing with an off-tasting public water supply.","In addition, if you live in an area with hard water, the lack of a water filter means you will need to descale hard water deposits approximately every 300 brew cycles to keep your DeLonghi DCF212T working at its best.","This automatic coffee machine employs a permanent metal mesh filter instead of paper filters, which for many consumers is the perfect arrangement since their palates respond better to coffee made without the paper filters. In addition, there is a cost savings by not needing paper filters. However, if you are someone who strongly prefers coffee made with paper filters in an automatic drip coffee machine, perhaps this is not the best coffee maker for you.","Customer support for DeLonghi is available by telephone or email. The warranty is for one year."]},"id":"f5b2129d-7769-4919-8270-cec4ca3099c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ed69c19a-f6b2-4c17-b49c-41ba22162d9d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With the DeLonghi 24-hour programmable 12-cup coffee maker, you get the benefit of front-loading access to all controls, a cup-warming area and a permanent filter.
