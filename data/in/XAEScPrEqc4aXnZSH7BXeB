Unfortunately, <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> leaves merchants vulnerable to friendly fraud, or chargeback fraud.

A customer may have been charged more than once for a transaction by mistake, or may have returned merchandise for some reason. Sometimes, chargebacks occur because of a dispute over credit, while other times, a chargeback is a result of fraud. Chargeback insurance refunds the amount of the chargeback and any associated fees to the merchant&#39;s account.","When customers commit chargeback fraud, they purchase merchandise, usually over the internet, using a credit or debit card. Then, the charge is disputed with the issuing bank and the money is forcibly removed from the storeowner&#39;s merchant account and refunded to the customer. Many merchant-service providers charge an additional fee to the merchant for chargebacks, even though the merchant has little opportunity to defend the chargeback. In this situation, chargeback insurance can be vital."]},"id":"8331be63-bea8-4c41-826f-3e6534551869","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"What Is Chargeback Insurance?"},"id":"5394cd36-63fd-4bc1-b97b-bbc2b3431abb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Some merchant-services companies include chargeback insurance as one of their available services. It can also be purchased separately through a company&#39;s existing insurance company. Regardless of where merchants purchase their chargeback insurance, it is important to understand exactly what the policy will cover.","Identity theft or identity fraud is a practice that is increasing in frequency. Because of protections offered to cardholders through their issuing banks, merchants bear the brunt of this type of fraud. When credit cards are stolen and used without the legal cardholder&#39;s permission, the cardholders are not typically held responsible for the charges. Instead, merchants find themselves without the merchandise purchased or the money for that merchandise. The bank that issued the credit to the customer initiates a chargeback to the merchant&#39;s account reversing the transaction initially charged during credit card processing.","Friendly fraud occurs when a customer intentionally initiates a chargeback with their issuing bank for merchandise or services already received. As the number of internet and telephone transactions continue to increase, this type of fraud is becoming more and more common."]},"id":"71cde8c1-2b52-4e68-b2fd-1a94cc9abedb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"How Chargeback Insurance Protects You"},"id":"49f84780-f967-4e8d-95f0-90bc246e6793","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If merchants have chargeback insurance, they pay a monthly premium for protection against chargebacks. In return for this premium, the merchants are reimbursed for the amount of the chargebacks and the fees charged by the bank handling their merchant account.","Merchants who conduct a large number of transactions over the telephone or online should invest in a good chargeback insurance policy because it is difficult to predict the frequency and number of times they will encounter fraud. Often, when information is compromised and illegally obtained, or when a customer intentionally commits fraud, the merchant is not aware until the chargeback occurs. With few alternate methods of recourse, chargeback insurance can be the one way to help ensure the financial stability of a merchant&#39;s business."]},"id":"739b9fe9-a9b3-4b6b-934b-725db4bf66f0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6636","url":"/does-my-business-really-need-chargeback-insurance","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"denise-ferreira","url":"/author/denise-ferreira","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Denise Ferreira","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"sU7VAACANGjQPTh6T934a5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-09-22T13:46:50Z","datePublished":"2011-09-22T13:46:50Z","name":"Chargeback Insurance - Does My Business Really Need It?","synopsis":"The concept of chargeback insurance is to help protect you from the financial losses these charges can cause. Accepting credit cards as a form of payment is an important part of doing business today.","review":{},"strapline":"The concept of chargeback insurance is to help protect you from the financial losses these charges can cause. Accepting credit cards as a form of payment is an important part of doing business today.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-04-06T18:24:49Z","id":"XAEScPrEqc4aXnZSH7BXeB","meta":{"title":"Chargeback Insurance - Does My Business Really Need It?","description":"Without chargeback insurance, some small businesses can be gouged to the point of bankruptcy over false charges.
