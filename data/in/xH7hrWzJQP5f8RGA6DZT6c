You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Yepzon One <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS tracker</a> is a minimalistic device with exceptional battery life. There are no on-board buttons to press, and the device works via a combination of GPS, Bluetooth and GSM (international cellular networks). However, its simple design approach means it lacks some important features.","One of the most impressive things about the One is that it offers the widest and most flexible range of location update intervals. This means you can easily choose to receive updates about your child’s location as frequently as every 10 seconds or as infrequently as every six hours. This is convenient, especially since the device doesn’t allow you to ping it manually for on-demand location updates, like the best GPS trackers in our review do.","However, ujnlike the <a href=\"/amber-alert-gps-review\">Amber Alert GPS</a>, the One doesn’t offer much beyond that in regard to tracking. It lacks the ability to let you know when your child leaves a geofence perimeter you create around areas like your home or their school. The unit also lacks the ability to make and receive calls, which would allow you to contact your child or for them to reach out to you if they are in danger or need help.","You can monitor the Yepzon One&#39;s whereabouts on the free companion app, available for both Android and iOS users. Once you’re logged in, you can see the device’s last recorded location as well as its recent history. It also lets you view a low battery alert.","The unit itself is water resistant and has rubberized port covers so you won’t have to worry about water seeping in. Battery life on the device is outstanding, lasting up to two weeks on a single charge, with minimal usage.","If you ever have a concern about the GPS tracking device, you can contact Yepzon’s customer support team via email. There is a European phone number as well, as the company is located in Finland, though you may incur additional charges if you call from outside of Europe. The tracker works internationally and ships with an impressive two-year manufacturer warranty. The Yepzon One tracker is not the most affordable GPS tracker, as it has one of the highest initial purchase prices of any product in our comparison, but its monthly subscription rate is amongst the lowest."]},"id":"e9da792d-e1b3-4564-9715-158e1e9f4c1b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29092cea-31e0-4718-bf99-32afafc795bb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Yepzon One doesn’t do as much as some of its competitors, despite its high price point, what it can do it does well.
