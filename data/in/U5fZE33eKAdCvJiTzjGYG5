Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because AV-Test, an independent antivirus test lab, did not evaluate ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus &amp; Firewall in its latest round of tests. These tests play a heavy role in our ratings, so we are unable to review products not included in the tests. The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">Antivirus Software</a> comparison here.</em>","ZoneAlarm Antivirus + Firewall uses a powerful antivirus engine that passes all major tests. This antivirus program is minimally intrusive and never sends annoying alerts. It includes a two-way firewall. It does not protect against email spam. This antivirus software can stop keyloggers in a few ways. It uses behavioral protection to detect and stop keyloggers. Because it includes a firewall, it monitors applications and processes and stops dangerous activities, including keyloggers. The antivirus component of the product is also able to scan for and detect keyloggers along with viruses and malware. Furthermore, it can detect and stop keyloggers from reading anything that you type into a browser. It also has a virtual browser that encrypts whatever you type in a browser.","One of the many features that we like is how ZoneAlarm scans downloads. When you request a download it will check the content against millions of known threats and perform a heuristic check. If the program cannot tell if it is safe, it scans the contents of the file in a protected environment separate from your system. This product is simple to use even by non-techie types. You do not have to worry about complex configuring and you do not need to know complex security terms. With ZoneAlarm you simply install it, make a few configuration choices and use the slider tool for setting the strength of the security. The main control panel is elegant and you can easily control the firewall as well as the antivirus and antispyware protection. From the control panel you can easily set the level of protection you want from off to minimum to automatic to max. This antivirus software also has a game setting, so you can lower security defense and alerts for uninterrupted online game playing.","ZoneAlarm uses one of the most powerful antivirus engines on the planet, the scanning engine from Kaspersky. Kaspersky has passed all commonly known tests including VB 100%, West Coast Labs Level 1 and 2 as well as ICSA labs and other independent third-party tests. ZoneAlarm provides up-to-date protection from fast-breaking security threats. ZoneAlarm provides updates as needed, even within an hour for new threats. You can also commission an update whenever you desire. This antivirus software provides zero-hour rootkit protection and new definition updates automatically.","The chat support is responsive and helpful. We used this feature multiple times and always received quick and relevant information. ZoneAlarm also provides free email support. The ZoneAlarm web site provides a searchable knowledgebase, tutorials and user forums."]},"id":"8da5d0ca-90f7-4dae-b24e-a5fd3e6cc11b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ff5af0fb-e3e5-4d3e-8063-42b01347d2c0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ZoneAlarm Antivirus + Firewall is a two-way firewall that also contains one of the most effective antivirus engines.
