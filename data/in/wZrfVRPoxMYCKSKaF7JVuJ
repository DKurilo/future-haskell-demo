We have watched product videos, read manuals and spoken to customer service representatives to determine the best in the industry. We have utilized EPA figures to quantify energy efficiency and spoken with industry experts to gauge what matters for this type of appliance.<br/><strong><br/>Front-Load vs. Top-Load Washers</strong>","There is still some debate about whether <a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">top-load washing machines</a> or front-load machines are best. While that decision is mostly a matter of personal preference, front-load washers generally save on space because you can stack them with front-load dryers, according to Edward Crump, brand and product marketing manager for Frigidaire.","&#34;Front load units also typically offer better cleaning and handling of clothes, and tend to use energy and detergent more efficiently,&#34; he wrote in an email. ","Top-loading washers have come a long way in both efficiency and cleaning power, but they&#39;re just not as good as front-loading machines, said James Peters, product manager at Kenmore. Peters has been involved in lots of testing that proves that point, and most third-party testers come to the same conclusion: Front-load machines clean better. However, people still tend to shy away from front-loading machines for many reasons. Part of the issue is some early front-load machines had problems with mildew and vibration.","&#34;It&#39;s comparable to a lot of things out there in the world today – people have biases that they lean on,&#34; Peters said.","Since he&#39;s been in the business for a long time, people often ask him whether to buy a front- or top-loading machine. And then they ignore his answer. &#34;I&#39;d think people would listen to me, but I find that they don&#39;t,&#34; he said.","Peters explained that top-loaders have gotten better, but front-loaders are still better at cleaning and are more efficient. Top-loaders even tend to need more repairs, based on his experience with appliances, which goes back to selling them in college. He&#39;s always seen fewer issues with front-loaders over the years.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We purposely selected the best-selling front-load washers from major retailers to compare. We made detailed charts comparing features that matter for front-load washing machines, including annual operating costs, total capacity, water used per wash, dimensions, warranty and more. We gave better scores to the units that have useful features like a wide variety of cycles, soil levels and water temperatures and presets.<br/><strong><br/>How Much Does a Front-Load Washer Cost?</strong>","There is a pretty broad range of prices when it comes to front-load washers – from about $600 to $1,700. You can find a good machine for right around the middle of that range if you can live without some of the more advanced features like steam cleaning. The five most popular front-load washing machines on Home Depot, Lowe&#39;s and Best Buy have an average price of $782.","<strong>How Long Do Front-Load Washers Last?</strong>","A 2007 National Association of Home Builders/Bank of America Home Equity study concluded that 10 years is a reasonable life expectancy for washers. Frequency of use, quality craftsmanship, maintenance and other factors can impact how long a front load washer lasts. You can safely assume most machines will outlast their warranties but that is not the same as life expectancy. One way to get a more educated guess is to ask people in the industry.","We asked Richard Spencer, who has been involved in the repair business since the 60s and owns Utah-based Mark-A-Newt Appliance Specialists. He recommends Speed Queen as the most reliable brand. He rarely repairs them. He also likes Whirlpool and Maytag for dependability. He recommends looking for a strong warranty and researching how easy it is to find replacement parts before purchasing any appliance. All of them will need repairs eventually, he said.<br/><strong><br/>The History of Washing Machines</strong>","It wasn’t all that long ago that most washing was accomplished by beating clothing on a rock near a river, no matter what part of the world you were in. The washboard came along in 1797, and that made it at least a little easier to extract water and dirt. The earliest washing machines started to appear in the 1800s and were still pretty labor-intensive. Some versions consisted of a metal drum with holes that users would turn over a fire. There were also some <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/120823202489969065\">wooden models</a> that sped the process at least a little. Most people still did everything by hand, though laundry <a href=\"http://www.oldandinteresting.com/laundry-ponches-punches.aspx\">plungers</a> helped. They look a lot like a modern toilet plunger and came in different sizes. There were even small ones for agitating baby clothing in a wash basin."]},"id":"d0dc606d-dfe7-454c-b1c3-f1b3edd663eb","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/5hvN6MGnNKGNugLUqtqKn9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/home-front-load-washer/w/512/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS80L1IvODE5MjQzL29yaWdpbmFsL1dhc2hpbmctTWFjaGluZS1IaXN0b3J5LmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5hvN6MGnNKGNugLUqtqKn9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"5hvN6MGnNKGNugLUqtqKn9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5hvN6MGnNKGNugLUqtqKn9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"2017e470-d16a-4fd3-811f-b5d0542d5e81","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As the technology progressed, there were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8tLm-GNmk\">gasoline-powered motors</a> that moved a central agitator in a metal tub to clean the clothing. It was then transferred by hand to a rinsing bin and sent through a hand-crank wringing device to extract water before being hung on a clothesline. Each item had to go through the wringer or mangle separately. Eventually inventors were able to combine washing and extracting into one machine that could also fill and drain water on its own.

That means they are at least 20 percent more energy efficient than the minimum required federal standard. Many of these machines go far beyond the Energy Star level. If you want to save money over the life of your machine, you should pay attention to other energy stats as well, including the estimated annual operation cost, power cost, water cost and water usage. The DOE also provides information about average water used per wash and the water factor (WF), which is the number of gallons per cycle, per cubic foot. The lower the WF, the better.","A fair amount of energy efficiency is determined by the size of the machine – if the washer has a smaller wash drum, it will use less water and power. As such, it is definitely worth buying the smallest machine that accommodates your needs. However, the correlation is not always exact. We saw many machines of roughly the same capacity that have quite different energy efficiency numbers. See our energy scores for more information, and check out the <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-clothes-washers/results\">DOE&#39;s site</a> for specifics about energy efficient machines.  ","Wash Cycles &amp; Options<br/>More cycles are generally better, but look at the types of wash options, too. If you plan to use cloth diapers for your baby, for instance, you will want a sanitize cycle. If you have athletes in your household, you may want a heavy-duty cycle that can power through stains. We gave higher scores to machines that have <a href=\"http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/appliances/washers-dryers\">NSF</a>-certified cycles. This means they can reduce 99.9 percent of microorganisms without carryover to future loads.","Design &amp; Dimensions<br/>Before shopping, measure the space you have available for your washer. Even if you have a tiny laundry room, you can find innovative features on a compact unit. The best compact washers offer design features so you won&#39;t feel like you have to sacrifice functionality for size.","Warranty<br/>A washing machine represents a significant investment, so look for one with strong coverage from the manufacturer, especially on the motor. You should be able to count on the most expensive part of the washing machine for years to come.","<strong>Impressive Upgrades</strong>","We compared some great machines that cost right around the average price of the most popular models at Home Depot, Lowe&#39;s and Best Buy. However, some of the best rated front-load washers are outside the average shopper&#39;s budget. If you have more to spend, you might want to take a look at some of these upscale options. They have impressive, unique upgrades that might be worth it.","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8900250-10943755?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sears.com%2Fsamsung-5.5-total-cu-ft-flexwash-8482-washer-black%2Fp-02646705000P\">Samsung FlexWash</a> models have a separate small washing machine on top of the main one. They also scored high when tested by independent facilities like Consumer Reports and CNET. You can simultaneously run loads in the top and bottom washer or just throw in a quick load up top, for example after a workout. While this feature would be wasted in a small household, it might really pay off if you routinely have large laundry piles.","The LG <a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8900250-10943755?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sears.com%2Flg-4.5-cu-ft-ultra-large-capacity-front%2Fp-02645883000P\">WM5000HVA </a>is another pricey machine that might really be worth it. It has a smaller machine under the main washer for tiny loads. It also cleaned well in unbiased testing and has great energy efficiency numbers.","<strong>What Size Washer Do I Need for a King-Size Comforter?</strong>","Maybe your old machine didn&#39;t fit your comforter, which meant a trip to the laundromat when it was time to wash it. One of the most common answers we found to this question online is you need about 3.8 cubic feet to fit a king-size comforter, but that might be a little too small, according to our research. Lots of cleaning experts also list 4.5 cubic feet and larger as the proper size for cleaning a king-size comforter. However, even that may be too small.","&#34;The question is not just can you fit it in but also can you clean it properly,&#34; said Peters. &#34;The testing that we do is around actually cleaning the comforter in different capacities.&#34;","One basic standard Kenmore has established is that any machine over 4.5 cubic feet in capacity can properly clean a queen-size bedding set – comforter, sheets and pillow cases. A washing machine over 5.2 cubic feet can clean a king-size set. Machines over 4.5 cubic feet can fit a king-size comforter, but they might not clean it quite as thoroughly, Peters said.","The answer may depend on the type of comforter you have, too. A really bulky one might not have enough room to get clean in a 4.5-cubic-foot model, but a thinner one might be just fine. Consider what type of bedding you have. We recommend you buy a machine with at least 4.5 cubic feet of space for any king-size comforter, with more space for bulkier comforters.","<strong>Proper Maintenance for Front-Load Washers</strong>","Front-load washers are notorious for smelling like mold and mildew. It may even deter you from buying a front load style of washer. But there are ways to keep the smells in check. It really is as simple as airing things out, maybe more than you are used to with a top-loading machine. There are three things that really need attention between uses.","The Gasket<br/>The seal around the machine&#39;s door has folds in it that need to be cleaned out on a regular basis or gross things will start to grow. Wipe it down with a paper towel or a rag often.","The Door<br/>Keep it open when you are not using the machine. This allows the tub to air out and helps keep it dry. Less moisture in general is a good thing for these machines.","The Detergent Tray<br/>Keep the air circulating around the detergent tray, too. Pull it out so air circulates through it, and remove it for a thorough cleaning regularly.","<strong>How Full Should a Front-Load Washer Be?</strong>","The answer to almost any question you have about your washing machine is to follow manufacturer instructions. However, many of the manuals we looked at don&#39;t actually address the overfill question directly – they simply list loading laundry and closing the door as steps in the process. A few of the manuals warn against overfilling your washer but have nothing about how much laundry it would take to do that. We also spoke with several manufacturers&#39; customer service departments to get a feel for the prevailing wisdom. We were told to leave room at the top, though no one got very specific.","Some washers have a fill line, but for those without one, we recommend you fill the drum no more than 80 percent full. There has to be adequate room to move water through the clothing. If you stuff the wash basin too full, there won&#39;t be room for proper agitation and clothing will not come clean. Overloading your washer not only leads to rewashing loads that didn’t get clean, but it can also cause undue stress and wear on the motor.","<strong>Can I Wash One Item in a Washing Machine?</strong>","Information abounds about why stuffing your washer too full is bad – wear and tear on the motor, clothes do not get fully clean, etc. But you may also wonder how small load sizes impact your washer. There is a fair amount of suspicion that tiny loads are also bad for your machine. We scoured the internet to find some answers. Here is what we can tell you:"]},"id":"41527ebf-b4cc-4088-9770-6f3ac8eab3f2","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Small loads are somewhat bad for top-loading machines.

You use almost the same amount of energy to wash a large load as you do a small load, so it makes sense to run full loads simply for the savings, in both water and energy."],"type":"ul"},"id":"d01caee1-1ee8-45c3-82f9-6cc406c52e23","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Can Vinegar Damage Your Washing Machine?</strong>","Vinegar has sometimes been given credit for cleaning super powers. It is so appealing to use something natural instead of a bunch of store-bought chemicals, and it is economical. Vinegar has its limits, though. It is an acidic liquid that is produced through fermentation. That acidity means it can be helpful for cutting through grease and grime in some settings. But that same acidity has been credited with breaking down seals and hoses on washing machines and dishwashers, capable of pitting and eventually weakening them.","We asked a few manufacturers and some of them recommended using vinegar, at least for running it in a clothing-free load periodically to clear out soap residue. Others warned against it, citing potential damage to stainless steel tubs. Cleaning experts online seemed divided on the question as well. There were mentions of vinegar&#39;s power to boost colors and remove odors when added to normal loads but there were also warnings about acidity and its ability to break down soft surfaces. The safest bet is to follow manufacturer instructions regarding vinegar use.","We recommend vinegar as a solid option for both cleaning the seals and tub cleaning. Make sure you run a washcloth with just water over the seals after you use the vinegar, though, and run a water-only cycle after a vinegar cycle just to play it safe.","<strong>Front-Load Washer Detergent Tips</strong>","If you are switching over to a front-loading machine for the first time, you may wonder what laundry detergent is appropriate for these machines. The modern front-load machine is so different in every way from the old top loader you may be replacing. For one thing, the modern front-loading machine uses much less water.

Shelves are lined with HE choices. Less water means that using normal detergent creates too many suds. You will end up with soap in your clothing after running a cycle. That is why high efficiency detergent is so helpful.","Use less – The relatively small amounts of detergent recommended for a front-loading machine may seem odd at first, but you really don&#39;t need much. Usually just a tablespoon or two will do, depending on how hard your water is.  ","Use pods and powder properly – Popular detergent pods can be used in the high efficiency setting of a modern front-load washer. Just make sure you put them on the bottom of the wash drum. Placing them on top of clothing might make it hard for enough water to reach them and dissolve them fully. Placing pods in a dispenser drawer won&#39;t work either.

Detergents with a reputation for coating fabrics include homemade soaps and some eco-friendly detergents. Fabric softeners can also coat fabrics over time. The results of stripping a load, generally a bathtub full of murky water, can be disturbing yet satisfying. It&#39;s even more alarming when you strip a load of light items and the water still turns dark. Stripping comes down to five steps:","<br/>1.       Start with clean clothing and bedding right out of the washer.<br/>2.       Fill your bathtub or another container with hot water.<br/>3.       Add mineral removal solution and dissolve. The mineral removal solution can be a few different things. There are commercial options: Grovia pods or RLR.

That way you have only the footprint of the washer to accommodate. If you want to save even more space there is nothing better than a <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">washer dryer combination</a>. These are still considered a foreign concept to many people in the U.S., who often have sprawling laundry rooms and are just more used to having a separate washer and dryer. If you live in a smaller dwelling, though, these machines can be a lifesaver. Even if you just want to simplify your life they might be a good idea, especially if you ask Atul Vir, Founder and President of Equator Advanced Appliances, maker of a few washer dryer combo brands, including Deco. He&#39;s been wondering why Americans have two separate machines since he moved to the states from Europe decades ago. Stopping your day to move a load from the washer to the dryer strikes him as unnecessary. At least some of the reason people do it is just habit.","He recognizes there are reasons besides habit that washer dryer combos are still somewhat rare in the U.S. Until very recently the capacity of most combos was much smaller than washer and dryer sets. Also, combos are not known for drying as well as they wash, leaving clothing wrinkled.

Pay attention to the label, though. You can ruin some couch cushion covers in the washing machine. The same is true of blankets and throws – most are fine, but check the label.","Rugs – Even those with rubber backing can be washed safely in the machine, though the rubberized portion will wear out after a while.","Sneakers &amp; Running Shoes – Yes. And No. Sneakers are fine, though it&#39;s best if you throw a towel in to act as a buffer. Running shoes really should not go in the washer, though. They are so carefully designed, and a harsh cycle could change some of the features that make them comfortable for running.","Pillows – Most pillows can be washed in your machine – even down pillows, with a little caution. However, you shouldn&#39;t wash memory foam pillows in your machine, since a wash cycle can materially change the feel of memory foam.","Embellished Items – Backpacks and formalwear with a lot of glitter or glue-ons will not do well in a typical wash cycle.
