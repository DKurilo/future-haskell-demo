This machine has a large showerhead for distributing water more evenly over the coffee grounds than other units. The large showerhead is designed to encourage uniform extraction and better saturation than machines that send water through the grinds in a much more concentrated stream of water. Also, the filter basket is flat instead of pointed like most others in our drip coffee maker reviews. This encourages more even extraction, too, by giving the water a chance to reach the grounds around the edge more and to stay there long enough to saturate them.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57921-bonavita-8-cup7.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8eGMMd6q9FXRXAKRDv7D4.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"o8eGMMd6q9FXRXAKRDv7D4","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8eGMMd6q9FXRXAKRDv7D4.jpg","alt":""},"id":"0106d6c9-a218-4feb-9b67-331158abaf39","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is not the machine for you if you value a lot of bells and whistles.
