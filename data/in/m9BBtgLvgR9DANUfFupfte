You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Mr. Coffee ECM250 <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a> allows you to brew cappuccinos, lattes and espresso in the convenience of your own kitchen. Now you can wander to the kitchen when you first wake up and make your own espresso instead of getting dressed and heading down to the coffee shop. With its sleek black body and stainless steel accents, this little machine will look nice sitting on your countertop.","This cappuccino maker will make four cups of espresso at one time. Because it has 750 watts of power, you will have to wait a few minutes for the machine to heat up enough to produce the steam necessary to create a steaming cup of cappuccino. However, the wait will still be under 5 minutes. Even better,  you can make your own espresso in your own kitchen – you do not even have to get out of your pajamas in order to get your morning brew. Because you are making it in your own kitchen, you can also make it exactly the way you like it, instead of relying on a barista to make it to your specifications.","Now you can have the convenience of making lattes right in your own home since this espresso machine also comes with a steam wand for frothing milk. This frother is also removable, which will make it much easier to clean after each use.  This cappuccino maker also comes with a removable drip tray for quick and easy cleanup.","Because this espresso maker has a removable filter, it will be easy for you to add the espresso and tamp it. Tamping is an important part of espresso making because for such a rich flavor, the espresso grounds must be concentrated. A removable filter is also important for cleanup. Having the ability to remove the filter will allow you to thoroughly clean the filter itself, and it will give you access to better clean the nozzles and the machine itself.","This espresso machine also comes with an illuminated on/off switch so you will know whether the machine is on with only a quick glance. Another feature we like about this espresso machine is that it comes with cord storage. This is a great feature to have if you plan to move this espresso machine in and out of the cupboard. You will not have to worry about the cord getting in the way.","The people at Mr. Coffee want you to be happy with your product. They offer a great listing of FAQs on their website that covers everything from why cappuccino may come out cold to the proper method for frothing milk. They also offer instruction manuals available on their website, as well as a toll free telephone number and an email address for customer service."]},"id":"7f2edbe3-21bf-4217-8df0-17a92e22b214","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"be3b1e16-f71d-4ca6-aa48-9188dcbc4e9b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Mr. Coffee ECM250</strong> is an espresso maker that will make your busy life a bit simpler, saving you time by brewing your espresso at home.
