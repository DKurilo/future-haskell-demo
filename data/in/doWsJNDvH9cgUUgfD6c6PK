You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Marantz is a company that has been around making upper-mid range to high-end audio equipment for quite a number of years. It was a bit surprising when they didn&#39;t match up better in the same price range as their competition. Sure, you can pay more for a similar one that has everything that the others have but why would you? They either need to drop their prices a bit or up the capabilities and features of this <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receiver</a> if they want to be a better candidate.","That Marantz NR1501 is one of those upper-mid range systems that we mentioned. It doesn&#39;t quite meet the standards of high-end since it&#39;s missing so much. It does well in some areas but bombs in others.  A good example is the overall performance of it.","At first glance you see that the Marantz NR1501 has a signal-to-noise ratio of 100dB, just like most of the other AV receivers that we reviewed. The range of frequencies that it can handle goes from 8Hz to 100kHz. The level of harmonic distortion is 0.08%, which is average. The amount of power consumed is 250 watts, and that is pretty decent. However, despite all that looking good, the output per channel is only 50 watts. That is only about half of the leading AV receivers that we reviewed.","With only half of the output, it&#39;s easier to pull out low noise and distortion levels. The problem is that you lose out on a lot of the power that you want with a surround sound system. The whole point is to rock your world and low wattage per channel takes away from the potential of your system. A 50 watt system isn&#39;t uncommon but if you&#39;re going to spend three to four hundred dollars on an AV receiver, there is no sense in settling for something with less potential.","For the most part the input and output ports are fairly standard. There are a few missing that we would have liked to have seen, especially for the price that Marantz is asking for this AV receiver. The first of the main two we would have liked on this AV receiver is satellite radio. As people get more and more caught up in high definition, we wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see more people jump into satellite radio as well. Satellite radio is known for HD transmissions and hundreds of stations for your enjoyment. Despite the extra cost, this form of radio is growing more all the time. By not having a port that gives you access to it, you somewhat limit the people that would consider buying this AV receiver.","For similar reasons it surprised us to find that the Marantz NR1501 doesn&#39;t have speaker connections for a separate zone. Multi-room connections are becoming more popular due to the networking capabilities that we have nowadays. Although most AV receivers around this price, with this ability, are limited to stereo sound in the second room, they are still quite useful. These systems allow you to put on a movie for your kid&#39;s slumber party while you relax in your room and listen to music or your favorite audio book. Although most people probably don&#39;t base their purchasing decision on these two factors, having them only looks better for you and widens your targeted audience.","This AV receiver has most of the major audio formats from Dolby Digital and DTS. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t any THX, and it doesn&#39;t have Dolby Pro Logic IIz, only Pro Logic IIx which is the previous version. This isn&#39;t a huge deal for most since they are nearly the same but it is still outdate technology on a newer AV receiver.","The real problem is that it is missing so many other common features as well. We already mentioned the lack of multi-zone speakers and satellite radio, but there isn&#39;t any iPod-specific compatibility like the rest we reviewed. There also isn&#39;t any 1080p video scaling, an equalizer or Bluetooth."]},"id":"0cd691fe-e772-4bf1-89d5-32212cd32bff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"34845bb3-c8f0-4dfb-8dd1-649b90dfa3b6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Marantz NR1501</strong>, for the time being, isn&#39;t the best option available.
