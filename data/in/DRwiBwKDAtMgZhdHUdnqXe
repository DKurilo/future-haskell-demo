You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Once upon a time, Lycos was one of the largest search engines on the internet. Then Google changed all of that when it took over the search engine world. However, Lycos still offers a host of services, one of which is free email services. Lycos’ <a href=\"/best-free-email-services\">free email service</a> is basic at best, though, and its lack of features held it back in our ranking.","Lycos&#39; free email interface is quite easy to use. If you&#39;ve had an email address in the past, you will have no trouble whatsoever figuring out how to use this service. All the features, such as the inbox, spam folder, trash, contacts and calendar, are all exactly where you&#39;d expect them to be and function precisely the way you would anticipate. There isn&#39;t a whole lot of innovation going on in the interface – it&#39;s pretty basic.","The features are also standard for services in this category. Lycos provides 3GB of email storage space, which isn&#39;t much at all – you&#39;ll likely find yourself running out of space in your inbox quickly and have to delete emails regularly.","Lycos has a spam filter with the choice of three strengths: off, on and exclusive. Exclusive spam filtering is the equivalent of using blacklists and whitelists. You can place certain contacts on your blacklist to make it so you don&#39;t receive email from them, while contacts you place on your whitelist will always get through the spam filter.","One of its other security features is the ability for you to create aliases. An alias lets you keep your primary email address masked by allowing emails to automatically forward to a different inbox. The alias email address also shows up as the account you&#39;re using when you send emails.","While the basics of email are covered, Lycos Mail seems to be a bit behind in the features department. There is no POP support, and while you can log in from your mobile web browser, there is no mobile app to help streamline your access. Lycos doesn&#39;t offer IMAP support either, so you can&#39;t access your emails from your phone or tablet&#39;s mail app.","This is not one of the free email service providers that has social media integration. Lycos does not offer chat functions or provide a way to import your social contacts. The only media option we found was to have your RSS feed subscriptions show up in your inbox."]},"id":"e2005a1a-c7de-4ee2-9688-5b24d2bb6805","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f874ebaf-ac98-4d4d-855e-13b72d6d4057","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Lycos Mail offers a handful of basic features for your personal email account.
