You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Pioneer ND-BC4 is a <a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">rear view camera</a> designed to work with the in-dash display already installed in your car. It provides a clear, crisp picture at a decent resolution. It&#39;s small, compact and easily mounts on your vehicle. It has a decently wide viewing angle that allows you to see objects and obstacles that you might miss in your rearview mirrors. It also possesses luminance control that allows drivers to adjust the camera to capture available light. It connects to your in-dash display via a 6-meter RCA cable.","One of the first things we look for when we review rear view cameras is whether they come with their own monitor. The Pioneer ND-BC4 does not have a display to call its own. However, that isn&#39;t a deal breaker because many vehicles rolling off assembly lines these days have multiple monitors and displays. The Pioneer ND-BC4 is compatible with any of these screens, as long as they accept an RCA connection.","If the vehicle you own lacks an onboard monitor, there are options available to make the Pioneer ND-BC4 work for you. Third-party monitors and displays are available, many of which you can install directly into your dashboard, and others that sit atop the dash on a pedestal. Just make sure that whichever third-party monitor you buy accepts an RCA connection.","The camera itself is a decent piece of equipment. The resolution of the images it captures tops out at 491 x 512 pixels. That&#39;s another statistic to consider if you&#39;re buying a third-party display to use with this rear view camera. The signal-to-noise ratio of the Pioneer ND-BC4 is the standard 40dB, which means that you won&#39;t have a problem with static or visual distortion from the camera.","The viewing angle of the Pioneer ND-BC4 is a wide 135 degrees. While this is by no means the widest on our side-by-side comparison chart, it&#39;s sufficient to augment your rearview mirrors. It also assists you with parallel parking. With this rear view camera mounted on the back of your vehicle, you can see exactly how much room you have to work with so you don&#39;t have a fender bender on a busy city street.","One of the standout features of the Pioneer ND-BC4 is its luminance control. This feature allows you to harness all the available light to get the best picture possible. For example, you can adjust the luminance to capture more light at night so you have effective visuals when the sun goes down.","Pioneer includes a detailed manual, a mount and an installation kit with the ND-BC4. Couple that with the 6 meters of RCA cable and you have all you need to install this rear view camera on your vehicle. If you decide to install it yourself, take the time to make sure you are doing it correctly. Installing third-party electrical devices in your car can be a perilous task if you don&#39;t fully comprehend the mechanics involved."]},"id":"78db79fd-bb4a-439b-baca-de8fa7a67ca3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f2411811-926d-48cd-aa78-d08044fa9966","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have an in-dash monitor or display but no rear view camera, the <strong>Pioneer ND-BC4</strong> is an elegant and discreet solution.
