This <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof camera</a> is effective, durable and takes great photos. Its sleek design looks at home in a suitcase, a fancy restaurant, on a beach towel or at a party. This camera is waterproof up to 16 feet and shockproof up to 5 feet.

The camera features a 3-inch LCD touchscreen display. The touchscreen feature is modern, but users with bigger fingers may have problems pressing the icons and may have to backtrack to change the settings they want. We recommend implementing a cover for the touchscreen to protect it further when using the camera in and around water. A screen protector will also prevent scratches from keys and other objects in your pocket or purse.","At a width of less than 4 inches and a weight of just 4.2 ounces, the Cyber-Shot DSC-TX20 is one of the smallest waterproof digital cameras we reviewed. It is small enough to easily slip into a purse or pocket and take anywhere.","The sliding front cover seemed a bit flimsy. It did not seem particularly strong; if you drop the camera, it might chip or break. Sand can easily become lodged between the cover and the camera, which may in turn cause grinding and scratches. You can prevent this by rinsing off your camera to remove any sand or dirt.","Overall, the Cyber-Shot DSC-TX20 has a slim and sporty design that is ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. Because it is waterproof to a depth of 16 feet, you can safely use it in the deep end of the pool, though you may need to exercise caution when scuba diving. However, since no waterproof camera is ever truly waterproof, we recommend using an underwater camera case when you know the camera will get wet."]},"id":"7c97687d-0a3f-497d-99a3-62560f3cce56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"7e8a9072-1b15-4ecd-a2ed-280e7adb3791","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/4evxzYxxV8agic9JyuFbrT.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Cyber-Shot DSC-TX20 comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and charging cable.
