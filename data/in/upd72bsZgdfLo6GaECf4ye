There are numerous benefits to renting an apartment, but there are also some downfalls. If you re trying to decide the best course of action, consider the following pros and cons. If in the end you do choose to go with an <a href=\"/\">apartment finder</a> site make sure to look through our reviews to find the best one for your needs.","<strong>Pros:</strong>","One of the best benefits of renting an apartment is that they re generally less expensive than renting a house. Many times, some of the utilities will be paid by the managers or owners when you rent an apartment, saving even more money. There are also other things that are typically taken care of with an apartment that you ll have to do on your own with a house, such as maintenance and lawn care. If something breaks in your apartment, you simply dial the maintenance man s number and have him come and take a look.","Many apartment complexes have amenities that you will not have if you rent a house, such as a pool, tennis court, laundry services and even community gems. Most of these items are available to you at no extra charge. Generally, rental apartments also provide appliances like refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers and even washers and dryers. However, rental homes may require you to supply your own, which can be expensive if you don t already own these items.","<strong>Cons:</strong>","While there are many advantages to renting an apartment, there are also some downfalls. With an apartment, you generally don t have the privacy that you do with a single-family home. It s easy to hear noises from apartments beside you, upstairs, or downstairs. You generally have a limited number of parking spaces, so parties and get-togethers are more difficult. You won t get your own yard, although you may get a shared space where you can place things like barbecue grills, patio furniture, etc.","Another disadvantage of renting an apartment is felt most by those with pets. Apartments typically charge non-refundable pet deposits and there is less room for larger animals to exercise outdoors. This may mean you ll have to take Fido to the local dog park or walking track. Being so close to other residents limits the things you can do. For instance, in a rented house it s possible to practice your guitar or have louder parties whereas if you do these things in an apartment, your neighbors may complain about the noise.","Speaking of neighbors, it s easy to get ones that don t mesh well with you when you live in an apartment complex. Sure, this can happen to you in a rental house as well, but in apartments it s more difficult to steer clear of them.","As you can see, there are disadvantages and advantages to renting an apartment. It s important to analyze these and determine what you need most from your home before deciding what to do.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"bfcb464b-9aa4-4139-b18f-2ca048dd6516","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4753","url":"/pros-and-cons-of-renting-an-apartment","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kristi-carter","url":"/author/kristi-carter","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kristi Carter","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"ocdh7EzQoWJySdmVX2bDaL","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-12T04:34:55Z","datePublished":"2010-08-12T04:34:55Z","name":"Pros and Cons of Renting an Apartment","synopsis":"As with anything, it’s important to weigh the pros and cons of renting an apartment before doing so.
