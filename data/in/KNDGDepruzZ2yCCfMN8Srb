The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printers</a>Â here.</em>","The Samsung ProXpress is the best laser printer series for a home office. All of these printers are compact and built tough, so any one of them will be able to handle jobs ranging from weekly payroll and monthly invoicing to basic mailers. Each printer has a toner yield of 3,000, so you won&#39;t have to continually replace expensive toner cartridges.","The M3320nd monochrome laser printer can handle printing up to 50,000 pages per month. This is a sure sign that this laser printer is built to last. It is very fast, taking only 6.5 seconds to warm up and printing 35 pages per minute. Unfortunately, all that speed requires a lot of power: the Samsung ProXpress uses 700 watts each time it prints.","The ProXpress M3320nd black and white laser printer has 128MB of standard memory. This is enough to support more than one computer networking to the same printer. However, the memory cannot be expanded, so this is all the memory the printer can have. It is enough to hold multiple projects within its queue. It is also enough to automatically print on both sides of pages, which is also called duplexing, if you need to.","The quality of the ProXpress laser printer is pretty good. Its resolution is 1,200dpi, which is double the standard resolution for laser printers. Some of the best laser printers have a higher resolution, but the images and text printed by the M3320nd are very clear. This is especially impressive since it is pretty compact, at only 14 inches wide and weighing in at just a bit more than 20 pounds.","The Samsung ProXpress laser printer series is compatible with most Windows operating platforms. It will also work smoothly with Mac and Linux systems. If you find you have difficulties connecting to your printer or if you need other troubleshooting help, Samsung has several options to choose from. Its website includes user guides to download and a FAQs section to search through. You can also receive one-on-one customer service by both email and telephone."]},"id":"7f58f876-c0a4-4e3d-afd4-8b23c5ea4062","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"81b9cdc6-7221-41c5-b531-20bd143a7987","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung ProXpress M3320nd is built to last and can print up to 50,000 sheets each month.
