Unfortunately, this air purifier is supposed to work in medium-sized rooms. When compared to similar air filters, the 203 offers weak purification and little convenience. Also, much of the filtration comes from an always-on ionizer that sends electromagnetically charged particles back into the air. Although the Blueair 203 is small and quiet, it is an underwhelming machine.","The Blueair 203 can use one of two filters. The cheaper Particle Filter traps allergens such as dust and pollen. The more expensive SmokeStop filter also offers good allergen cleaning and can capture odors and gases. Either filter is part of the Blueair 203&#39;s three-stage purification. First, large particles get caught in the pre-filter. Next, the particle filter or the SmokeStop filter captures fine pollutants. Finally, the ionizer charges the air and sends negatively charged particles back into the air. When the electromagnetically charged ions pass through the filters, they are easier to capture and clean.","However, the EPA states that ionizers are ineffective. Fortunately, while most ionizers produce a small amount of ozone, the Blueair 203 is certified by the California Air Resources Board for low- to no ozone emissions.","The Blueair 203 could be a strong contender as a compact air purifier if it offered more filtration and convenience. Other always-on ionizing air filters offer some kind of operation scheduler or timer for set-and-forget convenience. This air purifier also lacks an air-quality sensor and auto mode. While these features are not absolutely necessary, they help make the air purifier easier to live with.","Blueair offers a full range of support on the website. There are links to several resources and articles, as well as downloadable owner manuals and FAQs. Customer support agents are available by email, phone and live chat. The weakest part of the 203&#39;s support is its one-year warranty. This is especially problematic when compared to other Blueair products that have five-year warranties."]},"id":"22ceee14-e80d-47fc-b85a-3126d8704cb1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"324c9316-d71d-4424-a60c-cb54855bef3b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Blueair 203 is a compact air purifier best suited for small rooms.
