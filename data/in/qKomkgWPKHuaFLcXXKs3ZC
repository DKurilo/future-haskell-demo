Although it allows you to see thermal information and measure accurate temperatures, its low cost comes at the expense of image quality and additional features.","The E4&#39;s detector produces images with a resolution of 80 x 60 pixels. This resolution, while it fails to meet the RESNET (Residential Energy Services Network) standards, provides enough detail to analyze general areas for potential problems. Problems like large gaps in insulation, serious leaks in windows or doors, or overheating generators should be visible on the camera, although more intricate details will be missing.","The visible-light camera somewhat makes up for this lack of resolution by capturing higher-resolution images and pairing them with the infrared images. Although a higher-resolution thermal detector is more accurate, this method grants you the clarity of a visible-light photograph with the helpful information of a basic infrared image.","The focus point on the E4 is fixed, so you have to adjust your distance to the subject to produce the sharpest images. The lens is optimized to have the largest distance possible in focus, so this shouldn&#39;t be a major problem.","The E4 saves images in a standard JPG format, with no radiometric data embedded, so building reports and analyzing images with FLIR&#39;s software won&#39;t provide you the wealth of information that you would get with FLIR&#39;s more expensive thermal cameras. However, the images are still useful for identifying general problem areas.","Despite its low cost, this thermal-imaging camera is engineered just as durably as any of FLIR&#39;s other thermographic cameras, and it&#39;s covered by the exact same warranty. With its durable, rubberized outer shell, it can withstand falls of up to 6.6 feet. Its warranty covers the detector for 10 years, the battery for five, and the parts and labor for two.","On FLIR&#39;s website, you can easily find support for the E4. Its product page offers calibration information and several documents on the E4 and thermography in general. If you can&#39;t find answers to your questions here, you can get more specific information via phone and email support."]},"id":"9c9fd1d9-44cd-4c24-a3a3-c6adb90396eb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"242e19ff-9427-4581-8767-2180a3bed80b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["FLIR&#39;s E4 is an inexpensive option for discovering general problem areas using infrared technology.
