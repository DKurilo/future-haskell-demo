Regular tubs can make this difficult if you have a long-term injury, arthritis or another condition that makes some movements painful. This is a basic <a href=\"/best-walk-in-tubs\">walk-in bathtub</a> with several safety features that makes it ADA-compliant and easy for almost anyone with limited mobility to use. As a safe step tub, it includes a low threshold where the door opens so you can easily step in. The textured floor prevents slips, whether it&#39;s wet or dry. This model also includes a grab bar to help with stability.","The built-in seat is 17 inches high and 23 inches wide, making it easy to sit down for a bath and stand up afterward. This Ariel walk-in tub is sturdy with its stainless steel support frame and reinforced fiberglass shell. It&#39;s finished with a high-gloss coat that&#39;s easy to clean. You also get your choice of right or left drain, so you can be sure that it fits in your bathtub alcove without the need for extra plumbing. Like all walk-in tubs, this Ariel model has a watertight door with a handle that&#39;s simple for anyone to secure.","This walk-in bathtub can easily fit in your existing bathtub space, because it&#39;s the standard size of a regular bathtub at 60 inches long and 30 inches wide. Its sleek design works with almost any bathroom decor, but it&#39;s only available in white.","Although this is an excellent tub for those with limited mobility, it isn&#39;t necessarily a handicap bathtub. The position of the seat and the door would make it difficult for someone to transfer themselves from a wheelchair to the tub. It also doesn&#39;t include extras such as air jets or water jets, which can provide soothing massages, as part of the basic package. If youâ€™re in the market for wheelchair-accessible walk-in tub, the <a href=\"/ameriglide-review\">AmeriGlide Sanctuary</a> is a good choice.","As for the cost of the safe step tub, this Ariel model is one of the most affordable on the market. If you order it directly from the manufacturer, you can get add-ons such as aerotherapy and hydrotherapy jets, but this makes the price much higher."]},"id":"23528212-2600-49a2-8806-8b8102dac589","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68020","url":"/ariel-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
