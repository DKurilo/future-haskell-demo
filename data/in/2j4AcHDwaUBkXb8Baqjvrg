Like a humidifier, mold and mildew can build up","quickly where water is stored, and any impurities inside the machine can get dispersed into the air.","Clean the intake and exhaust grills at least once a season with a vacuum and brush attachment to help improve the longevity of your dehumidifier.","Place the dehumidifier at least 6 inches from the wall, so the exhaust isn’t blocked, and keep it in a room that’s at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent damaging motor. Some dehumidifiers are designed for lower temperatures, but not all are.","Regularly check the humidistat and adjust it when necessary to keep the humidity levels between a safe 40 and 50 percent.","To protect the compressor, make sure that whenever you turn off the device you allow at least 10 minutes before turning it back on."],"type":"ul"},"id":"34ae1843-7c09-4859-810c-835686fde535","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What to Look for in a Dehumidifier</strong>","Daily Moisture Outtake &amp; Collection Reservoir Size<br/>If you want a whole-home or basement dehumidifier, you need a high-capacity unit that can remove at least 70 pints of water a day. The collection reservoir should also factor into your decision. In general, a large collection tank is a good idea. Unfortunately, none of the dehumidifiers we reviewed have a collection reservoir as large as the moisture outtake, so occasionally dumping collected water is expected. However, you can buy a hose from the manufacturer to attach to your dehumidifier for continuous drainage to a nearby drain.","Room Size<br/>Room size also determines the dehumidifier you need. For a bathroom or bedroom, choose a portable dehumidifier that can be positioned in an area where it isn’t a safety hazard. As with all electrical equipment in bathrooms, keep the unit away from the sources of running water.","Noise Levels<br/>Noise, measured in decibels, matters if you plan to run the dehumidifier nonstop. For context, a level of 50 decibels is about as loud as a running refrigerator, while 70 decibels equal the sound of a vacuum cleaner. Danby makes the quietest room dehumidifier in our review; it has a noise level of only 50 decibels.","Safety First<br/>Over the past five years, there have been several dehumidifier recalls because of possible overheating, smoking or catching fire. While there are risks in owning and using a dehumidifier, several design features and smart practices can reduce hazards. The most important safety feature is an automatic shut-off, which turns off the unit when the collection reservoir is full so the machine doesn’t continue to run and overheat.","Auto defrost is another good safety feature. When the evaporator coils inside a dehumidifier get too cold, they can freeze and keep the unit from running properly, which can make it overheat. Auto defrost turns off the compressor, so the dehumidifier’s fan pulls in warmer air to heat the coils. Once they reach a safe temperature, the compressor turns back on to resume collecting moisture.<br/><br/>Pricing<br/>The dehumidifiers we looked at range between $200 - $350.  The most powerful models, that dehumidify a large space of about 4,000 square feet, often have a higher price tag. However, if you live in an apartment, or are trying to dehumidify a space of 1,500 square feet or less, you can find good dehumidifiers for less than $200.","The Sunpentown SD52PE is one such dehumidifier with a good feature package that you can usually buy for less than $200. While it’s not as powerful as the best humidifiers, it uses less energy than most, which accounts for its Energy Star rating. It has a built-in drain pump that pushes excess water through a hose you attach to the drain spout, so you don’t have to buy a separate condensate pump.","It’s also a good idea to look for deals online. At the time of this writing, for instance, the DeLonghi DD50P was being sold through the Amazon Warehouse for $150 and it lists for more than twice that amount.","Warranties<br/>Every home dehumidifier we reviewed has both a parts warranty to cover the cost of any replacement parts and a labor warranty to cover defects caused during the manufacturing process. The industry standard is one year on these, though many manufacturers offer extended warranties.","Another warranty covers a dehumidifier’s sealed system, which includes the compressor, condenser coil, capillary, filter dryer and internal connecting tubing. A sealed-system warranty covers these specific parts longer than the traditional parts warranty, which covers the less-expensive parts in the unit. Sealed-system warranties last between four and five years, although not all dehumidifiers have one."]},"id":"59001eb7-e736-44bb-bb9c-db2d01b5ea50","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_76","url":"/best-dehumidifiers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-22T21:33:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-22T21:33:00Z","name":"Best Dehumidifiers of 2019","synopsis":"If you want a whole-home or basement dehumidifier, you need a high-capacity model that can remove at least 70 pints of water a day.","review":{},"strapline":"If you want a whole-home or basement dehumidifier, you need a high-capacity model that can remove at least 70 pints of water a day.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-07T04:48:20Z","id":"2j4AcHDwaUBkXb8Baqjvrg","meta":{"title":"Best Dehumidifiers 2019 - Basement and Whole Home Models","description":"If you want a whole-home or basement dehumidifier, you need a high-capacity model that can remove at least 70 pints of water a day."},"products":[{"slug":"keystone-kstad70b","url":"/product/keystone-kstad70b","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","name":"Keystone KSTAD70B","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"3dsDzr27f4xKEgzeoa2mcP","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"sunpentown-sd-52pe","url":"/product/sunpentown-sd-52pe","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","name":"Sunpentown SD-52PE","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"fgipbaX5FwNwocjsFZZrDP","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"friedrich-d70bp","url":"/product/friedrich-d70bp","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","name":"Friedrich D70BP","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"mY2kNwtbwpEpD93MVrWTd","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"danby-ddr070bdwdb","url":"/product/danby-ddr070bdwdb","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","name":"Danby DDR070BDWDB","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"q5EDd2qEysb84qHdCPfmve","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"frigidaire-fad704dwd","url":"/product/frigidaire-fad704dwd","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","name":"Frigidaire FAD704DWD","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"NgqWP5u4VBBoo4vZ8WQvJa","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/2bBf2nFjHQjT3jnfeFRKLN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Dehumidifiers-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/0/822132/original/_Hero-Dehumidifiers-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"2bBf2nFjHQjT3jnfeFRKLN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2bBf2nFjHQjT3jnfeFRKLN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Dehumidifiers of 2019","description":"If you want a whole-home or basement dehumidifier, you need a high-capacity model that can remove at least 70 pints of water a day."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/2bBf2nFjHQjT3jnfeFRKLN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Dehumidifiers-003.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/0/822132/original/_Hero-Dehumidifiers-003.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"2bBf2nFjHQjT3jnfeFRKLN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2bBf2nFjHQjT3jnfeFRKLN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Dehumidifiers of 2019","description":"If you want a whole-home or basement dehumidifier, you need a high-capacity model that can remove at least 70 pints of water a day."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-quality","url":"/health-and-beauty/air-quality","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","name":"Air Quality","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:28Z","id":"9XQeSF4Awfph4vGpgLPmkB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
