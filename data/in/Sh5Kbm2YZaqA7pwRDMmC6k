Unlike Grammarly, which uses red and green lines to indicate errors, Ginger highlights incorrect word and phrases in gray. As you add to your doc, the gray doesn’t follow the original text. Instead, it remains where it was first placed, now highlighting another, usually correct piece of writing.  Often, when I tried to correct an error by hovering over the highlighted section, it would take a few seconds for the clickable correction to appear."]},"id":"301ab052-efba-45fa-ad23-a031c976fbd5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Customization"},"id":"0ac05232-e583-4f27-a600-cd63defb287d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ginger’s premium program comes with a translator, but we didn’t find it to be any better than Google Translate, which you have access to for free.
