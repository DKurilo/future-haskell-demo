You’re most likely not going to be able to find your keys if you have no idea when they fell out of your pocket because those types of trackers depend on your being close enough to the tag for a Bluetooth signal to reach your phone. The Pocketfinder+, however, works using cell phone service, satellite and Wi-Fi, making it a lot easier to find your lost possessions no matter where you left them.<br/>Pocketfinder+ sells a car tracker, but we opted for the personal tracker. It is oval, black and weighs only 1.3 ounces. It comes attached to a key but its size – roughly that of a large car key fob – does make it a little cumbersome, especially if you have a lot of keys or several key fobs already. There is also a string of small metal rings between the tracker and the key ring and while they didn’t break or slip loose during our tests, we could see it happening. It is splashproof, so it will survive some wear and tear.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"0683baa4-3644-4f3d-ba00-5e5ea54f568a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58217","url":"/pocketfinder-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-19T16:59:09Z","datePublished":"2013-11-19T16:59:09Z","name":"Yepzon Pocketfinder+","synopsis":"While small tracking devices like the Tile Mate might be well-known and widely used, they work using a Bluetooth signal and therefore have a range.","review":{"rating":67,"verdict":"The Pocketfinder+ is a keychain GPS tracker, making it ideal for keeping track of your keys, bag or other personal belongings.","pros":["It&#8217;s a keychain."],"cons":["The charging cord we received was finicky."]},"strapline":"While small tracking devices like the Tile Mate might be well-known and widely used, they work using a Bluetooth signal and therefore have a range.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","id":"XV4aYsjDzEBknFAGM83oU9","meta":{"title":"PocketFinder Personal Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The PocketFinder has exceptional battery life.
