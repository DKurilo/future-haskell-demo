You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP Webcam HD-3110 has been on the market for some time and still manages to compete well with many other products in the same category. It lacks a few features we prefer to see, including one-click social networking uploads and audio effects, but this <a href=\"/best-webcams\">web camera</a> does capture high quality, high definition video at a rate of 30 frames per second.","HP provides you with ArcSoft Magic-i Visual Effects 2, an application that on its own would cost close to $40. The application allows you to add special effects to videos and chats by affixing a theme and altering frames. If there are settings you prefer to change for your profile, you have the power to customize them too.","Although we hoped for higher quality in the still-image resolution, HP provides 5.7MP, which is still a great deal higher than several other products we reviewed. You can take screenshots with the web cam while you video chat. Although you can&#39;t enlarge an image to poster size without it becoming overly pixilated, pictures maintain a good quality – comparable to a low-end digital camera.","Designed to be universally compatible, the HP Webcam HD-3110 has an adjustable clip that will attach it to any desktop or laptop computer monitor. The clip is designed to secure the camera to the top of the monitor, and it does a decent job of it.","There are three easy-access buttons located near the lens of the web cam for taking a snapshot, opening instant chat and recording a video. With many webcams, the features and tools are accessible solely through the software interface, and they are sometimes difficult to find. HP makes it easy, though. We like that.","HP has solid customer service options. Customer service answered our emails within 24 hours. The customer service representative was very helpful and adequately addressed our questions. Live chat support is not available in every circumstance, but we like having that option at times."]},"id":"62474943-7518-49e0-9d9b-0b0344f1d9f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9503ff68-1faf-417b-b92c-f4c4f6b952c4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This web camera falls a little short with its stills resolution and a few other issues, but it is a good product overall.
