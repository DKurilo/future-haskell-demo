However, like all the travel rewards cards we reviewed, it allows you to redeem points for international flights, and you aren&#39;t limited by blackout dates when you&#39;re making your travel arrangements.","You earn one point for every dollar you spend with this card. Unlike most of the cards we reviewed, there&#39;s no sign-up bonus that gives you a certain number of points if you spend a set dollar amount on purchases within the first three months of having your card.","You won’t have to worry about the points you earn expiring, and American Express doesn’t limit you on the amount of points you can earn. When you use your card for certain purchases, the following features automatically kick in: travel accident insurance, rental car insurance, 24/7 roadside assistance, purchase protection, extended product warranty and return protection. However, lost luggage reimbursement is not included as one of the additional features offered with this card.","The standard annual percentage rate with this card is a little higher than many frequent flyer credit cards currently charge. All purchases and balance transfer transactions come with a 17.24% to 22.24% Variable APR. Additionally, cash advance transactions are expensive, as they are held to a 25.24% Variable APR.","This card boasts a $0 annual fee, which is rare among travel rewards cards. . Its other fees are what you would expect and are on par with industry standard. This card can be used to transfer a balance or get a cash advance, but those transactions will incur a minimum $5 or 3% fee. Additionally, if you use this card when you’re traveling overseas, a 2.7% fee will be attached to every purchase.","American Express can be contacted via phone 24/7 or via its live chat function on its website. In the event that your card is lost or stolen, emergency card replacement is available. If you have questions about your card or its benefits, you can also reference the frequently asked questions listed on the company&#39;s website."]},"id":"e5fd1b43-5db6-4d35-8d21-b4b56fd2e69d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fa903b8f-0dec-4bda-aed2-0c91f83b3aa5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Blue Sky from American Express® card is an option to consider if you are looking for an air miles card with no annual fee that gives you the option to carry a balance.
