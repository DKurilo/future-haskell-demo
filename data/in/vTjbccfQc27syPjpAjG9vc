We used only the best quality ingredients – name-brand popcorn, butter, salt and oil, when called for – so each popcorn popper would be tested and evaluated in the same fashion. In addition, we used the same testing approach for each model by doing such things as timing the popping process carefully, examining it thoroughly by hand, and of course, tasting it.","We checked written materials about popcorn makers in general and carefully read the websites and consumer reviews for each of the poppers we tested. We also examined the fine print of warranties. We documented everything significant that we learned about each popcorn maker, and scored and ranked each accordingly.","We also considered cost when testing and evaluating popcorn makers, and we found models that perform very well at any price. For example, the roughly $20","popper does a fine job making tasty popcorn, even when compared to popcorn makers that cost almost double that sum. The higher priced models tend to yield greater amounts of popcorn, but if you don’t want to spend very much, a good, inexpensive machine might work quite well for your needs."]},"id":"62c9837c-0ffe-438f-a60e-eb490f037d7b","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How We Tested?</strong>","We made two batches of popcorn in each of our test models, following the manufacturer’s instructions. All popcorn and oil (if needed for a particular model) was carefully measured, and we timed how long each popcorn maker took to complete the job. Then we combed through the popcorn to find any burnt or unpopped kernels, picked them out of each batch, and carefully measured and documented them. We even gathered up unpopped kernels from inside the machine, on the kitchen countertop and on the floor in order to measure those. We scored those criteria based on an average for the three batches.","As far as such things as the length of the electrical cord and the dimensions, we didn’t just take the manufacturer’s word for it, but took our own measurements with a tape measure. We also evaluated how easy or difficult it was to clean and whether you got a recipe booklet or measuring cup with it. We checked to see whether plastic popcorn popper parts were free of the chemical compound BPA (bisphenol A), which some research indicates could be harmful to human health, although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers it safe at low levels.","Additionally, we examined the length of the warranty, as well as reading the fine print, looking at the number of ways you can contact customer support, checking to see if the manufacturer offered a FAQs section on its website and determining whether you get a user manual with the popper – either a paper booklet or online.  We also looked to see which manufacturers offer videos that show how to operate its popcorn popper.","<strong>How Much Do Popcorn Poppers cost?</strong>","We found that popcorn poppers vary in price with a typical price range going from less than $20 for a simple model to about $60 for a home model. Some people don’t mind splurging on big circus-style popcorn carts that cost hundreds of dollars, but most consumers tend to buy reasonably priced models.","<strong>What Is the Best Oil to Use in Popcorn Machines?</strong>","While you can potentially use any type of oil in your popcorn machine, you’re most likely going to use coconut oil or canola oil. Coconut oil contains more fat and cholesterol than canola oil but both make excellent popcorn.","For that classic buttery flavor, consider getting a flavored popcorn oil. Likewise, you can use plain coconut oil or canola oil seasoned with a butter-flavored salt such as Flavacol or a kettle corn seasoning for sweet popcorn.","Peanut oil is an excellent alternative to coconut and canola oil because it has a high burning point. You can also experiment with sunflower or soybean oil or try something more exotic such as avocado or walnut oil.","On the other hand, while olive oil is a healthy choice, makes a great vinaigrette for salads and works well for pan cooking, it has a low burning point and tends to be expensive. As such, you might not want to use it with a popcorn maker. However, you can combine it with other oils – for example, you could use peanut oil as the primary oil and add just a touch of olive oil.","It’s best to avoid using flaxseed oil and wheat germ oil since they aren’t supposed to be heated.
