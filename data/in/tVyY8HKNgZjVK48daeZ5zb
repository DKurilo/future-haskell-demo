The company manufactures a variety of models that range in price from just over $1,000 to less than $400, which makes them some of the least expensive dishwashers we reviewed. They’re also the most basic. So, if you don’t need a lot of extra features and want to save some cash while still getting your dishes clean, Frigidaire dishwashers are worth your consideration.","Depending on the model you buy, Frigidaire <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-dishwashers/\">dishwashers</a> have anywhere between two and seven wash cycles. Available cycles include Heavy, Normal, 30 Min Wash, China Crystal, Energy Saver and Rinse Only. Additionally, you can customize your wash cycles with options such as High, Sanitize, Air Dry, Spray and Scour. These combinations of cycles and options ensure your dishes get the washing treatment they need. Some Frigidaire dishwasher models even have a My Favorite option, which allows you to program your preferred settings for a quick start. Wash cycles and options vary from model to model, so if you have a specific need, make sure the one you buy has the option you want.","Frigidaire’s dishwashers have capacities ranging from 12 place settings on the low end to 14 on the high end. This should be enough to satisfy most of your dishwashing needs, but compared to other top dishwasher brands in our review, these machines come up a little short. The highest-capacity dishwasher we evaluated can clean up to 16 place settings in a single wash cycle.","The best dishwashers made by Frigidaire use the company’s trademarked OrbitClean technology. OrbitClean is a specially designed wash arm with an oscillating sprayer that can cover more area than a traditional dishwasher. These machines also use AquaSurge technology that allows you to regulate and customize water pressure. This gives you the ability to adjust the wash for anything from delicate dishes to hard, cooked-on messes.","The level of noise produced by Frigidaire dishwashers ranges from 47 to 62 decibels. While the noise probably won’t disturb you, these aren’t the quietest dishwashers available. Other top-rated dishwashers run as low as 39 decibels.","Almost all of Frigidaire’s dishwashers are ENERGY STAR qualified, which means they meet or exceed the Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines for energy efficiency. These machines can help reduce your carbon footprint and protect the environment.","If you’re looking for an economical dishwasher, Frigidaire is a great place to start your search. It offers some great options at very affordable prices. The company’s washing machines have decent capacity and an acceptable number of wash cycles and options. They’re not the quietest machines on the market, but they can get your dishes as clean as many of their more expensive competitors."]},"id":"900136aa-4624-4bbc-9a7b-6ad8be79b03d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56071","url":"/frigidaire-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-03-26T17:18:16Z","datePublished":"2013-03-26T17:18:16Z","name":"Frigidaire Dishwashers","synopsis":"Frigidaire dishwashers are both economical and efficient machines.
