It weighs less than 12 pounds. It features the same cyclonic technology as Hoover&#39;s larger machines, which gives the Nano Cyclonic very strong suction while protecting the motor and filter from dust and grit. It has a 12-inch cleaning path and a HEPA filter to reduce the amount of dust and allergens in your home.","The Nano Cyclonic is a great vacuum for a smaller space – such as a dorm room, condo or office – where a smaller stick vacuum isn&#39;t quite powerful enough to do the job. The power cord is 20 feet long, which is several feet shorter than most full-size machines. The stretch hose on the Nano is 5 feet long, which is also a bit shorter than other budget vacuums. The machine only weighs about 12 pounds, so it is light enough for most people to pick up and carry. Hoover provides a one-year warranty on this small vacuum.","The Nano achieves its small size with clever design. For example, the handle detaches and doubles as the wand and crevice tool. It also comes with a dusting brush for cleaning upholstery and other surfaces. It&#39;s important to note that the crevice tool is permanently attached to the wand. Because of this, the hand tools can&#39;t pick up any large debris.","You will need to empty the dirt cup on this machine each time you use it, but that task is easy and neat since it empties from the bottom with a button. An indicator lets you know when the cup is getting full. The HEPA filter is rinsable, so you won&#39;t have to buy replacements However, you&#39;ll need to check the filter monthly and rinse it when it becomes dirty.","This model does not have height adjustment capabilities, so if your carpets are deeper plush than average, you may not get optimal airflow and suction with this machine. The Nano features a handy brush roll switch on the base that allows you to turn the brush off and on when moving between rugs and bare floors.","The Hoover Nano can clean a wide variety of surfaces, and the HEPA filter helps keep allergens from being re-circulated in your home. This space-saving vacuum offers the same cleaning power as Hoover&#39;s full-sized vacuums, making this a good value in a budget vacuum cleaner."]},"id":"3138897f-a848-4e93-aa40-9b20d50f56ba","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59986","url":"/hoover-nano-cyclonic-compact-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-15T14:35:47Z","datePublished":"2014-07-15T14:35:47Z","name":"Hoover Nano Cyclonic Compact","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
