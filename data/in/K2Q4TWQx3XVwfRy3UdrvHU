Every time we update this guide, we download the newest versions of the best programs and use them as a typical consumer would.","As we tested the software, we noted how easy each program is to purchase and download. In addition, we evaluated its features to find out if it&#39;s easier to notate with the program than it is to do so by hand. We also checked whether there are hidden steps to connect input devices such as MIDI keyboards and microphones. ","As a musician, I have been using notation software for the past 10 years, both professionally and for fun. Although my experience with these programs makes it easy to find and use certain features, I try to approach testing as if it is my first time using composition software. In the product reviews, I let you know my impressions of useful tools and indicate which features are impractical.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","When we test notation software, our first step is to purchase each product, download it and register it. As we do, we note how easy or difficult the process is. Once the software is up and running, we connect a MIDI keyboard and headphones to our testing laptop, count the number of steps it takes to start notating music, and monitor the playback.","<br/>Not everyone who uses notation software has a MIDI keyboard, so when available, we also used the programs’ virtual pianos and virtual guitar fretboards to input notes. The third important note input method is shortcut keys and a computer mouse, so we also compared the applications’ tool palettes. We found the best notation programs have toolbars you can customize to prominently display the tools you use most often, which can speed up your work.","After we created a score, we used each software’s playback engine to test how realistic its virtual instruments sound. Our favorite programs have a good variety of instruments in their libraries, including percussion instruments, strings and horns.","Finally, we tested each application’s import and export capabilities. We imported a variety of files, including MIDI files, MusicXML files and graphic images, to see how easy each program makes the process. We then exported the compositions in a variety of formats to check that they were legible and accurate, which is important when you send your scores to other musicians or composers.","<strong>How Much Should I Spend on Music Notation Software? </strong>","Most of the software we reviewed costs between $100 and $200 and is perfectly suited for making simple compositions for small band arrangements. If you compose complex arrangements for large bands or orchestras, you should consider one of the more full-feature versions of programs like Finale or Sibelius. However, you can expect to pay upward of $500 for one of these advanced programs. There’s also MuseScore 2, a free program for creating and printing simple lead sheets. It has comparable features to the best for-pay programs we tested.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Choosing Music Notation Software</strong>","We asked Mark Maxson, a faculty member and music technology specialist at Weber State University, which features he thought were most important, and he said, “Because the number one purpose of notation software is to put accurate and great looking sheet music in front of live players I find non-print export options useful.” He also noted, “Any feature that helps get notes on the lines fast is invaluable.”","Here are some of the features we tested that make sharing files and note entry efficient:","Music Features<br/>It is important to choose software that can create more than one style of sheet music. The best composition programs we tested not only create piano music but also make guitar tablature, guitar chord names and percussion notation. Programs that have a variety of these music features allow novice musicians to write and play compositions with little knowledge of music theory.","Input/Output<br/>If you don&#39;t have a MIDI controller, you need software with other ways to create sheet music. All the products we reviewed let you insert notes by clicking on the staff with your mouse or by using a virtual keyboard or guitar fretboard.","Sharing your sheet music with others is just as important as creating it. All the software we reviewed let you print off your sheet music and export standard MIDI files. Programs that allow you to export your final compositions as audio files make your work easier when you share with people who can&#39;t read music.","Editing Features<br/>When you choose a composition program that has a volume mixer, you can make changes to volume and panning information as you listen to the playback. You can also use the mixer to record the changes as you make them, although those changes only apply to the playback sound, not to the composition data.","<strong>MIDI Controllers for Music Notation Software </strong>","There are two important considerations to keep in mind when choosing a MIDI-compatible keyboard to use with music notation software: the tactile quality of the keys and the number of keys. Acoustic pianos have 88 weighted keys, and many digital piano manufacturers have done a good job simulating the feel of a real piano. Keyboards with a MIDI or USB output with 88 weighted keys start around $400 and go up to thousands of dollars, depending on the number and quality of the built-in sounds. MIDI keyboards without built-in sounds control software the same as digital pianos but are much more cost effective and portable, and they often have differing numbers of keys. Here are our favorite MIDI-compatible keyboards for music notation software.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/d/Home-Digital-Pianos/Yamaha-Weighted-Digital-Sustain-Standard/B00UJ9LNDK\">Yamaha P-45</a><br/>This digital piano has an 88-key weighted key bed and USB output to connect directly to a computer without an additional MIDI interface. If you are accustomed to playing an acoustic piano, this is the best input device to use with transcription software. It only has 10 built-in sounds, but all the notation programs we tested have piano and other keyboard tones included. The downside of using a digital piano with weighted keys to control notation software is the keyboard&#39;s size. At 25 pounds, the P-45 is a bit cumbersome to move around. It has rubber feet on the bottom to keep it from sliding around on a desk, but we suggest pairing it with a keyboard stand to ensure the keys are at the proper height.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/M-Audio-Keystation-Semi-Weighted-USB-Powered-Controller/dp/B07DDN4PYD/\">M-Audio Keystation 61 MK3</a><br/>This controller keyboard doesn’t have a fully weighted key bed or any built-in sounds, but it’s lightweight and a perfectly suitable controller for all the music notation software we tested. The semi-weighted keys are the same size as those on an acoustic piano and velocity sensitive, so they track how hard you hit the key and send volume information to the software. The Keystation series controllers come with 25, 49, 61 or 88 keys and have a standard USB output to connect to a home computer or laptop.","<strong>Sheet Music Reader Apps </strong>","A sheet music app is an invaluable tool for taking finalized arrangements to the stage or rehearsal. All the notation programs we tested export PDF files that display on any mobile device, but sheet music readers have better organization features and allow you to annotate a score and export it with markup. Here are our favorite sheet music apps for iOS and Android devices.  ","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/forscore/id363738376?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">forScore</a><br/>This app is only available on iPad, but it is the best sheet music app available. It’s compatible with popular cloud storage services like Dropbox and Box, or you can upload PDF or MusicXML files from your computer or email inbox. Once you finish adding arrangements, you can search the library by composer, genre or key. forScore supports half-page turns, which allows you to see the bottom half of one page and the top half of the next page simultaneously. It also syncs with Bluetooth page turner pedals for hands-free page flips.","<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gramercy.orpheus&amp;hl=en\">Orpheus Sheet Music Pro</a><br/>If you prefer to use Android hardware, Orpheus is the best sheet music app on that OS. It doesn’t have as many organization and file import features as forScore, but the interface is easy to use and includes an annotation tool. There’s a free version that displays ads and limits chart uploads to 30 total. Orpheus has support for Bluetooth hands-free page turners, and syncs with Dropbox. This app isn’t compatible with as many import file types as forScore, but every notation software we tested exports PDF files, which is the preferred file type for Orpheus."]},"id":"c9e36f9b-1c34-4319-bfaa-7fc4e1fff5a1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_248","url":"/best-music-notation-software","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-22T20:15:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-22T20:15:00Z","name":"Best Music Notation Software of 2019","synopsis":"Music notation software makes it easy for composers and hobbyists to create music using a keyboard, MIDI interface or a simple mouse.","review":{},"strapline":"Music notation software makes it easy for composers and hobbyists to create music using a keyboard, MIDI interface or a simple mouse.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-22T22:48:28Z","id":"K2Q4TWQx3XVwfRy3UdrvHU","meta":{"title":"Best Music Notation Software 2019 -
