The housing of this device is made out of clear acrylic, so you can watch as your creation prints. The 3D Touch can use ABS and PLA filaments and is capable of printing multicolor objects.","This 3D printing device allows you to print a creation that is approximately 8 x 10.8 x 10.8 inches. It has a minimum layer thickness of 0.1 millimeters and a maximum layer thickness of 0.125 millimeters. The device comes with a single print head, which allows you to print in a single color at one time. However, you can choose the optional dual head extruder, which will allow you to print in two colors at the same time. This 3D printer uses both PLA and ABS filaments. Unfortunately, it does not come with a heated platform.","The 3D Touch housing is made out of clear acrylic, so you can watch your creation as it is printing. This is a great tool to use in a classroom setting, because students can watch the machine at work.  This device measures 23.6 x 23.6 x 27.5 inches and weighs in at 84 pounds. In other words, it&#39;s not very mobile.","When you order the 3D Touch, you will receive the printer, USB cable, power supply and a memory device, which contains all of the setup instructions you need. In addition, you will also receive a tool kit that will help you to keep the machine maintained.","The 3D Touch will connect to your computer using the included USB cable. However, you can also transfer your files to the flash drive, which will plug into the 3D printing device.","Included with this 3D printer is a one-year warranty. Additionally if you have any questions or need help with your 3D Touch, you can contact the support team of Bits from Bytes by telephone or email. Moreover, you can read the list of FAQs on the website or join the online forum."]},"id":"9b983a42-7269-4caf-ad31-affd0d0db7b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"075b8012-65c9-4985-b5fd-1a1aeca9652c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Because of the clear design of the 3D Touch, it makes a perfect device to use in classrooms.
