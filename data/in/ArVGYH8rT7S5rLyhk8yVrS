Since this firm focuses heavily on the overall concept of emergency preparedness, it’s food offerings are smaller and less diverse than those of some its competitors in the <a href=\"/best-food-storage-services\">food storage</a> area where food is the primary focus. <a href=\"/the-ready-store-review\">The Ready Store</a> is one service that gives you a lot of options to grow your own food or a wide variety of balanced meals through its service.","However, SOS Survival Products is outstanding when it comes to first-aid kits for different types of disasters, pre-assembled emergency preparedness kits for various numbers of people – up to as many as 100 – and in preparedness education and information.","This company offers Mountain House kits of foods that come freeze-dried in pouches or in cans. You can get tasty meals including entrees like chili mac with beef, spaghetti with meat sauce, a chicken fajita bowl and more. You also can get prepared breakfasts, desserts, various meats and side dishes, side dishes by themselves and more.","You also can get Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) that have a five-year shelf life. This company offers vegetarian and gluten-free entrees for people who prefer or need these kinds of meals. This firm does not sell organic, lactose-free, soy-free or nut-free products.","For short- or long-term food supplies, you can get kits or buckets of food for two, three, four, five or 14 days. You can also get kits that comprise cans of food for different number of people for different periods of time. For example, you can buy a one-person 30-day supply of food or a year’s supply for one person, and the offerings change in the numbers of people served and duration of time food will be needed. In addition, SOS Survival Products offers a hearty selection of high-calorie energy bars in different flavors.","However, you cannot buy such things as dried milk, cheese, produce, cereals or beans. This firm also does not sell things like seeds or plants – or food storage equipment such as canning or dehydrating equipment.","One area where SOS Survival Products does well is water, which is a key element in staying healthy, safe and alive after a disaster hits. You can get prepackaged drinking water in pouches so you have clean water on hand in the event you cannot trust the water in your area or there is no water available after a tornado, hurricane, earthquake or other disaster. You also can buy water purification and filtration equipment, containers and rain collection barrels.","The company’s website lacks live chat, but you can reach friendly representatives by email or phone, which was our experience. SOS Survival Services presents many educational materials on its website including training classes in Van Nuys, California for such things as CPR, first aid for humans and pets, general emergency preparedness and more. You also have access to a free electronic newsletter, and you can buy pocket disaster guides, emergency response and incident notebooks, and books addressing things like fire safety and how to respond to a flood."]},"id":"b152bbbf-9ff0-467d-8c42-3cb707634846","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"50d7bb7e-9d13-450a-8f47-6170a3e55811","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You don’t get the widest food selection from this company, but SOS Survival Products presents a reasonably good selection of freeze-dried and canned foods as well as plenty of solutions to have or get clean water in the event of a disaster.
