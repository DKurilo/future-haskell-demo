Food Network star Alton Brown is one advocate of digital kitchen scales. Many foods cannot be correctly measured by volume alone, but you can get accurate measurements if you weigh them, according to Brown.","&#34;Consider a cup of all-purpose flour. Depending on who&#39;s doing the scooping, the age of flour, the size of the bag, the relative humidity, it could weigh between four and six ounces -- the difference between success and failure of a recipe,&#34; Brown says. &#34;You&#39;ve got to have a scale.&#34;"]},"id":"16c73349-1c65-4a7f-922c-d7b11f46741e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/MfjiGQdrKuXQLhXvsggDbS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/food-scales-kalorik-xl-digital-eks-42428-s-testing-004/w/711/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9ML1AvNzgwOTczL29yaWdpbmFsL0Zvb2QtU2NhbGVzLUthbG9yaWstWEwtRGlnaXRhbC1FS1MtNDI0MjgtUy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwNC5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MfjiGQdrKuXQLhXvsggDbS.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"MfjiGQdrKuXQLhXvsggDbS","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MfjiGQdrKuXQLhXvsggDbS.jpg","alt":""},"id":"241944fa-1ab4-40ee-9506-ccc3e6636f32","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Melissa Clark, cookbook author and staff writer for the New York Times, said in an article titled &#34;Our Favorite Gadgets&#34; that her food scale is an indispensable part of her food preparation for many reasons.","&#34;Pastry chefs love kitchen scales for their precision; using weight instead of volume gives you more exact measurements and more consistent results,&#34; Clark said. &#34;But the real reason I love my kitchen scale is its convenience.
