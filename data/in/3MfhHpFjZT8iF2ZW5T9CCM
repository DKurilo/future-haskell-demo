This cost-effective product provides ample magnification and can be installed almost anywhere. Unlike larger lighted mirrors, it can also be stowed away in a suitcase or a carry on to keep your brows shaped when traveling.","At 3.5 inches in diameter, this compact mirror can fit inside a purse or gym bag for adjustments on the go. The 10 times magnification is ideal for putting on makeup without corrective eyewear, putting in contacts and, of course, tweezing eyebrows or maintaining facial hair. It attaches to any smooth surface via suction cups, so you can move it around the house or hotel room. A small light on the top provides additional illumination. This mirror is cordless and is powered by three AG10 watch batteries.","For additional suction, it&#39;s recommended to moisten the suction cups prior to fastening. This mirror is small enough to be handheld if a smooth or mirrored surface isn&#39;t available. It&#39;s designed for tweezing eyebrows, so a larger lighted vanity mirror may be more appropriate for overall makeup application and hair styling. This small mirror doesn&#39;t come with a carrying case, which would be a useful source of protection.","The light is quite small and designed to shine a tiny beam of light on a particular area. If you need a more generous lighting palette, you may need to look for a larger mirror, like <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">Floxite</a>. If you only need a little extra light in a small or dark bathroom specifically for detailed work like tweezing eyebrows, putting in eyelash extensions or contacts, this small, Tweezermate mirror is an ideal choice. Keep in mind that because it doesn&#39;t have lighting all the way around the mirror, there may be shadowing.","The focused light and 10 times magnification of this lighted mirror make it the ideal tool for tweezing eyebrows and putting in contacts. Because of its size and suction cup mounting, it is a useful option for traveling, and it can be used as a handheld mirror."]},"id":"b1a03d34-9a00-4949-ae87-9fb111d32a44","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66161","url":"/tweezermate-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-10T21:46:27Z","datePublished":"2015-07-10T21:46:27Z","name":"Tweezermate 10X","synopsis":"Tweezermate's 10X Lighted Mirror can be attached to any reflective surface to give you extra detail when shaping your eyebrows.
