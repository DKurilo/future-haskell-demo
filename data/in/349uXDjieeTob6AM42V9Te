The main difference between the two machines is the T7-02’s larger motor. While the T7 had a 2.75 continuous-duty horsepower drive, the T7-02 has a 3.0 CHP motor that is more durable, quiet and responsive. The newer model also has a sturdier frame.","The Elite T7-02 has a running surface 20 inches wide and 60 inches long. Higher-rated treadmills give you two more inches. On the plus side, the Elite T7-02’s 3/4-inch deck has three-zone variable response cushioning. Horizon says this offers an impact zone, a transition zone and a push-off zone to provide optimum flex and support.","This treadmill’s silicone belt has a 2.4-inch front roller and a 1.8-inch rear roller. Its maximum speed is 12 mph and, like every treadmill we reviewed, it provides a 15 percent maximum incline. The machine itself weighs 227 pounds and can accommodate users weighing up to 350 pounds. Fully assembled, the Elite T7-02 measures 77 x 35 x 60 inches (length, width, height) and folds hydraulically to 44 x 35 x 69 inches.","The Elite T7-02’s extras include built-in speakers, a workout fan, a tablet rack and a water bottle holder. It also features an energy-saving mode. With 42 workout programs onboard, it provides excellent statistical feedback such as calories, distance, zone, incline, laps, speed and time. You can also track your heart rate and your heart rate training zone. The T7-02 has a polar wireless receiver and comes with a chest strap.","Both the Horizon Elite T7-02 and the <a href=\"/matrix-fitness-review\">Matrix TF50</a> are Passport Ready. This means they can connect with your home television to display workout destination courses in high definition. Passport then syncs the courses to your personal workout speed and intensity. To use this feature, you must purchase a Passport Player separately. You can then access courses filmed around the world, including throughout Italy, Switzerland and the United States.","The Elite T7-02 doesn’t have the same level of connectivity as the NordicTrack and ProForm treadmills we reviewed, but it does sync with ViaFit. This unique Horizon Fitness app lets you track workouts, monitor progress toward reaching your goals and share data between third-party apps like Fitbit and MyFitnessPal. This treadmill has an 8.5-inch blue backlit LCD, and we admit it’s not our favorite display. Higher-rated machines have larger, high definition touchscreens. The <a href=\"/proform-smart-pro-9000-review\">ProForm SMART Pro 9000</a> has a 10-inch smart screen, and the <a href=\"/nordictrack-commercial-2950-review\">NordicTrack 2950’s</a> interactive coaching touchscreen is much bigger, measuring 22 inches.","Horizon guarantees the T7-02 with a lifetime warranty on its frame and motor, five years on cushioning and parts and one year on labor. Most other manufacturers provide a two-year labor warranty. Horizon’s customer service is available by phone and email."]},"id":"8b6b940c-5ba1-4613-aaf8-5d5d81458ef2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70009","url":"/horizon-elite-t7-02-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-04T19:40:51Z","datePublished":"2018-06-04T19:40:51Z","name":"Horizon Elite T7-02","synopsis":"New on the market in 2018, the Horizon Elite T7-02 is an upgraded model of Horizon’s popular Elite T7 treadmill that was introduced in 2016.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"The Horizon Elite T7-02 is a solid midrange treadmill at a fair price.
