Now, its Philips&#39; turn to step up and showcase the elite in their universal remote lineup.","The Philips Prestigo SRT9320 is said to be Logitech Harmony One&#39;s biggest competition because of its gorgeous 2.8-inch LCD touch screen and fully customizable buttons.  Although we disagree with this claim, we do agree that the Prestigo SRT9320 is a fantastic product and should not be overlooked when considering your universal remote purchase."]},"id":"45f74cbe-6b2c-4dbe-884d-8865ac7d6906","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"99dd6b57-97f7-4fcd-81e1-8fe99e22ee64","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The touch screen really is fabulous and easily accessible. We love the large channel icons and text size, as well as the activity options that can be found by flicking your finger and scrolling through the various on-screen pages.","A huge feature of this universal remote is the number of devices it supports: a whopping 20! Every electronic device in your house could be programmed to this universal remote, that is if this remote had RF capabilities. While having the 20 supported devices is the highest of any other product in our side-by-side comparison, without RF connectivity, the range of the remote is limited to 33 feet. And there really are only so many products in your living room that can be accessed within 33 feet. When you first get the universal remote, there are already pre-programmed channel icons and activities. You can keep these pre-programmed features or take them off using the easy on-remote setup wizard.","Every button on the Philips Prestigo universal remote, both hard and soft, are customizable. Having the ability to take your new remote and make it exactly how you want it is a fantastic bonus that should appeal to a lot of consumers. On the touch screen, you have the ability to rearrange the channel icons and activity buttons in whichever order you would like, making accessibility number one. The learning mode feature, seen in other remotes in our universal remote review, is also seen here, and we love it. The commands that are learned from the old device can also be programmed to your touch screen button options."]},"id":"271e55dd-df26-4634-bb32-655ae8e704a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Capabilities"},"id":"19c4bb16-6595-47ca-b6a4-de488a6eeaad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Prestigo SRT9320 really is a beautiful product. The body is ergonomically designed and has a very modern, high-tech look. All of the frontal buttons are backlight with a blue light that is not too harsh when using in the darkness.  When you have it in your hand, however, the glossy finish attracts finger marks and the button options and layout are disappointing. The top half of the universal remote is dominated by the 2.8-inch LCD color screen where channel icons and activities are programmed, while the bottom half has hard buttons. The bottom half is lacking quite a few of the buttons seen in our top three universal remote products, but they are all customizable, which is definitely a bonus. There are color-coded, programmable buttons, but they are located at the very bottom of the remote. This placement is awkward and poorly planned."]},"id":"780f4318-1a91-4041-90a3-24049b9b8a0e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Setup"},"id":"44adfb60-6faa-4a6a-9a54-fee5a3691725","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips Prestigo SRT9320 has great help and support options.

However, we found that Philips Prestigo may have something better than the help button: When an activity button is selected from the touch screen, whether it be &#34;watch TV&#34; or &#34;watch DVD,&#34; the action should occur immediately. If it doesn&#39;t, however, simply press the on and off button and a screen will show you which devices should be activated at that moment. Instant troubleshooting. From here, you can send a missing activity command.
