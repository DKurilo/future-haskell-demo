This photo retouching software is just one of two of Pilot&#39;s diverse retouching programs and is extremely helpful in getting the cover model look your photos need.","Using this photo enhancer, you can remove skin blemishes like freckles, pimples and more with the click of your mouse. You can also whiten teeth, erase wrinkles and soften skin. When you initially open Makeup Pilot, a window will pop up, suggesting you watch one of the 12 step-by-step tutorials on the best features. This will help you get a grasp for the software as well as allow you to get comfortable with using the tools.","MakeUp Pilot is not the best photo retouching software available and may seem limited compared to other photo retouching software, but it can be very flexible. You can use this software to restore old photos, removing scratches and healing distressed areas. There is no preset retouching template included in this photo fixing program, which means all retouching must be done manually. Fortunately, because all adjustments are done by hand, you have complete control over the result of your picture. You can add lipstick and blush, apply eye liner and even change your subject’s eye color.","Unfortunately, you can’t batch import or export with this software, nor are you able to apply edits to groups either. You have to import, edit and export photos individually. While this software can be used as a stand-alone program, it can also be installed as a plugin for Photoshop or Corel PaintShop Pro Photo.","There is not very much documentation beyond the tutorials mentioned earlier. The website shows examples of possible actions, but does not have text tutorials to show how it was accomplished. There is a forum and FAQs section on the website, but unfortunately, it does not have information regarding the use of MakeUp Pilot contained in it. When contacting help and support, a standard email form is available on the site. Be aware that an answer may take quite a while to reply."]},"id":"d7af29e8-84f4-4e4b-bbdf-e4abd671e205","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b15f3c39-9549-45d6-9688-46b7e6f6bfa4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Makeup Pilot is good for what it is, but the limits of having all the tools split between various modules weakens the effectiveness of this photo retouching software.
