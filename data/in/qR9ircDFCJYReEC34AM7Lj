During our hands-on testing, the player took a respectable 8.8 seconds to boot, while most others took around 12 seconds.","This BP550 is rectangular in design and weighs about 2 pounds. It is made of plastic and is small enough to fit in the tightest of entertainment centers. It only has two buttons on its front – one to open the disc tray, and another to turn it on and off. The player lacks the premium features of the best 3D Blu-ray players, including deep color and 4K playback, though it supports Dolby TrueHD and has a single coaxial output. It doesn&#39;t have an HDMI audio output, but it does have an Ethernet jack. We were impressed with the picture quality, especially for DVDs, since the player upscales them to full 1080p HD.","The player&#39;s operating system has an easy-to-use interface with large icons and straightforward menus. It has built-in Wi-Fi, and by default, the LG is loaded with a slew of apps from major video streaming services like Netflix and Vudu. It includes DLNA support and the ability to play videos from a hard drive or flash drive using its USB port. It&#39;s compatible with LG’s Music Flow multi-room system, which lets you stream music from a CD or the USB port to other compatible LG devices or speakers around your house.","The player includes a remote, but you can also download a remote control mobile app to your smartphone. The app has a nifty Private Sound Mode where you can use headphones rather than relying on your TV&#39;s speakers and disturbing others. LG offers a one-year warranty on the BP550. You can reach support by telephone, email or live chat."]},"id":"9876a214-b76b-4448-96eb-0213015bac4a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8b4dd1f7-8c17-4e04-a6a5-8fe7f7a41a42","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG BP550 has plenty of features to make it worth your consideration.
