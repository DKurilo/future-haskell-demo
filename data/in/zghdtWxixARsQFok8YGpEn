You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With the advent of smartphone apps that provide navigation tools, navigation GPS manufacturers have been coming up with ways to compete. Smartphone navigation apps update the maps frequently and show real-time traffic information, and some of these apps do this for free. TomTom combats this by making map and traffic updates free for the life of your device, in addition to adding advanced features to basic models. The Start 50 M is a model that includes these lifetime map updates, but it doesn&#39;t include lifetime traffic updates.","The 50 M is a 5-inch model in TomTom&#39;s Start series, and the body of the device is not much bigger. As is standard in basic models, the screen is plastic and resistive, with a resolution of 480 x 272 pixels. A resistive screen means the pressure from your finger or stylus is what makes the selection on your display. The newer and more advanced models of GPS navigators use a capacitive screen that can handle things like multitouch. It is better to have your route preprogrammed on the Start 50 M, as making changes on a resistive screen en route can take your attention away from the road.","To keep up with the free smartphone apps, the Start 50 M comes with a lifetime subscription of map updates. You can update the maps for free  up to four times a year. Unfortunately, this model misses the mark by not offering free traffic updates, as several free smartphone apps already do this. If you want traffic updates, you will have to purchase a subscription. However, the Start 50 M does offer free roadside assistance – available 24 hours a day. Additionally, this GPS unit for your car has the ability to show the best gas prices at some of the stations in your area.","You will find advanced features like lane assistance and a speed limit indicator on this device. You will also find standard options, such as choosing your route from among a few options, to choosing to avoid certain annoyances like such as toll roads and highways. If you diverge from your specified route, the Start 50 M will automatically recalculate your route, helping you get to your destination. Surprisingly, this model comes with an eco-route option, which presents the most fuel-efficient path. However, this GPS device can&#39;t save any routes, auto-sort multiple destinations, offer an alternate route to avoid traffic or suggest a route based on your previous history."]},"id":"2e836b64-4ad3-42e5-a6a3-65f878a2a25e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1421fb72-9c6f-4da7-a46b-88e7747b7fe1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TomTom Start 50 M has a few advanced features such as lane assistance and a speed limit indicator, as well as free map upgrades for the life of your device, but it is still missing a lifetime traffic update subscription.
