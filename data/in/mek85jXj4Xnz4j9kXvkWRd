Created more than three decades ago, Smart cards are a way to fend off thieves and protect consumers from fraudulent charges when their cards are stolen. While many may think of a smart card as just another credit card, it actually uses different technology when processing a transaction.","<strong>The Difference Between Smart Cards and Credit Cards</strong><br/>Swiping a credit card is a common activity for many. You turn the card a certain way, swipe it through a card reader and the machine collect&#39;s the card&#39;s information using the black magnetic strip on the back of the card. Smart cards work in a similar way, but they don&#39;t use a magnetic strip.","Smart cards use a microprocessor to store and transmit information for use during a <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> transaction. You can see this microprocessor on the card. It appears to be a gold square with lines running through it.  This chip stores the card&#39;s information and talks to a card reader by relaying information. This process is quick and efficient and merchants often have to pay less transactions fees when this type of card is used. The card also lasts longer, saving credit companies money on replacement cards.","<strong>Why Smart Cards Are Safer</strong><br/>Credit card magnetic strips are easy to read using simple tools. Thieves can easily attach readers to ATMs and merchant terminals or simply walk by you and scan that card in your wallet using a handheld device. The information from the reader can be used to make fraudulent purchases.","Smart cards can&#39;t be read with simple technology. This prevents thieves from stealing the credit information. Also, a transaction using this type of card has what is called &#34;two-factor authentication.&#34; Two-factor authentication means that the card and another form of identification, such as a PIN number or ID, must be presented at the time of purchase.<br/>Another reason that smart cards are more secure is that the transaction doesn&#39;t need to be processed by a human. The information is processes electronically throughout the entire transaction.","<strong>Using Smart Cards</strong><br/>Smart cards aren&#39;t widely used in the United States, but they are used commonly in other countries. For example, many countries use this type of technology in their health insurance cards, and many countries only accept these types of cards at ATMs and merchants.","To use this type of card, a customer only has to wave the card in front of the card terminal. The card talks to the terminal during these few seconds using a radio frequency. There are other terminal types, called &#34;contact terminals,&#34; where the card must be inserted inside the terminal. These types of terminals are considered more secure.","While smart cards aren&#39;t used very often in the United States for credit card processing transactions, companies are slowly gravitating towards them. They provide users with better protection, they last longer and they are more affordable than credit cards.","For more information, check out our <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">EMV Chip Cards guide</a>.Â "]},"id":"7246fb07-deb0-48f5-a4e4-08d98c9df651","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7191","url":"/what-are-smart-cards","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alina-bradford","url":"/author/alina-bradford","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alina Bradford","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"B3tPrF8sxRUy8i2s9RVdDe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-04-19T17:27:56Z","datePublished":"2012-04-19T17:27:56Z","name":"What Are Smart Cards?","synopsis":"According to the Identity Theft Assistance Center, a national consumer advocacy organization, 8.1 million adults were affected by identity theft in 2010.","review":{},"strapline":"According to the Identity Theft Assistance Center, a national consumer advocacy organization, 8.1 million adults were affected by identity theft in 2010.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-20T15:14:20Z","id":"mek85jXj4Xnz4j9kXvkWRd","meta":{"title":"What Are Smart Cards?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
