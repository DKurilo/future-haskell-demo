You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Cloer 6021NA Egg Boiler cooks with a steam method, providing you with soft-, medium- or hard-boiled eggs. This <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a> includes a measuring cup with a built-in shell piercer.","The egg cooker by Cloer delivers consistently cooked eggs using multiple accessories and settings. The appliance should only use cold water in the reservoir. You can load it with up to three eggs along the single-row tray before lowering it down. Within minutes, they are ready to chill and eat. To avoid potential water burns, you have to wait at least one minute to open it by the handle. The device has a clean white finish with a clear case, blending with other kitchen appliances of similar coloring.","The measuring cup included with the set functions as an example of the water level that you need for the correct level of doneness. The amount varies based on the size, temperature and age of the eggs you use in your recipe.","The housing on this egg cooker is made of white plastic. Measuring 9.1 x 6.2 x 2.9 inches wide, it is compact enough for cabinet storage. The heating element is nonstick to make the eggs easy to detach from the tray, and the tray itself is removable, making it easy to clean. You use the egg piercer in the bottom of the measuring cup to pierce a hole in the shell, allowing it to cook evenly while steaming to the correct level of doneness.","The electric egg cooker has a built-in overheating protection system. If you or someone else tries to operate the machine without water in it, it emits a beeping noise after a few seconds and the thermostat automatically shuts off.","This device also includes a downloadable manual written primarily in German but including an English translation. The manual addresses cleaning and maintenance, as well as additional information about the product.","The egg carrier, tray and cover are all dishwasher safe. There are instructions in the manual for proper cleaning procedures if the heating element accumulates calcification.","The Cloer 6021NA Egg Boiler cooks a few eggs at a time and requires regular cleaning to avoid calcification on the metal. This model is best suited for individuals who only need to cook a few eggs at a time or who have limited storage space for appliances."]},"id":"8cece422-31ef-433b-b7af-1e636a979975","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63179","url":"/cloer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T19:09:43Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T19:09:43Z","name":"Cloer 6021NA","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-03T19:09:43Z","id":"hbe2RdtLLSCZsPrWtLHXQR","meta":{"title":"Cloer 6021NA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Cloer.
