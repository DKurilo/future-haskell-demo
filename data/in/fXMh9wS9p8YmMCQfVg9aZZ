The application boasts a superb 1:5 speed ratio, which equates to one minute of conversion time for every five minutes of video converted. Therefore, to convert a DVD to MP4 will take approximately one-fifth the amount of time of the video&#39;s total length.","Overall, we were also impressed with the playback quality of each converted video.

For starters, is has multi-task batch conversion that allows you to select multiple output formats for different DVD titles or chapters and convert them all at once. We really like this feature because it offers set-and-go operation; you can start a lengthy conversion process and not worry about having to manually initiate each output profile to convert. Moreover, a convenient preview screen allows you to view each video as it is being converted and CSS decryption allows the software to decrypt your DVD for playback on a mobile device.","When it comes to customizable features, this video to MP4 converter is as versatile as they come. It has two editing sections – &#34;edit&#34; and &#34;clip&#34; – that you access through the navigation bar at the top of the software&#39;s interface window. Under the edit tab, you can alter the brightness, contrast and saturation of the output video. To ensure that you have adjusted the video effects perfectly, the interface shows you an original preview alongside an output preview so that you can see exactly how your changes will appear in the final video. There&#39;s also on option to crop a video frame to get rid of unnecessary borders and a watermark function. A watermark is a distinguishing mark or image that is placed on digital images or videos. Watermarks are often used to personalize and retain ownership of a video, and are most useful if you plan to publish or post a video online.","The software&#39;s clip tab offers access to the trimming function. The trim feature is a great tool for cutting and merging distinct video clips. For instance, you can use it to combine separate home video clips into one seamless compilation or to capture your favorite movie scene so that you can watch it on your phone or share it online."]},"id":"b81d975b-2ec0-4daa-937c-b27d89e7cc3d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Customization"},"id":"60931a24-8ea3-474e-8476-0d79f0baa90d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Given that it is a DVD ripper, this iSkysoft software application is a multifaceted, all-in-one solution for ripping DVDs to all popular video formats.
