This company ranks near the bottom of our review for credit repair education because it lacks any articles or discussion about credit repair laws and because there aren’t any additional articles inside of the online client portal. However, once you sign up for service, you can use the online portal to track the ongoing progress of your disputes and see which items have successfully been removed from your credit report.","One factor that sets this company apart from the best credit repair companies is the initial setup fee that MSI charges. While other companies will charge a set amount for the setup fee, MSI will charge between $30-$1,000 depending on the type and number of negative items on your credit report. Because this amount varies based on your situation, we felt there were better companies in our review that only charge a set amount for their initial fee.","MSI only works with third-party credit report providers, which makes the initial credit report required to start service potentially expensive. If you want monthly credit monitoring or identity protection in addition to credit repair, you have to pay extra for these services through a third party.","Like the best credit repair services, though, MSI works with the three major credit bureaus – TransUnion, Equifax and Experian – as well as with your creditors. This is an important point because some companies only work with the credit bureaus, which can result in items being initially removed from your credit report, only to reappear because the original creditors are still reporting the negative item to the bureaus. Working with creditors directly removes the items from all parties’ records."]},"id":"ef5052ea-2fd1-44d9-a838-8771a8bfd343","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9a921aa8-485c-476d-b8a4-77926268e1c1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though MSI Credit Solutions has a good set of educational offerings, including videos explaining credit and credit repair, the variable cost for setting up your account and service makes this company one of the lowest ranking in our review.
