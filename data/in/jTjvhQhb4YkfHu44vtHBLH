You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","Blu-ray Ripper from Aiseesoft Studio is the best product we found for copying Blu-ray Discs and files because it does most of its job in the background, and it works quickly. With a simple interface, superior video-conversion features and decryption skills that never fail, the application floated pleasantly to the top of our list of the best <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software/\">Blu-ray to Blu-ray copy software</a>.","Think of the road to Blu-ray to Blu-ray back up as unpaved and dangerous, like one of the dirt roads you might come across in a third-world country. Few technophiles have attempted the journey, and many are completely unaware that a path exists. Now, imagine that the Blu-ray to Blu-ray trail leading to a perfect copy of a high-definition movie runs through territory fraught with improvised explosive devices in the form of Digital Rights Management (DRM) protections such as AACS, BD+ and MKB.","Luckily, combat forces around the world have heavy tanks, armor and artillery to help keep them safe. Techies, too, have tools in the form of software that can rip, decrypt, copy and burn Blu-ray files. Only one product can do it all, however, and that’s Blu-ray Ripper from Aiseesoft Studio. For a price that’s lower than most competing software packages, Blu-ray Ripper can take you from blank BD to perfect copy in about 90 minutes. And you can leave the hassle behind.","Aiseesoft Blu-ray Ripper doesn’t require third-party DRM-cracking software to work. In fact, all the decryption work is done in the background, so you can copy almost any Blu-ray regardless of who manufactured it, where it was sold and how recently it was created. Then, you can edit, crop and transform the copied video using intuitive controls. With Aiseesoft, making legal Blu-ray to Blu-ray movies is a war you can win.","Rival products, in comparison, can only decrypt one of the three kinds of decryption, or can only recognize Blu-ray files from specific manufacturers such as Walt Disney and Paramount. Other Blu-ray to Blu-ray copy products seem to work, but your finished product will come out garbled and chunky, or it might be a high-definition silent film."]},"id":"37b2840e-2693-43db-9264-ad1bdc4eeffa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Copy"},"id":"4dddada3-c468-4062-b954-4e8632aab320","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aiseesoft Blu-ray Ripper is the only product we tested that made copies quickly and easily with no problems. That alone makes it a great application for backing up your entire Blu-ray collection. Fortunately, Aiseesoft Blu-ray Ripper goes the extra mile with its editing capabilities. You can clip short segments for a classroom presentation, for example, or make a black-and-white copy of new movie releases. You can also insert a watermark of your own design and change the contrast and saturation of your movie to suit the Blu-ray player device you plan to use. When the ripping, decrypting and copying is done, the application can turn off your PC to conserve power.","Beyond copying backup files of your favorite high-definition Blu-rays, Aiseesoft Blu-ray Ripper allows you to make copies of your BDs and DVDs that will play on your PlayStation gaming system. You can also burn copies of BDs to regular blank DVDs so you can watch your movies on electronic devices such as your laptop computer or portable DVD player.","Other winning features of Aiseesoft’s Blu-ray Ripper include its ability to omit or retain bonus material and menus, insert subtitles in multiple languages and extract audio independent of the main movie."]},"id":"d1394ce4-fade-43be-b735-ec946b8d69f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output"},"id":"7a4713f1-b133-49fe-a000-1f62fab4941f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As you might already know, the first minutes of viewing a Blu-ray movie on a high-definition screen is astounding. Imagine, for example, a scene from the 2000 Paramount film &#34;Gladiator.&#34; In the DVD version, the film starts with a field of grass and a close-up of Russell Crowe’s character, Maximus Meridas. The gladiator is decked out in fighting gear and carries a look of determination on his face, but you feel as if you are seeing the character from far away.","In contrast, the Blu-ray version of the film shows the field as you would see it with your own eyes. Each strand of yellow grass is visible, for example, as is each feather on the songbird that makes a brief appearance. In Crowe’s close-up, the fur on his collar looks real enough to tickle your skin. Similarly, the sweat and dirt on his face appear as real as yours would in the bathroom mirror.","Once you’ve experienced this kind of quality, it’s natural to want it all the time. However, spending the money to outfit every media player in your home for Blu-ray technology is out of reach for many families. Instead, you can purchase just one Blu-ray player and make legal copies to watch on your other machines. Alternatively, you can make exact Blu-ray to Blu-ray backup copies so you can put the originals away for safe keeping."]},"id":"6d8359da-89e8-4212-87b6-9e43be3c9539","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Customization"},"id":"4e01833a-a124-4696-a518-a5f810e1a354","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can make Blu-ray to Blu-ray copies easily with Aiseesoft’s Blu-ray burner. The opening interface will direct you to load either all the files on your BD or just its playlist. Depending on the speed of your computer, that will take between 30 seconds and a few minutes. Then, a list of Blu-ray files will appear. To copy the whole movie, keep all the boxes checked that appear to the left of the file names. If you have other plans, uncheck the appropriate boxes. A helpful preview screen will let you know if you’ve found the right file.","From here, you need to choose the output format of your copy. If you want to make a high-definition movie, find the TS file-extension option. If you want to make a copy that will play on almost all computers, choose MPEG. Next, you can choose the location of the copied file. Use a standard browse button to complete the task.","Now, you’ve done everything necessary to create a perfect Blu-ray to Blu-ray copy. Push the play button and let the software do its magic. You’ll immediately see a clock tracking elapsed time and another tracking the estimated completion time.","If you want a customized copy, there are a few additional steps you need to take.
