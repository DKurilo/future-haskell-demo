Sony created the HDR-CX300 to make capturing those precious moments in your life easy, simple and of high quality. We were impressed with this high-end <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HDV camcorder</a> because of its Exmor R CMOSE image sensor, compact size and touchscreen interface."]},"id":"67029829-3533-441e-b9a3-f5692e559607","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"72d087af-0c24-4fcd-860d-f42fe6cf1eef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This video capturing device offers something for everyone. Whether you are an experienced photographer or an amateur, this Sony product makes capturing every moment easy and of high-quality. The HDR-CX300 features 3.5MP (megapixel) video resolution with full HD video recording. We loved the vivid and crisp images that were captured on this device.","Several features are added to this device to improve the video and images captured. We were impressed but not as much as we were with other Sony products such as the HDR-CX550V. For example, the optical SteadyShot image stabilization with active mode prevents those unnecessary camera shakes that results from unsteady hand movements. The HDV camcorder also has a 3-way shake canceling features which also reduces the camera shake.","This HDV camcorder also offers its users with 10 auto modes. Many similar devices have auto modes, but those available on the HDR-CX300 take a step ahead of the rest and analyze the shot and then automatically select the appropriate settings. We were impressed with how accurate the intelligent mode was and more specifically, that up to 90 combinations were possible on such a compact device.","As with several other high-end video capturing devices, the HDR-CX300 features face priority so the device perfects the color, exposure and focus of the subject in your image. By simply touching the face on the LCD screen, the HDV camcorder puts that face on a priority list. It was a simple process and at first we thought we missed a step. However, this proves that this camcorder is simple and easy.","Aside from some of the specialty features offered on this HDV camcorder, a 12x optical zoom brings a far away subject up close and personal. Also, the digital zoom has interpolation which makes the 160x zoom with less distortion and much clearer. Also, to enhance your image’s distance even more, a 27.4mm focal length provides for wider angled shots."]},"id":"d1f583be-2910-4a88-b6ca-b95fe5eb2300","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"f202ef75-e0e8-4df5-922c-be7eaea2a077","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony HDR-CX300 HDV camcorder provides 16GB of flash memory which was our greatest drawback with this device.

For example, an active interface shoe allows you to mount external accessories, such as lights or mics, to improve your camcorders capabilities. Also, a USB 2.0 interface makes it easy and quick to connect the camcorder to a computer for the uploading of video and the ability to edit.","Sony placed a high-quality G-lens on this device. The lens goes hand-in-hand with the X.V color technology to provide outstanding color with sharp, crisp images. One additional feature we were most impressed with was the touchscreen interface. The LCD screen is touchscreen and allows for several possibilities such as the My Menu system. This allows the user to create a personalized menu so they have what they need and want without the hassle of scrolling through several separate menus. This is the ideal feature for a experienced or beginning photographer. One can have the more advanced menu options available while the other can cast those all away and only worry about what they know and what they feel comfortable using."]},"id":"5277aff2-e385-400e-827e-fca5e1bcd5ef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7054cf13-2d52-4271-9e39-dcd8ec2fbf68","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sony HDR-CX300 is a HDV camcorder that is simple to use and captures high-quality video and images with astounding color.
