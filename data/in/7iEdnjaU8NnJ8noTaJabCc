The special wide-view lens captures most of the room in its viewing area. Though it&#39;s best for large rooms, this monitor may not be a good fit for large homes, as it has a poor connectivity range compared to the best video baby monitors.","This baby monitor’s audio quality is average, scoring an 80 in our audio test. The monitor has two-way communication, so you can hear your baby through the video monitor and speak to them through the camera unit. We noticed some delay and crackle from both units, but the quality was similar to that of a phone call.","The video monitor&#39;s 5-inch screen is the largest in our review and complements the wide-angle lens in the camera, but it has the same resolution as devices half its size, resulting in poor video quality. This means you get a broad but fuzzy picture of your baby&#39;s nursery. Unlike most monitors, you can&#39;t pan or tilt the camera using the handheld unit. However, you can zoom in on your baby to get a better view.","The Summer Infant Wide View partly makes up for its poor video quality with simplicity. We set it up in minutes, and it only took a couple hours to fully charge. You can adjust the volume and lock the screen from the side of the video monitor, and the menu is basic, so you won&#39;t get lost in settings. The trade-off for simplicity is a couple of common features found on other video baby monitors. It doesn&#39;t monitor room temperature so you can make sure your baby is comfortable, and you can’t play lullabies to your child through the camera unit.","Such a simple video monitor means better battery life. In our test, it lasted nine hours without needing to be recharged. Our top performer went 10 hours before it died, so the Summer Infant Wide View did well by comparison. While there is a low-battery indicator on the screen, it came on in hour six of our test, giving us plenty of warning to charge the battery.","You&#39;ll be on a tight leash with this monitor, though it uses the same 2.4GHz signal found in home routers to keep the connection secure. With a relatively short max indoor range of 124 feet and 600 feet outdoors, this baby monitor is best for small homes.","Summer Infant has a variety of customer service resources such as an online manual and a one-year warranty, both of which are average for video baby monitors. If you need to contact the company, you can get in touch over social media, phone and email; the company doesn&#39;t have a live chat support channel."]},"id":"da851a5f-cf6d-488e-81f3-76008e3d8ec1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"adfa13c5-3054-4c0c-9371-59588405032d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["From the Summer Infant Wide View 2.0&#39;s huge 5-inch screen, you can zoom remotely for a better look at your nursery.
