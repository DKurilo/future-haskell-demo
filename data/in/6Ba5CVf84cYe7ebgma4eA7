You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Spring of Knowledge Guitar Magic Evolution has many of the tools you need to improve your guitar skills. With an in-depth look at music styles and plenty of music theory, this advanced <a href=\"/best-guitar-lesson-software\">guitar lesson program</a> will improve your guitar musicality. The complex and deep lessons are helpful while trying to solidify some more advanced ideas, but you should avoid this software if you are a beginner.","For the number of lessons offered by Spring of Knowledge Guitar Magic Evolution, the variety of material covered is decidedly slim. An overwhelming amount of guitar and music theory fills this program at the expense of more basic things such as tuning and hand positioning. Although this software aims to teach beginners, intermediate players and advanced guitarists, we felt that it skimped on guitar essentials. Also, you have to track your own progress by leaving notes as you complete each lesson.","Basic practice tools are included in this guitar learning software, such as a metronome (called a “Click Track”), an animated fretboard and tempo control. Guitar Magic Evolution lacks recording and playback functions as well as interactive games, which would make a lot of the deep theory easier to swallow.","A very impressive chord dictionary helps you learn a profound amount of chords. The program also boasts over 170 different lessons and 100 songs, justifying the high price for this meaty guitar lesson software. However, a few common features such as a computerized guitar tuner are missing from Guitar Magic Evolution.","This program is easy to navigate; the interface is intuitive and the lessons are divided into categories that make it simple to find what you are looking for. The lessons themselves are a bit more difficult to manage. Important building blocks such as note names, parts of the guitar and even how to tune a guitar are assumed to be known rather than taught, leaving a beginning guitarist behind.","Guitar Magic Evolution provides phone and email support as well as a physical mailing address for standard mail. We found it difficult to contact the company through email and the response time was slower than we had expected."]},"id":"44bf4477-a4b5-4b72-9308-8654b603b5dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c8435fbc-d934-4f63-8fd6-5612a10fea7b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Beginning guitarists will quickly find themselves over their heads with this advanced guitar lesson software.
