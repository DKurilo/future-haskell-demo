In addition to burning DVDs, Media Maker also supports data transfer, CDs and music files. Media Maker’s interface allows you to easily drag and drop your DVD movie, specific tracks and files as well as schedule system backups.","NTI Media Maker 8 has several features that contribute its success as a DVD burning software package. We successfully copied to DVD, CD and copied DVDs onto the hard drive. We also had good luck backing up PC files and WAV formats.","For the most basic test we copied a DVD movie onto the hard drive then made a copy to DVD disc with no trouble at all. We also had no troubles working with/converting to MP3, WMA, images and photos (ISO), data folders and files, or Video DVD. The ability to convert OGG files is a rare commodity among the products we reviewed here.","The video and audio conversion features that NTI Media Maker 8 provides add a great deal of functionality to the product that we weren&#39;t able to find in many other applications. The combination of DVD burning features and the ability to convert file types make this a powerful piece of software. The addition of a feature that would allow you to compress a DVD-9 to fit on a DVD-5 disc would help this software perform better in our comparison.","Other interesting and useful features we successfully used include erasing rewritable discs, creating labels for our projects, ripping CDs and Media Maker even has an audio recorder to boast.","Media Maker 8 also boasts the added functionality of supporting DVDs, CDs, dual layer DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. Now, if you want to burn to or from a Blu-ray Disc, you will need a compatible Blu-ray burner. It&#39;s definitely worth having the Blu-ray capability when considering the huge amount of storage space it allows you.","The help documentation was useful. Topics are listed in a way that makes locating them easy. The writing is a bit confusing though so it takes a bit longer to read and comprehend the manual/FAQs. Email support and forums are also offered."]},"id":"de55f52a-8311-428c-ac2a-603ff2a14f47","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"05d3aab2-fd17-4231-8f80-ba1ae325e48f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall,<strong> </strong>NTI Media Maker 8 is an excellent DVD burning software product, though it lacks a few features.
