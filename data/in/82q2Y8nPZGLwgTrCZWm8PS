The company knows how to enhance your cell phone signal while on the road or in a business setting and is unmatched in this field. The Wilson Electronics Dual Band is one of the company&#39;s top-selling <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-boosters\">cell phone boosters</a> for mobile use and comes equipped with everything you need to get the job done.","The device&#39;s high frequency and excellent gain ensure that if there is a signal available, you will be able to use it – and it will be a much stronger signal than you ever thought possible. Hundreds of satisfied customers have praised the Wilson Electronics Dual Band cell phone signal booster, and they are obviously satisfied with their purchase. We found this product to be ideal for emergencies or simply to reduce dropped calls while traveling to and from work. No matter how you plan to use this amazing device, we are sure you will receive quality phone service by doing so."]},"id":"46a60617-833c-4cfc-813e-7f8c5f5c8f92","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Signal Boosting Performance"},"id":"8930dbf9-7b4e-4f89-b3f0-7e7d2f04efcc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Wilson Electronics Dual Band cell phone booster is the most powerful device we reviewed when it comes to increasing the cell phone service you receive while on the road. Like many of the other products on our site, the Wilson Electronics Dual Band is a wireless booster. This will give you the freedom to come and go without unhooking a cord every time. If you want to get the best reception, or any reception, for that matter, you will need to be within just a few feet of the receiver. One major advantage to using a wireless connection is that everyone in the car will benefit from the cell phone booster instead of just one person.","One of the main features you will want to consider when purchasing a cell phone booster is the amount of gain it uses. (Gain, in this context, is the ability of a circuit or amplifier to increase the level of the signal received by your phone.) Since the idea behind a cell phone booster is to ensure that you get a stronger signal, it is obvious that a high gain is ideal. The Wilson Electronics Dual Band has an average gain of around 40dB, which is quite high compared to many cell phone boosters that only reach about 20dBs.","Most cell phone providers are covered under the frequency the Wilson Electronics Dual Band uses. The dual-band capability gives the receiver even more freedom when it comes to capturing the frequencies used by a variety of different service providers. The 900 and 1800MHz frequencies are ideal for use in the United States, and they will work in South America, Asia, Australia and Europe. This broad range of frequencies makes this projector perfect for anyone planning to travel or who simply wants to avoid dead zones while commuting to and from work.","One thing to keep in mind when working with the Wilson Electronics Dual Band is that the amplifier does become quite warm at times and will require a decent amount of ventilation so it does not overheat. You can easily place the amplifier under the driver’s seat and then remove other items to ensure that the amplifier gets plenty of air. Wilson Electronics has included an overload projector in case something does go wrong along the way."]},"id":"2287d2a2-1c52-4f8f-84f2-12592a240195","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Installation Features"},"id":"71eda77d-fd6d-4091-95bf-f6fe564179b7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The main factor in determining the quality of performance you will receive from a cell phone booster is how you set it up and how close you are to the receiver. In testing, we found that the Wilson Electronics Dual Band was able to increase our signal by at least two bars in areas that had no service. This increase allowed us to make calls and receive messages, which was exactly what we were looking to accomplish. In many areas, we found that we were able to increase an almost nonexistent signal to a strong signal and had no problems with making or receiving calls.","since cell phone boosters for cars are centered on you being in the car, the range at which wireless boosters work is minimal. You will need to be within 3 feet of the receiver if you want the best experience possible. Once you leave the 3-foot radius, you will notice that your signal drops dramatically or disappears all together. Once you have everything set up and plugged in, you will need to wait a few seconds before the signal is increased. One thing we were surprised to see is that the Wilson Electronics Dual Band is actually able to prolong the battery life of the cell phones while in use, which is always a welcome bonus."]},"id":"68f0246b-e22b-4aec-b032-07d27c930845","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Antenna Features"},"id":"43f5d18f-9baf-4881-9db7-52b11e01970f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Wilson Electronics Dual Band cell phone booster is quite easy to use once you have everything hooked up and ready to go.

You will notice right from the start that there is a variety of cords, antennas and other parts that are necessary for getting this system up and running.","The first thing you will need to do is locate an appropriate location on top of your car or truck where you can place the antenna. The ideal spot to place it in is near the rear window so the strong magnet doesn’t interfere with any electronic devices inside the car. Once you have connected the antenna, you will need to carefully run the cable under the door seal and into your car.","The next step is to find a location for the signal booster; ideal locations are under one of the front seats or under the dash. The antenna itself can easily be attached to the side of your seat and needs to be at least 8 inches away from a cell phone for optimal performance. Both antennas will need to be connected to the booster, and the final stage is to plug the booster into your cigarette lighter and then let it work its magic.","As you can see, there are quite a few steps required get this system up and running. However, once the process is complete, you simply need to switch the power connector to the off position when you leave the car and you’re done. To make the process even simpler, you will find a detailed step-by-step guide on how to install your cell phone booster that is very easy to follow."]},"id":"66399475-8e8d-4092-9034-1e1dc69d2986","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"614d5ca8-8d2c-47d9-8e59-54cf6ee2975a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Wilson Electronics is the leading cell phone booster company because they know how to produce quality products and keep their customers happy.
