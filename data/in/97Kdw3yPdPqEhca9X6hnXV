You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Panasonic <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD players</a> and Blu-ray players slot seamlessly into your home cinema system. The robust budget models are light on extra features but a smart choice for consumers who want affordable quality and good value. Most are region-free, but it’s a good idea to check before you purchase if you regularly watch discs from other countries. The basic DVD players don’t offer streaming, as they don’t connect to the internet. The feature-rich players do offer internet connectivity and support the use of streaming services.","Although most models have at least one HDMI port, a few use the older composite video output standard instead. Many feature-rich Panasonic DVD and Blu-ray players offer a wired internet connection via Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi, with many products offering both connectivity options. Those players with wireless capability also let you connect peripheral devices, such as storage media, cameras, tablets and computers, so you can access files and watch stored videos, pictures and movies. Most players across the Panasonic range feature a USB port, so you can connect USB-compatible storage and media devices easily.","The most basic models don’t offer high-definition resolution, but they do feature progressive scan capabilities for a smooth, clear image. Midrange and upscale Panasonic players offer 720p HD, 1080p Full HD and 4K Ultra HD. Select players also offer 3D playback for an immersive viewing experience. Many products, including some of the budget-friendly ones, offer upscaling, enhancing the quality of low-resolution content. Select players also offer 4K upscaling, upconverting 720p and 1080p to 4K or near-Ultra HD.","Internet-capable DVD and Blu-ray players offer native apps that you can access from the home screen, including catch-up TV and streaming services. Some models feature a Netflix button on the remote control that, once your account is set up and linked, takes you straight to your Netflix account when you are connected to the internet. The products that play Blu-ray discs as well as DVDs connect to BD-Live, where you can download extra content, chat with other users and play games. Many are also THX certified, with clear, crisp 7.1-channel audio for cinema-quality sound."]},"id":"0b35afda-917d-4818-9d72-25b63dbdad32","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53472","url":"/panasonic-dvd-s68-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-17T21:11:29Z","datePublished":"2011-08-17T21:11:29Z","name":"Panasonic","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-17T21:11:29Z","id":"97Kdw3yPdPqEhca9X6hnXV","meta":{"title":"Panasonic Standard DVD Players - Pros and Cons","description":"Panasonic DVD players offer high-quality images, durable construction and extensive features.
