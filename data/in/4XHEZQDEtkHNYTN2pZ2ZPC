The first batch we tested used name-brand popcorn and name-brand vegetable oil. We let it sit on the hot plate just a bit longer than recommended in an effort to get virtually every kernel popped. Big mistake. That resulted in 16 cups of good-tasting popcorn, but there was a half-cup of slightly burnt corn kernels, with a few of them making their way into the main batch. It also did not alleviate the unpopped kernel situation, because we ended up with about half a teaspoon of unpopped kernels.","The second batch we tried stayed on the heating plate for just under six minutes. The result was wonderful popcorn with no unpopped or burnt kernels. However, this batch resulted in 14 cups. Cuisinart recommends letting the heating plate cool completely before making a second batch and cleaning the device, which we did. The manufacturer also notes that premium popcorn sometimes results in slightly fewer cups. Still, the overall performance of this popcorn maker was great, with no popcorn spills or messes at all.","If you want to make greater quantities of popcorn at once, take a look at the <a href=\"/west-bend-stir-crazy-82505-review\">West Bend Stir Crazy 82505</a>, which can make as much as 24-28 cups."]},"id":"07ce2589-275a-467d-8ba7-ef995df403e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"383986cc-0441-48d3-a898-0a108a4df742","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/cSLiNUNTKKNYXbxsR6UZdX.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Cuisinart CPM-700 EasyPop has an on-and-off switch, which beats plugging and unplugging a popper.
