This smart pedometer bracelet tracks your activity and motivates you to keep moving. It records your daily step count, distance and calories, and heart rate for over a month.","The Vivofit is smart enough to learn your normal activity levels and sets goals for you within your range. Many pedometers require you to set your own goal manually. We like this automatic feature because it allows you to reach an ultimate goal gradually. So whether you&#39;re a regularly training athlete or terrified of the treadmill, the Vivofit tailors your activity goal to something within your reach. The durable rubberized band that houses the actual device and is water resistant to rain, sweat and shower water."]},"id":"db6705dc-b9aa-4785-ba7d-120aed3dd8f9","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/wMnEfBye53iWsQ8fFkvtsc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Another useful feature of this pedometer is the inactivity alert feature. Like many other smart activity trackers and wearable tech, it alerts you when you&#39;ve been inactive for too long. But unlike other pedometers that simply buzz when you&#39;ve been sitting still for too long, the Vivofit displays a red bar that appears under your normal metrics and grows the longer you stay inactive. To reset the bar, simply get up and move. The bar will drop as your activity level increases. This feature is an especially good fit if you work in closed, sitting environments. A simple walk around the office or to the water cooler will be enough to reduce the Vivofit’s inactivity alert.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58617-garmin-vivofit4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMnEfBye53iWsQ8fFkvtsc.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"wMnEfBye53iWsQ8fFkvtsc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMnEfBye53iWsQ8fFkvtsc.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7f4ca71a-0bb1-4847-85ed-6a937d9be9b2","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vivofit tracks more than just your activity. This pedometer also contains a sleep monitor. It&#39;s not as sophisticated as some of the others we&#39;ve seen in activity trackers like this device, but it tracks your movement and the duration of your sleep. When you&#39;re done catching your Z&#39;s and out on the town, Vivofit can record your heart rate with the Vivofit. However, it cannot monitor your heart rate on its own. You’ll need to purchase a compatible heart monitor to wear in conjunction with the Vivofit to take advantage of the heart rate tracking feature.","Garmin Connect is Garmin&#39;s online fitness community. Using this site, you can sync data from your device to check your normal stats and daily accomplishments. The Challenges board shows you where you stand on specific challenges that Connect sets for you and other Vivofit users. We like seeing visualized data paired with smart pedometers so you get a better understanding of your progress from charts and graphs. You can also access Garmin Connect from your phone via the Garmin Connect Mobile app, which is available for both iOS and Android devices.","The most impressive quality in this step counter is the battery life. By eliminating simple features like a backlight and simplifying the syncing abilities, the Vivofit will run for an entire year on two common CR1632 watch batteries. Many comparable activity trackers last only a few days on one charge because of their backlit displays and constant syncing. Though the Vivofit can sync your information to Garmin Connect, the syncing process is activated by a single button and does not send any information automatically."]},"id":"338d3186-272b-44ec-a218-46537d23e475","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5def3355-6dbf-4665-95a6-a5048caf32db","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The battery life on this durable pedometer bracelet far outshines other devices with battery-draining features.
