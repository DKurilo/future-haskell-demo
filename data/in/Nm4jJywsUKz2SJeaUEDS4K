I personally own five music production programs in addition to my main editing software, Pro Tools, and use them for different applications. I tried hard to eliminate any bias before making my recommendations because I realize everyone who uses music production software has unique requirements. Instead, I focused my recommendations on highlighting the features of each product so you can decide which one is right for you.","I talked to David Evanoff, owner of <a href=\"https://davidevanoff.com/\">David Evanoff Sound Designs</a>, about how he uses music production software to create award-winning music for film and television. Although he has access to all the best recording hardware, real instruments and musicians, he told me he still finds value in starting a project with drum loops and software instruments. He uses virtual drums, bass and synthesizers daily to do mock-ups and get the ball rolling.","Rha’Gene Beal, who is pursuing interdisciplinary studies in music with <a href=\"https://online.berklee.edu/\">Berklee College of Music’s online platform</a>, told me he learned how to use the drummer track plug-in in Logic Pro X as part of the music production curriculum at that prestigious institution. He now uses the plug-in regularly to inspire compositions and play along with melodies he writes using only a MIDI keyboard and software.","If you plan to distribute the music you produce with one of these programs, consider a membership to <a href=\"https://www.ascap.com/\">ASCAP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bmi.com/\">BMI</a> or both. In the age of digital publishing, it is important to have the help of large and established advocacy groups to make sure you get paid for the music you produce and publish on sites like Spotify and Apple Music.","<strong>How Much Should I Spend on Production Software? </strong>","A full-featured digital audio workstation (DAW) costs upwards of $500. We chose to focus this comparison of music production software on programs that cost less than $200 for novice sound engineers who want to produce and arrange music on a budget. The biggest differences between some of these entry-level versions and their more robust counterparts are the editing and mixing tools. The user-interfaces look the same, and all the programs we tested accept third-party plugins and virtual instruments. However, if you plan to produce, mix and master your arrangements, consider one of the more advanced versions of the software in this comparison.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent more than 30 hours testing the loop library and virtual instrument catalog while taking note of how easy each program was to install and navigate. The royalty-free-loop grade is based on two factors: the total number of loops and the quality of the sampled instruments used in the loop. A program with a huge loop library full of bad loops doesn’t help much. Similarly, if the samples sound good but lack variety, it will be hard to use them in multiple projects.","We were able to do a side-by-side test of the virtual instrument catalog in each program by recording a short melody played on three often-used instruments and a simple beat played on an electronic drum machine and acoustic drum plug-in. We found similar-sounding presets in each program; recorded a melody on an acoustic piano, Fender Rhodes and lead synth; and issued a score based on the average quality of the instruments. Our final grade is based on the average score for each instrument and drum plug-in.","Our ease-of-use score is based on how easy it was to install the software, control virtual instrument parameters, create a session and export a lossless file that was ready to send to a mastering engineer. We had no problem exporting a master-ready file using the included dynamics and equalization (EQ) plug-ins in each program, but there were significant discrepancies among them in the installation and virtual instrument control tests.","We realize there is a good amount of subjectivity involved in testing software, so we suggest determining the features that are most important to you and choosing a program that provides them. Just because a professional studio or artist you enjoy uses a particular software product doesn’t mean it has the tools you need to produce the music you want.","All the programs we tested support popular third-party plug-in formats, such as VST and AU, so you can supplement a lackluster virtual instrument selection in a program like Mixcraft Pro Studio and take advantage of its incredible editing features and effect plug-ins.","<strong>Important Features to Consider When Choosing Music Production Software</strong>","Genre-Specific Instruments<br/>All the programs we tested provide often-used virtual instruments like piano, drums and strings. If you plan to produce a genre like EDM or hip-hop exclusively, consider a program that has a good synthesizer and electronic drum machine collection because the hardware equivalent is expensive, and you may be using several layers of each. If you write rock music, it will be important to have good acoustic drum sounds and electric bass and guitar plug-ins. Even if you plan to record real instruments, we learned that using virtual instruments to set a roadmap can save time.","Recording<br/>Recording vocals and external instruments can be an important aspect of music production. Beat-making programs that allow you to record multiple sources simultaneously eliminate the need to rent time at an expensive studio. The total track count is important too, especially if you prefer to build an arrangement with many short samples or short recordings of real instruments.","Effect Plug-ins<br/>If you plan to finalize a product that is worthy of posting on YouTube or Spotify, consider a program with a good selection of effects. Virtual instruments and samples usually don’t need too much manipulation, but it is important to compress and EQ the master bus in a project to make sure the song is at a proper volume and sounds good in headphones and larger speakers. Effects like reverb and delay are also important because they add texture and depth to virtual instruments","<strong>MIDI Controllers for Music Production Software </strong>","If you plan to use virtual instruments to build an original composition, a MIDI controller is an important tool to add alongside music production software. Here are a couple of our favorite MIDI keyboards that work with every software we tested. We recommend 49-key controllers because that size is a good fit for a desk, but both of our recommendations are available with various numbers of keys.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Novation-Impulse-Midi-Controller-Keyboard/dp/B005M02VNW/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Novation Impulse 49</a><br/>Novation MIDI keyboards are easy to set up with any music production software and have the best mapping software to help you fully integrate every button and knob. The Impulse series controllers have pressure-sensitive drum pads and responsive, semi-weighted keys. The Novation Impulse automatically maps the faders and knobs when you open the software, and the Automap software enables you to create custom profiles for third-party plugins. In addition to the USB port for connecting to a Mac or PC, the Impulse controllers have a traditional five-pin MIDI connection for controlling hardware synths.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/M-Audio-Oxygen-49-Keyboard-Controller/dp/B00IWU2CBA/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">M-Audio Oxygen 49 MK IV</a><br/>If you&#39;re looking for a controller for less than $200, this is your best bet. The keyboard and drum pads don’t have as many levels of velocity sensitivity as the Novation Impulse, but the M-Audio Oxygen has the same number of faders and knobs. It doesn’t come with helpful mapping software, but the keys and drum pads automatically sync when a software instrument window is open.
