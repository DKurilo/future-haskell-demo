You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Roxio has been around for a while, developing media duplication software. Putting this experience into a <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copy software</a> application gives us Popcorn 4, an interesting and versatile application. Roxio Popcorn 4 has some great browsing functions, an export scheduling utility, and comprehensive format importing. It should be noted that this review was written as a survey review, meaning that the information submitted is culled from other product reviews. We’ll get to the details of this further into the review.","This application comes loaded with the features you have come to expect from Mac DVD copy software application. It will take videos and prepare them for exporting to all of your gadgets, thanks to the vast device profile catalogue. The basic video editing tools allow you to tweak your video and even extract portions of video from the larger whole.","It should be noted however, that this application won’t crack CSS encryption. If you were hoping to back up your DVD collection, or burn those iTunes movies to disc you will be sorely disappointed. You’ll need to supplement this Mac DVD copy software application with a decryption utility application, which can get a bit hairy if you aren’t familiar with the process. The decision to not include CSS decryption is more of a legal decision than processing one, but just as disappointing either way.","Despite a few minor pitfalls here and there, this Mac DVD copy software application seems to be useful and well designed. The biggest and most egregious stumbling block for this application was the installation process. For Macs, this is never more than a simple drag and drop. After that, the application is ready to be up and running, but with the trial version of Popcorn, the application simply wouldn’t start. It was loaded and installed, and would even pop up to start, then immediately shut down. It’s frustrating when an application like this has such strong potential, but is unable to run on multiple computers.","As stated above, Popcorn 4 will help you get your videos where you want them, provided that they weren’t commercially purchased and thus locked up with content security. This application does have great compressing ability allowing you to shrink dual-layer DVDs onto single layer discs and create DVD player-compatible discs. Provided you have content to put on the discs, this application will do a great job of helping you watch them on disc. You can also export your video to multiple devices through the profiles provided for easy video compatibility.","The developers also made it really easy to import your files to this Mac DVD copy software application via either the drag and drop capability or through the great media browser tool in the application. A quiet highlight of this application is the conversion queue. If you have a lot of videos you want to convert, you can create a queue for your computer to work on while you’re not sitting at your computer, freeing up your time and mind. However, this was not the easiest application to install.","From the website, help can be pursued through a direct email address to the support team. There are also FAQs to peruse for answers and guidance with your conversions. For the low-low price of an email, you can register for the forums and join the Roxio community, discussing all sorts of topics with other users."]},"id":"27b8714c-bfd0-4fa4-ba69-584514f11642","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ccf65a2e-d291-45f6-b236-150b7e0e0add","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Popcorn 4 seems to be a great little application.
