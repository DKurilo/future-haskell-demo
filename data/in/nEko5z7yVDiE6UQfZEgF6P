It serves a very utilitarian function and is built quite sturdily, as evidenced by its popularity among informed consumers. This device has a refreshingly basic design and fulfills its main function of picking up dirt and debris, all without the use of a powered brush."]},"id":"234e6c22-bd64-447d-a475-87e2e053349a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/4SAQstydLKTirQAonAQGFG.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57668-sebo-airbelt-k24.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SAQstydLKTirQAonAQGFG.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4SAQstydLKTirQAonAQGFG","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SAQstydLKTirQAonAQGFG.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8db628e2-d917-4626-af4d-ad6cfe089330","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sebo Airbelt K2 acts as a traditional canister vacuum, utilizing a straight-suction brush to remove dust and allergens from the floor. It doesn&#39;t have a spinning brush, which means it won&#39;t agitate dirt and debris as effectively from surfaces like high-pile rugs. The end result is that with higher carpets you can expect to have a more difficult time pushing it around. At the same time, despite its difficulties, the vacuum is able to pick up more than 50 percent of dirt in high-pile carpeting according to a number of tests performed in canister vacuum reviews.","If your home has short carpet or plenty of bare floor surfaces, however, the Sebo Airbelt K2 will excel. The canister itself is designed low to the ground, ultimately aiding in the device&#39;s overall maneuverability. Around it is a protected Airbelt wrap, which serves as a padded surface that protects furniture from dings and dents caused by dragging the canister along behind you while cleaning.","The Sebo Airbelt K2 is very much an agile top rated canister vacuum, with a wand that extends up to a full 4 feet for cleaning in hard-to-reach places, like behind the couch. In addition to that range, the hose itself that attaches the wand to the canister is capable of nearly 9 feet of movement around the canister itself. From a noise standpoint, whereas other vacuums prove to be quite noisy, this is among the quietest of devices, and even contains settings to turn down the motor&#39;s power for even quieter performance.","For individuals in need of a quality small canister vacuum, the Sebo Airbelt K2 will fulfill all of your most basic needs. It may lack a powered brush, but the suction capabilities prove themselves equally capable to competitors in most any circumstance. Sebo proves it is quite possible to create a quality vacuum that excels in performance and efficiency without the need of superficial features."]},"id":"b7152898-4412-4bc1-b607-4460f2a20301","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57696","url":"/sebo-airbelt-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-04T13:31:50Z","datePublished":"2013-10-04T13:31:50Z","name":"Sebo Airbelt K2","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
