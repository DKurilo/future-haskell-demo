You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Denon is a Japanese company that recently merged with Marantz and formed D&amp;M Holdings. Both are great companies that make quality products. Denon has been around for about a century making various audio products. They started out making disc records and gramophones, then moved to cassettes and CDs but now are neck deep in home theater equipment.","Modern Denon makes everything from Blu-ray players to <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a>. The topic of this article is the Denon<strong> </strong>AVR-1910 receiver, which isn&#39;t part of their highest-end equipment and neither did it rank very well in our lineup. Although it is not a bad AV receiver by any means, there are better options for a few bucks more. With a few improvements or for a slightly lower price, this would be a more viable option.","This 7.1 surround sound capable AV receiver has a 100dB signal-to-noise ratio, which is pretty standard. Digital-to-analog conversion can be done at 192kHz for 24-bit. The frequency response goes from 10Hz to 100kHz.  The amount of power this AV receiver consumes is about 460 watts. When you pair that with the 90 watts that it can output through each channel, it&#39;s about par with the Onkyo AV receivers.","There is a nice balanced set of ports on the Denon AVR-1910. There is a single HDMI output and four inputs to cover the basics like your Blu-ray player. If you don&#39;t use HDMI for your HD or you prefer something else, there are two component inputs and one output for video at your disposal. For audio you have a choice between two optical inputs or two coaxial.","If you haven&#39;t jumped onboard with HD yet, there are a whole slew of composite audio and video ports that can be used as well. Those cover about every non-HD device out there, from a CD or DVD player, to your old Nintendo 64. Even though they aren&#39;t HD, it is still good to have these for those devices that don&#39;t run through the newer cables and ports.","There are a few additional connections worth mentioning. One of which is for SIRIUS satellite radio. This form of HD is becoming more and more popular since it offers many more options and promises clearer reception. Satellite radio does cost extra though so if that isn&#39;t your thing then there is the classic AM and FM radio options too.","One of the other nice set of ports is the pretty much standard front panel connections. These usually consist of a single set of composite AV ports, a headphone jack and maybe an auxiliary line-in for connecting an MP3 player and other similar devices. Lastly Denon provides a set of speaker connections for a second room or zone that you can play a separate stream of audio. This works great, for example, if you want to play music through the same AV receiver in another room while someone else watches a movie or TV in the main room.","Aside from THX certification and decoding, this Denon AV receiver has all the audio technology formats at its disposal. From Dolby Digital it has everything from Plus to TrueHD, including Dolby Pro Logic IIz which is the latest version of Pro Logic. On the other side you have DTS also and there is everything from ES to HD Master Audio, including Neo:6, which is the DTS version of Dolby&#39;s Pro Logic. The great thing about virtual surround sound technology like Neo:6 and ProLogic is that it allows for some decent 3D sound over two speakers, especially headphones.","As far as extra features go, we kind of already mentioned most. Just to reiterate though, this AV receiver does have SIRIUS satellite radio available for use. There is a separate set of speaker connections to connect a separate room through the same AV receiver; this feature only always stereo sound on the second zone. Both zones have an equalizer so that you can adjust the sound to fit your taste. Lastly we want to point out the speaker position correction system that will automatically adjust so that you can get the best sound out of whatever speaker setup you use."]},"id":"f69a586c-67cb-41c0-b2a7-577c9f43080c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3053658c-aeac-4c6a-83eb-fc76f4eae663","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All in all this is a great way to go for a home theater.
