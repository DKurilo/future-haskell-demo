We looked at models created by respected name-brand manufacturers, and we looked for a variety of characteristics, including coffee-making options, the time it took to brew a cup of coffee and extras like travel mugs.","We also checked to see how easy each machine was to clean, the overall dimensions, and what – if any – accessories come with each model.","Perhaps most important was how each machine brewed coffee. Some single-cup coffee makers won’t work without buying prepackaged pods of coffee, and these make delicious cups of coffee. However, we wanted to expand the field so you can choose whether to use pods or go with already-ground coffee, K-Cups, loose tea leaves or tea bags.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We researched single-cup coffee makers, keeping in mind that consumers have different tastes as well as different levels of patience as they wait eagerly for a hot cup of coffee in the morning. We considered a wide variety of machines, including regular countertop models and compact coffee makers, paying particular attention to which use soft premade pods or prefilled K-Cups and which let you use your own grounds. The latter takes a bit more time but is a budget-friendly way to brew.","Beyond mere brewing, we looked for machines with extra features that can make your life easier. For example, some machines have an automatic shut-off so you don’t have to worry about burning down your house if you rush out the door and forget to turn off the coffee maker. In addition, you may want a machine that keeps the water tank full and hot, can accommodate both regular cups and taller travel mugs, and has features that enhance the flavor and strength of your coffee.","During our 80 hours of research, we searched the internet and carefully read manufacturers’ websites and online user manuals. We also pored over warranty information. In addition, we watched videos that show how each coffee maker operates, looked at reviews and read reader comments. We also checked to see how extensive and helpful each manufacturer’s customer service is.","<strong>Things to Look For in a Single-Cup Coffee Maker</strong>","How Much Do Single-Cup Coffee Makers Cost?<br/>Single-cup coffee makers range in price from $25 to $250. With this type of appliance, a higher price often indicates the machine is higher quality, more durable and more versatile. More expensive machines also tend to have more features. While more expensive models are typically better, there are excellent single-cup coffee makers in the mid-price range.    ","Brewing Choices<br/>Some of the best single-cup coffee makers let you make a hot, robust cup of coffee using a prepackaged pod of grounds. However, we looked for other models as well so you’d have a greater range of choices. We found machines that let you use loose coffee or tea leaves, pods, K-Cups and even tea bags. This offers great variety for you as a consumer, as well as potential savings if you opt to use ground coffee.","Coffee Strength<br/>The best single-cup coffee makers let you adjust the strength of the coffee you brew, which as every coffee fan knows, is probably the most important feature. Weak, watery coffee doesn’t appeal to anyone, but people have different standards when it comes to what is acceptable “regular” coffee and the best “bold” coffee. With a machine that lets you control the strength, you can brew your java just the way you want it.","Extra Features<br/>Depending on what you’re seeking in a single-cup coffee maker, the extra options and accessories included with your purchase might sway you one way or the other. For example, you might like the idea of a matching thermal travel mug as part of the coffee brewer. Someone else might be pleased with an extra button to add boldness to their cup of coffee. Easy cleaning is another welcome feature, and we looked for coffee makers whose drip trays can be quickly removed and washed, along with the holders for pods and grounds.","<strong>How to Clean a Coffee Maker</strong>","To keep your favorite morning appliance in good shape, you’ll need to clean it regularly.
