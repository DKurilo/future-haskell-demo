Using this software, you can manage and record different stages of sales functions. Sales automation software, which includes <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Salesforce</a>, <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Base</a> and <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Oracle CRM On Demand</a>, allows you to nurture and convert leads and build stronger, longer-lasting relationships with your customers.","Sales automation software usually includes a lead-tracking component, where a sales lead is tracked from first contact to follow-up after a sale is completed. Other functions of sales force automation software can include sales forecasting, call automation, proposal creation, product modeling, order management and <a href=\"/money/small-business\">email marketing</a>. Now more than ever, organizations are searching for full-service, comprehensive sales force automation software and CRM solutions that integrate all aspects of a business.","<strong>Sales Force Automation Software: What to Look For</strong>","Sales force automation software ranges from apps that track calls and purchases to cloud-based software that provides several customer relationship management solutions. Businesses need to evaluate software based on their company’s unique needs and budget. A few things you may want to consider when looking for sales automation software are software types, features and usage.","<strong>Types</strong><br/>Sales software comes in many different forms, built to service small businesses to large corporations. While you can custom build proprietary automation software (software hosted on-premise), the fees for creation, customization, storage and maintenance can be expensive. Most businesses choose cheaper, on-demand and online-based solutions to meet their needs.","Online, open-source and cloud-based software, such as Salesforce, has become a popular choice for businesses. Cloud-based software eliminates overhead and maintenance and offers secure data storage. It also allows you to securely access the software remotely, which is an attractive option if your sales team travels often.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>Sales management software offers a variety of features to accommodate different business&#39; needs, with some software offering a comprehensive, “one-stop-shop” solution and others providing very select features. Different software companies specialize in everything from analyzing sales markets or targets and creating customized sales goals, to marketing research and product development. Some software boasts a focus on sales lead tracking, while others offer more robust tools for customer retention and brand management.","You can decide whether these tools are necessary and order them separately or purchase a more expensive solution that covers all your needs. Ideally, all of your sales software solutions should integrate seamlessly with one another for ease of use and accurate sales data management.","<strong>Usage</strong><br/>In addition to sales software types and features, pricing also depends on how many users require access. Also, some sales software is billed monthly or yearly for unlimited access while others charge per month, per user. You need to know how many users will need access to the software to determine pricing.","By investing in good sales force automation software that matches your business size and model and provides the features you&#39;re looking for at a price you can afford, you can streamline business operations and stimulate sales growth for years to come."]},"id":"54a1de1e-e894-4138-909e-3d4dbfcac9c2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"04091afd-11f9-4745-9984-ea5f52486e87","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Axiom Sales Manager</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Base</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Nutshell CRM</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Oracle CRM On Demand</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Pipedrive</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">PipelineDeals</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Salesforce</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">SalesJunction</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/sales-force-automation-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">SugarCRM</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c7fd2ea4-96a4-4c62-8927-beb1fb6d9e81","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1591","url":"/best-sales-force-automation-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-25T18:52:27Z","datePublished":"2016-10-27T18:18:49Z","name":"Sales Force Automation Software Review","synopsis":"The number of sales force automation software programs available can be overwhelming.
