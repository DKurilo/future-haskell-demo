For instance, this washer has a deep steam, bedding plus and a pure cycle. It also has standard wash cycles such as a normal, a heavy duty and a sanitize cycle. This Samsung washer also includes a handful of specialty cycles such as active kids and baby.","You can choose from a handful of additional options when you run a load of laundry, such as a delayed start up to 24 hours, a prewash and an extra rinse. We are most impressed with the ability to set the child lock and add-a-garment options on this washer.","We are happy to see the sanitize cycle is NSF certified. The cycle uses a high water temperature to remove up to 99.9 percent of bacteria that can be found on clothing and other laundry items.","Another feature we like is the machine’s vibration control via Samsung’s VRT Plus™, which is vibration-reduction technology. 3D vibration sensors on the machine help to lessen vibrations and noise so the washer operates quietly.","This front-load washer can be controlled and monitored via a smartphone app that is available on the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
