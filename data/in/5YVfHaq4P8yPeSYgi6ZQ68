But with your traditional coil-burner electric cooktop, temperature settings can get unpredictable and before you know it, your delicate cream sauce base has burned and the water for your pasta still isn’t boiling. With better kitchen equipment, like the 30” Induction Cooktop with Touch Control 300 Series by Bosch, this disaster could easily have been avoided.","The 300 Series cooktop offers every feature a serious home chef would look for among the <a href=\"/best-induction-cooktops\">best induction cooktops</a> on the market, plus a few that you might not even think of. This induction cooktop’s convenience begins with its sleek design. The black glass top uses the traditional circular burner outline, but with an added twist: If you use a pan that’s smaller than the burner element, the burner automatically adjusts down to fit your pan size, thanks to the PotSense™ feature."]},"id":"afe30b6b-42e3-4fb9-8ddf-53c6942e61c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/cP4eygN6fJrmyWkSxwH7L7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Also convenient is the burner placement, with the smallest six-inch element in the front-right position and the largest 11-inch one slightly behind it. This means you’ll have easy access to pots on both burners, even if the larger one is heating a giant stockpot. On the left side of the cooktop, the nine-inch burner is in front of the six-inch one.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57625-30-induction-cooktop-with-touch-control-300-series1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cP4eygN6fJrmyWkSxwH7L7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"cP4eygN6fJrmyWkSxwH7L7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cP4eygN6fJrmyWkSxwH7L7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4f9b489a-486d-4258-84fa-caf2c4874e9a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Many electric cooktops have built-in kitchen timers, but on the 300 Series cooktop you can preset each individual burner with its own countdown timer, so they automatically shut off at the end of the countdown. And for cooks in a rush, the SpeedBoost™ function allows you to boil water twice as fast as a conventional electric cooktop.","Like many other induction cooktops, the 300 Series has a child safety lock and “keep warm” functions. But it also has an anti-overheat system that shuts burners down when they get warmer than a pre-set temperature and an anti-overflow system that sounds and alarm and shuts off the cooktop if something overflows. Instead of a standard heat indicator light to warn you that the cooktop still has residual heat, this unit lets you know if it’s hot or just warm. And the SafeStart function prevents a burner from turning on if the proper cookware is placed in the proper position.","The Bosch website gives an excellently detailed list of specs and installation requirements for DIY installers, as well as great installation instructions and a user manual for download. There’s also a list of FAQs regarding cleaning and care, cookware and product use. If you want replacement parts or accessories, you can order them via the Bosch website. Bosch also offers a customer service phone number, how-to videos and an email address.  While you can’t order this cooktop directly from Bosch, there is a link to help you find a dealer.","So if you’re serious about cooking at home, the 30” Induction Cooktop with Touch Control 300 Series compares well with the best induction cooktop options. It has a plethora of features that make multi-tasking in the kitchen easier and more convenient."]},"id":"2b911ba2-e9e3-49dc-8f71-51470c4e9a8d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57653","url":"/30-induction-cooktop-with-touch-control-300-series-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-02T09:07:00Z","datePublished":"2013-10-02T09:07:00Z","name":"Bosch 300 NIT3065UC","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
