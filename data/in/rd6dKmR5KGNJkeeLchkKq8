Computers, monitors and gaming systems are also adopting the interface.","For devices that are equipped with standard HDMI ports, connection is simply a matter of connecting the cable. Beyond just the cable, however, there are a number of accessories available that can help consumers customize HDMI connectivity to meet special circumstances.","Some devices, particularly portable ones, may have smaller versions of HDMI which <a href=\"http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/interface-masters-pci-e-40gb-network-adapter,1-1197.html\">require an adapter</a>.

If you want to connect a computer, whether laptop or desktop, to a HDTV, a VGA to HDMI converter is likely to be the best bet. The process is more complex than converting DVI to HDMI because the VGA signal is analog. VGA to HDMI converter boxes are available to do the job. The analog signal is carried from the computer to the converter by a VGA cable and comes out as a digital signal that is sent to the HDTV via HDMI cable. Some audio-video receivers have a VGA to HDMI converter built in.","<strong>Component and S-Video</strong>","If you need to connect a device, such as a DVD player or VCR that only has component audio output available, and need to connect it to the HDMI port on an HDTV, you ll need a Component to HDMI converter. As with VGA signals, component signals are analog so have to be converted to digital to connect to an HDMI interface. There are converters that go the opposite direction, converting HDMI s digital signal to analog component signals but we don t recommend them because the HDCP copyright protection of HDMI is likely to render the converted signal unusable.","Similarly, there are converters that will upscale S-Video output to HDMI.","<strong>USB</strong>","USB connections have become the most common outputs for computers. Any USB output can be made compatible with a HDMI input by using a USB to HDMI converter box. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"88c29753-06be-46ea-b249-ac4e5e166fef","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are three types of HDMI connectors currently available given that the larger Type B interface with 29 pins isn t in use.
