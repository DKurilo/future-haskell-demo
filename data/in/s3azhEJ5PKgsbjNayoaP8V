The best way to prepare is to work on your technique; sit comfortably and practice tests that are similar to the one you ll have to take. These six tips can help you feel more prepared for your upcoming typing test."]},"id":"458af93d-7a07-4e6e-aa23-532c0003fc8e","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Practice</strong>","Typing is a skill, which means that it s something you have to learn and practice in order to be good at it. The best way to prepare for a typing test is to practice typing. You can do this using <a href=\"/best-typing-software\">typing software</a>. If you want to improve your speed, the only way to make it happen is to work at it through constant practice.","<strong>Ergonomics</strong>","Make sure you feel comfortable at your computer. Adjust your chair so your arms comfortably reach the table at a 90-degree angle. Make sure your wrists are straight. Sit up straight in your chair with your back resting against the chair. Place both feet on the ground.","<strong>Use All Your Fingers</strong>","Learn how to type using all your fingers   not just your two pointer fingers. Even though you may be able to type quickly with two fingers, you can type even faster with practice if you use all your fingers to do the work. Typing lessons can help you learn which finger to use to type each letter. This memorization can help your brain direct your fingers to the letters you need without requiring you to look at the keys. As you teach your fingers to find the keys, you can look at the screen to see what you re typing instead of watching your fingers, which will further increase your typing speed.","<strong>Practice a Similar Test</strong>","Not all typing tests are the same. You might take a three- or five-minute typing test, or it may be longer. The test might not allow you to press the backspace key. It might be in the form of a game, or it might be a simple paragraph you must read and copy. If you can, find out the format of the timed typing test you ll be taking. Look online for free online typing tests that are similar to what you might encounter during your test.","<strong>Keep Corrections to a Minimum</strong>","While it s important to type quickly with as much accuracy as possible, going back to correct mistakes can slow down your typing speed considerably. Practice finding the correct keys the first time so you don t have to worry about errors. Use discretion when choosing which errors to go back and correct.","<strong>Practice with New Material</strong>","The material you are tested on will most likely be something you ve never seen before. Chances are you won t have an opportunity to read over the material beforehand. To prepare for your test, practice typing things with which you re not familiar. Don t worry about whether you understand what you re typing; just focus on typing it correctly.","Also, be aware that not all computer keyboards feel the same way. Although it will still be a QWERTY keyboard, which is the standard computer keyboard, the keys may feel a little different when you type on it. They might stick a little more or be a little touchier than the ones on the keyboard you use to practice. Another thing to consider is your surroundings. If you re not used to typing in different surroundings, it may be a good idea to try out a new location. Doing these things might help you feel more relaxed when you take your typing test."]},"id":"57c2db21-ae35-466c-a947-44b85495f537","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5534","url":"/prepare-for-a-typing-test","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kimberly-bowen","url":"/author/kimberly-bowen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kimberly Bowen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"b8MJQh4eTYahbv48ZxQEJk","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-02-28T21:24:25Z","datePublished":"2011-02-28T21:24:25Z","name":"Prepare for a Typing Test","synopsis":"Whether you’re taking a typing test in school or for a job application, preparation is an important factor in the outcome.","review":{},"strapline":"Whether you’re taking a typing test in school or for a job application, preparation is an important factor in the outcome.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-26T17:25:27Z","id":"s3azhEJ5PKgsbjNayoaP8V","meta":{"title":"Prepare for a Typing Test","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
