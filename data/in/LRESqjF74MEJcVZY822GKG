You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool WFE510S0AS stands 46.87 inches high, 29.87 inches wide, 27.75 inches deep and weighs 165 pounds. Unfortunately, this <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktop-ranges\">electric range</a> is only available in stainless steel finish. This Whirlpool model has a ceramic glass cooktop with three burners and one expandable element. The left front element grows from a smaller 6-inch burner to a 9-inch element with the turn of a knob. This burner is placed in a convenient spot, and you don&#39;t have to reach over hot elements to get to any big pots and pans on the nine-inch burner. At its max capacity, the dual burner reaches 3000 watts.","The oven has a max capacity of 4.8 cubic feet. The bake element inside this electric oven can generate up to 2,400 watts while the broil element reaches 3,400 watts of power. It does not have a convection feature, but the oven chamber holds sensors that monitor the internal temperature of the oven and its cooking elements. This Whirlpool model falls on the lower end of the wattage scale; in terms of energy production, wattage only measures the energy a stove or oven can create, not the temperatures it can reach.","This unit has all the useful conveniences you expect in an electric range. On the control panel, you can access the preheat settings, timer, Sabbath Mode and self-cleaning cycles. When you run self-clean, you can set the cycle to run between 2.5 and 4.5 hours, depending on the mess inside the oven.","This electric range comes with a one-year warranty. Whirlpool support is available by phone, email or live chat. In case you lose the original printed manual, you can access the user manual and specs on Whirlpool&#39;s website. The website has easily downloadable PDFs of the installation guide, use and care guide, dimension guide, and warranty information available when you need them."]},"id":"bf0b7ea6-03d1-47ec-940e-bc24920c6934","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bd0b7e65-9454-4603-890f-47a596382f43","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re dying for a ceramic cooktop with an expandable element and don’t need many extra features, this simple electric range is a good choice.
