You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Shark Rotator Pro series of <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaners</a> offers a variety of machines to suit different needs. We wrote our review about the Shark Rotator Pro Lift Away because of its portable canister and wide variety of features.","This bagless vacuum cleaner combines a completely sealed system with filtration that captures and contains 99.9 percent of dust particulate matter and allergens. The filters are washable, so you can reuse them, and the sealed system makes up for what the filters do not contain. The sealed system consists of individual compartments lined with protective rubber that prevent dust from blowing back into your home after you have removed it from the floor. Be aware that although the system is sealed, you are exposed to dirt and dust when you empty the canister and wash the filters.","The vacuum has a power switch that allows you to turn the roller brush on and off so you can clean bare floors and throw rugs. It also has a variable suction control that you can adjust while the machine is running, located on the handle of the machine so you can reach it without bending. You can lower or raise the suction according to what type of surface you are cleaning. This feature is important if your home has a wide variety of flooring surfaces.","The body of the vacuum can separate from the base, so you can carry it in one hand to clean your stairs or car. However, it only has a 25-foot power cord, which is shorter than most, so you have to switch outlets as you go from room to room.","The head of the cleaner rests on pivoting joints, so it is easy to push and steer. The handle does not lie flat to the ground so that you can reach under the bed or coffee table, so you have to use the hose and a cleaning wand or move your furniture to reach underneath it.","The vacuum cleaner&#39;s tools come attached to the body of the machine, so you do not have to search for them or bend over to reach them. With the machine, you get a wand, dusting brush and crevice tool.","Shark has an email address, phone number and live chat service. We were pleased with how easy it is to contact representatives. You can also check out Shark&#39;s FAQs page online, which answers many questions. The vacuum has a five-year warranty."]},"id":"912ac52c-f129-4dfb-b228-d066eeea22bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"993b4721-7e2b-49ee-b7d5-eb5201e6d429","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Shark Rotator Pro Lift Away&#39;s features give it more versatility than most upright vacuums have, with suction control, height adjustment and a canister that separates for cleaning hard-to-reach places.
