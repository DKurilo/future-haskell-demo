The team at Active Junky tested sleeping bags on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado and declared this down sleeping bag the best for men’s backpacking. It’s pricier than other sleeping bags in our lineup, but if you are an active backpacker, you may find it worth the investment.","This 20-degree down sleeping bag is filled with 850-fill pound DownTek insulation. It uses vertical baffles rather than the horizontal most sleeping bags use. Testers liked the design as well as the puffy draft tube that kept cold air from seeping in through the zipper. These features helped this sleeping bag performed as advertised, keeping backpackers warm even in 20-degree nights.","The sleeping bag weighs in at just over two pounds but comes stuffed into a bag the size of a large submarine sandwich. While impressive to look it, testers had a hard time compressing it that small again. Nonetheless, it’s a low-volume sleeping bag that fits easily into your backpack.","The Brooks-Range Drift 20 has a semi-rectangular design that offers a hood and collar combo that keeps your head warm on cold nights, even in windy conditions. One tester called the hood “a halo of warming down clusters.”","The shell is DWR treated to make the sleeping bag further water-resistant. However, one issue the testers found was that the shell was more prone to snags and rips than the more robust down sleeping bags they tested.","<strong>Tester Comment: </strong>The barrier for more people is the price point on Drift 20.  With a long trip coming up, this bag is worth the investment as I’m solid on my pack and tent. Time for a lightweight upgrade.<br/><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Versatile<br/><strong>Best For: </strong>Serious, do-it-all backpackers or car campers who can afford the best.<br/><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>This ultralight backpack is pricy, but its quality and warmth make it an excellent choice for any kind of backpacking trip. Brooks-Range Drift 20 is an especially good investment for campers who need a versatile three-season backpack."]},"id":"a1c83d1b-d4e3-4256-b668-8bc81e59e1e9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68160","url":"/brooks-range-drift-20-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:57:22Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:57:22Z","name":"Brooks-Range Drift 20","synopsis":"While weight and volume are important considerations for a backpacking sleeping bag, comfort and warmth can mean the difference between a great experience and a not-so-pleasant “challenge.&rdquo","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"While weight and volume are important considerations for a backpacking sleeping bag, comfort and warmth can mean the difference between a great experience and a not-so-pleasant “challenge.&rdquo","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-02T19:51:04Z","id":"bDpnCtANYGNPaByFQHsB9m","meta":{"title":"Brooks-Range Drift 20 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Brooks-Range Drift 20 is a lightweight, versatile 20-degree down backpack that provides a warm, comfortable sleep even at freezing temperatures.
