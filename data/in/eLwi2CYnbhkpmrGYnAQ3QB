Although all rice cookers do one function well – that is make rice – we also sought out appliances that provide other helpful features and extras. Some rice cookers make enormous amounts of rice, which is great if you feed a large family, while others prepare only a small amount, which works beautifully if you&#39;re a college student, newlywed, single parent or senior citizen.","Once we had a thorough understanding of how these devices work and which ones offered specific amenities, we checked further to see what consumers had written, what bloggers had to say about particular rice cookers and what expert cooks recommended.","<strong>How Much Do Rice Cookers Cost?</strong>","Like with most other kitchen appliances, you typically pay more for larger sizes and conveniences, like a digital display. You can typically find decent rice cookers between $20 and $70. You&#39;ll also find ridiculously overpriced rice cookers that cost $100 or more. Honestly, if you&#39;re wanting to spend a lot of money on an multi-cooker, you should consider getting an <a href=\"/best-pressure-cookers\">electric pressure cooker</a> instead of a rice cooker. Family-sized pressure cookers give you more cooking options, speedup the cooking process and the best ones cost between $50 and $100.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We browsed the internet for general information about rice cookers, watched user videos and spent time reading about the cooking styles presented by these machines.","We read manufacturers’ websites, compared the claims they made with consumer reviews and examined the fine print in warranties. We also looked at different brands and models for a wide range of prices and features. We sought out rice cookers that do more than simply cook rice, and many do just that, offering steaming for meat, fish or vegetables; cooking modes for grits and oatmeal; <a href=\"/best-slow-cookers\">slow cooking</a> and even cake-baking capabilities.","We also looked at design and found smart rice cookers that use “fuzzy logic,” which means the machine is designed to make adjustments the way a person would. These rice cookers can adapt cooking to external conditions, such as how warm or cold it is and the elevation at which you’re cooking. These machines also adjust to correct human errors in measurement.","In addition, we noted how big each rice cooker was, the space it might require on a countertop, the drawbacks (a very hot exterior or one that spits hot water onto the counter, for example), portability and how easy it is to clean.","<strong>How Long Do You Steam Vegetables in a Rice Cooker?</strong>","The quick and not terribly helpful answer: What kind of vegetables are you steaming? We’re not avoiding the question – steaming times differ from rice cooker to rice cooker depending on the size of the vegetables, whether or not you have chopped them into smaller chunks, and how much your rice cooker can hold. First things first, check to see if your rice cooker came with a steaming basket or tray. If it did, you can steam.","Next, consult your rice cooker&#39;s instruction manual for the manufacturer’s recommended method and steam time for your vegetable of choice. If the vegetable isn’t listed in the instruction manual, you can use handy online resources like this chart found on <a href=\"https://www.gourmetsleuth.com/recipes/detail/rice-cooker-recipe-steamed-vegetables\">GourmetSleuth.com</a>, which tells you how much water to use and the recommended steam time based on amount of veggies you&#39;re cooking. Some people like firm steamed vegetables and others prefer them mushy, and you may need to experiment with the time to get the firmness you prefer. Using these guidelines, you’ll be steaming up healthy vegetables and other foods in no time.<br/><strong><br/>What to Look For in a Rice Cooker</strong>","Pricing<br/>There is a surprising amount of pricing variety when it comes to rice cookers. Some of the smaller capacity devices can cost loads more than the large capacity ones. It really just comes down to what you need and what convenience features you&#39;re willing to pay for. The Oster 6 Cup, the least expensive rice cooker at the time of our comparison, only costs $18.76 on Amazon, while Zojirushi 5.5 Cup, the most expensive unit costs a whopping $149. Typically, products, like Zojirushi, that offer a digital interface and the ability to cook more than just rice will cost more.","Capacity<br/>Rice cookers vary from 6- to 20-cup sizes, so you&#39;ll need to decide how much rice you want to make on a regular basis so you don&#39;t get a cooker that&#39;s too small. On the other hand, it&#39;s smart to check dimensions, since you probably will want to store this in a cupboard. In addition, some models spit water out of their steam vents, so you&#39;ll want to choose one that fits in your kitchen so the steam won&#39;t harm your cupboards or countertop.","Smart Features<br/>Some first-rate rice cookers use what is called &#34;fuzzy logic,&#34; which means the device is designed to interpret and even correct human actions. These kinds of rice cookers can handle value terminology such as &#34;almost&#34; or &#34;slightly,&#34; and adjust for environmental conditions such as the heat of day or the elevation where you&#39;re cooking. These rice cookers also can fix your mistakes in measurement.","Extras<br/>Certain features, although not essential to making rice, are helpful if you use a rice cooker frequently. For example, having a nonstick interior makes cleaning considerably easier, and you can save even more time if the removable parts can be put in the <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a>. Some rice cookers come with scoops, measuring cups and spoons. A steamer basket is exceptionally helpful, since it lets you cook other foods in the top part of the rice cooker while the rice cooks below.
