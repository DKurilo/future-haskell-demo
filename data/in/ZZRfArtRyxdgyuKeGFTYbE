It’s capable of integrating with all the most common accounting software, such as QuickBooks, Sage, Wave and Xero, making the payroll processing a fully automated experience. And since all of your information is stored in the cloud, you don’t have to worry about losing information from a crashed computer system.  <br />\n  <br />\nADP has three payroll suites designed for 1-49 employees (Run Powered by ADP), 50-999 employees (ADP Workforce Now) and 1,000 or more employees (ADP Vantage HCM). At each level, the payroll is automated and the tax compliance issues are automatic.   <br />\n  <br />\nHowever, many features of ADP are not included in the package cost and require additional fees for filing tax document and other more specialized services like mailing checks to employees or placing wages on prepaid debit cards. The packages also don’t include HR services, but you can easily add them as you need to, but at a cost. In addition, ADP charges a rather steep $200 setup fee, but you get two months free and can cancel the service if you’re dissatisfied. In this way, ADP allows you to test drive it long enough to get a good idea of how it fits your needs before committing to it."]},"id":"02216e22-c80a-4716-a1ca-c7f00c41ccfc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best for Handling Freelancer Payrolls"},"id":"ef1ad429-d44c-476b-a4a4-ed68604c4961","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/6U4CogsXaE65HkfMRjuCrZ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/Y/3/828075/original/Gusto.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6U4CogsXaE65HkfMRjuCrZ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6U4CogsXaE65HkfMRjuCrZ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6U4CogsXaE65HkfMRjuCrZ.jpg","alt":"Gusto"},"id":"05e79e43-e77e-403e-a0e3-8903917c2329","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Gusto\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"Gusto","pros":["Compatible with all major accounting software","Filing tax forms is free","Unlimited payees"],"cons":["Employee Benefits features aren’t available in every state","Doesn’t do payroll for international employees"]},"id":"9d0272e0-2d4e-4b95-808f-a895fb5a614f","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With unlimited payees at an affordable cost each month, Gusto is the best online payroll service for small and medium businesses who work with contractors.

We specialize in a wide variety of categories, ranging from consumer focused tech products to services for small and medium businesses. We devote between 40 and 140 hours researching, testing and carefully analyzing products and services to find help you make the best purchasing decision for you. Our reviewers consult with experts within the field to pinpoint where those purchasing decisions are for consumers and businesses. ","<strong>What We Evaluated</strong>","It might be a marketing cliche, but the purpose of an online payroll service is quite literally to save your business time and money by automating the entire payroll process. Imagine turning a full day of getting payroll ready for your employees into a matter of minutes. You gain valuable time, allowing you to turn your focus towards other priorities, like coming up with new strategies for growing your business. So with this in mind, we evaluated each service’s ability to automate the payroll process, and compared this with the cost savings.","We found most payroll services offer essentially the same benefits and services, such as tax withholdings and filings. The major difference in these services is the overall design of the cloud platform and SaaS features, which can determine how well the service fits your needs and whether it’s scalable enough to fit your expected growth over time.","We looked at how easily these cloud-based SaaS companies integrate with your accounting software, tax filings and time clock management. And we evaluated how well the service can grow with your business by looking at how easy you can add and remove to scale the platform to your needs.","In addition, while the basic pricing structures are similar from one service to another, we found that often cheaper services may have more affordable costs per employee but charged additional fees the more expensive services didn’t, like tax filings. Depending on your business’ size, these additional fees can actually make the more affordable monthly option less cost-effective in the long run. So, it’s important to research the cost-impact of multiple services before committing to a service. And if you can, use services with trial periods or commit only to a short test period where you can see if the service fits your needs and budget. ","<strong>How Much Does Online Payroll Cost?</strong>","Most cloud-based payroll services require you to speak with a representative to get an accurate quote of how much the services costs. This is because most of these services are module-based SaaS - you can pick and choose what kind of functions and features you want for your business. That said, most online payroll services have a pricing structure based on a month fee between $20 and $100 with an additional fee for each employee you have on payroll. Those fees cost between $1 and $15 per employee for each payroll you run.","<strong>How to Make a Payroll Checklist</strong>","If you go shopping around for an online payroll service without knowing what you need, you risk spending money on services and features you don’t need or choosing a service that lacks a feature you need or wish you had, like HR features and benefits. As such, John Duval of <a href=\"https://www.fuseworkforce.com/blog/software-for-payroll-checklist-how-to-choose-the-best\">Fuse Workforce</a>, recommends taking the time to closely evaluate the following payroll checklist:   "]},"id":"b37dad37-091e-47d1-8ef0-1e9b7ed6bbc1","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Company Size: First and foremost, you need to consider size - number of employees, freelancers, and vendors. Most payroll services have packages for small, medium and large businesses, which include a monthly fee or a fee for each processed payroll. But also, most services also charge a fee for each employee on the payroll. This is vital information to have ready so you know each services cost impact. ","Payment Structure: You also need to know how many employees are salary, hourly, paid commissions and your over-time policies.","Payment Delivery: Decide whether to offer your employees the options of a direct deposit, printed checks delivered at work or mailed checks.  ","Locations: If you have offices in separate locations, you have to determine how this might affect the pay structure and delivery. For example, if hourly workers are in a remote office, you need a service with remote check-in features to manage their time. You also may need to account for how the service is capable of handling the complexities in tax withholdings for various states, localities and countries.","Customization: Do you want to be able to adjust how the online payroll services dashboard looks and how features are organized? Is internal branding important to you?","Scalability: Every online payroll service claims to be scalable, but some are better than others. You need a service capable of adapting to your company’s growth.","System: Online payroll services integrate with most accounting software but they also offer cloud-based software.","Suite or Siloed: Online payroll services typically offer full suites or siloed features, where you can pick and choose what features you want. Are you looking for something comprehensive with a simple payment structure or a siloed service you can customize, but which may be more difficult to evaluate from a billing perspective?","Mobile: Do you want mobile access to payroll, allowing you to access it anywhere? ","Support: How much do you value support? Any time you’re looking to do business with a service, especially one handling something as important as your employee’s paychecks, you need to carefully evaluate the service’s support features.","Employee Self-Service: How much access do you want to provide your employees? Most payroll services have cloud-based platforms designed specifically for your employees to request PTO, view company policies, choose health benefits, download pay stubs, access tax documents and punch timecards. ","Alerts: Do you want to be alerted to issues and errors? Do you want reminders for deadlines? Choosing a service with alerts helps keep you on track.","Taxes: Tax withholdings and filings are among the most complicated and error-prone issues with doing payroll on your own. Most online payroll services automatically withhold your employee’s taxes and make the payments and filings for you. However, some charge an additional fee to do this, especially at the end of the year. Look for a service with an accuracy guarantee on their tax withholdings. ","Lifecycle Management: By integrating HR and payroll into one platform, you can take care of the full lifecycle of an employee, from hiring to retiring.","Additional Modules: Are there any additional needs specific to your business? For example, do you have to meet specific federal requirements as a contractor or do you have employees who have special wage garnishment requirements?"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6f193132-15aa-4acc-acd2-cbed4f240752","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_378","url":"/best-online-payroll-services","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-13T15:45:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-13T15:45:00Z","name":"Best Online Payroll Services 2019","synopsis":"A good payroll service allows a smaller business to operate like it has fully staffed accounting and HR departments, giving you more time to focus on growing your business.","review":{},"strapline":"A good payroll service allows a smaller business to operate like it has fully staffed accounting and HR departments, giving you more time to focus on growing your business.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-15T16:19:29Z","id":"ZZRfArtRyxdgyuKeGFTYbE","meta":{"title":"Best Online Payroll Services of 2019","description":"A good payroll service allows a smaller business to operate like it has fully staffed accounting and HR departments, giving you more time to focus on growing your business."},"products":[{"slug":"adp","url":"/product/adp","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","name":"ADP","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","id":"3W88enLXpZPTVurx2zEqDR","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gusto","url":"/product/gusto","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","name":"Gusto","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","id":"C2eAHTC35JDSSksZzJc2YN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"mypayrollhr","url":"/product/mypayrollhr","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","name":"MyPayrollHR","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","id":"bYac3stTwb2bTzwkmogpu7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"trinet","url":"/product/trinet","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","name":"TriNet","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","id":"qKL7QChVFb9AiYvimJHF76","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"paycor","url":"/product/paycor","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","name":"Paycor","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","id":"DbRgU8VfXGkaDVyqA6znaR","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/uTMwEZNBEvwdNW92W7msCd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Online-Payroll-Services.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/5/U/819282/original/Hero-Online-Payroll-Services.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","id":"uTMwEZNBEvwdNW92W7msCd","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTMwEZNBEvwdNW92W7msCd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Online Payroll Services 2019","description":"A good payroll service allows a smaller business to operate like it has fully staffed accounting and HR departments, giving you more time to focus on growing your business."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/uTMwEZNBEvwdNW92W7msCd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Online-Payroll-Services.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/5/U/819282/original/Hero-Online-Payroll-Services.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:07:53Z","id":"uTMwEZNBEvwdNW92W7msCd","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTMwEZNBEvwdNW92W7msCd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Online Payroll Services 2019","description":"A good payroll service allows a smaller business to operate like it has fully staffed accounting and HR departments, giving you more time to focus on growing your business."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[]}
