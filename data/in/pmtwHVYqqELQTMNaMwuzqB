You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This 40-gallon <a href=\"/best-water-heaters\">water heater</a> is the ideal size for small families. Dual heating elements combine to produce better efficiency, and the non-CFC polyurethane foam insulates the tank to reduce heat loss and lower your energy costs. The American Residential Electric tank itself features the traditional tubular shape, and its corrosion-resistant lining helps you get the most out of the 40-gallon electric water heater for years.","American prides itself on the reliability of its models, and backs them up with a six-year warranty on the tank and its parts. A built-in electric junction box makes installing the water heater simple and quick, and the temperature-control feature allows you to set limits and prevent overheating after you’ve installed the tank. An anode rod mounted atop the tank protects and extends the life of it.","All American water heaters come with a fused ceramic shield lining, which is fused to the interior of the tank at extremely high temperatures to create a lining that resists corrosion. The eco-friendly non-CFC foam helps you trap heat in the tank, which reduces the energy used to reheat the tank or maintain the desired temperature. A dip tube minimizes the dilution by carrying any cold water deep into the tank, so you don’t see drastic temperature changes.","Like most new electric models, the tank comes with a 3/4-inch water connection on the top, as well as a side temperature and pressure (T&amp;P) relief valve. The T&amp;P valve is CSA certified and ASME rated. It also offers a top opening for field installation. The unit’s brass drain valve is also childproof. American’s models have met or exceeded the standards set by UL 174 and BOCA. They’re also compliant with the thermal efficiency and standby loss requirements dictated by the U.S. Department of Energy.","The American Residential Electric water heater is a dependable, basic model for moderate water consumption. It should provide a small family with plenty of hot water for showering, dishes and other household duties. The electric heater acts more quickly than gas water heaters."]},"id":"bb45218f-07dc-40b3-86c4-b40064705933","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62026","url":"/american-residential-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T21:26:30Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T21:26:30Z","name":"American Residential Electric 40 Gallon","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
