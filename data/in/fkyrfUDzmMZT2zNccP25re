Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","HomeDNA’s GPS Origins test shows the historical migrations of your genetic ancestry, something that no other <a href=\"/best-dna-testing-kits\">DNA test kit</a> we tested showed. This company also shows your biogeographical ancestry in the most depth and with the most potential percentages of any of the tests we reviewed. However, like the <a href=\"/national-geographic-review\">Geno 2.0 test from National Geographic</a>. there is no DNA matching with this test and you can’t find relatives through this test. If you’re interested in taking advantage of the migration tool and also want to connect with matches, we recommend taking the ancestry test from Ancestry.com and then paying the fee to transfer your results from Ancestry to HomeDNA.","The GPS Origins test required me to swab my cheek with two cheek swabs for 30 to 60 seconds each. But there was no vial or plastic bag to put the swabs in like the other tests I took. Instead there was a paper envelope that got a little soggy after the wet swabs had sat in it for a while. This was a little gross when it came time to mail my sample, but the results came back with no problems. This test took 29 days to complete from the time I sent my samples in. One great part was that the customer service reps I spoke with gave me an estimated date of completion when I called to confirm that my DNA samples had made it to the lab. Only three companies – <a href=\"/familytree-dna-review\">FamilyTree DNA</a>, Living DNA and this one – gave estimates of when the tests would be completed.","This test is almost two times more expensive than many of the other tests we reviewed. It is more affordable if you sign up for one of the other DNA testing services and then transfer your raw DNA results to GPS Origins. You can transfer results from 23 and Me, Ancestry.com, FamilyTree DNA and National Geographic Geno 2.0.","The biogeographical ancestry results from this company were more high level than other companies I tested. Instead of zeroing in on specific countries, it focused on regions. It identified my ancestry as originating from Fennoscandia, Southern France and the Orkney Islands. Other companies were more focused, but all admixture results aren’t accurate at country-specific levels. The percentage breakdown from GPS Origins was one of the most specific of all the breakdowns. It listed 13 potential biogeographical ancestries in my past.","The most interesting part of the GPS Origins test, however, is the migration stories that it compiles. Using markers like pins on a Google Map, you can zoom in and see where your genetic ancestry originated from and migrated to. Clicking on the pins brings up specific dates and other information about the migration. No other service we tested had a feature like this.","If you’re looking to learn about the migration patterns of your ancient ancestry, this is the only DNA test kit that provides this information. However, it is cheaper to test your DNA with another company and transfer the results to GPS Origins than to take the test from HomeDNA. You can transfer from multiple companies, but we recommend you test with Ancestry.com, our pick for the best ancestry DNA test, and then transfer your results over."]},"id":"541e843d-0c99-482b-80ed-4bef31ac0a01","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61523","url":"/homedna-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-12T03:12:23Z","datePublished":"2014-12-12T03:12:23Z","name":"HomeDNA GPS Origins Ancestry Test","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":22,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","id":"fkyrfUDzmMZT2zNccP25re","meta":{"title":"HomeDNA GPS Origins Ancestry Test Review - How It Works","description":"HomeDNA&#8217;s GPS Origins test shows the historical migrations of your genetic ancestry, something that no other DNA test kit we tested showed."},"products":[{"slug":"homedna-gps-origins-ancestry-test","url":"/product/homedna-gps-origins-ancestry-test","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","name":"HomeDNA GPS Origins Ancestry Test","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","id":"tiVswV4ToqMjqmPQuJfArF","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/iLfdJ4AmnKVHCRkAq74XnG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","mimeType":"","name":"f4d0ea6993f69b5241ea05059b8cec68.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f4d0ea6993f69b5241ea05059b8cec68.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","id":"iLfdJ4AmnKVHCRkAq74XnG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iLfdJ4AmnKVHCRkAq74XnG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"HomeDNA GPS Origins Ancestry Test Review - How It Works","description":"HomeDNA&#8217;s GPS Origins test shows the historical migrations of your genetic ancestry, something that no other DNA test kit we tested showed."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/iLfdJ4AmnKVHCRkAq74XnG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","mimeType":"","name":"f4d0ea6993f69b5241ea05059b8cec68.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f4d0ea6993f69b5241ea05059b8cec68.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","id":"iLfdJ4AmnKVHCRkAq74XnG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iLfdJ4AmnKVHCRkAq74XnG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"HomeDNA GPS Origins Ancestry Test Review - How It Works","description":"HomeDNA&#8217;s GPS Origins test shows the historical migrations of your genetic ancestry, something that no other DNA test kit we tested showed."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/home/best-dna-testing-kits/homedna-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"genealogy","url":"/hobbies/genealogy","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","name":"Genealogy","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:03:31Z","id":"PuNCGX8PqZvk7d7PyEvJ9P","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
