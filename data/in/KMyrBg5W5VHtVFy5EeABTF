You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With infrared technology being one of its strongest features, the Moultrie I-45S Game Camera doesn&#39;t have a lot to set it apart from other <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-cameras\">game cameras</a> on the market. It has a decent resolution of 4 MP, but there are cameras with higher resolutions available. This game camera ranks among the top 10 best game cameras on today&#39;s market because it is reliable, it consistently provides decent footage, it has a decent focus range, it has a durable and well-designed case, and it is easy to use. While it doesn&#39;t really excel in any of the categories, it is a decent camera that does outrank other available options.","This camera captures photos using infrared technology. On the outside of the camera, you can see where the internal motion sensors sit to trigger the camera and capture footage. The SD card slot, an LCD display screen for settings, the power switch and the navigation tools all sit on top of the camera. We found through our research of this and other trail cameras that these are important design features to take note of. Some game cameras have the SD card slot on the bottom, and when foul weather hits, the rain and debris run down the camera and end up in the SD card slot. With the card slot located on the top, gravity will work in your favor and you won&#39;t have to worry about foul weather or debris ruining your camera.","The photo resolution of this camera is 4 MP, and the range of the photos is approximately 50 feet. Photos taken during the day will turn out better than photos captured in the evening, but we were able to capture good photos during each setting. The default settings on the camera are set to capture footage in the highest possible photo quality. This can be adjusted between low, medium, high and enhanced.","The I-45S has the ability to capture still photos as well as video footage. If you are capturing still photos, you can take continuous photos and capture up to three photos from a single trigger. When capturing videos, you have the option to capture footage for five, 15 or 30 seconds.","To access the battery compartment, you will need to rotate the knob on the outside of the camera. The battery tray will slide out, and you will need to install four D-size alkaline batteries. We found that the battery life of this cameras is not the greatest, and the average battery life is around a month. As we mentioned earlier, there is an SD card slot on the top of the camera. The camera is compatible with cards with up to 16GB of memory, which won&#39;t last as long as some cameras&#39; cards but will still provide a decent number of photos and video footage.","There are several resources available that you can access for support for your I-45S Game Camera. Packaged with the camera, you will find a user&#39;s manual that is also available online. The user&#39;s manual is very helpful. While the camera is simple to navigate and control, we found helpful information and usage tips inside the  manual.","If you have questions that can&#39;t be answered by looking through the user&#39;s manual, you can contact Moultrie using its toll-free telephone number or through the email address that is listed on the company&#39;s website. We attempted contacting support through the email address and never received a response. We were able to contact support by phone. We were connected fairly quickly to a knowledgeable representative who was able to answer each of the questions we proposed. We recommend contacting the company by phone if a problem or question does arise with your game camera."]},"id":"d3c7cfc2-eec0-4721-9929-9bf03c4f54c4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c54da460-8170-4afc-8477-b9baed2cee83","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While this isn&#39;t our top choice for a game camera, it is a decent camera that works properly and provides average results. There are no extra hidden bells or whistles that you should expect, but it will capture footage just as it is designed to.
