Many systems also assist you in gathering contact information from your customers that you can then use for your marketing efforts.","Our Android POS systems review can help you find options that run on the Android platform and include essential POS features.

Most are regularly upgraded, and the upgrades are included in the subscription price, so you get new features as soon as they&#39;re released. However, you need reliable internet access to run this type of system. If this isn&#39;t available in your area, a downloadable program that runs offline may be a better option.","<strong>Offer unlocked hardware.</strong> Before choosing a system, you want to find out if the POS hardware is locked (specific to that system) or if it&#39;s unlocked and can be used with other systems. Choosing a system with unlocked hardware may save you money in the long term, as you may be able to keep using it if you switch POS systems or processors.","<strong>Are scalable.</strong> Choosing a system that can expand as your business grows can save you the time and frustration of switching systems later. All the systems in our review allow you to add extra POS stations and provide apps for mobile devices that you can use to speed up checkout lines. Many offer integrations for ancillary services such as accounting and marketing that may be useful as your business grows.

Most systems have apps that you download to your Android tablet, though some companies sell the tablets or proprietary equipment with the POS software preloaded on them. The tablet connects to or is used alongside the card reader or terminal provided by your payment processor. The POS system records sales transactions and generates reports that help you analyze your business&#39;s performance. Many include additional features that help you run your business, such as inventory and customer management tools.","You can connect the tablets to POS hardware such as receipt printers, cash drawers and tablet stands to create a countertop checkout station. Many systems also allow you to add more tablets or phones as well as peripherals such as barcode scanners to the system.","Many POS systems are designed to be used by either retail businesses or restaurants; however, some companies offer solutions for multiple business types, including retail, restaurants, and service-based businesses like salons and spas. Some POS companies offer systems that cater to specific types of retail business, such as clothing stores, florists or jewelry boutiques. All of the Android POS systems we reviewed offer a retail solution; these are often also suitable for counter-serve restaurants. Half of the systems can also be used by full-service restaurants.

If you&#39;re looking for a <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing company</a> to use with your Android POS system, we&#39;ve got a review for that as well. Our <a href=\"/money\">articles about POS systems and payment processing</a> can help you learn more about these topics.","<strong>Why Is It Difficult to Choose an Android POS System?</strong>","Each Android POS company offers a different combination of software, hardware and payment processing, and many also strive to create a one-stop solution by offering ancillary features for things such as marketing, accounting and employee management. Because there&#39;s such great variance between systems, it&#39;s difficult to compare pricing and overall value. As you evaluate your options, consider the costs for all three components in your calculations.","You also want to determine which ancillary services you require and whether it&#39;s more cost-effective to choose a POS system with these features built in, particularly if it requires you to subscribe to a higher service tier, or to get them as add-ons or third-party integrations, which may also cost extra.","<strong>Android vs. iPad: Which POS Platform Is Better?</strong>","Although some POS systems can be used with either Android tablets or <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">iPads</a>, some are platform specific. If you have a strong preference for one platform over the other, or if you already have tablets and phones you want to use, this is an important consideration as you&#39;re evaluating systems.","Android is the more popular platform, with over 2 billion devices in use. Because multiple manufacturers develop Android tablets, there&#39;s more competition in the market, resulting in lower pricing and a broader product selection, which can save you money as you set up your system, add devices, or replace broken, lost or stolen tablets. Many developers prefer Android, as it allows greater customization than iOS. However, iPads are well regarded for their ease of use, superior security and overall stability.","<strong>Android POS Contract Terms &amp; Conditions: What to Watch For</strong>","Most Android POS companies provide service on a month-to-month basis; however, some require you to sign multi-year contracts. Before you sign up with any POS company, it&#39;s important to read the contract and understand what you&#39;re agreeing to. You want to pay special attention to the length of the term, the cancellation procedure and penalties, and all fees. If the company will also be providing your credit card processing service, you want to verify that you have the full contract, as it&#39;s often a three-part document (application, terms of service and program guide).","<strong>&#34;Free&#34; POS Hardware &amp; Leasing Contracts</strong>","It&#39;s always more cost-effective over the long term to purchase your POS equipment upfront. However, if you choose to accept free POS hardware or participate in a &#34;free placement program&#34; offered by your payment processing service, or if you choose to lease equipment, you need to make sure you understand what you&#39;re agreeing to and what your responsibilities are. These contracts can be inflexible, and some are noncancelable, even if your business closes, leaving you personally responsible to fulfill all obligations. If the contract is cancelable, you want to find out what the cancellation fees are and if the company also charges liquidated damages (the amount of money the company expected to earn on your account for the time left on your contract).","You need to know the length of the initial term and subsequent terms, how long you have to cancel before the term automatically renews, and what process you must follow. Contracts typically have three-year terms, though some may be as short as one year or as long as five, and most only give you 30 days to provide written notice of your intent to cancel your account.","You also want to find out if you&#39;re expected to return the equipment at the end of the term or if you&#39;ll own it. If you&#39;ll need to return it, you want to find out if there are wear-and-tear penalties or restocking fees, and how much it would cost to purchase it at the end of the lease if you want to keep it.","<strong>Android POS Systems: More Recommendations</strong>","Our top recommendation, Epos Now, is a good Android POS system for most businesses, regardless of type and size.
