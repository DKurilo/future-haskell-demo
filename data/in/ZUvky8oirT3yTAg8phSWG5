TopTenREVIEWS has just released a comparison of the best wireless earbuds that are Bluetooth compatible. They examine how each device holds up to casual listening as well as exercising and exposure to moisture. Most importantly, TTR reports which earbuds produce superior sound quality even in loud environments."," "," "," ","&#34;Wireless earbuds are a handy, comfortable solution to flapping cords, whether you&#39;re outside gardening or running through the park,&#34; said Lecia Monsen, Managing Editor of TopTenREVIEWS. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about accidentally ripping your earbuds out of your ears.&#34;","<strong>The Top 3</strong>:","1. <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Jaybird JF3</a>: TTR&#39;s Gold Award winning wireless earbuds can be paired with multiple Bluetooth-enabled devices, and they have a sporty design. The honeycomb cushion inserts and a cord that wraps behind the neck keep them in the ears during physical activity.","2. <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/jabra-sport-coach,review-2952.html\">Jabra SPORT</a>: The Silver Award Bluetooth earbuds have noise-isolating earbuds that always keep music sounding clear and vibrant. They also feature dual microphones that keep call quality clear, even in windy conditions.","3. <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1071-best-cheap-wireless-earbuds.html\">Motorola S9</a>: The Bronze winning S9 earbuds feature easy-to-use buttons for controlling music and phone calls. The padded behind-the-head design makes these some of the most comfortable Bluetooth earbuds for consumers.","[<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Complete Wireless Earbuds Review</a>]","<strong>What Makes Top-Notch Wireless Earbuds?</strong>","The best wireless earbuds are not only Bluetooth compatible, but easy to pair with more than one Bluetooth device. They also need enough battery life to last for hours of talk and listening time, and there should be easy-to-use controls for doing so. As TopTenREVIEWS researched and analyzed each set of earbuds, they used the following four criteria.","<strong>Performance:</strong> Even though earbuds lose the wires, they don&#39;t lose performance. The Bluetooth earbuds TTR reviewed compared with even the best wired earbuds for MP3 players. Researchers looked for wireless earbuds with a wide frequency range and optimal impedance and power levels that would result in superior sound quality. There should also be a minimum Bluetooth range of 30 feet.","<strong>Features:</strong> All Bluetooth earbuds TopTenREVIEWS reviewed have buttons on the earpiece that control volume, skip tracks, answer/reject phone calls and pair devices. One specific control to look for is a multipurpose button, which can control a majority of these. Additional items to look for are dual microphones, replaceable noise-isolating ear tips and resistance to moisture.","<strong>Design &amp; Specifications:</strong> TTR reviewers also tested battery life. Using the wireless earbuds to talk on the phone uses more battery than just listening to music, but users should look for earbuds that last at least four hours of continuous talk time. The best earbuds feature lightweight materials, batteries that charge in less than two hours and behind-the-neck cord design for added stability.","<strong>Warranty &amp; Support:</strong> The best wireless earbuds come with at least a one-year warranty, a user manual and downloadable help documentation. TopTenREVIEWS found many manufacturers feature live chat options for technical assistance, which is helpful for tasks such as setting up the Bluetooth and pairing devices. Consumers should also look for earbuds whose websites have user forums and FAQs.","Wireless technology is making consumer electronic devices more convenient. The wireless earbuds reviewed by TopTenREVIEWS untangle music fans from their MP3 players, phones and other mobile devices. A set of earbuds that rests comfortably and securely in the ears is ideal for the mobile consumer.","<em>More product reviews can be found at </em><a href=\"/\"><em>TopTenREVIEWS</em></a><em>.</em> "]},"id":"967d9014-ffa6-4abb-b4d6-7c59cc7c583e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7390","url":"/best-bluetooth-earbuds-revealed","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"toptenreviews-editors","url":"/author/toptenreviews-editors","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"TopTenREVIEWS Editors","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6yWTF9SkaD2BnPo6GVTbs8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-06-12T14:13:58Z","datePublished":"2012-06-12T14:13:58Z","name":"Best Bluetooth Earbuds Revealed","synopsis":"Mobile consumers understand the importance of wireless products that don't tie them down.
