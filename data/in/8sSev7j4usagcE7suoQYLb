One advantage of this pressure pool cleaner is that it does not require an external booster pump. Its cleaning technology is powered by cleaning jets that give it enough pressure to spray down your pool’s surfaces.","It can clean any pool coating including concrete, fiberglass and vinyl, and it comes equipped with an extra-large leaf bag to reduce stress on the pool’s internal filter while sucking up large pieces of debris. This should help increase the life of your filter and save your pump from extra wear and tear. The cleaner also helps circulate water as it moves around the pool, and its internal jets power it up walls, over stairs and across any surface.","The 360 is available in two colors, black or white, giving you the ability to choose the design that best fits your pool’s color so that it can blend in while cleaning. It comes with 31 feet of hose, which should be long enough to clean most in-ground pools. If this is not adequate, backup hoses are available from the manufacturer. A backup valve automatically engages at timed intervals to ensure that the cleaner doesn’t become stuck on the drain or in a corner.","Note that this Polaris pressure pool cleaner line is suitable for in-ground pools only. You should look for a pressure-side suction cleaner if you have an above-ground pool. The obvious advantage of the 360 is that, unlike the rest of the Polaris line, it does not require an external booster pump. This means you won’t have to replace or purchase extra parts. If you have a booster pump already and want the advantage of a little extra cleaning power, you may want to consider another model, such as the <a href=\"/kreepy-krauly-legend-review\">Kreepy Krauly Legend</a>. The Legend is a powerful cleaner in the same price range with a four-wheel design and a similar feature package.","This cleaner should do an ample job of cleaning any in-ground home pool. Its internal jets can spray down any pool surface. It connects to any pressure line and does not require an additional booster pump. Additional hose length can be purchased if required. It is not suitable for above-ground pools, but it is gentle enough for smooth pool surfaces including vinyl and fiberglass."]},"id":"0c0f0e37-b09f-40f3-ad12-9aa15125dd5c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66567","url":"/polaris-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T18:30:05Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T18:30:05Z","name":"Polaris Vac-Sweep 360","synopsis":"The Polaris Vac-Sweep 360 pressure-side pool cleaner simply attaches to your pressure line and cleans your entire pool automatically in a matter of hours.
