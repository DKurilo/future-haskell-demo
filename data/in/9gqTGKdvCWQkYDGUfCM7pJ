The <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">stereo headphones</a> in the V-MODA Crossfade series have deep, responsive bass; crisp highs; and clean mids. They have a flexible frequency response of around 5 to 30,000Hz, depending on the model you choose. It is important to note that the normal frequency range for human hearing is 20 to 20,000Hz – by expanding beyond the range of human hearing, the Crossfade series adds richness to its sound reproduction.","Made primarily from rugged sturdy steel, these V-MODA headphones have tested beyond military quality standards and are extremely durable. They are over-the-ear style, so they completely cover your ear in elongated earcups that isolate you from outside noise and keep your music from leaking.","The Kevlar-wrapped cables are particularly durable. These nearly 10-foot cables have been tested to withstand over a million bends. The audio cable can detach for easy storage and stays firmly in place in the jack without wiggling out if you move about or exercise.","One of the most exciting features found on some headphones in the Crossfade series is that you can use customizable shields to display your own individual style and flair. V-MODA sells shields in many colors with predesigned logos and sayings, but it also has downloadable templates you can use to design your own logo for the company to engrave on custom shields. Custom shields cost extra, but this is a great way to express your individuality or show off your favorite design to the world.","While most stereo headphone manufacturers package a simple carrying pouch with their headsets, V-MODA includes its Exoskeleton rigid case. This form-fitting padded case provides exceptional protection for your Crossfade headphones and makes them easy to transport without the worry of major damage.","In addition to the 9.7-foot audio cable, headsets in the Crossfade series come with a three-button mic cable that is compatible with iPhones, iPads and iPods. The buttons allow you to control the volume and your music, but they are located toward the end of the cable, which puts the controls high on your jaw, close to the earcup. This makes them a bit awkward to use.","If you ever need assistance, it’s easy to contact V-MODA for support. You have the option of sending an email detailing your questions or concerns, calling its support phone number, or striking up a chat online with a live chat representative. The company offers a two-year warranty on the headphones in the Crossfade series.","The V-MODA Crossfade series stereo headphones have excellent sound and are designed with many customizable options that make them stand out. They are durable and comfortable, and you can show off your individual style with custom shields, which makes them an attractive choice."]},"id":"da037f26-149a-438a-9ccd-73694d4a06ac","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55793","url":"/v-moda-crossfade-lp2-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-15T19:45:14Z","datePublished":"2013-02-15T19:45:14Z","name":"V-Moda Crossfade Series","synopsis":"The most important feature of any set of headphones is its sound performance.
