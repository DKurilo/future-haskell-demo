You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Ryobi RY40811 sets you free from the leash of an extension cord with two 40-volt lithium-ion batteries that power this electric snow thrower for up to 40 minutes. You aren’t limited by the length of a cord and could even venture out and help a neighbor clear snow. The best electric snow blowers can clear a wide path in a single pass, and the Ryobi RY40811 has an above-average width of 20 inches, letting you clear a lot of snow quickly. This blower is best used with fresh snowfall that&#39;s up to 10 inches deep, and it can throw snow up to 25 feet away.","Another benefit of this cordless electric <a href=\"/best-snow-blowers\">snow blower</a> is that the batteries only take 90 minutes to get to a full charge. This allows you to get more done, even if you have to wait a little while to recharge. The discharge chute rotates in a 180-degree arc, helping you place the snow where you want it to go.","The blades on the auger are made from a hardened thermal plastic. This makes the blades lightweight yet strong. Unfortunately, this snow blower doesn’t have a self-propulsion system, so you will have to push it the whole time you are plowing. The good news is that the Ryobi only weighs 35 pounds, which is much less than a gas-powered model weighs, so you won&#39;t get too worn out from pushing around an overweight blower.","The controls of the Ryobi RY40811 are easy to use. You start the snow blower with the push of a button, rather than a pulling cord, which saves your arms and back from unnecessary strain. Pulling the auger release handle starts the auger rotating, while releasing stops the auger and blades from spinning. This allows you to clear out buildup without endangering yourself or turning off the motor.","Unfortunately, this electric snow blower does not include a clearing tool, so you need to find something to safely clear the chute when it has buildup. This electric snow blower has two built-in LED headlights to help you see in low-light conditions, such as at dawn or dusk. To rotate the chute, all you need to do is turn the crank that&#39;s just below the handle. This makes it easier to aim your snow discharge without having to stop plowing.","The Ryobi comes with a five-year warranty that covers any manufacturer defects or faulty parts. This is a great warranty length, especially since the average electric snow blower is only covered for two years. If you ever need to have your blower repaired or have questions about how to operate it, you can visit the Ryobi website and use the repair center locator or download an owner&#39;s manual. You can also reach customer service representatives by phone or email. If you are in need of replacement parts, you can order them directly from Ryobi as well.","The Ryobi RY40811 is a reliable, strong cordless snow blower. Although it does not have auger-assisted propulsion, it is lightweight enough to be handled easily. In addition, the quick recharge time allows you to spend less time waiting and more time clearing snow. If you are looking for a snow blower that runs quietly and can handle up to 10 inches of fresh snowfall, the Ryobi RY40811 is one of the best electric snow blowers available."]},"id":"e0292e1e-6c54-4699-9762-2fdb72f0c06d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61185","url":"/ryobi-ry40811-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-13T21:38:10Z","datePublished":"2014-11-13T21:38:10Z","name":"Ryobi RY40811","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":18,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-13T21:38:10Z","id":"dCtyTxMLdWRvdApWqXkQxB","meta":{"title":"Ryobi RY40811 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Ryobi RY40811 is a reliable electric snow blower that uses batteries instead of a cord.
