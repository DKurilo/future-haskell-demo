At less than 30 ounces, the plane is very light and easy to launch, and launching is really all the hands-on flying you do. The wingspan is a little over 36 inches, so you do need to be sure it will fit comfortably in your vehicle. This same wingspan makes the aircraft easy to see in the sky and gives it the stability that makes its photography of such a high quality.","The LA100, comes with software that lets you map a flight path and photography plan for it to follow. Once in the air, the LA100 will fly your plan automatically. The plane is simple to launch because you do it by basically throwing the plane into the air.","After it is airborne, the LA100 flies your computer-programmed path for up to five minutes and stores the photographs it takes on an SD card. You can program this aerial photography drone to climb up to 330 feet to shoot videos or still photography in bright daylight. When it has finished its flight path, it will automatically return home and land safely.  <br/><br/>"]},"id":"c250af25-286b-46da-a746-9fd4074c5266","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LA100 remote-controlled plane combines almost professional-level photography with a plane that is simple enough for anyone to operate.
