When guests arrive and you run to your <a href=\"/best-wine-coolers\">wine cooler</a> to grab the perfect vintage for the occasion, you want to have a solid selection waiting for you. Whether you are starting your collection or simply adding to it, here are some superb wines to have on hand.","<strong>Cabernet-Sauvignon</strong><br/>Known far and wide as the King of Red Wines, Cabernet-Sauvignon, or  Cab  for short, is made from one of the most widely recognized red wine grapes. This dry wine has a full to medium body flavor range and is extremely dark colored, with some vintages being almost completely black. Cabernet-Sauvignon ages very well and is best enjoyed when it has matured five to 10 years. You can recognize hints of cherry, plum, vanilla or even warm spice as you drink this delicious wine. It also is a great complement to red meats like lamb and beef.","<strong>Zinfandel</strong><br/>This dry, fruity red wine is a cornerstone for the California wine market and rightly so. Zinfandel is produced in three intensities: light, medium and full bodied. The light variety is perfect for easy drinking occasions, such as a small glass with lunch or visiting with a friend, while the medium body Zinfandel begins to unlock more fruit flavors and spices. The fruity hints of raspberry, blackberry, raisins, plums and cherry make this wine a favorite across America and around the world. The full bodied Zinfandel has a higher alcohol content and pairs well with red meats and poultry dishes.","<strong> </strong>","<strong> Merlot</strong><br/>Once the golden child of the wine world, Merlot wines oversaturated the market in the 90s, and the movie Sideways delivered a shocking line that many attribute to the decline of this delightful light bodied wine. Over the past decades, Merlot winemakers have continually refined their processes to improve the quality of this diverse, fruity drink. With hints of blueberries, blackberries, cherry, strawberry or plums, Merlot s body ranges from light to strong and goes especially well with chicken, pork and other grilled meats. It is generally recommended that you avoid drinking Merlot with strong cheeses or spicy foods, as this will make the wine seem bitter. If you have not tried a bottle of Merlot in a while, give it another chance and you might be surprised."," <strong>Chardonnay</strong><br/>Originating in Burgundy, the wine region in eastern France, this dry white wine and is one of the most popular wines around the world. Chardonnay is versatile and mixes well with other wines, lending flavors of butter, butterscotch and oak to the mix. Enjoyable by itself, Chardonnay pairs exceptionally well with poultry dishes like turkey or chicken, as well as pork and some seafood. There are numerous varieties of this white wine, so don t be afraid to take some time and find a favorite or two.","<strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong><br/>Unlike its red grape cousin, Sauvignon Blanc does not benefit from aging and is best enjoyed while the wine is young. This dry white wine has a lower alcohol content than Chardonnay and is a crisp, refreshing beverage that goes perfectly with lighter fare such as appetizers, salads, cheeses and fish. Not limited to hot summer days, Sauvignon Blanc is versatile enough to be enjoyed with most any food and comes in many varieties with subtle hints of tropical fruits to having a distinct herbal taste. While this wine is produced in countries across the globe, New Zealand has the best reputation for producing some of the best Sauvignon Blanc available.","Any of these are great additions to a wine collection. They are enjoyable with a wide range of meals and taste even better when shared with pleasant company. Any wine collection can benefit from having these wines present, and keeping a few of them on hand will definitely help conserve your more expensive and personal favorites for a special occasion. Try a bottle or two occasionally and enjoy the distinct flavors and aromas each vintage has to offer. Part of the pleasure of being a wine enthusiast comes from finding out which wines please your palate the most, and as you explore the wide varieties available you might just find a new favorite."]},"id":"7f9c9e9a-adb0-4e38-a12a-dc544fb6f7d7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8050","url":"/5-wines-to-keep-on-hand","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-30T15:45:02Z","datePublished":"2013-08-30T15:45:02Z","name":"5 Wines to Keep On Hand","synopsis":"Even if you are a seasoned wine drinker, you might not know how to start your own collection.","review":{},"strapline":"Even if you are a seasoned wine drinker, you might not know how to start your own collection.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-13T00:55:58Z","id":"jfMCH2UDb5RDyV8h6FSaLL","meta":{"title":"5 Wines to Keep On Hand","description":"Are you unsure what wines to stock for your collection?
