You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The iGrill Mini is small but mighty. This <a href=\"/best-digital-grill-thermometers\">digital grill thermometer</a> provides you with precise temperature readings, features loud alarms, and since it pairs with your smartphone or tablet, it even has a nifty app that has built-in temperature presets and recipes.","This BBQ thermometer can read temperatures as low as -22 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 572 degrees Fahrenheit. If you prefer to use the metric system, the app has a Celsius setting that can be reconfigured with just a couple taps of your finger.","This digital grill thermometer does not feature a display of any kind. Instead, it relies on your smartphone or tablet’s screen. This is a potential turnoff since you may not want your smartphone covered in BBQ juices. To compensate for this,Weber, the manufacturer of the iGrill series of digital grill thermometers, included a thin, circular LED indicator that rests on top of the thermometer. The light goes from green to yellow, orange and finally red when the thermometer reaches the target temperature. This thermometer has a range of 150 feet. Once your meat is done, both the device and your phone beep. If your phone is on silent, it will vibrate instead.","Because of the iGrill Mini’s small size, it is easy to lose. There is an included magnet so you can affix it to your grill, refrigerator or knife rack. The small size also means this thermometer supports one probe. A single 3.75-inch probe is included, and it has a 48-inch long cord.","We found the probe to be pretty accurate, but not as accurate as other thermometers. Weber says it will read temperatures within two degrees of accuracy. As far as its speediness, it has a response time four seconds. To get a full reading, it took us an average of 17.5 seconds when grilling steaks.","During our tests, we found the Weber app to be incredibly helpful. It is simple to navigate and pairing the iGrill Mini to an iPhone and iPad was easy. If you have an Android device, the app is also available on the Google Play store.","Depending on what you are grilling, the app alerts you when your meat has finished cooking according to the doneness level you set. In our case, we grilled four steaks without any problems. When we grilled a pork chop, the setting of 160 degrees was a little overdone to our liking.","The iGrill Mini digital BBQ thermometer comes with a 90-day warranty, which is slightly shorter than most. You can reach Weber by telephone or email, and they have FAQs and downloadable manual on the website."]},"id":"cd48b64e-0745-443d-9d8d-183be0599700","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"69cfa057-f906-4d79-acdb-5471c97500a7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iGrill Mini does its job well, but it relies entirely on your smartphone or tablet.
