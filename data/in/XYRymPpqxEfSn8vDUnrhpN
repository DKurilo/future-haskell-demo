We spent more than 80 hours researching and testing the best CD burning software this year, and we have covered this category for more than a decade. We judged the software by using each program and comparing burning capabilities, exporting tools, customization options and help resources. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","All the CD burning programs we reviewed through a battery of tests to determine which one is the best. Those tests are detailed below.","Ease-of-Use Tests<br/>Our team of reviewers evaluated the interface of each program, noting how easy it was to navigate, complete common tasks and access basic and advanced features. They noted any bugs in the software or counterintuitive workflows. They found that most of the programs are simple to learn and use, some more so than others. Each program was given a percentage score based on this evaluation.","Timing Tests<br/>During our testing phase, we created multiple CDs with each program – both audio and data – timing how long it took each program to burn an identical disc, filled to capacity. Results ranged from under two minutes to nearly six minutes. If you’re making multiple copies of the same disc, consider a product with quick burn times.","Quality Tests<br/>After we finished burning our test discs, our team of reviewers listened back to the audio on the new CD. They compared it both to the source CD and a digital download of the same album, listening for quality loss and flaws such as compression artifact, hissing, crackling and more. All the programs we reviewed produce outstanding quality; our audio experts weren’t able to find any flaws in the new burned discs.","<strong>Best CD Burning Software - Key Features to Look For</strong>","Audio and Data Burning<br/>All the programs we reviewed make audio CDs, and will work well whether you just want to copy CDs you already have or make them from scratch. But you may also want to burn a data disc. This is a great option for backing up your important files somewhere else than in the cloud or an external hard drive. Both of those options can fail. Consider data discs as a backup for your backup.<br/><br/>Burn DVDs and Blu-ray Discs<br/>CD burning is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Nearly all the programs we reviewed include CD burning as a secondary feature. They mostly focus on making other discs like DVDs and Blu-rays. You can use these programs to either copy discs you already own, rip their content onto your computer, and even create your own disc from scratch using files from your computer. Make sure you buy a program that can create menus and include special features to give your projects that professional look and feel.","Customization<br/>The best CD burning software enables you to make your new discs truly your own. Audio editing tools are a must if you want to do more than simply copy discs. Additionally, the best programs include things like the ability to edit metadata, so your CD player and other electronics can display what song you’re listening to.","Additional Features<br/>All the applications we reviewed can burn new CDs with relative ease. However, several provide far more functionality than simple disc authoring. Some convert video, make copies of discs as well as contain video and photo editors. Before you buy, look at all the other features you’re getting for the price tag. You may be surprised at all the extras.<br/><br/>How Much Does CD Burning Software Cost?<br/>CD burning software will cost you between $20 and $70. That may seem like a lot for something as simple as CD burning. But keep in mind that CDs are on their way out, so companies have to offer more to make their software as useful as possible. More expensive software have tools not just for CDs but also DVDs, Blu-ray discs and other digital media.","<strong>What Is the Best Free CD Burning Software?</strong>","All the CD burning programs we reviewed are for-pay applications. That’s because they all do much more than burn CDs – they also make DVDs and Blu-ray discs, among other things. However, if you just need to burn CDs, there are some free options to consider.","<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/itunes/\">iTunes</a> is the first, most obvious choice. It’s free, organizes all your music and makes burning music CDs nearly foolproof. All you do is create a playlist, right click on it from the sidebar and select &#34;burn playlist to disc.&#34; In just a few minutes, you’ll have an audio CD you can play in any optical drive. However, if you want to burn a data disc, iTunes simply doesn’t fit the bill.","Another free program worth mentioning is <a href=\"https://www.ashampoo.com/en/usd/pin/7110/burning-software/burning-studio-free\">Ashampoo Burning Studio Free</a>. It has all the basics you need to make data and music discs, plus a few extras. For example, it can password protect discs and erase rewritable CDs for reuse. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t a Mac version.","<strong>Audio vs. MP3 CDs</strong>","Some of the CD burner software we reviewed gives you the option to make an MP3 CD. The difference between an MP3 CD and a regular audio CD is compression. Audio CDs contain uncompressed audio files that have no quality loss from the originals. The typical audio CD can hold about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio. MP3 CDs compress files into a smaller format, which increases the number of files you can hold. You can potentially burn hundreds of MP3s to a blank CD.","The quality of your music will suffer. Since compression requires information to be left out of a file, you’ll lose fine details in music and may not even be able to hear some of the softer background sounds. Additionally, not all CD drives can play MP3 discs. We recommend making a single MP3 CD to test in your player before you start burning multiple discs."]},"id":"4831cb1e-4879-4045-815d-381a48f05e77","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_137","url":"/best-cd-burning-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
