Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","There are a few things to keep in mind when you&#39;re looking for the perfect <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">high-definition camcorder</a>. While quality is important, we feel that ease of use is equally important. If the camcorder is difficult to use then it&#39;s not going to be fun to film anything. The JVC Everio GZ-HM1S is limited when it comes to navigating through the menus because of the lack of a touchscreen. The video quality is good, but the limited amount of memory means you won&#39;t be able to record for hours on end in full high definition.","There are various qualifications to look at if you want to make sure that you get a quality picture. Some of these include the focal length, zoom, LUX rating and recording speed. The focal length is 6.7-67 mm. This is the standard size lens so you can get some of the wide angle benefits and some of the telephoto benefits. The zoom also determines the distance you can stand away and still get a clear picture up close. The optical zoom is 10x and the digital zoom is 200x.","The other factors to consider are just about average. The LUX rating is 1, which means that you can shoot in dim light but not in incredibly dark environments. The JVC Everio GZ-HM1S uses what they call Super LoLux for low light situations. The recording speed is 24 Mbps. Not only can this HDV camcorder take quality video, but you can take still photos up to 10MP. This means you don&#39;t have to carry around multiple cameras to get the most out of your vacation.","The memory of this particular high-definition video camera is OK, but don&#39;t it expect it to last as long as you do. The 64GB of memory can record up to 28 hours of film, which sounds good until you realize that isn&#39;t HD. If you are recording in high definition, you are closer to 6 hours, and that&#39;s if you haven&#39;t taken many pictures, which also use memory. If you want more memory you can use an SD or SDHC card which can give you up to 32GB of extra memory.","The additional features are what disappointed us the most. Though having a touchscreen isn&#39;t necessary, it does make it easier to use. Having a device that is difficult to use means you are less likely to use it. For the actual physical dimensions, the unit is 2.13 inches high, 2.5 inches wide and 4.68 inches deep, which makes it one of the smallest camcorders in the lineup. It weighs 17 ounces including the battery."]},"id":"3ca4bf50-1620-4978-8e2f-90a6050001ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c53cc527-636a-44c4-8a97-1bc59ef319e6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the lack of a touchscreen is what really sinks this product.
