Avoid reading, eating or watching TV in bed so that when you crawl into bed after a long day, your body knows it is time to shut down for the night. Just like you would give a baby a bath and read them a bedtime story, a regular bedtime routine would help you as well.","<strong>Exercise</strong>   if after a full night s rest you still feel fatigued, you may be one of the 50 million people in the U.S. with a sleep disorder, or your body may just be in desperate need of exercise. This may sound ludicrous, but your body needs exercise to promote good sleep. Try to exercise in the afternoon instead of the evening. An elevated heart rate does not provide the best circumstance for easily drifting to sleep. If you must exercise at night, try a relaxing activity like yoga or meditation.","<strong>Sleep Hygiene</strong>   an average adult needs seven hours of sleep each night to wake rested and ready to go the next day. If your sleep hygiene is out of whack, your body won t be on a consistent sleep schedule, resulting in improper rest. Make sure to stay away from nicotine, caffeine, alcohol and other stimulating substances before bedtime. Oprah suggests not eating after 7:30pm, but at the very least plan to eat your last meal at least two hours before you head to bed. You don t want to go to bed hungry, but you also don t want to go to bed right after eating either.","<strong>Sound Machines</strong>   sound therapy technology in sound machines has increased leaps and bounds. No longer does simple, white noise emanate from a sound machine. Now, the sounds are specifically designed to subtly make your brain wave match them. Once your brain waves are parallel with the sound machine, your body will naturally relax and fall asleep.","<strong>Visit a Doctor</strong>   if, after trying several different sleep aid methods, you still feel fatigued throughout your day, we recommend visiting a doctor. Chronic sleep disorders go largely undiagnosed, and they are often associated with the onset of cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes and obesity. Your doctor may prescribe sleep medication to assist you to sleep, or he may suggest trying a sleep aid like a sound machine."],"type":"ul"},"id":"60ddc8ca-4491-45f0-a717-2877033b48c4","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Fatigue can be a symptom of many different things, but if you experience it on a regular basis, trying one of these suggested practices may help. Most of those plagued by exhaustion simply need a better night&#39;s rest. Before jumping straight to sleeping pills or other chemical sleep aids, try falling asleep to a sound machine. The science behind sound machine technology shows that when the body is lulled to sleep with sounds that match relaxed brain waves, the sleep is deeper and much more effective."]},"id":"7bf31de6-eeb4-46f1-9517-6a4fbbba33ae","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5339","url":"/sound-machines-can-they-really-help-me","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-rose-johnson","url":"/author/anna-rose-johnson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Rose Johnson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"K8X8mra9tUQ8dFrjVwmdAP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-12-29T03:01:46Z","datePublished":"2010-12-29T03:01:46Z","name":"Sound Machines, Can They Really Help Me?","synopsis":"In the United States, a work hard, play hard mentality exists, which is probably the reason 29 percent of the population report not obtaining the appropriate amount of rest (about seven hours) each ni","review":{},"strapline":"In the United States, a work hard, play hard mentality exists, which is probably the reason 29 percent of the population report not obtaining the appropriate amount of rest (about seven hours) each ni","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-06T23:11:24Z","id":"Mjcj8mMBPi4qsg4UjA8b6","meta":{"title":"Sound Machines, Can They Really Help Me?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
