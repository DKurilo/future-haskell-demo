The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-video-converter-software\"><em>Video Converter Software here</em></a><em>.</em>","We give Audials Tunebite a lot of credit for doing many things well. When compared with the pros and cons of the best products on our lineup the software offers an impressive application with a number of capabilities, including video converter functions. This comprehensive video converter software has good tools for converting, compressing and copying content without compromises in quality.","However, Audials Tunebite suffers from a busy and poorly organized interface. That could be a minor issue if we were talking about any other world besides the one video converters inhabits. There are so many of these products that dealing with a confusing interface is just not worth it when there are so many other applications that are easier to use.","In addition, the list of input and output formats the software can handle is underwhelming. This product&#39;s range is good but not great. Of course, it covers the basics like WMV, AVI, DivX and Xvid. Unfortunately, Audials doesn’t work with as many less-common file formats than our top-rated products can, so you’ll want to make sure your intended source files are supported before purchase. For many, the covered formats and adjustable parameters should be sufficient, however.","Audials Tunebite Platinum isn’t completely comprehensive in file format support, but the video converter software does have a robust feature set. For video converting, you can control several of the parameters to optimize the conversion process and output files accordingly. For example, you can set the target output dimensions, audio channels and other considerations for the specific device you plan to use.","If you have many files to convert, you can take advantage of the batch convert mode. While the target output format has to be the same across the batch, the input files can be different file types.","The software also includes the ability to convert audio files, and you can extract audio from movie files to make your own soundtrack.","Audials Tunebite can help you capture content to convert. We like that. You can copy movies from DVDs, YouTube and any websites that stream movies. It doesn’t matter what the source is or what file format it’s in; you can capture it. Audials re-records videos at the network level as they are streamed on your computer (unless it’s RTMP-E protected, in which case the software uses a built-in screen recorder). The video converter software essentially takes photos of each shot and then puts them all together.","Tunebite takes care of everything automatically, including drawing the perfect video capture frame, syncing the video and audio, and cutting the film up into chunks that your processor can handle. In fact, the software compares the copy to the original and can even repeat the process as needed until the quality is perfect.","If you have questions about this or any other feature, you can contact Audials with specific questions via email. The company also has several self-help resources online. The step-by-step instructions and how-to videos are useful, as are the FAQs section and thorough glossary. You can also tap into the user forums."]},"id":"30f095a8-113c-4122-89d8-2f88952afe72","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"37575bc3-d2e4-49c3-ae9e-bc6143d892de","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Audials Tunebite offers some sophisticated tools and a solid list of compatible file types.
