Alex told me the primary advantage is the ability to create a well-defined stereo image in more than one sweet spot. He also pointed out that “floor standing speakers have the benefit that the designer can determine the height of the drivers and generally optimize this for a seated listener.” This is important because bookshelf speakers and sound bars are often placed on home theater furniture, which means the furniture designer determines where the speakers are placed, rather than a speaker designer.","We also talked about the potential pitfalls of mixing and matching brands in an audio system. Murno suggests that <a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">subwoofers</a> are the safest component to mix and match because they “play a very narrow band, so low in frequency that the brain can barely tell where the sound is coming from.” If you aren’t happy with low frequency reproduction of the floor standing speakers in your system, feel free to shop different subwoofer manufacturers&#39; offerings. He did caution against mixing brands with the left, center and right channels though, because of “differences in the tonality or dispersion characteristics.”","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We connected an Apple TV and ultra-high-definition Blu-ray player to an AV receiver, then sent the amplified output to a speaker switcher.

Here are a couple of our favorite AV receivers that have the correct amount of amplification for all of the floor standing speakers we tested.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-STRDN1080-Channel-Theater-Receiver/dp/B06XKRWWSG?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews-ttr:en_US_43_Review_17-20\">Sony STR-DN1080</a><br/>This 7.2-channel receiver is, by far, the best option for less than $500. It has all of the important audio format options, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X multidimensional surround formats. There are six HDMI inputs and two HDMI outputs on the back panel, and this receiver supports two-zone audio, so you can power a 5.2-channel home theater in one room and send an amplified stereo output to a pair of speakers in another room. The 130-watts-per-channel power rating was enough to run all of the floor standing speakers we tested, and the audio format compatibility ensures this receiver is a future-proof hub for an entertainment room for years to come.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-NR575-Channel-Network-Receiver/dp/B06XVFY3M8?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews--20\">Onkyo TX-NR575</a><br/>The Onkyo TX-NR575 isn’t as powerful as our favorite Sony AV receiver, but it costs less and has a comparable input and output selection. It isn’t compatible with as many sound formats from Dolby and DTS, but it covers most of the popular formats, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. You can stream music from mobile devices or a computer using the built-in Chromecast. It also supports wireless streaming from popular apps such as Spotify and Pandora, and simply connects your devices via Bluetooth. If you&#39;re looking for a power source for floor standing speakers for less than $300, this is the best option.","<br/>","<strong>More Home Audio
