You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Onkyo has built up a stellar reputation in the <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater in a box</a> industry, primarily for offering top-tier sound quality at moderate prices. Several Onkyo models have been extremely well received for not only their amazing sound quality, but also for their 7.1-channel system and array of well thought out features and connectivity options.","The Onkyo HT-S990THX differs from these models in a few ways. With the HT-S990THX, Onkyo took sound quality in home theater systems to the next level – this system is the world&#39;s first THX-certified home theater in a box. However, to achieve this, Onkyo had to raise the price and leave out some basic features, which some consumers are not happy about.","The sound quality of the HT-S990THX is beyond high end, and even though this system costs more than most other Onkyo models, the price is still very competitive for the quality of sound delivered. THX is a technology provider and quality-assurance assessor for the consumer entertainment industry.","THX only certifies theater equipment and systems of the highest caliber, and up until now, it has generally scoffed at home theaters in a box. Home theaters in the box were assumed to provide a little of everything at an affordable price for the average Joe&#39;s home theater needs, sacrificing premier sound quality in the process. However, with this system, Onkyo has delivered such superb sound quality that THX has given the HT-S990THX its seal of approval.","Truly, this system&#39;s sound quality is beyond what you&#39;d expect from a home theater in a box. Independent testers call the sound quality nearly flawless. There is no reported distortion, even at the highest volume levels.<br/>There are several different surround sound settings, including Dolby Digital, Dolby EX, Pro Logic IIx, DTS, DTS-ES, DTS Neo:6, DTS 96/24, Neural, THX Cinema2, THX Music and THX Games. However, Onkyo left out the Audyssey sound technologies (included in other Onkyo models), which auto-calibrate the satellite speakers and even out the sound levels between the programs you view and overly compressed commercials. These are noticeably missing features, according to consumers.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"1c8e73db-bb55-4993-903d-7f5c645a35bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7aa76c7-c123-410c-8df0-9dcff5e77cc0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the HT-S990THX offers the world&#39;s first THX-certified 7.1-channel home theater in a box, it&#39;s lacking some basic features.
