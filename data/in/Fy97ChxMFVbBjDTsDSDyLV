Despite its unassuming appearance, the E40 has solid midrange image quality, thermal precision and a long list of additional features that make it one of the best thermal cameras available.","As one of FLIR&#39;s top-tier offerings, the E40 produces images with an impressive resolution of 160 x 120 pixels. The clarity that this resolution affords makes it easier to spot potential problems and gives you a clearer picture of what to do to remedy them. The E40 also takes 3-megapixel visible-light photos that, once blended with a thermal image, make for even greater clarity. The lens on the E40 relies on manual focus to produce crisp images. To do this, you twist the lens until the image is in focus.","A large benefit of going with the FLIR E40 is its ability to shoot radiometric JPGs. This format allows you or people you share with to view the images anywhere without the need for special software. However, these radiometric JPGs are embedded with temperature information that is still accessible by opening them within FLIR&#39;s thermal-imaging software. Radiometric JPGs let you share your images without ever having to convert them.","Using a free Apple or Android app and the E40&#39;s Wi-Fi connectivity, you can share this detailed information with clients and co-workers. With just a few taps, you can connect your mobile device, download the images and share them.","In addition to its impressive resolution, the E40 is a thermally accurate device. It is accurate to 2 percent, has a measurement range of minus 20 degrees to 650 degrees Celsius, and is sensitive to temperature changes equal to or less than 0.05 degrees.","The E40 is also capable of shooting infrared video, but it doesn&#39;t contain radiometric information. In order to capture radiometric information in video form, you&#39;ll have to plug the camera into a computer and stream directly to the FLIR software.","Extra features like voice and text annotations, an onboard flashlight and laser pointer, and an LCD touchscreen make it easy to take advantage of the E40&#39;s powerful resolution and thermal precision. With these features, you can select the appropriate settings, illuminate a target and pinpoint problem areas within your images. You can then attach important information to them using the voice and text annotation tools.","The last thing you need is one of your tools failing or running out of battery. For this reason, the E40 is engineered to withstand falls of up to 6.6 feet and comes with an extra battery and charger. Each battery lasts up to four hours, and the external charger allows you to keep your batteries charged all day.","FLIR offers outstanding support for its products. Unlike other manufacturers, FLIR covers different components of the E40 for different lengths of time. The detector has a 10-year warranty, the battery is covered for five years, and parts and labor are covered for two. Because you must periodically calibrate infrared cameras so they remain accurate, FLIR offers a calibration program to keep your device functioning properly. The company offers additional support in the way of downloadable manuals, general information on its products, and phone and email support."]},"id":"848a7597-1ce8-4f37-a183-ec16607274e2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"646adf7d-88e9-485a-9f74-bf4df2eb43ba","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The FLIR E40 is a well-designed thermal-imaging camera with good resolution, reliable accuracy and solid options for sharing information.
