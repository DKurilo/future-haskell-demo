The higher capacity means you can wash more per cycle, so you can conserve energy over time by running fewer cycles. The stainless steel tub means it&#39;s durable and built to last for a long time.","This top loader doesn&#39;t offer as many cycle options as others, but it still has a good range of features. You can choose from nine wash cycles, including a speed wash if you need a load done quickly. This unit also has a prewash option as well as general options like heavy duty, delicate and permanent press. You&#39;ll be able to select the best cycle for your load that will both preserve your laundry and clean it efficiently.","Also available is a stain boost specialty cycle. This option has a longer wash time, so your laundry can soak and have a longer time to work out stains.","In addition to the range of cycles, this unit has five water temperature settings and four soil level options. Other features include an end-of-cycle signal, which will sound an alarm to let you know when the cycle is finished, and some cycle status lights on the console, so you can keep track of how close your laundry is to finishing.","This top-loading washing machine is energy-efficient with an Energy Star qualification. The EnergyGuide estimates that you&#39;ll spend $15 and use 145 kilowatt-hours a year running this machine.","One downside to this top loader is its warranty, which only covers the machine for one year. If you need to contact the company for help and support, you have the option of phone, email or live chat. The product webpage also has the owner&#39;s manual available for download."]},"id":"41d2826b-66bf-486b-a6d0-0d5865b1e9a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"350461e9-b96d-403a-8251-f1f3298eca00","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore High Efficiency 28102 top-loading washing machine doesn&#39;t have as many cycle options as some others on our list, but it has enough options to cover your laundry needs.
