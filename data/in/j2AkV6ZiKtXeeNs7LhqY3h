Rates change often and insurance companies continually add features – for example, the ability to file claims through mobile apps.","Industry experts recommend getting new quotes every few years, and a good time to look at other options is when your existing policy expires. Shopping around can save you substantially, though you should make sure your new quotes match your existing policy in terms of deductibles and coverage limits. You can also consult your existing agent to see if you can lower your current premium by adjusting your coverage limits or deductibles.","Some organizations, such as the <a href=\"https://www.usaa.com/inet/ent_utils/McStaticPages?key=insurance_auto_product&amp;wa_ref=pub_subglobalnav_insurance_auto_product\">USAA</a>, provide auto insurance for members of certain groups, like the military. They often offer quality rates, but owing to their exclusivity, we chose not to include them on our update.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Cost is one of the biggest considerations when choosing insurance, so we got quotes from each insurance company based on a variety of policy scenarios. There’s a lot that goes into insurance premiums, including where you live, the car you’re insuring and your credit score.","Your premium also varies depending on the level of coverage and your deductible. All our quotes reflect the 100/300/100 coverage recommended by most insurers. This means that $100,000 worth of bodily injury per person is covered with $300,000 total in an accident and $100,000 worth of property damage.","Using research by third-party groups, we chose a car listed as one of the 10 cheapest to insure (a Subaru Outback) and one listed as being among the more expensive (a Chevy Cruze), then got quotes for each one. We also got a quote for a policy with both of those cars. In addition, we looked at the costs for minimum coverage and the cost to add a teen driver to a plan.","Again, these are only example quotes, and yours may vary depending on where you live. Life events also impact your premiums – marriage can lower your cost, while adding a teenage driver makes your policy more expensive.","We also looked at programs offered by insurance companies. For example, many have their own roadside assistance services, though if you’re already a member of one, it may not be worth the cost to join the program your insurance provider offers.","<strong>How Much Does Auto Insurance Cost?</strong>","How much you pay for auto insurance depends on where you live, the car you’re insuring, your credit score and the coverage you plan on carrying – minimum required coverage varies by state. In general, you can expect to pay around $380 for a policy, though we saw quotes as low as $95. If you opt for the industry-recommended 100/300/100 coverage, you can expect to pay between $200 to $1,000. Adding a teenage driver dramatically increases your premiums, often by an average of $600 or more.","<strong>Why Did My Insurance Go Up?</strong>","If you’re like many drivers, you let your insurance policy renew automatically without giving it much thought – that is, until you see an increase in your monthly premium. If you haven&#39;t filed a claim or had a traffic violation, you may think your insurance provider has increased your premium for no reason. According to <a href=\"https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-factors.html\">Insure.com</a>, here are some of the reasons your premium may have increased:"]},"id":"2551ffba-ee85-4009-83b1-d3d572e970a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Geographic location: Even if you, personally, didn&#39;t have any accidents or violations, your area may have experienced an increase in accidents. Insurance providers evaluate risk, and a lot of it has to do with your location. If accidents, vandalism, theft, bad weather (like hail) and congestion are common in your area, your insurance premium may go up. ","Marital status: Married couples have been found to be less of a risk, so if you got divorced or widowed, you may see a 5- to 15-percent increase in your premium.","Credit history: Studies have shown that drivers with a credit score under 600 are more likely to file claims, file inflated claims and commit insurance fraud. As such, if your credit rating dips, you’re seen as a higher risk, which is reflected in your premium. If your provider requires you to pay a large percentage of the premium up front, this may be the reason. However, some states – California, Hawaii and Massachusetts – prohibit credit scores and credit history from being considered.","Vehicle type: If the make and model of your vehicle had higher rates of accidents, repair costs and theft in the previous year, your premium may go up.","Vehicle use: If you started using the vehicle for business purposes, such as driving for Lyft or Uber, it raises the premium.","Miles driven annually: Insurance providers have various methods of determining how much you drive – for example, by self-reporting, estimating your commute or using OBD connectors. If your provider determines that you spent more time on the road than in previous years, you’re seen as a higher risk, and thus will need to pay more.","Coverages and deductibles: If you don’t pay attention to the coverages and deductibles when your policy is renewed, you may not realize how they affect your premium. To lower your premium, review your policy and make any desired changes, such as increasing your deductible or lowering the collision coverage."],"type":"ul"},"id":"c3057de7-f99a-47b6-b9c0-e76f5f05ded7","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Ways to Lower Your Car Insurance Payment</strong>","If your car insurance payment is too high, here are some steps you should consider to lower the cost."]},"id":"8addf972-5c48-4bd3-a4ff-6fea7f8a3a0d","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<em>Shop around:</em> The most important step in lowering your insurance payment is to see what other providers are charging for the same coverage.

So, if you own an older, high-mileage vehicle not worth very much, choosing only liability insurance can lower your insurance payment by over half.","<em>Choose a higher deductible:</em> If you choose a higher deductible, most car insurance companies lower the monthly premium significantly. The downside, of course, is the risk of paying more than you can afford if you get into an accident.","<em>Bundle insurance with the same company:</em> Most insurance companies provide discounts if you purchase additional policies, such as homeowners&#39; insurance.","<em>Maintain good credit:</em> Because your consumer credit information is used to obtain your car insurance quote, a good credit history can keep your payments low. This means checking your credit report regularly to make sure it&#39;s accurate.","<em>Take advantage of low-mileage discounts: </em>Keep records of how much you drive each year, and see if you qualify for a low-mileage discount.

The standard-level gasoline is expensive enough, so why would you pay up to 50 cents more per gallon? You may want to reconsider that perspective, especially if you drive a midlevel or luxury car.","According to <a href=\"http://carfax.com/blog/top-tier-gas-medicine-engine\">Carfax</a>, most drivers pass up the premium gasoline options because they view them as little more than a marketing cash grab. But studies suggest otherwise. The EPA requires all gasoline to have a minimum amount of detergent to minimize fuel buildup in the engine, which can cause major problems over time and lead to a reduction in fuel efficiency. As such, the premium gasolines have more detergent and additives to keep your engine running smoothly, leading to 19 times fewer deposits and a 2 to 4 percent increase in fuel economy.","Premium gasoline is especially important for some car makes and models because the manufacturers engineer the motors to run most effectively with no buildup. You can drive these cars on standard gasoline, but it might cause damage to the engine.","To see if your car was designed for premium gasoline, consult the owner’s manual. Many cars also have the recommendation printed on or near the gas cap. By paying a little extra each time you fill up, you extend the life of the engine, experience a smoother ride and burn less fuel over time.","<strong>Common Car Insurance Myths</strong>","As you shop for a car or car insurance, there are many myths to contend with. Some are true but many aren’t. Here are some of the most common auto insurance myths:","Color matters: You’ve likely heard that red cars cost more to insure because they attract more attention from police. In reality, color doesn’t affect insurance rates. There’s some <a href=\"https://www.insurancequotes.com/auto/auto-insurance-car-color\">evidence</a> that certain colors of car cost more to buy, but insurance rates are more affected by your driving history and the car’s safety features than superficial things like color.","Your friend’s insurance covers their accident in your car: Say you let a friend borrow your car and they get in an accident. It&#39;s a common misconception that their insurance will cover the accident. However, car insurance insures the car, not the driver. So, if a friend or relative borrowing your car gets in an accident, the policy covering the vehicle, in this case, your policy, covers the collision and liability claims from the accident. And yes, your premiums will go up as a result.","Your credit affects your auto insurance: This is true, depending on where you live. Insurance companies use information from your credit reports to gauge your potential risk as a driver. If you live in California, Hawaii or Massachusetts, insurers aren’t allowed to use credit information when creating your policies. ","Gender matters: It’s largely true that young men pay higher premiums, but the way auto insurers include gender in their calculations varies widely. While it depends on the insurance company, a recent<a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/02/11/what-women-pay-more-than-men-for-auto-insurance\"> Pew </a>study shows that older women, between the ages of 40 and 60, tend to pay more, sometimes by as much as 10 percent.","<strong> When Should You Look for A Different Insurance Company?</strong>","Whether you’ve been with your insurance company for one year or ten, it&#39;s always a good idea to get a new insurance quote. There are many reasons to get new quotes and even to consider switching carriers. According to a study by the<a href=\"https://consumerfed.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/PO-Consumer-Alert-PR-8-27-14.pdf\"> Consumer Federation of America</a>, if you stay with the same carrier for an extended period of time, you’re more likely to get charged a higher rate. This is why shopping around can save you substantial amounts of money.","The best time to start collecting quotes is when you get your renewal information from your current insurer. This gives you a chance to compare premiums and coverage of your policy with the quotes you get from other insurers. By shopping early you may be eligible for an advanced quote discount.","A major life event is also a good occasion to shop around for policies. If you’ve gotten married, have a teen driver, retire or buy a new or used vehicle it’s a good idea to shop around. With those changes, your policy will increase, so it&#39;s a good occasion to look at what other carriers are charging. Most insurers offer discounts for multicar families or good student discounts, so getting multiple quotes will let you see who has the strongest discounts.","Cars depreciate over time, but your current auto insurer is unlikely to adjust your policy to coincide with your car’s reduced value. If you have an older car, it may be wise to shop around to see if you can get a lower price from another carrier.","Because credit history factors into your auto policy rates, if your credit score has improved since the last time you bought auto insurance, this may be a good time to shop around, since it&#39;s likely your credit will help you get a lower rate. If you live in California, Hawaii or Massachusetts this won’t apply to you."]},"id":"6bc327eb-6752-458e-8744-b2b2c0d92eed","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_330","url":"/best-auto-insurance","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-12T12:49:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-12T12:49:00Z","name":"Best Auto Insurance of 2019","synopsis":"We researched which insurer offers the best rates to the most people, and which ones have the best reputation for customer service.","review":{},"strapline":"We researched which insurer offers the best rates to the most people, and which ones have the best reputation for customer service.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-12T18:29:09Z","id":"j2AkV6ZiKtXeeNs7LhqY3h","meta":{"title":"Best Auto Insurance of 2019 - Car Insurance Reviews and Comparisons","description":"We researched which insurer offers the best rates to the most people, and which ones have the best reputation for customer service."},"products":[{"slug":"liberty-mutual","url":"/product/liberty-mutual","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","name":"Liberty Mutual","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"xJLzZWhe7Qkh9L5xpZ6tYZ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"farmers-insurance","url":"/product/farmers-insurance","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","name":"Farmers Insurance","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"t8svkBEbCPoDvzKwvnKheC","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"allstate","url":"/product/allstate","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","name":"Allstate","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"esVvGiReQWVRtMfhTcDHF7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"progressive","url":"/product/progressive","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","name":"Progressive","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"3b4ZdGZZm8S5o7hi3oEMng","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"geico","url":"/product/geico","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","name":"Geico","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"moh6EgsRfQqzXkk3qbYBqL","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dpzoLfhuvg7jRCftWwzere.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Auto-Insurance-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/Y/J/789211/original/Hero-Auto-Insurance-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"dpzoLfhuvg7jRCftWwzere","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dpzoLfhuvg7jRCftWwzere.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Auto Insurance of 2019","description":"We researched which insurer offers the best rates to the most people, and which ones have the best reputation for customer service."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dpzoLfhuvg7jRCftWwzere.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Auto-Insurance-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/Y/J/789211/original/Hero-Auto-Insurance-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"dpzoLfhuvg7jRCftWwzere","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dpzoLfhuvg7jRCftWwzere.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Auto Insurance of 2019","description":"We researched which insurer offers the best rates to the most people, and which ones have the best reputation for customer service."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:19Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
