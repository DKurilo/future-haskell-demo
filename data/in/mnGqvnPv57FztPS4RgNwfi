Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","Aiseesoft Blu-ray Copy is a basic <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software\">Blu-ray to Blu-ray copy software</a> that has a single function – to duplicate Blu-ray discs – which it does quite well. It has eschewed many of the extra features that we looked for when we reviewed the best Blu-ray copy software, but the core functionality of the product deserves some praise for its simplicity and for the quality of the final product.","The application is extremely easy to use, even if you’ve never used a Blu-ray or DVD copy application before. In fact, installing the software and getting started on your first burn takes about five minutes. All you have to do is install the software, insert the Blu-ray disc you want to copy, click a few buttons and you’re off to the races.","The rest of the process is completely hands-off. With the exception of replacing the original disc with a blank one at the end of the ripping process, there is no interaction required from the user. The copy, conversion and burning process take a bit longer, though. In our test, it took a little more than four hours to successfully duplicate a Blu-ray movie.","The decryption tools employed by Aiseesoft Blu-ray Copy are both effective and invisible. The commercial Blu-ray disc we cloned was copy protected. But you wouldn’t know that because throughout the entire process, Blu-ray Copy never opened an alert window, asked for input or notified the user in any way that it was breaking the encryption.","This software has four options for copying Blu-ray discs: Full Disc, Main Movie, Clone and Write Data. These are all variants of the same function. Full Disc is the default setting and will likely be the one you use most often. This option converts the ripped movie, bonus features and all, to fit on whatever size of blank Blu-ray movie you happen to have. Since most commercial Blu-ray discs have more storage than a blank disc, most times this option will compress the content and it won’t be an exact 1:1 copy.","The Main Movie option is exactly what it sounds like. This option removes everything except the feature presentation from the copy process. This has the effect of allowing you to copy a commercial Blu-ray movie to fit on a blank Blu-ray disc without compressing the file, so you get an exact copy.","The Clone option has the benefits of both the Full Disc and Main Movie selections. It makes an exact 1:1 duplicate of everything found on a Blu-ray disc; the only caveat is that you must have a blank disc with enough storage to contain it. And lastly, the Write Data option enables you to write ISO files or Blu-ray folders onto a blank Blu-ray disc."]},"id":"574d7f7d-93be-4dd7-b663-167754cfae95","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"77e34124-feb2-4cc1-9e42-d393a16aec7e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aiseesoft Blu-ray Copy is simple but capable.
