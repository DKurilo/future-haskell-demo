The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\"><em>3D Blu-ray Player here</em></a><em>.</em>","Marantz is a company best known for manufacturing high-end audio equipment, so it should be no surprise that the best aspects of the Marantz UD5007 are its sound quality and audio format versatility. However, it lacks several conversion features and connectivity options that would make it a more useful addition to your home theater system.","It can handle just about any type of disc or disc format you can think of, including CD, DVD, 3D or standard Blu-ray, SACD, DVD-A, CD-R/RW, and DVD-R/RW. A front-located USB port also lets you open audio, video or photo files from a memory stick or plugged-in drive. It supports internet movie streaming and includes apps for all of the most popular services, like Netflix, Hulu Plus, VUDU and YouTube.","That&#39;s not to say the UD5007 is perfect. One of its biggest shortcomings is the fact it isn&#39;t Wi-Fi ready and has to be hardwired via Ethernet LAN to get online. While that may not a big deal to everyone, the <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">best 3D Blu-ray players</a> include this capability. It also has a surprising shortage of connectivity ports, with only one HDMI out and one USB port, and its only audio output is  two RCA jacks on the rear panel. In comparison, most of our highest-rated 3D Blu-ray players have either an optical digital audio output jack, a coaxial audio out or both, which would deliver higher quality audio to your stereo.","The video department, while fully capable of delivering on the immersive experience of 3D, is missing a couple of features that would serve to make it a device capable of adapting with emerging technology â€“ most notably, this model doesn&#39;t have the ability to convert video to 4K for playback on ultra-high definition TVs. It&#39;s also lacking 2D to 3D conversion.","Back on the upside, it&#39;s DLNA certified, which means it can stream media files wirelessly from other similarly certified devices on your network, and there&#39;s even a free app you can download that will let you remotely control it with your tablet or smartphone, as long as you also have a Marantz network receiver. It&#39;s also got one of the best warranties on the market, effectively tripling the standard one-year warranty most 3D Blu-ray players come with."]},"id":"945a546c-680f-49ba-ae30-66b1c27dfc9c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"51bd5457-d96e-49dd-ab62-d9b5dc102dbf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The UD5007 puts out good sound and performs in the more well-established areas of 3D Blu-ray playback.
