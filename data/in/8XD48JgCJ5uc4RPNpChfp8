While each lender may have its own requirements, the SBA mandates some basic requirements for any business to qualify for an SBA 7(a) loan. For example, you must do business in the United States and have invested equity, a sound business plan and purpose, and a legitimate need for funding. You must also have utilized other sources of funding, including personal assets, before seeking a 7(a) loan. We list several additional qualifications below.

However, other programs, sponsored by the government and independent lenders, are available for nonprofits.","<strong>Work in a qualifying industry.</strong> While many industries qualify for an SBA 7(a) loan, there are some that don&#39;t, such as government-owned companies, lending institutions and life insurance businesses.

They&#39;re also more readily available for companies that may not qualify for conventional bank loans or SBA loans, such as those with less-than-perfect credit or new companies that haven&#39;t been in business long enough to establish a credit history. Plus, online alternative lenders can approve and fund the loan more quickly than banks, which is an important consideration for many businesses.","These loans are typically smaller than SBA 7(a) loans, ranging from $2,000 to $150,000, though some lenders may offer as much as $500,000. However, the amount your business qualifies for may vary depending on the health of your business, which online lenders gauge using your cash flow, personal and business credit history, and other considerations. This type of loan has shorter terms, as most lenders offer terms between one month and five years. On average, however, most loans terms are between 12 and 24 months.","Alternative loans typically have higher interest rates and more fees than conventional loans. Although there are many reputable alternative lenders, this market lacks the regulations of bank loans. Because these are business loans rather than personal loans, the Truth in Lending Act doesn&#39;t apply, potentially leaving small businesses vulnerable to predatory lenders.","No matter which type of loan you apply for, it&#39;s important that you thoroughly read the contract and understand the loan&#39;s interest rate, fees, penalties and repayment terms. Taking out a small or startup business loan is a risky undertaking for a small business, and it&#39;s important that you&#39;re certain you&#39;ll be able to repay the loan, as consequences for defaulting are significant. Although applying for an SBA 7(a) loan may require you to submit more paperwork than many other loan options, it&#39;s a regulated loan with capped interest rates, limited fees and flexible terms. These are important considerations when you&#39;re looking for business funding, as it makes the 7(a) loan more affordable than many other types of loans, especially those that lack regulation. ","<em>Disclaimer: The interest rates listed are reflective of the date this review was last updated.</em>"]},"id":"714195ff-c8df-4404-94ff-c4c7c3c2432e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9217f3c2-cb8f-4b6c-b6be-7eab5b038792","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz/loans_lines/sba/7a_term_loan/\">Wells Fargo</a>","<a href=\"https://www.chase.com/business-banking\">Chase</a>","<a href=\"https://www.smartbizloans.com/\">SmartBiz</a>","<a href=\"http://www.thesba.com/financial-institutions/financial-lender-program/\">Newtek</a>","<a href=\"https://www.usbank.com/small-business/credit-financing/sba-loans.html\">U.S. Bank</a>","<a href=\"https://www.celticbank.com\">Celtic Bank</a>","<a href=\"https://ndconline.org/small-business-lending/\">NDC Grow America Fund</a>","<a href=\"https://www.connect2capital.com/\">CRF Connect2Capital</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cimgroup.com/pmc/loan-programs/loan-program-highlights\">PMC</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ablsba.com/abl-loan-products.html\">American Business Lending</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c0169517-169f-49c0-814e-aaa2b3711aeb","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1269","url":"/best-small-business-loans","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-01T18:32:24Z","datePublished":"2017-05-05T19:45:33Z","name":"Small Business Loans Review","synopsis":"Find the small business loan that helps your company grow.
