Rather than having to press the shutter button time and time again, this nifty camera can be set to automatically snap pictures in one-, five- or 15-minute intervals. Even cooler, this digital camera is designed to clip onto your pet&#39;s collar, so you can see exactly what Fluffy or Fido does when you are not around.","This kids camera is made from durable plastic and will be able to handle a few bumps and drops, and even a little splash of water as your pet drinks. It is lightweight, only 8 ounces, and has a clip that can easily slip onto your pet&#39;s nylon or flat leather collar without posing a choking hazard to your animal. Another fun idea is to clip the camera on your own belt and discover things you miss while you are going about your day.","The National Geographic Wild Pet&#39;s Eye View child&#39;s camera takes two AAA alkaline batteries. This camera has an automatic shutoff feature to help prolong the life of the batteries and extend the fun your child will have with this camera in between battery changes.","This child&#39;s camera has some small parts that can be dangerous for children under 3. The National Geographic Wild Pet Eye View is recommended for children over 8 years old. This camera comes with a booklet that has fun facts about animal eyesight and suggestions for capturing fun and different perspectives in photography.","The resolution of this child&#39;s camera is okay. It isn&#39;t up to traditional digital camera standards, but it&#39;s great for the kids camera that it is. The photo storage of this camera can only hold 40 pictures. This is on the low end of the spectrum for kids digital cameras. You can easily upload all the images onto your computer using the included USB cable. This is the only way that you will be able to see your photos, since this camera doesn&#39;t come with a view screen."]},"id":"f4d93edb-76b0-46d9-b702-951f82a7b04f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c2f83f10-9b7d-485c-961e-86f640fcb5e7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The National Geographic Wild Pet&#39;s Eye View is a good choice for a digital camera for kids.
