We also spent time checking online videos, watching TV cooking shows, and reading articles, cookbooks and cooking blogs. Periodically, we called manufacturers so we could give you accurate information if any questions arose.","We also consulted with experts and industry insiders to get their take on some of the most important new features and to understand the direction cooktops are headed. We talked to Natalie Walsh, a marketing manager for Frigidaire. She said one of the primary concerns of consumers purchasing an electric cooktop is knowing if it will fit into the existing cutout of their counter space. She said the cooktops that are in the process of being launched are redesigned to fit into most existing cutout spaces for cooktops of the same size, whether they be 30 or 36 inches.","Walsh said that when installing a cooktop you should consult the product installation guide for detailed instructions and electrical requirements needed to support the product. You should also consult local and national electric codes, she said. Representatives from Maytag we contacted recommended that consumers consult installers who are familiar with the appliance as well as electricians for proper wire hookup. “Every home situation is unique,” the Maytag representative said. “So wiring recommendations vary based on the need and circumstance.”","The cooktops in our electric cooktop lineup lack induction technology. Top Ten Reviews has a separate review site devoted to <a href=\"/best-induction-cooktops\">induction cooktops</a>. Walsh pointed out that there are many advantages to induction cooktops. They provide faster heat and consistent results with precise temperatures. Plus, they are easy to clean because the surface stays relatively cool so spills and occasional boil-overs don’t burn onto the cooktop. When consumers experience cooking on induction for the first time, they absolutely love it and are amazed by the speed, precision and overall time savings,” Walsh said. Our reviews for the Frigidaire and Maytag will contain more information from our interviews with representatives from these companies.  ","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","We spent 80 hours researching gas cooktops to determine the 10 best and did so with the idea that different cooks would want different things. We reviewed an array of top-quality electric cooktops that give you a wide variety of features, capabilities and price tags so you could find the best for your kitchen and culinary style.","Among other things, we looked at sizes. We also checked how the heating elements were arranged on each cooktop, what kinds of controls were available and the location of the controls. In addition, we looked for safety features including child locks, heat indicators and automatic shut-off functions.","We also examined different temperature levels. Some electric cooktops give you a rapid heating function that lets you bring pasta water to a boil quickly. Some also offer a low-temperature heating element dedicated to things like simmering foods or even just keeping them warm while other foods cook on the remaining burners.","We decided to look within a wide but reasonable price range, at models created by popular and well-known manufacturers, and we searched for many characteristics ranging from heating element wattage to overall dimensions.","For our comparison, we chose to evaluate ceramic glass cooktops and avoid the coiled burners of low-end models. Those are extremely economical and they certainly work as far as food preparation goes. However, we determined they did not suit the needs of readers who are looking to renovate or build a kitchen today since our readers likely want a greater variety of cooking, safety and cleaning features, as well as a more modern and streamlined appearance that would work well in today’s kitchens.","<strong>What to Look for in an Electric Cooktop <br/></strong><br/>Number of Burners<br/>If you cook for lots of people, or simply love to get plenty of good food ready, then a five-burner cooktop would no doubt be just right for you. However, if you don’t use that many pans, four burners could easily do the job – typically for less money. Frequently, good-quality electric cooktops have double- or triple-burner cooktops, meaning rings-within-rings of elements that heat up as needed when you set the controls. These work well to fit the type of pan you’re using on that particular burner.","Cooking Extras<br/> An especially popular feature is the bridge, which is a heating area that links two burners and can be used to cook foods in long, oval roasting pans, or for use with grills or griddles. It also makes cooking easy when you have multiple cooking settings for heat levels and preset temperatures for favorite dishes. A burner with a fast boil feature can be very helpful as can a simmer burner.<br/><br/>Safety Features<br/>Most of the cooktops in our lineup have control locks to render the cooktop unusable, so a curious child can’t turn it on when you’re not around. Most cooktops have glowing burners that mimic a coiled burner, so there is no mistaking when it is hot, but this goes away when you turn off the burner, even if it’s still hot. It’s therefore important to have heat indicator lights to let you know when it is safe to touch, especially if you have kids around. It helps to have controls positioned in front of the burners so you don’t have to reach across hot burners to get to them.","Price<br/>We reviewed cooktops ranging in price from under $700 to more than $1,400. Although many consumers look for units priced below $300, these cheaper cooktops don’t have as many burners, settings and features as our favorite models. If you’re looking for a cooktop on the highest end, expect to spend up to $3,500."]},"id":"9ce1ba8a-929f-4a3a-b70f-3d940121e7a7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_139","url":"/best-electric-cooktops","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-22T21:43:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-22T21:43:00Z","name":"Best Electric Cooktops of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best electric cooktops for a variety of budgets and needs, including recommendations for small spaces and griddle-cookers.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best electric cooktops for a variety of budgets and needs, including recommendations for small spaces and griddle-cookers.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-07T17:53:54Z","id":"dJym2omzaKYvmdAtzhKM5J","meta":{"title":"Best Electric Cooktops of 2019 - Glossy Ceramic-Glass Stove Tops","description":"Here are the best electric cooktops for a variety of budgets and needs, including recommendations for small spaces and griddle-cookers."},"products":[{"slug":"electrolux-ei36ec45ks","url":"/product/electrolux-ei36ec45ks","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","name":"Electrolux EI36EC45KS","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"WmnNg9W5G4gn3oHKi8xFCR","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"kenmore-elite-45113","url":"/product/kenmore-elite-45113","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","name":"Kenmore Elite 45113","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"nGEx8Uib8dntMPmt4aFzM8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lg-lce3010sb","url":"/product/lg-lce3010sb","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","name":"LG LCE3010SB","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"qinpTKts4BxEDstENkZ3Sa","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"bosch-benchmark-net668suc","url":"/product/bosch-benchmark-net668suc","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","name":"Bosch Benchmark NET668SUC","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"pss2PGL77iiSRANwXdidbR","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"ge-profile-pp9036sjss","url":"/product/ge-profile-pp9036sjss","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","name":"GE Profile PP9036SJSS","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"kQCncuXYBF27ofjgtEPLrR","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/pCL4fAwgHDFSzaJYqX8rdA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Electric-Cooktops-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/C/V/739183/original/Hero-Electric-Cooktops-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"pCL4fAwgHDFSzaJYqX8rdA","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pCL4fAwgHDFSzaJYqX8rdA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Electric Cooktops of 2019","description":"Here are the best electric cooktops for a variety of budgets and needs, including recommendations for small spaces and griddle-cookers."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/pCL4fAwgHDFSzaJYqX8rdA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Electric-Cooktops-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/C/V/739183/original/Hero-Electric-Cooktops-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"pCL4fAwgHDFSzaJYqX8rdA","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pCL4fAwgHDFSzaJYqX8rdA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Electric Cooktops of 2019","description":"Here are the best electric cooktops for a variety of budgets and needs, including recommendations for small spaces and griddle-cookers."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"cooktops","url":"/kitchen/cooktops","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","name":"Cooktops","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:10:27Z","id":"jemnMYzb6AiSzYYFPLLdMY","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
