The <a href=\"/best-rewards-credit-cards\">rewards credit cards</a> you can choose from include the ThankYou Preferred Card, ThankYou Premier Card, Prestige Card and the popular Double Cash Card. Each one may include a sign-up bonus, but check Citi&#39;s website as the offers are subject to change at any time.","The Citi ThankYou Preferred Card is packed with reward options that give you points on everyday purchases. With this rewards credit card, you rack up points with every purchase you make, and some purchases earn double points. Every dollar spent earns you one point on everyday purchases, and you can earn two points for every dollar spent when you use your card at restaurants and for entertainment.","The credit card rewards you earn with this Citi card can be redeemed for gift cards, merchandise, cash or even donations to charities. There&#39;s no cap on the amount of points, and they won&#39;t ever expire with the Citi ThankYou Preferred Card. Additionally, just for being a Citi ThankYou cardholder, you receive exclusive event information. There is no annual fee with this card, but other fees apply.","If you&#39;re looking to earn more ThankYou points, you can apply for the Citi ThankYou Premier Card. This rewards card nets you triple points for every dollar spent on travel expenses and gas, double points for dining and entertainment, and one point per dollar spent on other purchases. Additionally, your rewards points are worth more than face value if you redeem them for travel expenses such as airfare, hotel stays, cruises and car rentals – but you must purchase them through the Citi ThankYou Travel Center. There is a $95 annual fee with this card, but it&#39;s waived the first year you have your card, and the price is subject to change.","For a card with even more benefits, the Citi Prestige Card is available, but at an added cost. You get the same ThankYou points earning potential as the ThankYou Premier Card, but triple points are awarded when you purchase airfare and hotel stays with your card. Additionally, you receive a $250 air travel credit to your card that applies to airfare, luggage fees and upgrades purchased with your card. Also, your ThankYou points are worth 33 percent more when you purchase flights through the Citi Travel Center. There are other perks to having this card that may make it worth its $450 annual fee.","Citi also offers its Double Cash Card, which lets you earn twice the amount of cash back than most cash rewards cards. You get 1 percent cash back on your purchases and then 1 percent cash back as you pay for those purchases, but you need to pay at least the minimum due each month to continue accruing those rewards.","There is no cap on how much you can earn back, and you don&#39;t have to purchase from specific categories – you earn cash back on all purchases. It&#39;s your choice on how you receive your reward: statement credits, gift cards or checks. There is no annual fee for this card.","As with most rewards credit cards, Citi has a 0 percent annual percentage rate (APR) on both purchases and balance transfers you make for the first 12 or 18 months you have one of these cards. Following the introductory period, the APR switches to a variable rate. Additionally, you can expect higher interest rates on cash advances and penalties. What you pay in interest is also determined by your creditworthiness.","Citi does levy certain fees with its line of credit cards, which are follow the industry standard. Citi charges a late fee, and you pay a percentage for each cash advance and balance transfer. It&#39;s important to check the terms of each credit card as they can change at any time and your interest rate, fees, rewards, earning potential and more can go up or down.","Citi&#39;s credit cards include all the extra features that generally accompany a credit card. If you use your Citi card to purchase travel, you get automatic travel accident insurance and trip cancellation or interruption coverage. The rewards cards also include auto rental insurance, extended warranty coverage, zero liability protection and much more.","Contacting Citi for customer service can only be done by telephone; there is no member support via email or live chat. You can reference a list of frequently asked questions on its website, which are very helpful and neatly categorized, making it easy to find the answers you need.","Citi&#39;s line of rewards credit cards can earn you all sorts of rewards: access to exciting events, plus they can put some cash back into your pocket. There&#39;s no annual fee with many of its cards, a lengthy introductory APR for purchases and balance transfers, and some extra key features that could come in handy in an unforeseen situation."]},"id":"37c46c73-e1ef-4aa6-9608-1f5c37df4275","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68336","url":"/citi-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-07T18:57:52Z","datePublished":"2016-09-07T18:57:52Z","name":"Citi Rewards Credit Cards","synopsis":"Citi Bank offers plenty of different rewards cards for every budget, giving you the opportunity to earn cash back, points and travel rewards.
