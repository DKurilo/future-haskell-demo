This device does not have 3D compatibility or built-in Wi-Fi, features that we’ve come to expect on the best LED TVs. However, if you’re in the market for a basic, affordable LED TV with an adequate picture, the Emerson LED TV can work for you.","The Emerson LED TV is a simple device. It has a passable black level and color accuracy score, and the picture pales in comparison to the top-ranked LED TVs. However, if this will be a secondary television or if you just don’t put too much stock into having the best picture quality, this Emerson brand TV will work because it still offers 1920 x 1080p high definition resolution. This TV has a 60Hz refresh rate as well. This is not as fast as 120Hz or 240Hz refresh rates, so you may experience some motion blurring with fast action sports or video games. On the other hand, some people don’t enjoy the “soap-opera” camera motion that inherently comes with a higher refresh rate. If this is you, then this TV may even work better.","Many of the best LED TVs offer features like Wi-Fi or 3D compatibility; however, you may never use those features. No use in paying extra for features you won’t use very often, so save yourself a little dough and get a basic television for simple TV watching. Another great reason for choosing an Emerson LED TV is that since it is not a name brand, the cost of advertising is not naturally built into the price of this unit like it may be for top-ranked LED TVs.","It’s important to have a decent number of connections on a TV. Blu-ray players, video game systems and satellite or cable TV boxes can connect to a TV with HDMI cables to ensure you get a full HD picture. This device has three ports for HDMI, as well as component and composite connections for non-HD devices like a DVD player."]},"id":"36b7c609-abf6-4805-955d-140514a54847","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"34b10f8f-f8ac-4dcf-bafa-663ff6b9cb6f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When choosing a secondary LED TV, price sometimes becomes the number one priority.
