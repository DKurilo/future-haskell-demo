You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","At a storage volume of 1.8 cubic feet, the SunDanzer DCR50 is among the smaller <a href=\"/best-freezers\">chest freezers</a>. Most entry-level chest freezers start at a volume of around 5 cubic feet. However, the SunDanzer&#39;s internal features help to shrink down the size differential.","Despite its small stature, the chest freezer is built for durability. The DCR50 measures at 26.5 x 23 x 30.5 inches and 75 pounds, but its airflow requirements provide some installation flexibility. The freezer only requires 3 inches of clearance on each side. This will allow the freezer to circulate enough air to maximize its operating efficiency.","When cleaning the freezer, SunDanzer recommends that you use warm water and mild soaps. You can also use baking soda to absorb odors inside the cabinet. Abrasives or other harsh cleaners can damage your freezer&#39;s cabinet and finish. A drain hole at the bottom of the unit also allows you to drain extra water while defrosting the freezer.","Internally, the SunDanzer possesses several unique features. The small chest freezer is built with DC construction for greater power efficiency. According to SunDanzer, the freezer only consumes 0.28 kilowatts per day at an operating temperature of 32 degrees Celsius. This lets the freezer consume less power on a daily basis, which will cut down on monthly power bills.","An adjustable thermostat allows you to control the freezer&#39;s operating temperature. While the freezer&#39;s small scale makes it relatively portable, outside temperatures can affect DCR50&#39;s performance. SunDanzer recommends that you not use the freezer when the external temperature is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.","For the environmentally conscious, SunDanzer also powers the DCR50 with CFC-free environmental coolant. The chest also includes a 12-month warranty to cover parts and labor for issues caused by defective components.","As a small freezer, the DCR50 is limited by its modest storage capacity. However, the SunDanzer&#39;s low power consumption makes it versatile enough to work in a variety of untraditional applications. Whether you need a spare freezer for your cabin or business, the SunDanzer DCR50 is capable of meeting these needs."]},"id":"ee1bf6f0-12a7-4836-ac92-954617839986","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58822","url":"/sundanzer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-19T21:48:05Z","datePublished":"2014-02-19T21:48:05Z","name":"SunDanzer DCR50","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
