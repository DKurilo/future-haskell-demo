The hair dryers found in hotels arenâ€™t typically high quality and often cause more harm than help. This is where the BaByliss Pro Nano Travel comes into play. Offering a compact and lightweight design combined with a powerful heating element, this device is more than equal to the task of drying and caring for your hair."]},"id":"848b99cb-2781-40e2-918f-719ae4b57544","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/x9tgKMPTwnLHrHKeaPXwAN.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58143-babyliss-pro-nano-travel2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x9tgKMPTwnLHrHKeaPXwAN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"x9tgKMPTwnLHrHKeaPXwAN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x9tgKMPTwnLHrHKeaPXwAN.jpg","alt":""},"id":"cd44929b-30c7-4740-ac86-f994b59522e3","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The main appeal behind the BaByliss Pro Nano Travel is its compact nature. It is less than half a foot wide or tall and comes with a folding handle, so you can pack it in your smallest suitcase. Weighing only 12 ounces, or three-quarters of a pound, this hair blower will be an easy addition to any vacation packing.","In terms of wattage, the BaByliss Pro Nano Travel is rated at 1000 watts, making it an ideal choice for individuals with fine or damaged hair. It may take longer to dry curly or thick hair, but the airflow can prove quite surprising. This unit easily outperforms many other portable hair dryers on the market, due largely to the nano-titanium technology used to control temperature.","This hair dryer easily maintains a constant temperature while in use, which  dries your hair more effectively. The BaByliss Pro Nano Travel utilizes a heating element that uses infrared heat, producing gentler air and preventing unnecessary damage. By heating hair up from the inside out, you can dry your hair in half the time it takes traditional ceramic blow dryers. In addition to a more controlled flow of air, the heating element also emits negative ions to reduce frizz and contain moisture for even healthier-appearing hair.","The BaByliss Pro Nano Travel is one of the best blow dryers on the market for individuals seeking something portable. It may not be as heavy-duty as larger dryers on the market, but it still packs a significant amount of heat output for individuals on the road. When you lack the space to pack something large, this unit can become your best friend."]},"id":"0541a82a-797d-430c-a5ee-234519dee642","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58171","url":"/babyliss-pro-nano-travel-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:58:14Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:58:14Z","name":"BaByliss Pro Nano Travel","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
