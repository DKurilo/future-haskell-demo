You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","eMachines has garnered a decent reputation for making reliable budget-friendly computers. The eMachines EZ1601 is the vendor&#39;s all-in-one PC product, and it’s what we’d expect: a cheap all-in-one desktop PC. The value of the eMachines EZ1601 all-in-one computer all depends on how you look at it.","The monitor display, space-saving design and included features are amazing for the low price. But in relation to the best all-in-one PCs, the processor, RAM, storage and other hardware are comparatively weak. To compare the eMachines EZ1601 with the best all-in-one computers isn’t completely fair; the only real comparable feature is the form factor. In reality, the EZ1601 is actually a nettop computer: a desktop all-in-one design with the internal specs of a netbook, and a built-in DVD drive.","The eMachines all-in-one computer is not a powerhouse media center computer. It is however a very viable option for a second or third family computer. For basic tasks and internet browsing, the EZ1601 is one of the best nettop computers. The hardware design and included features lend itself to be a great option for kids, spare rooms or business storefronts. As long as know the limitations beforehand, the strengths of the eMachines EZ1601 (price and convenience) make for a really good all-in-one nettop computer."]},"id":"a445db16-d2ea-4de3-8b7a-56a8d119299c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Basic Specifications"},"id":"223c9d94-8312-498a-b6a0-2a5019501923","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The processor, system RAM and other specs make it clear that the eMachines EZ all-in-one is not a powerhouse. The EZ1601 falls significantly behind the best all-in-one computers in terms of specs. The 160GB hard drive and graphics card are comparatively weak. The 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 processor is decent but not great. The real kicker is the paltry 1GB of memory that is neither sufficient nor upgradable.","The eMachines EZ1601 all-in-one PC runs on Windows XP Home (Service Pack 3) and comes bundled with several software trials, including Microsoft Home and Student 2007, Norton Internet Security and CyberLink PowerToGo."]},"id":"f9ffa881-0ef7-482b-841e-ac53a2f8a55e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"d7010cb3-1299-491d-8162-68bf074e237d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The eMachines EZ1601 all-in-one PC comes bundled with a keyboard and mouse (both wired).

We’re not at all surprised (or disappointed really) to see eMachines steer clear of a touchscreen interface, but we were a bit thrown off that the EZ1601 doesn’t include a webcam.","eMachines’ EZ1601 all-in-one computer also comes equipped with a multi-in-1 digital media card reader that supports SD cards and other memory sticks. The design of the computer is respectable, with everything neatly packaged in an easel-upright monitor. The 18.5-inch LCD display is – like the rest of the computer – great for a nettop but not particularly compelling in comparison with the best all-in-one PCs."]},"id":"ca0b3ca4-2133-4f78-b3a9-18a11a083221","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"4f1fd210-f3e0-4c97-b2ed-63c22f1ee04f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["eMachines has several support options available, including online manuals, driver downloads and product registration.
