The extreme lack of compatibility pushes Energizer’s wireless charger further down our lineup, but the charger still performs well. Its compactness makes it more durable than some of its larger companions, but it also limits the number of devices that can be charged at one time. The customer support Energizer offers is fair, but the durability and service isn’t enough to push this wireless phone charger to the top of our comparison.","Energizer was formed just before the turn of the 20th century, with a 3-pound battery and the first electric flashlight as their foundation. They have become one of the premier manufacturers of batteries and flashlights the world over. They continue to innovate, boasting devices with early-adoption technologies, like the Qi protocol for inductive charging systems. The Energizer Inductive Charger takes full advantage of this technology, allowing you to keep your device charged with drop-and-go ease."]},"id":"e5c677d6-2cbc-4849-b691-8f7368b1fbdd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Specifications"},"id":"4aa3f705-b087-4eaf-a781-3a4de552f353","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is the category that Energizer performed the most poorly in. The Energizer Inductive Charger is only compatible with two devices: the BlackBerry Curve 8900 and the iPhone 3G/3GS. It was this crippling lack of compatibility that put this wireless charger behind the competition. If you have a device that you want to charge with this wireless phone charger that isn’t one of the abovementioned phones, a USB port located on the top-right corner of the pad will accommodate these. While this feature does expand the compatibility of the device, it doesn’t do so in a way that makes it any more convenient than the standard cord.","Outside of this stunning lack of device compatibility, this is a very functional wireless charger. If Energizer offered a few more cases for other prominent cell phones or devices, like the iPhone 4 or other main Blackberry models, this wireless charger would perform much better in our comparison."]},"id":"d5a83f3b-2e0d-4cc7-b6c1-bda034ea3790","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"db5ec02e-2685-4d98-8bf6-cb873afa8d62","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Energizer Inductive Charger can charge up to three devices at a time, but it only has the capacity to charge two devices wirelessly.

As an added bonus, it has an automatic shutoff that ceases sending power to the devices when they reach full power.
