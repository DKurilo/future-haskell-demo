The reviewers completed a user experience survey, rating each tool based on its balance, handling, power, weight and grip using a scale of one to five, with one being the worst and five being the best. After collecting the surveys, we averaged out all the scores and awarded each drill a letter grade.","We also conducted a battery life test. In this test, we attached a fully charged battery to each drill, taped its trigger down and timed how long it took for it to run out of power. Some died in as little as 20 minutes, while others lasted longer than an hour. We calculated a letter grade for each of the drills based on the results.<br/><strong><br/>Quick Tips</strong>","If you have never used a cordless drill before, something as minor as getting the bit to insert and stay in the drill may seem confusing. For all the first-time users, you should give this <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/tools/how-to/g2661/how-to-adjust-a-drill-driver/\">Popular Mechanics article</a> a glance. It’s a great read for novice users to become familiarized with a cordless drill and their features. <br/><strong><br/>Are Brushless Drills Better?</strong>","Even though all of the drills in our comparison are brushless and this type is much more common in the current market, you can find plenty of drills with brushes. The main difference is that brushless motors adjust to the task, based on resistance, whereas drills with brushes don&#39;t. Unlike some standard motors, brushless drills do not have a voltage drop, which means their motors should last longer. We think brushless models are worth it, even for occasional use, because they operate more efficiently, more quietly and longer than brushed models do.","However, if you need the most budget-friendly option, you may want to consider a traditional motor. The brushed motor drills we looked at were about $20 cheaper than brushless models. However, you may still pay more in the long run, as the brushes will eventually wear out and need to be replaced."]},"id":"bcfb493e-55bc-475e-a179-8c5eaa089729","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Kk5DzM92msnqhF7xtKkBP9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/home-cordless-drills/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9IL1gvODE5NzE3L29yaWdpbmFsL0NvcmRsZXNzLURyaWxscy0wMDguanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kk5DzM92msnqhF7xtKkBP9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Kk5DzM92msnqhF7xtKkBP9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kk5DzM92msnqhF7xtKkBP9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"2fa4c939-4758-440f-81ea-2616b0d7d876","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What Key Features to Look for When Buying a Cordless Drill?</strong>","User Experience<br/>Asking other people about their experiences with and opinions of their cordless drills is a good way to find the best one for you. Since we tested the drills we reviewed in real-world scenarios, the our user experience survey results are a great place to find this information. You can also ask your friends and family which cordless drill they own. If you have a chance, try out several different tools before you buy one – you might be surprised by which one you like best.","Power<br/>Power is measured in two ways: turning speed and torque. Turning speed is measured in RPM and torque in inch-pounds. If you don’t know what that means, don’t worry – you’re probably not a general contractor or professional builder, so your drill will mostly be used for small- to medium-size projects. If you don’t plan on using your drill on a regular basis, speed and torque become less important, and your choice should primarily be based on which model is the most comfortable to use.","Battery Life<br/>Running out of power during a drilling job isn’t just annoying – if the drill stops in the middle of boring a hole in wood, it can damage the wood, the bit and the tool itself. Consult the results of our battery life test, and if you can, get a drill with a backup battery. This allows you to keep one on the charger while you work, so when you run out of power, you can just swap out the battery.","Price<br/>The best cordless drills in our review can cost hundreds.

But if you just want to have a cordless drill for those just-in-case scenarios, you don’t have to shell out that much cash. While it was our lowest scoring product, the <a href=\"/porter-cable-cordless-drill-review\">Porter-Cable PCCK600LB</a>, can be picked up for less than $50. Of course, it won’t perform as well or last as long on a full battery, but it might be just what you need for quick jobs that pop up around the house from time to time. Based on our research, the best cordless drills can range anywhere from $75 to $260.","<strong><br/>More Power Tool Guides: </strong>"]},"id":"aeded57f-2d68-4116-8acf-b09765869009","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-chainsaws\">The Best Chainsaws</a>","<a href=\"/best-circular-saws\">The Best Circular Saws</a>","<a href=\"/best-miter-saws\">The Best Miter Saws</a>","<a href=\"/best-belt-sanders\">The Best Belt Sanders</a>","<a href=\"/best-palm-routers\">The Best Palm Routers</a>","<a href=\"/best-laser-line-levels\">The Best Laser Line Levels</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"49ec97e3-515a-4426-96db-a20a66503357","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_27","url":"/best-cordless-drills","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
