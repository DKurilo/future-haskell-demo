You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Yamaha started off well over a hundred years ago only making musical instruments, but over the years they have slowly added a variety of other things to their production list. One such product line was for electronic audio equipment, where they have been a main contender for years. In our selection of the top ten <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a> for around four hundred dollars, there were two from Yamaha that we felt deserved a spot. The better of the two is the Yamaha RX-V665BL.","This AV device is a pretty impressive competitor. It wasn&#39;t the best one we reviewed but it still ranked well. It has most of the important features and hardware but does lack a few things. The level of performance is the other area where it falls short. With some improved performance and a few more features this would be a superior AV receiver.","This Yamaha AV receiver has 100dB SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), exactly the same as the other receivers we looked at, aside from the two Onkyos (106dB). The frequency response isn&#39;t quite as broad as the other leading products, but the difference probably isn&#39;t audible to the human ear. On the other end though, the level of harmonic distortion is lower than all the competition, save only the Pioneer VSX-1020-K.","The amount of surround sound output per channel is only 90 watts, which is just average. Unlike Onkyo&#39;s TX-SR608 AV recevier though, the amplifier is much more efficient. Rather than consuming over 600 watts, it requires only 270 watts. That&#39;s not good enough to help this product rank better, but it is better than some that we looked at.","Aside from having a couple extra composite video inputs, the back of this box will look fairly similar to the rest. There are the composite AV ports, a SIRIUS satellite radio connection, optical and coaxial digital ports, AM/FM radio and more. The unfortunate part is that it only has four HDMI inputs. The Pioneer and both Onkyo AV receivers have six HDMI inputs, but all the rest we reviewed only have three or four. Four probably works for most people, but it is surprising how fast you can use them. Hopefully in the future, instead of a few extra composite inputs, Yamaha will throw in the extra HDMI instead.","Half of the AV receivers that we reviewed have Dolby Pro Logic IIz and the other half only has Dolby Pro logic IIx. Essentially they are the same thing, they up-convert stereo and 5.1 surround sound. The difference is that &#34;x&#34; up-converts to 6.1 and 7.1 channel surround sound where as &#34;z&#34; can take it up to 9.1.","What &#34;z&#34; does is create front height channels. Like the name indicates, these are located above the front speakers are not discrete channels. Since they&#39;re created and not discrete, you don&#39;t have to worry about finding &#34;9.1 content&#34;. Basically these matrixed channels play ambient sound like rain and other weather. This puts sounds like rain above you where they belong. This is the next step in 3D audio but unfortunately it isn&#39;t available on the Yamaha RX-V665BL AV receiver.","Supposedly the older Yamaha AV receivers were pretty lacking in features compared to this model. Well, we couldn&#39;t find much in the way of features for the Yamaha RX-V665BL either. Yamaha will have to take an even bigger step forward if they eventually want to overtake their competition. The unique feature it has going for it is its lightweight design, which is especially nice if you move a lot.","The only extra features you&#39;ll find are satellite radio, iPod compatibility and 1080p video scaling. The video up-scaling isn&#39;t even all that amazing. There is the option of paying extra to add a Bluetooth adaptor. We couldn&#39;t find warranty information on either of the Yamaha products that we reviewed, but it&#39;s probably covered for one year."]},"id":"e1bb29b7-956a-48f7-8d20-f9a7305501dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"792ee1ef-cf33-4082-9833-01a6eec757cd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Yamaha RX-V665BL</strong> definitely doesn&#39;t stand up to the best competition, but it actually gives you a lot for the price.
