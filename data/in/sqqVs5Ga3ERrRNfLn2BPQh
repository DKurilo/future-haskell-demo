You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Panasonic MC-CG301 is a budget canister vacuum without a lot of frills. The vacuum lacks the tools the best <a href=\"/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-budget-vacuums/\">budget vacuums</a> provide, including an upholstery tool and dusting brush. It is lightweight and easy to store, but it doesn&#39;t have a lot of suction.","In our tests, this inexpensive vacuum cleaner&#39;s performance was average at vacuuming up debris on both short and thicker carpet. We tested the Panasonic with flour and kitty litter, and it took several passes to clean up both messes. This is not the vacuum you want if you have pets. It was easily the worst vacuum at picking up pet hair and dander. Other affordable vacuums cleaned the entire area, but this vacuum simply couldn&#39;t pick up stuck hairs. We had to pick the hairs out by hand before the carpet was spotless.","The vacuum has a nice, portable design with a canister that rolls on large wheels, but the plastic base gives the Panasonic MC-CG301 a cheap appearance. We like how well it moves around a cluttered area. The hose is flexible, the head of the vacuum swivels effortlessly as you turn, and the canister rolls smoothly behind you. The vacuum is a less than 10 pounds, which is light. You&#39;ll have an easy time carrying it up and down stairs. At 87.5 decibels, it&#39;s near the lower end of the spectrum for noise level.","Our biggest complaint with the Panasonic is its lack of versatility and extras. The handle extends and a crevice tool is mounted to the unit, but there are no other tools that are included. There is no dusting brush, for instance, which would allow you to clean out heating vents or ceiling corners. The vacuum doesn&#39;t have an upholstery tool either. The head of the vacuum is too rough for fine couch materials or curtains, so you&#39;re limited to cleaning floors.","The Panasonic MC-CG301 comes with a standard one-year warranty. The manufacturer website offers a high level of service, with e-mail, online FAQs and live chat. If you lose your owner manual, one is available online as a PDF."]},"id":"d40ac653-3146-4889-bc4b-fa2abbb30cca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"653745d0-12f9-4909-be48-00135ae52833","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic MC-CG301 doesn&#39;t have the power, versatility or extras that other budget vacuums provide.
