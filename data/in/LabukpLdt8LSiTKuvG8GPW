You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The products engineers at T-fal have come up with an interesting and unique solution for retrieving finished toast from hot toasting slots: an angled-slot design. The angled slots let you view the bread during the toasting cycle, and when the bread has finished toasting, the angled slots provide easy removal. The toast will pop up above the angled edge of the toasting slot. This works well with the high-lift feature on the <a href=\"/best-toasters\">toaster</a>. The high-lift raises the toast even higher out of the toasting slots. With these features, it’s easy to remove the toast without sticking your hands, a fork or tongs down into the toasting slot.","There are seven standard shade settings included on the T-fal Deluxe. With so many different settings, you’ll find one to give you just the level of toasting you prefer. The dial also allows you to select different shade settings between the standard settings. This dial isn&#39;t digital, so it will be difficult to find your precise preferred toasting level again if the dial is moved.","The T-fal Deluxe comes in a two- and four-slice version. The four-slice toaster model includes dual toasting controls. These controls let you set the two toasting sections to different shade levels, and you can toast different breads and pastries on differing shade settings simultaneously.","The counter aesthetic of the T-fal Deluxe isn&#39;t anything beyond most electric toasters. The angled design is unique. However, the overall look of the toaster is basic. This toaster won&#39;t be one you&#39;ll want to display for guests. The cool-touch sides are great for giving you peace of mind that you won&#39;t burn yourself operating the toaster. There is also a removable crumb tray.","The T-fal deluxe doesn&#39;t include many toasting functions beyond a basic, cheap toaster. It includes the standard bagel function that toasts only the cut side of a bagel. Unlike many other toasters, it doesn’t include a defrost function that thaws the bread before toasting it. The T-fal Deluxe does have a reheat function that warms the bread after the toasting cycle without toasting it any further. This lets you have warm toast whenever you want it without standing over the toaster waiting for the toasting cycle to end.","This toaster has a standard one-year warranty. It is limited to manufacture defects and doesn&#39;t cover user-generated damage. T-fal provides a customer support phone line during weekday working hours. There is also an email form on the company’s Contact Us page, so you can submit any questions you may have."]},"id":"9846a941-0d87-458d-b0e7-69b0ff66b866","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0e8196af-0a4c-4ce9-9f05-c4f10ab36800","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The unique angled-slot design sets the T-fal Deluxe toaster apart from others.
