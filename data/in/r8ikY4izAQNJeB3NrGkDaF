Do that repeatedly and after a while, you get frost.","Frost isn t quite the fearsome foe of freezers, but it can shorten the lifespan of your chest freezer. Think of that frost as an igloo: Although frost itself is cold, it acts as an insulator, so your freezer has to run longer and work harder in order to penetrate that block of ice to keep your food cold.","It s a good idea to defrost your small chest freezer at least once per year, but if you re often opening it often, you might need to defrost more often.
