If you&#39;re frustrated at the lack of software that teaches music theory, Sibelius Musition is a good introductory look at key principles, including reading music and counting time. This diverse music software teaches you the basics of several instruments, including piano, drums and guitar. However, it offers very few guitar lessons in comparison to other programs we tested, so if you&#39;re looking for software to help you master the guitar, this isn&#39;t it.","Sibelius Musition offers a more lessons than any other guitar lesson software we tested. However, these lessons cover the basics of multiple instruments but no in-depth lessons for any of them. The software teaches you how to count time and read music, important skills for any musician, but not how to string or tune a guitar. It teaches you how to read tablatures, but it won&#39;t show you how to position your hands. With 34 basic lessons, Sibelius Musition will set you on your path to becoming a musician, but when you&#39;re ready to dive into advanced skills, you&#39;ll have to buy different software or pay for private lessons.","This guitar learning software does not offer many practice tools. There is a fretboard that shows the chord positions, but it is nothing more than a basic tablature cheat sheet. As you play along with music, you can adjust the tempo to fit your needs. The program lacks interactive feedback and games, though – two features that go a long way in teaching new musicians how to navigate the guitar.","This software includes audio examples with most lessons, and it has a simple chord dictionary and glossary. Sibelius Musition only shows the right-handed view, though, and the software lacks a guitar tuner. Also, the menus are difficult to navigate, and we had trouble finding the lessons we were looking for.","Avid Technology, the publisher of Sibelius Musition, includes tutorials and FAQs online. If you need personal help, you can call or email customer support."]},"id":"302273b2-dc53-4f80-a90f-35ac4864450a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b476400a-f778-45f0-a049-0d526ef788da","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sibelius Musition is diverse guitar lesson software that not only teaches you the basics of guitar, but also the basics of music theory.
