Web hosting services that offer automatic WordPress installation offer a good way to get your blog online quickly and easily with minimal input from you. Of course, self-hosting is always an option, but paying for a quality WordPress host means that your website is safe and secure with minimal downtime and maintenance required on your part. Web hosting is essential if you have a WordPress website or blog and are concerned about stability and uptime.","WordPress web hosting, from popular services such as <a href=\"/services/web-hosting/best-wordpress-hosting/godaddy-review/\">GoDaddy</a>, <a href=\"/services/web-hosting/best-wordpress-hosting/bluehost-review/\">Bluehost</a> and <a href=\"/services/web-hosting/best-wordpress-hosting/hostgator-review/\">HostGator</a>, make it easier to maintain control and stability over your website.

Among the most common features are bandwidth allowances and storage space for your website. Other things, like whether the provider offers custom email addresses or a free domain name for your website are other factors to consider.","<strong>Bandwidth</strong><br/>Bandwidth refers to the amount of traffic a web host allows for a certain service plan. As each visit and page load requires a certain amount of data transfer, this traffic adds up over the month. With some services, when your website reaches its monthly limit the website is suspended until you pay to upgrade your service plan. Purchasing a blog hosting plan with ample bandwidth ensures that your website doesn’t get suspended.","<strong>Storage Space</strong><br/>The amount of storage space offered by your blog hosting provider is important to consider as it determines the number of files and the amount of data you can store on your website. While most blog hosts offer ample space for simple blogs and websites, if you plan to include large files in your posts, you will want a plan with a large amount of available storage space so you don&#39;t run out of room.","<strong>Email Addresses<br/></strong>If you’re running a business or have website partners, you may want to provide customized email addresses for them. Some blog hosting sites offer a number of email addresses as part of the service package. Pay attention to the number of email addresses the company provides to ensure you get the number you need for your business.","<strong>Domain Name</strong><br/>In order to have a blog or website online you need a domain name. These are internet addresses that often end in .com, although there are other extensions to choose from. While you can purchase your own domain name through any domain registrar, as long as it’s available for purchase, some blog web hosts provide a free domain name with the purchase of a hosting plan. This makes it easier to get started with your blog, as the host does some of the work for you.","There are a large number of WordPress web host services that can provide you with a suitable home for your blog or website. Choosing the right one allows you to have peace of mind, knowing that your website is secure and stable."]},"id":"2944d332-981f-43f5-9a69-588301134420","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1707","url":"/best-wordpress-hosting","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-20T16:33:02Z","datePublished":"2017-04-15T00:05:50Z","name":"WordPress Hosting Review","synopsis":"WordPress hosting provides a home for your WordPress blog or website on the internet.
