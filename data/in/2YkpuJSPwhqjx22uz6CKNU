The original review is below, but check out our current top </em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/kitchen/best-french-door-refrigerators/\"><em>French Door Refrigerators</em></a><em> here.</em>","Electrolux, headquartered in Sweden, is the second largest manufacturer of home appliances in the world. This company makes solid French door refrigerators with advanced features you will not find with other brands. However, many of the company&#39;s fridges are missing features that comparable French door fridges include. The Electrolux EW28BS85KS, which comes with Wave-Touch Controls, is the company&#39;s flagship model and is a large refrigerator with a total capacity of 27.8 cubic feet. The capacity in both the refrigerated and freezer compartments, at 19 and 8.8 cubic feet respectively, is comparable to other fridges of this size.","It is quite energy efficient with an estimated Energy Guide cost of only $60 per year to run and $5 monthly, which is low for a French door refrigerator with this amount of interior space to cool. It also is Energy Star qualified. This inexpensive-to-operate feature alone makes this the best refrigerator for anyone looking to keep electricity costs low.","The refrigerated compartment has LED lighting that slowly increases in brightness when you open the doors. This feature prevents you from being blinded when you go for a late-night snack and gives your eyes time to adjust. This refrigerator features a touch-activated control panel. Once you are finished using it, the light slowly fades for an uncluttered appearance.","Another unique feature found in this Electrolux fridge is the spill-proof glass shelves, which are found in the best refrigerators. In this model, the shelves are beveled and slightly bowed so any spilled liquids run to the center where they can easily be wiped away rather than running down the sides of the fridge, which makes cleaning a chore. You can also adjust the height of the shelves, which is helpful for accommodating tall containers or bottles.","Also in the fresh food compartment, you have two product crispers in which you can adjust the humidity. The full-width drawer has nine preset temperature options and three customizable settings so you can dial the perfect temperature for anything you frequently store in that drawer. This is ideal for deli meats, party platters or other food you want to keep fresh and inviting.","With all these advanced features, you would think that door storage would be better planned. There is an icemaker in the fresh food compartment, as well as the freezer, so the ice chute takes up quite a bit of space on the left-side door. Having two icemakers comes in handy if you entertain a great deal or simply use a lot of ice. However, the top icemaker in the refrigerated compartment consumes quite a bit of space that could otherwise be used to store more groceries.","In total, you have seven door bins, one of which is meant for dairy products such as butter and cheese, but it is not covered, unlike those in the top-rated French door refrigerators. This fridge has two bins capable of holding gallon-sized containers. The bins on the left side door are rather narrow and the one next to the ice chute has only half the capacity of a normal sized bin."]},"id":"fc9b720f-f3c5-42b1-b466-bee5f775980c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce55c986-2731-4cbb-b9c7-a97ebd64e884","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Some aspects of this French door fridge are sterling, but Electrolux missed the mark on a few things.
