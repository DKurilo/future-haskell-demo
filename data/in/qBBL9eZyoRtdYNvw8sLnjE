If you’re looking for a DVD player for the dashboard of your car with at-your-fingertips controls, the Phase Linear UV8 is a solid choice.","With auxiliary input, the system is iPod and XM ready, and comes with a full function remote as well as a limited function remote for your kids in the back seat. Jensen’s Phase Linear UV8 provides clear picture on its 7-inch screen with full screen or normal aspect ratio. The internal amplifier has up to 160 watts of output. This great in-dash system is compatible with DVD, DVD-RW, DVD-R, as well as CD, CD-R, CD-RW, CD-DA, MP3, WMA, SVCD, VCD, MPEG1, MPEG2, Xvid, DivX, and JPEG, facilitating all sorts of video and audio options. The screen can also integrate with your back up camera, or connect another screen through an NTSC composite video output.","Users of the Phase Linear UV8 have been pleased with the system, allowing them to make their car an on-the-go media center. Consumers found that the display screen easily retracts into the dashboard base, and like that they can use the convenient AUX input to connect their iPhone and even use the head unit as a speakerphone. The limited 40 watts per channel is a concern of users who have reviewed the Phase Linear UV8.","If you’re looking for an integrated dashboard solution for your car, the Phase Linear UV8 is a good choice with its fully motorized flip-out-and-up 7-inch LCD touchscreen. The in-dash system supports a variety of formats and is a great way to turn your vehicle’s dashboard into a complete media system."]},"id":"b7f1c0b2-32de-4ce8-8b6f-f0db5276f6df","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_24535","url":"/jensen-uv8-21897-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","name":"Phase Linear UV8 UV8","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":22,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-08-11T17:27:18Z","id":"qBBL9eZyoRtdYNvw8sLnjE","meta":{"title":"Phase Linear UV8 UV8 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
