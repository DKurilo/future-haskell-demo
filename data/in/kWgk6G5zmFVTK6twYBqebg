We know that divorces can be ugly, mean and downright cruel. These are usually contested divorces, where one or both of the parties involved can not decided on the terms and agreements of their mutual assets. The movie War of the Roses is a good example of a contested divorce.","<strong>Online divorces</strong> are not designed for these types of complicated situations. If your divorce is headed in that direction, it s probably best to get a lawyer. Online divorces cater to uncontested cases. An uncontested divorce is where both parties are in agreement and have chosen to split amicably.","Just the idea of getting a divorce online begs a basket full of questions. Don t you need a divorce lawyer? What about the kids and the house? Is it legal?","Fact is an attorney is not required. An uncontested divorce may be prepared and filed directly to the courthouse without ever speaking to an attorney. Since it is a dissolution of marriage, or in other words all parties are in agreement on all matters, there is no reason to bring in a third party. One of the benefits to enlisting an <a href=\"/money/small-business\">online legal service</a> is the cost.","These types of services are an excellent choice for those with low incomes who cannot afford an attorney. A typical online divorce preparation service filing an uncontested divorce with no children is about $300 while an attorney might charge about $2,200 for the same forms and services.","Most online divorce services, such as <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/us-legal/\">US Legal</a>, will use an interview style questionnaire asking the filer about the details of their divorce situation. Those filing an uncontested divorce can still request child support, custody and alimony. When the questionnaire is completed and paid for, the answers are sent to the divorce service to prepare the paperwork in its state specific forms.","Forms and paperwork is one of the most important legal processes. The completion service will prepare the paperwork according to state and federal guidelines. One of the most common mistakes in pro se (representing yourself in court without an attorney) divorces is that the forms are incorrect. These services ensure the correct forms are prepared and 100 percent legal. Many services include a satisfaction guarantee. At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. ","The preparation service will then mail or email the prepared forms usually within about two days, ready to be signed, notarized and filed. A notary is one of the most important parts of the signing process. A notary public is a person that has been authorized by the state to certify documents. The signature and seal/stamp of a notary public is required when filing an uncontested divorce.","After the paperwork has been filed, it is unlikely a person will have to appear in court although there are exceptions to all legal rules. A judge may need to speak to one or both parties involved depending on the circumstances of the divorce.","Remember these services do not constitute legal counsel and are not acting as attorneys. They are designed to help people represent themselves in their own legal matters. The internet has become a powerful and useful tool. It seems just about anything can be accomplished via the information super highway. It s our fast track to news, shopping, love and divorce."," "," "]},"id":"2b82a7cb-d8e8-42eb-ae2f-c0606cbe898f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_463","url":"/online-divorce-is-it-legal","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"erin-monaghan","url":"/author/erin-monaghan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Erin Monaghan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"pJhSzFvAjtB92wXxfULoVW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2010-08-25T21:07:54Z","name":"Online Divorce - Is It Legal?","synopsis":"Marriage is a sacred union between two people who can get married at a drive thru in Las Vegas and divorced over the internet.","review":{},"strapline":"Marriage is a sacred union between two people who can get married at a drive thru in Las Vegas and divorced over the internet.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-08-25T21:07:54Z","id":"kWgk6G5zmFVTK6twYBqebg","meta":{"title":"Online Divorce - Is It Legal?","description":"Marriage is a sacred union between two people who can get married at a drive&ndash;thru in Las Vegas and divorced over the Internet.
