You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Whether you’re looking to upgrade or replace your <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a>, the Maytag Jetclean Plus is a good choice. We were impressed by the seemingly endless features, but were disappointed by its lean 1-year warranty.","At full capacity, the Maytag Jetclean Plus can hold up to 14, 5-piece, place settings. The largest capacity dishwasher we’ve come across can hold 16, 5-piece, place settings, so the Maytag is pretty comparable. Of course, you probably won’t be filling the washer full of just standard cups and plates; pots and pans will find their way in as well. Six different wash cycles and five options come to the rescue, taking care of any kind of dish you need cleaned. These varied cycles don’t mean a higher operating cost, however, as the Maytag Jetclean Plus operates at an estimated yearly cost of only $31 and is Energy Star Qualified. It also has a heated dry option that, when combined with a rinse aid, will leave your dishes sparkly clean.","One of the reasons why this dishwasher is Energy Star Qualified is because of the optimum wash sensor, an efficient feature that determines when the dishes are clean. This technology cuts down on the amount of water used, adjusting according to the situation. The inside of the washer is also stainless steel which conducts and holds heat in for a quicker drying time and qualifies it for a NSF sanitation certification. A fantastic feature for you parents out there is the child lock which prevents those tiny fingers from interrupting a wash. You can also set the dishwasher on a delay start timer to have it wash while you’re asleep or away from home.","The Maytag Jetclean Plus has a very sleek design with a stainless steel finish and no visible controls. It also measures the correct dimensions for a standard under-the-sink dishwasher. If you don’t care for stainless, Maytag also carries different versions of this model in black and white.","Although this dishwasher’s ratings were fairly high across the board, it took a major hit when we took a good, hard look at their warranty. One year from the purchase date, Maytag will replace only factory specified parts and will repair defects in materials or workmanship. However, after that time, you’re on your own unless you purchase a Maytag Extended Service Plan. We feel like Maytag’s warranty is intentionally thin to promote these service plans. Almost every other product we reviewed included a more consumer-friendly warranty, some covering you for up to five years to the lifetime of the product."]},"id":"ac57e916-3d19-4e3a-a825-6782f0f8246f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cac3d33c-7e95-4683-933f-d2a0b50d6913","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag Jetclean Plus would be in our top-ranked products if it wasn’t for its flimsy warranty.
