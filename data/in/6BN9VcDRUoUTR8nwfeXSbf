These surround sound speakers are especially good if you’re seeking nothing more or less than head-throbbing volume. This is because the speaker cones are made from paper, so they don’t reflect sound as well as the best <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speakers</a> that are made of more sturdy materials.","The frequency range spans between 35Hz and 20kHz. It still misses the lowest lows of the audible spectrum, but most movies don&#39;t push the limits that far, so it should perform well. If you are watching a movie that is high in bass or treble, you might not feel like the sound is as full as it could be.","The subwoofer that comes with the Z906 is a bass reflex, which means it has an internal amplifier for a more full sound. You won’t need to purchase more equipment to pick up some great bass tones. These home theater speakers are designed to support game consoles, so you can play Call of Duty with surround sound special effects. You can also plug in your iPad and use this system to listen to your favorite music.","The speakers of this surround sound speaker system are wall mountable, so you can place them where they will project sound that best for your room. The speakers are not magnetically shielded, so don’t place them too close to your television. Doing so may interfere with your TV signal and distort the color of the picture.","The warranty is the biggest drawback of all – it only covers the hardware for two years. With a warranty of only two years, the product may not enjoy the same lifespan that you will get from speakers with a five-year warranty. For that reason, this home theater speaker system makes a better starter set than a long-term element of your home theater.","Logitech does offer several service options to its customers. The FAQs and user guides on its website are easy to navigate, and you can find valuable information. Email support and telephone service is available 24/7. You can also get technical support through the Logitech Facebook page."]},"id":"75212dc6-d8c8-4d6c-b9ef-d59015752ba8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"93184d15-99c9-4638-82c7-e3f912ed356b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you value volume, the Logitech Z906 speaker system was made for you – just don&#39;t expect it to hammer your eardrums with intensity and elegance at the same time.
