The “removable load” is a series of hollow red cylinders, presumably modeled after a storage tank. They’re a fun detail young train enthusiasts might appreciate. The set feels high quality in your hand as it’s made predominantly of metal. Its weight paired with its detailed paint job make this train feel like it should be expensive, but we were able to find it online at a reasonable price.","You get 14 pieces of nickel silver railroad track that all slide together with E-Z Track design. S-shaped pieces of plastic on the back of the track simply slide together and lock, so a first-timer is less likely to get frustrated. The largest oval you can build is 45 x 36 inches, which was mid-range in comparison to the other trains we tested. If you want a super small track, check out the <a href=\"/bachmann-freightmaster-review\">Bachmann Freightmaster</a>. This train does run off electricity, so make sure the wheels are aligned or it might shoot off sparks. It’s recommended for users who are at least 14 years old, and we’d have to agree. This isn’t a train for a toddler.","The train runs off a power pack and you’ll need a flathead screwdriver to connect the wires. As one reviewer noted, “The throttle control is sensitive” and lets you move the train at a multitude of speeds. You really do feel like you’re driving. There is also an overload light that will illuminate if the train is about to careen off the tracks, though that never happened in our testing. Each train car has two sets of wheels – one in the back and one in the front – but they’re easy to get on the track if you slide the train back and forth over the piece of train track that’s connected to the power cord. It has a black top piece on it that makes it look a real train track crossing. Some of our reviewers did have a hard time getting this train to run though, but most said they really loved how the train looked so it earned an A- for design and detail.","The problem that knocked this train lower in our rankings was its durability, or lack thereof. This is the only train that totally failed to function in our tests. We dropped each train engine from a height of about 3 feet, and after the second drop, pieces of the Iron Horse’s engine railing were very bent, though it continued to run. After the third drop, the train didn’t seem to have any more physical damage but simply wouldn’t run around the track. It wouldn’t move an inch. It earned an F in this test, but that doesn’t mean the problem wasn’t fixable. We just didn’t know how. If you enjoy taking things apart and putting them back together, this could be a really fun opportunity for you.","At its quickest, this train traveled 1.69 feet per second. This was the third-fastest rate we tested, but if you want something that can really travel, check out the <a href=\"/lionel-pennsylvania-flyer-freight-train-review\">Lionel Pennsylvania Flyer</a>. While this train set isn’t the most durable, the Iron Horse has a lot of fun components those new to the hobby might enjoy. The removable load and easy-to-assemble track make using this train a lot of fun."]},"id":"e032bbc8-d4ae-44bb-b4df-c21626f961dd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70291","url":"/athearn-iron-horse-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-16T21:10:20Z","datePublished":"2018-10-16T21:10:20Z","name":"Athearn Iron Horse","synopsis":"This train comes with five cars total: a GP locomotive with working headlamp, tank car, box car with working door, wide vision caboose and gondola with removable load.","review":{"rating":67,"verdict":"The Athearn Iron Horse&#8217;s moving pieces and easy-to-use size make it the perfect first train for someone new to the hobby.","pros":["No batteries are required."],"cons":["It isn&#8217;t durable."]},"strapline":"This train comes with five cars total: a GP locomotive with working headlamp, tank car, box car with working door, wide vision caboose and gondola with removable load.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-10-16T21:10:20Z","id":"wVFibqm6tbGixp4bzNzZCa","meta":{"title":"Athearn Iron Horse Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Athearn Iron Horse&#8217;s moving pieces and easy-to-use size make it the perfect first train for someone new to the hobby."},"products":[{"slug":"athearn-iron-horse","url":"/product/athearn-iron-horse","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","name":"Athearn Iron Horse","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","id":"M2NhhwRRF7MHWpWvb8SW3F","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/gtWnxS2gnnMCGFuM8g2ATC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","mimeType":"","name":"d898023607f96ffd4d16c42a1d947f97.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/d898023607f96ffd4d16c42a1d947f97.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","id":"gtWnxS2gnnMCGFuM8g2ATC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gtWnxS2gnnMCGFuM8g2ATC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Athearn Iron Horse Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Athearn Iron Horse&#8217;s moving pieces and easy-to-use size make it the perfect first train for someone new to the hobby."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/gtWnxS2gnnMCGFuM8g2ATC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","mimeType":"","name":"d898023607f96ffd4d16c42a1d947f97.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/d898023607f96ffd4d16c42a1d947f97.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","id":"gtWnxS2gnnMCGFuM8g2ATC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gtWnxS2gnnMCGFuM8g2ATC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Athearn Iron Horse Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Athearn Iron Horse&#8217;s moving pieces and easy-to-use size make it the perfect first train for someone new to the hobby."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/science/best-train-sets/athearn-iron-horse-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"toys","url":"/hobbies/toys","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","name":"Toys","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:18:26Z","id":"nmskLXysMcqxbkZ6iB2YBG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
