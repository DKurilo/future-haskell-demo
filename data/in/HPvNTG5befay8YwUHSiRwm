You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The goal of the Boska Holland Blue <a href=\"/best-fondue-pots\">Fondue Set</a> is to make the fondue experience fun and easy. The Blue Fondue Set lets you and your family truly enjoy cheese.","Mimicking the construction of traditional fondue sets, this fondue pot includes a painted 1-liter ceramic pan, concrete frame, four stainless steel fondue forks and metal burner. While the set is large enough for you to enjoy fondue with friends or the whole family, it only comes with four forks instead of the standard six, so you will need to purchase extra if you want to enjoy the set at parties.","One perk of this fondue set is that it is dishwasher safe. Dishwasher-safe pots are a smart purchase because you don&#39;t have to spend time cleaning them by hand. This set is also available in three different colors: light gray, white or light blue. This gives you the option to pick a set that best matches your kitchen and other small appliances you own. The set isn&#39;t electric, though, which is a drawback when it comes to time and money, because you will have to run out and buy fuel for this pot whenever you want to use it, rather than simply plugging it in and letting it heat up.","The construction of the pot, while unique, limits the types of fondue you can make with it. This pot is ideal for melting cheese and chocolate, but it cannot withstand the heat you need to cook meats or broth and hot oils.","This pot also lacks a splatter ring and drip tray, which means you can easily spill the fondue or drip it on tables by accident. The forks are also not color-coded, which may cause confusion between guests when it comes to keeping track of which fork belongs to who.","Available in light gray and white as well as the light blue implied in its name, the Boska Holland Blue Fondue Set is dishwasher safe, making cleanup easy. It comes with only four forks, all in the same color, and it is not electric, which means you&#39;ll have to plan ahead with fuel and extra forks when you want to use it to make fondue for a party."]},"id":"921505ac-1c0a-4d37-a99d-e3ddb57d53c6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61612","url":"/boska-holland-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-16T17:17:28Z","datePublished":"2014-12-16T17:17:28Z","name":"Boska Holland Blue Fondue Set","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-16T17:17:28Z","id":"HPvNTG5befay8YwUHSiRwm","meta":{"title":"Boska Holland Blue Fondue Set Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Boska Holland Blue Fondue Set is a traditional ceramic pot that, despite the name, comes in three different colors.
