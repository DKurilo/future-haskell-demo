Fortunately, the new Kindle has some big improvements without a higher price. Its controls and features are similar to the Voyage and Paperwhite, so if you&#39;re curious about eBooks, the new Kindle is a low-cost entry-level option.","Compared to Amazon’s Fire tablets, the Kindle does not have much content. It is great for eBooks, magazines, newspapers and even comics, but its low-resolution screen doesn&#39;t do justice to images. Still, the Kindle benefits from Amazon&#39;s excellent content offerings. The company&#39;s store features books from popular authors that you can purchase or rent. Its strong software options include parental controls and a cleanly designed reading user interface.","Although the new Kindle has an upgraded touchscreen display, its resolution hasn&#39;t improved. The device’s display is optimized for text and reading, and because of this, its fidelity is limited; it still has a 6-inch screen with only 800 x 600 resolution. Also, the battery has not improved with its new design, though with a 14-hour charge, it is still far better than the Fire tablets. In addition, integrated Wi-Fi support makes it easy to purchase and download new books directly from the Kindle.","While its flaws are evident, they also keep the price low. For those who&#39;ve never used an eReader, the low-priced Kindle is a great point of entry. The charm of eReaders is their focus on reading, and using this model you don&#39;t have to worry about distracting apps or games. If you like the simplicity of the dedicated eBook reader platform, you can upgrade to something with more features, like a Voyage or Paperwhite, with your next purchase."]},"id":"a59d6c2a-3987-4577-83a6-06bc4ca8f04a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"46b67801-c15f-46e5-8744-928a3c286def","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["New improvements make the Kindle look and act like the better Voyage and Paperwhite eReaders.
