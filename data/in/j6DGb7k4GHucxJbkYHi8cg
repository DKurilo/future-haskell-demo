At startup, it goes right to the children&#39;s screen, and parents can switch to a regular Fire interface by punching in a password. It takes a little while to get used to switching between the systems, and adjusting the parental controls takes some time to understand. While options like purchase locking and custom app libraries are useful, the lack of thorough web browsing controls is a drawback. Child Mode simply disables browser access, which hampers the Fire&#39;s usefulness in comparison to other tablets."]},"id":"46e35677-cde2-40ce-8c87-4385de831714","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"39f5bb8e-dd9c-437c-ba99-20f982fd0917","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Fire HD Kids Edition is a good kids tablet with some excellent capabilities and features, but as a Fire tablet, it isn&#39;t great.
