The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/services/entertainment/best-sports-tickets/\">Sports Ticket Websites</a> here.</em>","TickCo is a basic ticket site that offers ways to buy theatre, concert and sports tickets. TickCo lacks many of the features found on better sports ticket sites, especially the ability to list your own tickets for resale. TickCo does offer a wide array of sports events for purchase including college football, golf, Indy racing, MLB, MLS, NASCAR, NBA, NHL, UFC and WWE.","The fees charged by TickCo are higher than other comparable sites that we reviewed. The service fee charged on every ticket purchase of 25% is among the highest amount we found. TickCo adds fees to shipping, eTickets and will call, which are comparable to other sites we reviewed.","One of the best features of TickCo is the interactive seating chart and specialized ticket searches you are able to perform. The website is laid out nicely for easy browsing. The search bar at the top of the screen allows you to search the site by location, sport and team. This specialized ticket-search ability saves you time as you find the games you want to attend. The interactive seating chart shows where you will be sitting in the stadium, down to the ticket section. This is especially nice if you are traveling with your team and bought cheap game tickets, as it will show you where you&#39;re sitting inside an unfamiliar stadium.","While TickCo give you the option of traditional shipping, will call pick up and eTickets, which allows you to print out your ticket at home and take it to the game, there is no paperless ticket option. A paperless ticket option allows you to present a barcode on your smart phone at the door to the stadium and use it at your ticket for the game. This is great when you buy sports tickets on the secondary market and don&#39;t want to arrange a pickup location. It is also a service provided by elite sports ticket websites.","Other sports ticket websites provide extras, usually at no additional charge, for purchasing sports tickets through their website. These features an include access to premium pay parking lots, ability to purchase gift cards, a rewards program for frequent purchasing and price alerts for good deals on cheap sports tickets. TickCo doesn&#39;t offer any of these, as it only offers price alerts as an extra to their customers.","TickCo does have excellent help and support options. TickCo has a great FAQs section on their website that is among the most helpful of the sports ticket sites we reviewed. TickCo also has toll-free phone support, form email support that is quickly answered and live chat capability on their website."]},"id":"215d2ab7-ce97-4eea-8991-62c67a6308a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"90130c8a-30a9-4100-8123-2e2d76e2239a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TickCo is a site that is competitive with a majority of its fees comparable to other sport ticket sites, but the lack of extras and the ability to resell tickets limit the overall usefulness of the website."]},"id":"45d517b3-a888-420f-8dbb-a4d624b974f8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2617","url":"/tickco-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","datePublished":"2008-09-18T23:39:26Z","name":"TickCo","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"verdict":"TickCo is a basic secondary market sports ticket site that only allows you to buy, not sell, tickets.","pros":["TickCo has a full array of customer support options for helpful service."],"cons":["TickCo doesn&#039;t offer extras like premium parking, gift cards or a reward program."]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-09-23T23:20:49Z","id":"kNhcGphpg3mgEiYAdtv8JD","meta":{"title":"TickCo Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"TickCo is a secondary ticket broker site where you can buy sports tickets for major sporting events.
