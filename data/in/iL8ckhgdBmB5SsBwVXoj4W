This 81-pound acrylic machine is designed to efficiently print 3D models and designs. Wide operating system compatibility is a plus, and the manufacturer, 3D Stuffmaker, also offers online chat.","With the Evolution you can print 3D design up to 8 x 8 x 8 inches. Resolution isn&#39;t the best with the Evolution, but if you want to make prototypes or other decent-quality prints, this printer will get them done.","PLA is the only 3D printing material compatible with the Evolution. A free filament cartridge doesn&#39;t come with the Evolution; you can buy one from 3D Stuffmaker or use a generic cartridge, though, as long as it&#39;s 3 mm PLA.","3D printer kits like the DIY Evolution version are perfect for the creative designer. The pre-assembled version of the Evolution, however, is better suited for beginners. Whichever you prefer, you&#39;ll get a good 3D printer. This desktop 3D printer comes with one print head, but you can purchase up to four print heads, which are easily changeable with the original. Design features are minimal, though: You won&#39;t find a LCD screen or heated platform with the Evolution.","3D printing with your home computer is easy because the Evolution connects to Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. The ability to connect to the printer via SD card, flash drive and Wi-Fi is not available, however, you are able to connect through USB.","3DStuffmaker does have a blog, though it does not offer any kind of help and support tips or tricks for the 3D printers. The articles on the blog relate to 3D printing in general but offer no specific help for any products. The company is based in Australia, so if you are willing to make the long-distance phone call, there is a telephone number. But with email, Skype and live chat support, thereâ€™s really no reason to. There is no warranty for this desktop 3D printer, which is also unfortunate.","USB is the only way that you will be able to connect to the 3D printer. Because of this, we were expecting the printer to come with a USB cable. Regrettably, you&#39;ll have to purchase your own, as one is not provided. The Evolution also has a power requirement of 12 volts, but the actual power source isn&#39;t supplied either. The only other things you&#39;ll get with the Evolution are some maintenance tools and the creation software. So the list of accessories missing from the Evolution include USB cable, filament cartridge and power supply."]},"id":"dbbba4ba-fc14-4509-8ecb-9dfb3ee35054","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aad25fd3-69ba-4dce-8c1e-edee8a6283ee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Besides the sleek design, the support options are the best features the Evolution 3D printer has.
