This <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum</a> has variable suction for cleaning curtains and hard surfaces and automatic height adjustment to match the type of flooring you are cleaning. It even has a lifetime belt so you never have to replace it.","The sealed system features a rubber lining that protects each compartment of the machine so that air carrying fine dust cannot escape into your home. Its reusable HEPA filter means you do not have to buy replacement filters. You simply wash it after each use. Keep in mind that washable filters do not remove as many fine dust particles as paper filters do, and you are exposed to whatever gunk you just cleaned from your floors when you rinse it. If you have allergies or respiratory problems, this filtration system is not ideal. If you do not suffer from allergies, the convenience of not having to purchase filters is a bonus.","You can adjust the speed of the brush roll, or you can choose to shut it off completely, depending on the type of cleaning you need to do. The high speed lets you agitate embedded dirt out of durable carpets, and with the brush off, you can clean expensive or delicate rugs that you do not want to damage. With the brush roll turned off, you can also tackle hard surfaces like the kitchen linoleum. You never have to sweep again because this vacuum cleaner will pick up kitchen messes, and a scatter guard keeps debris from being strewn across the floor. The best part about the brush roll is that you can remove it by pressing a button. You do not have to use tools to remove it for cleaning.","The swivel handle allows you turn corners by gently turning your wrist in the direction you want to go. It is easy to push across different types of flooring because of its swivel handle and ability to adjust to different heights. However, the handle does not recline flat to the floor so you cannot reach under low furniture. This upright vacuum cleaner has on-board tools, including a dusting brush, crevice tool and wand that allows you to reach ceiling cobwebs and high bookshelves. The tools attach to the machine itself, so they are easy to find and you do not have to bend to reach them.","This upright vacuum comes with a five-year warranty. The Electrolux website has a FAQs page, email link and toll-free number. There is also a service locator so you can find local repair services and parts. We found it easy to get a hold of live agents."]},"id":"d388cee7-8334-4ea2-9d2d-dc9a59c76d9c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"24415f08-e9e6-49b8-b7b2-a7b4ae110c57","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This upright vacuum has design features that make it easy to push and steer.
