Foremost is the doorbell's easy installation, you can install it anywhere if you run it off the battery, but it can also connect it to your existing doorbell chime to keep it powered all the time. Its excellent video quality shows enough detail day and night, even though it didn't perform as well as some competitors in our testing. The removable battery pack is easier to charge than the original Ring's battery, which required removing the entire unit from the wall. Aside from hardware differences between the Ring Video Doorbell 2 and its predecessor, both products work the same on the software side, though the Ring mobile app reacts more quickly to the Ring 2. While there's no free video storage option like the ones from August and SkyBell, Ring's cloud storage prices are the lowest in our comparison, starting at $3 a month per doorbell camera. However, if you choose Ring's most expensive plan, you get a lifetime warranty and can store footage from an unlimited number of cameras.

You can also connect it to other smart home products such as Amazon Alexa, SmartThings and Wink. While you can view your Ring's live video anytime without a subscription, you can expect to pay between $3 and $10 a month to record video. The $3 cloud storage plan is the most affordable compared to paid plans we looked at, but the $10 plan includes a lifetime warranty for your Ring products and records video from unlimited Ring doorbells and security cameras. As with most smart doorbells, the Ring only works with mechanical doorbell chimes, though you can buy the Ring Chime for an extra $29. This doorbell camera's video quality isn't as good as other products we tested, though certainly good enough for most people considering the price.

As with similar products, it records video when it detects motion, but it also saves 30 seconds of footage from before the sensor was triggered to give you more context into what happened, provided you pay for a cloud storage plan. To install the August Doorbell Cam Pro, you need a mechanical doorbell chime since it doesn't work with digital chimes. Unlike SkyBell and Ring, it doesn't have an adapter or add-on for digital chime functionality. As with most video doorbells, this one has a built-in battery, but it can't run off the battery for very long, less than a day in our experience.

The Ring Pro shines in a different way with some of the best motion detection options on the market.","In general, the other products were all very easy to use, though <a href=\"/remobell-review\">RemoBell</a> had fewer options for motion detection, smart home compatibility and was the only video doorbell we tested that must be rung to show live video. You can&#39;t look in on a live video stream because the unit goes into hibernation when nobody&#39;s around."]},"id":"40824609-b000-4bc0-9f7c-f7f8d6fd146b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/z2tseuQKrV78MWcDgSULbH.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/video-doorbells/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9TL1QvNzk0MTg5L29yaWdpbmFsL1NtYXJ0LUhvbWUtVmlkZW8tRG9vcmJlbGxzLVNreWJlbGwtSEQtVGVzdGluZy0wMDIuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2tseuQKrV78MWcDgSULbH.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"z2tseuQKrV78MWcDgSULbH","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2tseuQKrV78MWcDgSULbH.jpg","alt":""},"id":"44a1eaa3-ab29-4fe1-a674-25327e7a56b6","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>Video &amp; Audio Quality<br/>When someone calls at your door, the video doorbell is only as good as the video and audio in the call. For video, we used a video test chart to evaluate clarity in daytime and nighttime conditions, giving scores based on which portions of the chart were easy to read. Every unit we tested produced great results, though the Ring Doorbell Pro had the best video quality overall.","To a lesser extent, we also examined effective field of view and whether the video filled the screen. For example, the video doorbells from Ring each have a wide field of view, but the video has a fish-eye effect that doesn&#39;t fill the whole screen and distorts the image around the edge. While it&#39;s not a huge problem for most people, some users, including us, might prefer fullscreen video.","For audio quality, we gave pass/fail scores based on how clear and loud a call was on the mobile app as well as the built-in speaker on each unit. Although there were small differences in audio quality, we found each unit sufficient for brief conversations with someone at the door."]},"id":"7b716c64-e3c8-4b4a-958c-58514f525369","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/imhrYpwQxGAkNCuHGs6aqB.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/video-doorbells/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9TL1IvNzk0MTg3L29yaWdpbmFsL1NtYXJ0LUhvbWUtVmlkZW8tRG9vcmJlbGxzLVJpbmctUHJvLVRlc3RpbmctMDAyLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imhrYpwQxGAkNCuHGs6aqB.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"imhrYpwQxGAkNCuHGs6aqB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imhrYpwQxGAkNCuHGs6aqB.jpg","alt":""},"id":"efea7da8-0e49-4395-91d7-8cabc5b77549","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ease of Installation<br/>More than anything else, easy installation relies on what comes in the box with the smart doorbell. We gave higher scores to products that come with printed instructions, screwdrivers, masonry drill bits, levels, battery chargers and extra parts where applicable. Ring is the only company that met all of these requirements, setting a high standard for the competition.","We found that it takes between 10 and 20 minutes to install most video doorbells, though it can take longer if you&#39;re not experienced with electrical work. In most cases, you only need a screwdriver to install a video doorbell, though you may need to drill some holes beforehand. If you&#39;re installing it on a doorframe, make sure there&#39;s enough space since video doorbells aren’t as slim as normal doorbell buttons.","If the prospect of finding your doorbell transformer, turning off the power and manipulating electrical wiring to set up a smart doorbell is too much for you, some retailers offer installation services. Another option is to hire a licensed electrician to do the work.","<strong>How Much do Video Doorbells Cost?</strong>","You can expect to spend between $100 and $250 on a video doorbell, with most units costing around $200. Professional-grade video doorbells can cost up to $500, like the Ring Video Doorbell Elite. If you get a video doorbell as part of a security system, such as the <a href=\"https://www.vivint.com/products/doorbell-camera\">Vivint Doorbell Camera</a>, you&#39;ll need to sign up for professional security monitoring.","Cloud Video Storage<br/>You do not need a subscription to view live video, get notifications or speak with visitors. However, you need one if you want to record your video to the cloud, so you can review and download clips. You can expect to pay between $3 and $30 a month for cloud storage, depending on how long you want access to older videos. Two companies, August and <a href=\"/skybell-review\">SkyBell</a>, don&#39;t require paid subscriptions, but these are more limited than other plans.","<strong>What to Expect from Video Doorbells</strong>","Battery vs. Wired<br/>Most smart doorbells replace your home&#39;s existing doorbell, so you can expect them to have similar power requirements. This means your doorbell needs 12 to 36 volts of AC electricity to run properly. If your home doesn&#39;t meet these requirements, you or an electrician may need to install a new doorbell transformer.","While we found battery-powered units such as RemoBell quicker to install, doorbells like the Ring Video Doorbell 2 that also connect to your existing doorbell wiring are superior in almost every way. However, batteries mean units are much larger than a traditional doorbell button. In contrast, doorbells that only use a hardwired connection, like the Nest Hello and Ring Video Doorbell Pro, are slimmer and usually look nicer.","Chimes<br/>Although video doorbells replace the button on your doorbell, some still need the chime already installed in your home. There are two types of doorbell chimes on the market: mechanical and digital.","A Ring spokesperson said the main difference is that &#34;Mechanical doorbells make your generic &#34;ding-dong&#34; sound, whereas a digital doorbell has a speaker, and can make various sounds, including playing MP3’s and pre-recorded sounds. Having one chime or the other does not affect doorbell performance, so it’s ultimately user preference.&#34;","According to our research, most smart doorbells work best with mechanical chimes, though many companies sell an adapter or a have list of compatible digital chimes. Likewise, some companies, such as Ring, sell a wireless chime add-on that pairs with your doorbell camera."]},"id":"d9a02330-0a51-42ad-a653-4e3d339d6a7d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/VG2dcTPeYoMmRZDkNNnosS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/video-doorbells/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9TL1MvNzk0MTg4L29yaWdpbmFsL1NtYXJ0LUhvbWUtVmlkZW8tRG9vcmJlbGxzLVNreWJlbGwtSEQtVGVzdGluZy0wMDMuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VG2dcTPeYoMmRZDkNNnosS.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"VG2dcTPeYoMmRZDkNNnosS","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VG2dcTPeYoMmRZDkNNnosS.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7ec2271c-d4d3-441a-82f3-05ef055d02e1","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>Standard Features<br/>Each doorbell camera has a Wi-Fi connection and a mobile app that let you see the video feed and speak with visitors on your doorstep. Video doorbells also use motion detection to track events, which means they don’t record continuously like a security camera, with the notable exception of the Nest Hello. Most doorbell cameras record subjects in both daytime and nighttime conditions, usually at an HD video resolution of 720p or greater.","Smart Lock Pairing<br/>One of the most exciting features of video doorbells is that you can pair most of them with a smart lock such as the <a href=\"/kwikset-kevo-review\">Kwikset Kevo</a> and <a href=\"/august-review\">August Smart Lock</a> to let guests in when you&#39;re unable to come to the door. However, the level of integration between a doorbell and lock really depends on the company. This is something we discovered when we linked the doorbells to smart locks we were also testing.","The biggest difference comes from doorbells and locks designed to work together. <a href=\"/august-smart-lock-pro-review\">August</a> and <a href=\"/nest-x-yale-review\">Nest</a> make both smart locks and video doorbells, which let you unlock the door without leaving the app, though August is the only smart doorbell that lets you unlock the door from within the call. However, Ring and SkyBell don&#39;t make smart locks, but give you a shortcut to partner apps instead.","Other Smart Home Devices<br/>Aside from smart locks, you can connect the video doorbell to voice assistants and <a href=\"/best-smart-speakers\">smart speakers</a>, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, to get notifications and sometimes speak with people at the door. As part of a security system, the unit can help protect your home by detecting motion outside."]},"id":"46721903-12bc-4daa-a391-7ab22d93fc62","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"930dd321-7095-4649-aed8-1d24a8c14f55","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/ring-video-doorbell-2-review\">Ring Video Doorbell 2</a>","<a href=\"/august-doorbell-cam-pro-review\">August Doorbell Cam Pro</a>","<a href=\"/nest-hello-review\">Nest Hello</a>","<a href=\"/ring-video-doorbell-pro-review\">Ring Video Doorbell Pro</a>","<a href=\"/skybell-review\">SkyBell HD</a>","<a href=\"/remobell-review\">RemoBell RMBU-1512</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7b9a7465-2064-44a2-8ef6-1556e98c9677","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_240","url":"/best-video-doorbells","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-25T18:36:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-25T18:36:00Z","name":"Best Video Doorbells of 2019","synopsis":"We spent 150 hours testing video doorbells to find the one that has the best video quality, usability, installation process and unique features.
