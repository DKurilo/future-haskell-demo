M277dw"},"id":"a1643712-afde-41dd-992b-1a48157c82c4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"text":"Introduction"},"id":"fd1a88ac-6dd3-483a-849e-e32367bef4f4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<em>Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP LaserJet Pro M277dw is an all-in-one printer with an extensive feature set. Its print quality doesn’t match that of the best machines we reviewed, like the <a href=\"/computers/printers/best-wireless-laser-printers/samsung-review/\">Samsung ProXpress</a>, and its printing costs are high. Still, as a personal <a href=\"/computers/printers/best-wireless-laser-printers/\">wireless laser printer</a>, it is a capable and worthwhile machine.","The HP LaserJet Pro M277dw is a multifunction color printer, so it can copy, scan and fax as well as print. It is a bit larger than the print-only machines we reviewed, measuring 16.5-inches wide and 12.7-inches tall, though it is lightweight compared to other multifunction printers at 35.9 pounds. Additionally, it has a 3-inch color touchscreen, which isn’t large but makes navigating the features and settings easy.","The machine’s printing performance is adequate but nothing too fuss over. We found 31 errors in our 10-page, black-and-white text document. Additionally, one page became two because the machine improperly scaled the font. You can fix this in the settings menu, but none of the other printers we tested had this problem.","During our scanning tests, the quality was impressive – the scanned image showcased many small details well. However, the copy quality was much lower. There were blurry areas on the documents, and the fine details were poorly captured.","In addition, this was the slowest printer we reviewed. It printed 11 pages per minute in black and white and 13 pages per minute in color.","The primary and secondary paper trays each hold up to 150 pages of standard printer paper, which is low compared to the best laser printers we reviewed. Still, for home use, this may not be an issue.","One of this HP’s drawbacks is its operating cost. It costs approximately $0.22 per page to print with standard-size cartridges. When you use high-capacity toner, the cost drops to $0.17 per page. The operating cost is high when you use a standard cartridge, but the high-capacity toner drastically lowers the price.","The HP LaserJet Pro M277dw has an excellent feature set. You can use the Apple AirPrint and Mopria mobile printing apps with this machine. However, it is not compatible with the Google Cloud Print app. You can also scan to and print from a USB storage device as well as scan to online storage. The printer also uses near-field communication (NFC), so you can connect NFC-enabled devices by tapping them on the machine.","HP’s customer support is excellent. This wireless laser printer is covered under a one-year manufacturer warranty. You can reach customer service representatives via email, telephone or live chat. In addition, you can access a user manual and troubleshooting guide on the company’s website, which can answer many of your questions or concerns."]},"id":"69634881-57b4-48cc-8147-c57fb779ad0a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"31a71785-6f85-40df-aec1-3ec1b403a1f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP LaserJet Pro M277dw is an adequate wireless laser printer, but it has middling print quality and high operating costs.
