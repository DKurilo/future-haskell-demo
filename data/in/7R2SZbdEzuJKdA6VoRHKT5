The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-rewards-credit-cards\">Rewards Credit Cards</a> here.</em>","The Citi ThankYou® Preferred Card is a credit card that is packed with reward options that give you points on everyday purchases. With this rewards credit card, you rack up points with every purchase you make, and some purchases will earn you double points. Every dollar spent will earn you one point on everyday purchases, and you can earn two points for every dollar spent when you use your card at restaurants and for entertainment.","The credit card rewards you can earn with this Citi card can be redeemed for gift cards, merchandise, cash or even donations to charities. There’s no cap on the amount of points you can earn, and they won’t ever expire with the Citi ThankYou® Preferred Card. Additionally, just for being a Citi ThankYou® cardholder, you will receive exclusive event information.","This rewards credit card also offers a nice sign-up bonus. If you spend $1,500 in purchases the first three months of having the card, you will receive 20,000 bonus points from Citi, an equivalent of $200 in gift cards.","You will receive a 0% annual percentage rate on both purchases and balance transfers you make for the first 12 months you have this card. Following the introductory period of 12 months, your purchases and balance transfers will be held to a 12.99%-22.99%* (Variable) APR. Additionally, you can expect a 25.24% APR for cash advances and a 29.99% penalty APR.","You shouldn’t be surprised by any of the fees that are associated with this Citi credit card as they are pretty close to the industry standard. This card does have a bit of a shorter grace period, though. However, if you pay your bill within the allotted 23 days, you won’t see a late fee of up to $35 on your account.","If you plan to do any cash advances, balance transfers or international traveling with this card, those transactions will have a fee attached. Each cash advance will be charged a 5% fee, but no lower than $10. If you transfer a balance, a 3% fee no lower than $5 will be charged. For your trips abroad, any purchases will be charged a 3% fee.","This Citi credit card includes all the extra features that generally accompany a credit card. If you use your Citi card to purchase travel, you will get automatic travel accident insurance and trip cancellation or interruption coverage. This rewards card also includes auto rental insurance, extended warranty coverage, zero liability protection and much more.","Contacting Citi for customer service can only be done by telephone; there is no member support via email or live chat. However, you can reference a list of frequently asked questions on its website, which are very helpful and categorized really well, making it easy to find the answers you need without contacting them."]},"id":"56360e21-c74f-4bd4-af8f-468ba487fbb8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e1a151b8-02c1-480b-8014-d6a3f116aa0b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Citi ThankYou® Preferred Card can earn you all sorts of rewards, access to exciting events and even put some cash back into your pocket.
