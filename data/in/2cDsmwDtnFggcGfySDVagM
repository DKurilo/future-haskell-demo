We chose to review companies with the largest presence in the U.S., though most also operate internationally. Most of them have both airport and city locations, though some of the smaller services operate primarily at airports.","Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft are an attractive alternative to renting a car, but they don’t fit into the car rental category, so we didn’t include them. We asked Ed Perkins, an editor at SmarterTravel.com, about the advantages that renting a car offers over using a rideshare service. He told us that rideshares can help you avoid problems with finding parking if you’re making a lot of stops in a city, but a rental car can help you avoid costs associated with multiple trips. If you’re planning on driving through the suburbs or the country, renting is the best option.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We compared pricing for three types of cars in three different cities for a one-day and a weeklong rental. The cities we used were Los Angeles, New York City and Houston. We looked at economy, compact and full-size cars. Most of the rental companies offer a wider range of vehicles, including luxury sports cars, SUVs and 15-passenger vans, but we felt the cars we looked at represent most consumers.","Another important consideration is a rental company’s rewards program. If you travel frequently, this is a good way to recoup some of your expenses. Most of these services offer points for each dollar spent, which can then be redeemed for free rentals. We looked at how many points are typically needed to get a free rental. Another perk of joining the rewards program is an opportunity to get quicker service when checking out your car. Some rental companies have a line or kiosk specifically designated for its rewards members.","We looked at the broad availability of a rental service. If you like a company, and especially if you join a rewards program, you’ll want to be sure you can use it wherever you go. Many of the largest rental companies have international locations in addition to U.S. stores.","<strong>How Much Does it Cost to Rent a Car? </strong>","Car rental pricing fluctuates depending on a variety of factors, including time of the year, day of the week and how far in advance you book. Based on our research, we found that the cost for an economy car can range from $62 to $131 per day, and the cost of a full-size rental ranges from $74 to $153 per day. Taxes and airport fees can add another $15 to $30 to those daily rates. If you can, try to rent from a non-airport location to save some money.","<strong>Do’s and Don’ts of Renting a Car</strong>","Do: Shop around<br/>If you’re primarily looking for the lowest cost and aren’t a member of a specific company’s rewards program, using a service like Hotwire or Priceline can get you the cheapest price.","Don’t: Pay for insurance<br/>Your current car insurance policy likely covers you while you’re in a rental car, and the credit card you pay with may include secondary collision insurance. Collision damage waivers offered by the rental companies are often expensive and unnecessary.","Do: Sign up for rewards programs<br/>These programs are free and offer benefits beyond rewards points. They typically offer quicker service, free upgrades and free additional drivers as well.","Don’t: Rent from an airport<br/>If you can avoid it, try to rent from an off-airport location. Airports often add their own concession fees on top of whatever fees and taxes apply to the city you’re renting in. The concession fee varies from airport to airport but can approach 10 percent of what you pay for the rental.","Do: Take advantage of shuttle options<br/>Many rental companies now offer pick-up services. If you’ve made a reservation in advance at a non-airport location, you can arrange for the company to pick you up at your hotel or office or home. They will drive you to the rental office where you can sign the paperwork and be on your way. This is a great way to sidestep some of the logistical hassles involved in renting cars.","<strong>Is It Cheaper to Rent a Car or Use a Rideshare?</strong>","Whether you’re going on vacation or travelling for work, rideshare services may be a good alternative to a car rental. In fact, depending on the situation, a rideshare like Uber or Lyft can save you some money. A lot depends on where you travel and how you plan to get around while you’re there.","According to data from the <a href=\"https://nhts.ornl.gov/2009/pub/stt.pdf\">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>, the average rideshare trip costs around $22. That’s cheaper than the average one-day rental, which we found to be between $60 and $100. However, the rental price may be lower depending on where you travel and the make and model of the car you rent.","As you decide between renting and using rideshares, consider how often you’ll  need to use a vehicle at your destination. If you just need a car to get from the airport to your hotel, a rideshare may be the better option. Also, if you’re visiting a city with robust public transportation and many attractions within walking distance, for example New York City, renting a car can be a hassle – especially if you don’t want the stress of city traffic and trying to find parking. On the other hand, if you need to drive around your destination and take a lot of small trips here and there, a rideshare can end up costing more than a rental car.","When you travel somewhere remote or in the wilderness, like a national park, a rental is your only choice. Another reason to choose a rental over a rideshare is you have control over your own driving situation. Also, rideshare companies charge higher prices when there’s high demand, so during busier hours of the day, you’ll pay between one and half  to two times more than the base fee. ","<br/><strong>Related Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"eb1281ff-96e9-4231-a461-242223c0d33e","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-truck-rental-services\">The Best Truck Rentals</a>","<a href=\"/best-moving-containers\">The Best Moving Containers</a>","<a href=\"/best-roadside-assistance-services\">The Best Roadside Assistance Programs</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b8b856e0-c8a7-401b-a135-6b552b2d7e6e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_87","url":"/best-car-rental-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-22T20:27:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-22T20:27:00Z","name":"Best Car Rental Services of 2019","synopsis":"We ranked the top car rental companies using four main criteria: deals and services, types of rentals, ease of use and customer support.","review":{},"strapline":"We ranked the top car rental companies using four main criteria: deals and services, types of rentals, ease of use and customer support.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-25T16:27:14Z","id":"2cDsmwDtnFggcGfySDVagM","meta":{"title":"Best Car Rental Company 2019 -
