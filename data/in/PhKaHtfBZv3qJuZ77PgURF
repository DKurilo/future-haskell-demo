With storage of almost 1TB and 6GB of RAM, you won&#39;t have any problems running your applications and saving all of your important documents.

The first factor to consider is the RAM. This computer comes with 6GB of memory, which is what we&#39;ve come to expect with home computers. You can run multiple applications without slowing your machine down too much. There is also 1000GB of storage so you should have plenty of space to store all of your files.","The processor is an Intel Core i7-930. The processing speed is 2.8 GHz. This is a good speed for a home computer and will keep your applications running. The clock rate is 1.3 GHz, which is standard for most all-purpose desktop computers. When it comes to the video card, it isn&#39;t quite as good as we have seen on other machines. It is an NVIDIA GeForce G310 with only 512MB of memory. This means that if you are running an image-heavy application, such as a video game, the graphics won&#39;t be nearly as clean or crisp as a video card that has more memory allotment."]},"id":"6d3fc6e5-219a-4f9b-aa55-66e206664a32","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"ba52b7ff-5284-49c1-883c-4632d87ae785","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When researching a home computer sometimes it is the available features, not the performance, that convinces you to make the purchase. This computer comes with the Windows 7 Home Premium operating system. The top of the tower houses slots for memory cards so you don&#39;t have to invest in a peripheral device. It comes with a DVD player, which is useful, but we would like to see it include a Blu-ray player because of the big shift away from DVDs towards the higher-quality Blu-rays.

It will fit in a lot of places without taking up too much space. The problem is that the Dell Studio XPS 9100 is heavy. It weighs nearly 40 pounds, which makes it difficult to move if you need to.
