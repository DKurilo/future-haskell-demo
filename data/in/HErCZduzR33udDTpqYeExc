Instead, this online only bank offers a money market account that pays a relatively high interest rate for balances up to $35,000. For deposits above $35,000, the rate drops by more than half.","Unlike some of our top-ranked online only banks, AmericaNet Bank does not offer loans, CDs or IRAs. It does offer two types of checking accounts. The first is a free checking account that is not interest bearing. However, there are some advantages, including no monthly fee and no minimum balance requirement. It requires a $1 minimum deposit to open an account.","The second is Rewards Checking. It&#39;s among the best online banking accounts available because it offers a relatively high interest rate with no minimum balance or fees. The high rate is offered on deposits up to $10,000. Above that amount, the interest rate drops by about 75 percent. You must use your check card a minimum of 10 times a month with this account.","You receive a free Visa check card with your online checking account, and ATM withdrawals are free. Paper checks are available. The check overdraft fee is $25. When you bank online with AmericaNet, you can receive free email notifications if your account is overdrawn. In keeping with the practices of the best online banks, AmericaNet Bank sends your monthly statements via email.","You can make as many as 10 bill payments a month free through AmericaNet Bank&#39;s online bill pay feature. After that, each payment costs 50 cents. AmericaNet Bank does not offer mobile banking or banking by telephone. This online only bank is a member of the FDIC, which means that your deposits are guaranteed for as much as $250,000.","Customer support options available through this online only bank include FAQs, email and telephone support, available from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. CST. The toll-free telephone number quickly connected us with a helpful and friendly customer service representative. The representative was eager to assist and answered all our questions."]},"id":"24522867-2e32-45f9-96cd-fe0a3c8ed766","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e15c7b06-0793-4875-b01a-fbb8c605b421","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Online banking services offered through AmericaNet Bank include checking and money market accounts, but no savings account.
