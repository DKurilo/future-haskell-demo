As the name implies, perhaps its biggest selling point is that it has five main burners and a side burner. With 576 square inches of primary cooking space, this gas barbecue grill has plenty of room to grill up all of your favorite foods.","The temperature range on this grill is impressive. Preheating is quick and will allow you to effectively cook meals for big groups. It will slowly cook meat that is not placed directly over the flame and give you an evenly cooked piece of meat. Also, the stainless steel cooking grates should hold up for a long time.","For a big barbeque grill at this price point, the Kenmore has some nice extras. You have the option of black or red models. It has a hood light for night cooking, infrared burners and an optional rotisserie. While the cooking grates are stainless steel, the infrared burners are ceramic and not as solidly built. All the parts, except the main burners, come with a one-year warranty. This is on the low end when compared to the warranty of other grills on the market. The main burners have a much more generous warranty of 10 years.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"78f00b68-2fdb-4c35-bf0f-a0a9009349e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1505ef4-4a4b-4c7b-9882-d05ad72742c8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 5-Burner Gas Grill is an attractive grill that comes in black or red and will not feel out of place in most backyards.

Despite some flaws, like the ceramic side burners, which lack both the warranty and quality of the main burners, it performs well overall. It preheats quickly and cooks evenly, plus it has an optional rotisserie. Its stainless steel grates and heat tents help increase the longevity of the main burners.
