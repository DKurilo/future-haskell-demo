Moby Wrap&#39;s various slings, such as the Moby Wrap Classic, are award-winning baby products, so the brand&#39;s reliability and trustworthiness goes beyond the numerous men and women who use a Moby Wrap on a daily basis.","Folding the sling around you is easy, thanks to step-by-step instructions with photos and videos on the Moby Wrap website. It does not use the double-backed ring securing method that you might be familiar with. Instead, you cross it behind, in front and behind you again, tying a knot with the loose ends in the front, back or side. This design makes the sling adjustable to petite or plus-size, so it fits parents of all sizes. If you&#39;d prefer to not deal with tying or buckles, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">Baby K&#39;Tan BREEZE</a>.","The Moby Wrap is designed to grow with your baby, accommodating infants of about 8 pounds to toddlers of 35 pounds in a variety of carrying positions. The how-to videos and photos on the website demonstrate how to wrap the baby sling to use the newborn or older baby hug hold, hip hold and kangaroo wrap. Also available are special safety instructions, emphasizing the &#34;look, listen, feel&#34; method for checking on your baby. These wearing and safety instructions also come in PDF form with each wrap you purchase.","There are a variety of fabrics to choose from, including 100 percent natural cotton for the Classic and Designs collections and 100 percent organic cotton for the organic collection. Bamboo wraps are also available from this company, made from 70 percent viscose fibers from bamboo and 30 percent cotton. The slings also come in a variety of attractive colors to suit your taste. Moby Wrap slings of all materials are machine washable, so the inevitable stains are easy to get out.","If you wish to return your Moby Wrap for any reason, the company accepts returns and exchanges 30 days from the original purchase date. You must include your baby sling, the pouch to place the sling in and the instruction booklet, along with the original sales receipt and a note that states you are returning and requesting a refund."]},"id":"4606a32a-c556-4d95-a33c-34043a6c03a4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58771","url":"/moby-wrap-original-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-03T23:51:28Z","datePublished":"2014-02-03T23:51:28Z","name":"Moby Wrap Classic","synopsis":"The Moby Wrap is among the most widely used and popular baby slings on the market.
