This card has no true standout features, but no great disadvantages either. ACE Elite debit cards are produced by ACE Cash Express, which offers a variety of other financial services.","All prepaid debit cards have fees, and ACE Elite is no exception. When you receive your card, either by ordering it online or purchasing in in a retail store, you can select one of three plans. The Pay-As-You-Go plan charges you no monthly fee, but you are charged for each purchase you make. The FeeAdvantage Plan doesn&#39;t charge for purchases but has a high monthly fee. That fee is cut nearly in half when you enroll in direct deposit.","All plans feature the same costs for using ATMs. The ATM fee from ACE Elite is in addition to any fees the ATM operator charges. There are also charges for using an ATM to find out your account balance. You are also charged a fee if you request a paper account statement. You can withdraw cash for free at ACE Cash Express locations. To learn more about the specific fees, we recommend reading the cardholder agreement posted on ACE Elite&#39;s website.","ACE Elite offers a complete collection of the features we consider important in a reloadable prepaid debit card. There is a savings account with a decent APY. You can receive text updates about your account, manage your account online or use the smartphone app to monitor your spending. ACE Elite also offers a Payback Rewards program. You can sign up to receive special offers that can be redeemed online or in stores. ACE Elite also offers budgeting tools and other resources to help you manage your finances.","You can add funds to your ACE Elite card through bank transfers, direct deposit or Western Union. Money can be transferred between two ACE Elite cards. This prepaid debit card has one of the highest maximum balances of any of the cards we reviewed.","The website doesn&#39;t provide a FAQs, so if you can&#39;t find the answer to your questions, you may need to contact ACE Elite. For help and support, your best bet is to contact ACE Elite over the phone.","We are disappointed that this prepaid card site does not have a FAQs section. We had to send an email to customer support desk for the simplest questions. Unfortunately, we never heard back from email support, which is, again, disappointing and frustrating."]},"id":"468748b3-3f64-470d-82f1-c0a38cb998b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2f20fc6c-bf7d-4900-a973-a7bfe0412079","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This card offers a strong group of features, including a savings account and rewards program.
