Got SKY offers WildBlue’s three satellite internet plans: Value Pak, Select Pak and Pro Pak. Value Pak comes with download speeds as high as 512 kilobits per second (Kbps) and upload speeds as fast as 128Kbps. The Select Pak’s download speeds can reach 1 megabit per second (Mbps), and its upload speeds can be as fast as 200Kbps. The Pro Pak has the fastest speeds, up to 1.5Mbps for downloads and 256Kbps for uploads. Got SKY and other satellite internet providers don’t guarantee their advertised speeds.","Since so many people use satellite internet, WildBlue and other providers limit the bandwidth that each customer can use. Got SKY’s plans are no different. The Value Pak has a download limit of 9,800 megabytes (MB) per 30 days, the Select Pak has a 15,000MB maximum and you can use 22,000MB with the Pro Pak. If you exceed this limit, WildBlue will decrease your service speed temporarily.","You’ll also receive five email addresses that come with 7 gigabytes (GB) of storage per account for the Value and Select Paks. The Pro Pak comes with 10 email accounts that each have 7GB of storage. These come standard with most satellite internet plans."]},"id":"472c97fb-17b1-46ec-9cfa-8f4538674b5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Bandwidth Threshold"},"id":"5e9b55be-cf36-4526-91ca-3b306c3706c5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["They handle their own billing, customer service and 24/7 technical support.
