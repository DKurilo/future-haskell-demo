This mounting device is sleek and slim, and it&#39;s a good fit for most television sets measuring 37 to 60 inches. This wall mount allows you to tilt the television set, but it does not have any swivel capabilities, which can be a drawback.","The mount is made out of solid heavy-gauge steel. It is durable, and you will not need to worry about your TV set. It is only available in black. Its maximum weight capacity is 180 pounds, which is the average amount of weight many TV wall mounts will hold.","The AM-T3504B features lift-and-hook installation, making the process quick and simple. All of your mounting hardware is included with the TV wall mount, which means you do not have to gather or buy any accessories. It also features snapping wall brackets to aid in the installation process and a built-in bubble level, which helps ensure the TV mount is exactly where it needs to be for the ultimate security and protection.","This TV wall mount sits approximately 2 inches from the wall. This provides a crisp and clean look. A horizontal adjustment bar on this device allows you to adjust the mount even after it has been installed. However, we were disappointed to see there are no cord management features on this product. This would help contain and hide all of those pesky cords.","We were impressed with the help and support Arrowmounts provides. It offers email, telephone and live chat support to answer any questions or concerns you have regarding the mount. It also provides an installation guide to assist you through the entire process and ensure you get the most from this TV wall mount."]},"id":"84ad7d54-bc17-4824-babe-b19f25de3cf9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7eca99a0-3b8b-4f1d-8f8c-14a5ce2bf69e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Arrowmounts AM-T3504B is one of the best TV wall mounts if tilting capabilities and durable design are your priorities.
