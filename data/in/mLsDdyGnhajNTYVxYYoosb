The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/electronics/phone/best-cordless-phones/\">Cordless Phones</a> here.</em>","While Panasonic’s KX-TGE233B isn’t quite as versatile as the very best cordless phones we reviewed, its solid performance and smart design make it a viable option. You won’t find Bluetooth compatibility or other advanced functionality here, but the KX-TGE233B is a reliable home phone.","In our testing, this phone’s battery life proved disappointing, only lasting for one day when disconnected from the base. During our battery test, we didn’t use the phone – it just stayed idle. That means the battery life is even shorter when you use the phone throughout the day. At seven hours, battery charging time for this phone was about average compared to the others on our lineup.","The KX-TGE233B has good range, keeping a connection up to 250 feet away from the base. However, we did notice a drop in call quality. At 250 feet, there was noticeable static. Although it wasn’t enough to make the phone unusable, it isn’t ideal.","Because of its relative simplicity, the KX-TGE233B is very easy to use. The buttons are about the largest you can get on a handset, and the large font makes the text easy to read. This phone is great for those with poor vision.","The KX-TGE233B ships with three handsets, so you can rotate through them as one dies and needs to be recharged. The system can be expanded up to six handsets, though each extra handset must be bought separately. With a built-in intercom, it’s easy to talk with other people in your home, even if they’re on the other side of the house.","You can store up to 100 contacts in the KX-TGE233B’s memory. That’s a good number of contacts, but you may run out of space if you have the phone for a long time. The best cordless phones in our review can store as many as 600 contacts. With this phone, you also can store up to 50 caller ID entries and keep 17 minutes of recorded voice messages."]},"id":"14bb8acf-a661-4f23-977a-9492d9b3f48d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7e438889-0e04-497d-b743-c6157efc37af","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic KX-TGE233B may not be the very best home phone on the market, but there’s a certain appeal to its simplicity.
