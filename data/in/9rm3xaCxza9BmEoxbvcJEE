You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Beltronics Pro 500 is the flagship <a href=\"/best-radar-detectors\">radar detector</a> for the Beltronics brand. It has a listening range comparable to the best radar detectors and excellent false-alert filters so you&#39;re not constantly getting alerts for non-police radar. With six buttons, it has a more complicated interface to learn than with most radar detectors. However, once you have the functions down, it&#39;s very easy to operate and read.","After considering thousands of user reviews and expert advice from hobbyists, we gave the Beltronics Pro 500 a B for performance. The majority of users have had positive experiences with this radar detector. Unlike other radar detectors with average grades, we couldn&#39;t find any common patterns of complaints. It seems that everyone with a negative review of it has something different to complain about, which suggests it&#39;s largely a matter of the user.","The Pro 500 detects the three radar bands: X, K and Ka. It&#39;s also a Lidar detector, which means  it can alert you to laser guns. The multiple sensor diodes provide 360-degree laser detection so you get an alert even if the officer is behind you or on a side road.","However, laser detection is different from radar detection: When a police officer uses a radar gun, it spreads the radar signal out over a wide area, which is why you can detect it before the officer knows you&#39;re in the vicinity. Laser is more precise and extremely fast. An officer can target a single car, which means that by the time you receive a laser alert, the cop already knows your speed.","The best feature of the Pro 500 is the built-in GPS, which allows you to mark locations of false alerts. For example, if you drive past a grocery store and you receive an alert that you know is coming from the motion detector of the doors, you press the mute button three times and the GPS unit records that location as a false alert. The next time you drive past the grocery store, you won&#39;t receive an alert.","The GPS unit is also preloaded with thousands of speed camera and red-light camera locations. These are threats that don&#39;t emit radar. You can update the database by connecting to the internet; however, these updates require a subscription.","Since Escort owns the Beltronics brand, the Pro 500 is compatible with the Escort Live app, which provides excellent community threat sharing in real time. However, integrating with the app requires the SmartCord, which you have to purchase separately. The SmartCord plugs into the car charger and provides easy access to controls to mute alerts and mark locations. It uses Bluetooth to connect your smartphone to the radar detector. The app is an excellent resource for receiving and sharing threats with other drivers.","One of the features the Pro 500 lacks is auto learn, which combines the data from digital signal processing with geographical locations by using the GPS. If you repeatedly receive an alert in the same place, the processor learns to block it out. For example, if you receive an alert every time you drive past a specific traffic light, it&#39;s probably because the light is using radar to analyze traffic flow. It&#39;s not a threat, so the auto learn blocks the specific radar frequency at that location. Without auto learn, you receive more false alerts. You can manually mark the location and block it, however."]},"id":"b5d222e5-fee7-4bad-a1bf-1bf6da419d61","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7c28e46a-a049-4569-985d-8c6376f6314e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With a built-in GPS and compatibility with the Escort Live app, the Beltronics Pro 500 has a comprehensive list of alert features and controls comparable to the best radar detectors.
