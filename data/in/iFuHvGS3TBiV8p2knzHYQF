You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You can make <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">quality espresso machines</a> with the Hamilton Beach 40714, which uses bar-pump pressure during the brewing process. Its removable water reservoir and adjustable steam wand are convenient, though its lack of brew-strength controls and auto shut-off are not.","The best feature of the Hamilton Beach 40715 espresso machine is the removable water reservoir. The reservoir is clear and mounts to the back of the espresso machine so you can easily monitor the water level. It is big enough to hold plenty of water, so you don&#39;t have to refill the tank each time you crave some caffeine.","As with all the products in our best home espresso machine reviews, the Hamilton 40715 has a steam wand. However, because it is adjustable, you can steam, froth, churn and blend milk to top your espresso or turn it into a cappuccino or latte. The cup warmer lets you heat up your coffee cup while you wait for the cappuccino maker to get ready for brewing.","You get a conveniently combined measuring and tamping tool when you buy this espresso maker, which offers one of the best kitchen features around – convenience. You don&#39;t need to rummage around in kitchen drawers looking for two tools to make the delicious drink you want. With this tool, you can measure the precise amount of coffee grounds you need for your espresso machine and then tamp them to prepare the type of espresso you enjoy.","The Hamilton Beach 40715 can brew up to four shots of espresso at a time. With a push of a button and a turn of the dial, you can manually set the machine to brew two cups at once. Because this cappuccino maker stands more than 15 inches high, it has the clearance to hold a taller mug if you want to enjoy the entire 4 ounces of espresso yourself.","You can use both coffee grounds and espresso pods with this machine. The portafilter comes with two filter holders depending on whether you use grounds or pods. The manual controls allow you to set the temperature and toggle between brewing and steaming modes. Unfortunately, you cannot control the brew strength. If the espresso is too strong, you have to add water afterward to tone it down.","The indicator light lets you know when the machine is ready to make a latte. It also serves as a warning to curious little hands that the espresso machine may be hot. However, it lacks an auto shut-off function, which could be a hazard if you forget you left the machine on. Like the best espresso machines on the market, this device comes with a polarized plug, so you can only plug it into an electrical socket one way.","Hamilton Beach offers generous customer support options. You can access online user guides and read FAQs on the Hamilton Beach website. You also have access to customer service representatives 24/7 via telephone and email. You can even connect with Hamilton Beach and its courteous support staff on Facebook."]},"id":"4929a42f-7d54-4f76-b7e8-582a3a8eccf2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0322e070-ff29-4b62-b251-1b1211cf9499","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hamilton Beach 40714 lets you create a variety of tasty espresso-based drinks, including lattes and cappuccinos, with its adjustable wand.
