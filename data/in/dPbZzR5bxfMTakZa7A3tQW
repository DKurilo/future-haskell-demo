Two years ago, it stole the hearts and minds not just of Google’s fans but of everyone who wanted a solid, affordable smartphone. Simple, clean, well-built, comfy to hold and offering the purest Android experience you could find, the Nexus 5 was almost perfect. If it had a better battery and camera, it might have been.","Then the phone languished, forgotten by Google and untouched by manufacturer LG. Last year’s Nexus 6 was an uninspired follow-up – a bulky, uncomfortable device with a flagship-level price tag. It ultimately disappointed.","Enter the Nexus 5X. It’s small. It’s light. It uses pure Android Marshmallow, Google’s latest and greatest operating system. It’s also faster than the LG G4 and has the best fingerprint scanner we’ve ever – ever – used. Even better, it does it all for just a few hundred dollars unlocked. The iPhone 6s may be faster, the Galaxy S6 more impressive at taking pictures, but dollar for dollar, the Nexus 5X is the best mid-tier smartphone on the market. It’s the Nexus 5, matured."]},"id":"1bad7e8f-4754-4c6f-8f7a-b073191c2536","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"6be585d4-809c-41ae-9254-0955579211c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/DytL6XNQtuD36QCu7eKxL3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67321-nexus-5x8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DytL6XNQtuD36QCu7eKxL3.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"DytL6XNQtuD36QCu7eKxL3","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DytL6XNQtuD36QCu7eKxL3.jpg","alt":""},"id":"677022a4-94ad-4859-82af-4406da6b11be","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In an age of aluminum unibody phones, glass back covers and artful curves, the Nexus 5X might seem simplistic. It’s made of polycarbonate plastic and sports a basic, rectangular design that could accurately be called minimalist. This isn’t a phone that immediately turns heads, yet we can’t help but love it. The 1080p, 5.2-inch screen is plenty sharp and very usable in one hand, a boon other manufacturers seem determined to ignore with their big-screen phablets.","The real gem here, though, is Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Not only is the Nexus 5X the first phone on the market with Google’s latest OS, but it also boasts a pure version of the platform, unsullied by the bloatware that carriers and manufacturers love to layer on.","Along with better battery management and streamlined app launching, Marshmallow has changed how apps handle system permissions. Instead of demanding access to everything upfront, apps must now request control of different pieces of the phone – the camera, the fingerprint scanner and so on – as they need them. It’s a more iPhone-like take on app permissions that lets you cut off apps whenever you like and ultimately results in a cleaner, more secure experience."]},"id":"3bc238e7-5052-42bb-95e7-6a7a0d1b9f46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"58afe8db-ca15-41fd-9aa7-5505f985c440","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/XvXq3vPTZJaWuk8WYuQfHW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67321-nexus-5x4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvXq3vPTZJaWuk8WYuQfHW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"XvXq3vPTZJaWuk8WYuQfHW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvXq3vPTZJaWuk8WYuQfHW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8fde7324-791b-423f-9bdc-1110cdc2c58a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are three things every smartphone user wants from their camera: usability, beautiful pictures and great video.
