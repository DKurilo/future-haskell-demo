You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Remington Instant Curls is a basic <a href=\"/best-curling-irons\">curling iron</a> designed for all hair types. This device reaches temperatures of 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and it provides 30 heat settings and automatic shut-off capabilities. It also features a ceramic barrel and fast heat up. However, it does not include many advanced features that you find on similar hair-curling products.","This curling iron has a spring-based design. The spring holds a section of hair tightly around the barrel without any extra effort from you. The barrel is ceramic, which heats up evenly and quickly and reduces static electricity. We tested this product on a variety of hair types, including thin, fine and thick hair. Those with thin, straight hair had an easier time with this product. Those with thicker hair struggled, as the barrel is slippery and hair would often slide off it, which didn&#39;t result in the tight curl we were after.","The Remington Instant Curls reaches a maximum temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit. This is not the hottest curling iron on our lineup. However, the lower temperatures make it ideal for thin and fine hair, as it won&#39;t cause heat damage. One large advantage to this curling iron is that it features 30 heat settings, so you can find the perfect temperature for your specific hair type.","There are a few safety features on this curling iron. It shuts off automatically after 60 minutes of nonuse. It also features a heat shield for the barrel to protect wandering fingers and other objects from being burned. However, it does not have digital display capabilities, which would allow you to easily see the temperature and the heat settings of the curling iron.","This curling iron includes a two-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty. This warranty is similar to what you will find on many similar devices, but the best warranties are for four or five years. If you have questions or concerns about this curling iron, you can reach a support representative via email and telephone."]},"id":"bfd8b254-118f-4411-a26b-b7edf5b893d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c96d1395-a1bd-422d-8792-fa6f7cc01c3e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Remington Instant Curls boasts many features, including a ceramic barrel, 30 heat settings and automatic shut-off capabilities.
