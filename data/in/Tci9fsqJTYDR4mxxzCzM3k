It is run on the Windows XP and Vista platforms along with Windows Defender to protect against viruses, spyware, phishing and other forms of fraud. However, while Windows Live OneCare offers very comprehensive scanning and cleaning operations, it lacks the firewall considerations like ICSA certification, registry protection, file protection, data filtering, VB 100% certification and W.C.L levels 1 and/or 2 certification. This means that you are scanning and cleaning viruses and spyware, which should be blocked in the first place.","Another drawback is the lack of filtering and safeguarding that is given, meaning that website filtering, password protection, email scanning, website history logs and privacy controls must be accounted for by another program, or left to chance. Windows Live OneCare does block most adware, phishing and spyware, but others forms of phishing like keylogging, which allows phishers to obtain information through recording user keystrokes, are not protected by this internet security suite.","The availability of Windows products makes troubleshooting and other assistance issues relatively easy. However, since Windows Live OneCare is run simultaneously with Windows Defender on one of two different platforms, it can be difficult to pinpoint errors or to seek specific assistance."]},"id":"c91bff93-ddab-4bd7-a9c9-f419802c18f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"17b49154-7284-4277-ad9c-f3f838e9d056","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Windows Live OneCare offers both port mirroring and network traffic monitoring.
