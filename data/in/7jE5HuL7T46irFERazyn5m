Whether you&#39;re a speed runner practicing on the track at night or a long-distance runner participating in a multi-day race, the Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp helps you keep an eye on the ground in front of you. The beam lets you spot hazards before they become a problem, and it can reach as far as 45 meters out in front of you. At maximum output, this <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-running-headlamps\">running headlamp</a> produces up to 75 lumens, so you get a good balance of enough light to see, yet not enough to blind other runners or cyclists coming towards you.","At just 3.4 ounces, this running headlight is light enough that you barely notice it is there. It&#39;s specifically balanced to prevent bouncing during a run, and it comes with a removable top strap to give you added stabilization on rugged terrain. The adjustable strap has a lot of play, so it can be shortened or lengthened to fit most head sizes.","Dimmer and front strobe functions let you customize your light output. This running head torch also has a red blinking light on the back that you can use to enhance your visibility so cars and cyclists coming up from behind can see you from afar. You can also tilt the light to aim the beam closer to your feet or further up the path or trail.","The Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp uses a lithium polymer rechargeable battery that is embedded within the unit and comes with a charger and USB cable, so you can also charge it using your home computer or a portable charger. On high power, you get 6 hours of light from a fully charged battery, and on low power, you get up to 42 hours of battery life, making this one of the best models for multiday use in conditions where frequent recharging isn&#39;t a possibility. This running headlight also regulates light output to conserve energy when the battery starts running low. Fully recharging an empty battery takes about 5 hours.","Because the sealed light unit can handle complete submersion in water up to 1 meter deep for up to 30 minutes, this running headlight is great for jogs in inclement weather, including foggy, snowy and rainy conditions.","The Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp is a good all-around running headlamp that is lightweight enough for everyday use. The long battery life is a plus, but the internal charging mechanism means you need to have a charger at hand when it does run down because you can&#39;t just swap in fresh batteries."]},"id":"912751e4-7273-46f6-91ec-c8a9b7efa215","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62534","url":"/black-diamond-sprinter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:42:07Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:42:07Z","name":"Black Diamond Sprinter","synopsis":"The lightweight and low-profile Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp uses a wide oval-shaped beam to illuminate the ground while you run.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The lightweight and low-profile Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp uses a wide oval-shaped beam to illuminate the ground while you run.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-03T20:42:07Z","id":"7jE5HuL7T46irFERazyn5m","meta":{"title":"Black Diamond Sprinter Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The lightweight Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp has a low profile and wide beam, so it makes a great addition to your night running gear.
