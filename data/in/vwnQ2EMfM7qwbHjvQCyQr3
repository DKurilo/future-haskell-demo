It is one of the most common types of coil systems used in entry-level spring mattresses. The gauge of the coils is 13, which makes for a softer, springier surface compared to a coil gauge of 15 or higher.","The materials used for the upholstered top layer of this spring mattress include a polyurethane foam topper and insulator pads made from blended cotton felt and synthetic fiber. The mattress is padded equally on both sides so you can flip it over to ensure even wear.","This mattress is available in twin, full, queen and king sizes. On average, a person turns nearly a dozen times each night, so it’s important to opt for a mattress that gives you enough space to move freely. The range of sizes the Original Mattress Classic comes in ensures there is a size that will fit your needs."]},"id":"a0dc94bd-bb0e-4328-a8cb-12504e307eed","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/YUXE53omvG4bniRLpjVTbh.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58402-original-mattress-classic2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YUXE53omvG4bniRLpjVTbh.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"YUXE53omvG4bniRLpjVTbh","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YUXE53omvG4bniRLpjVTbh.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5f7e61de-b6f2-4024-bc2c-be61387796f1","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Original Mattress Classic comes with a 10-year prorated warranty that covers manufacturing defects. A prorated warranty means the manufacturer covers only a percentage of the replacement costs of any defects, depending on when you choose to exercise the warranty. For instance, if you discover a defect five years after the initial purchase date, the manufacturer will pay for 50 percent of the replacement costs since you are halfway through the warranty period.","While its prorated warranty is far from the best among spring mattresses, the Original Mattress Classic still ranks among the best mattresses that utilize a Bonnell coil system. Its multi-layer top gives you extra softness and comfort that helps keep you asleep at night. Furthermore, its two-sided padding allows you to periodically flip the mattress so it wears evenly and thus will last for years to come."]},"id":"91a64b40-4af8-470e-b665-3a741f44a643","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58430","url":"/original-mattress-classic-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-12T19:36:12Z","datePublished":"2013-12-12T19:36:12Z","name":"Original Mattress Classic","synopsis":"The Original Mattress Classic is a spring mattress that offers good support, durability and comfort at an affordable price.
