Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Equator EZ4400CV and its sister product the EX4000CV are the only <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">washer dryer combos</a> to offer both venting and condensing for the dryer cycle. So you can use it the traditional way and plug it into an outlet that will vent externally or pull it out and hook it to a standard faucet – the faucet method being common among most combination washer dryers. This machine has one of the smallest capacities of any washer dryer in our reviews, but the lack of wheels makes it less mobile than it would otherwise be. It is small enough to place in a closet or under a counter.","With 14 different washing cycles, this machine has plenty of options for washing. The dryer options on this unit are also impressive. It has an automatic dry level function that selects the appropriate level of drying (high, normal, low or damp) depending on the laundry it is drying. This machine also has only one soil level setting, so deep cleaning heavily soiled clothing could be a problem. While you can’t adjust the spin speed, the drum will spin up to 1200 rpm, which will help get clothes dry.","This is an energy efficient machine that only costs an estimated $10.30 a year to operate if you use it once a week. With a drum this size, you may have to use it more than once or twice a week however. The drum is 1.6 cubic feet, which is enough for two people but lacking in space for a large family or big items like blankets and sheets. This washer dryer will work best for a small family or couple. Bigger families may want to consider a larger machine.","While this machine doesn’t have a self-cleaning cycle like some of the units in our lineup, it does have a self-cleaning pump that you hook up to the back of the machine to keep the drum free of buildup. It also has a trap that prevents you from having to clear lint after several dry cycles.","This machine is not the most solid in terms of design. The display panel is made of white plastic, as is the automatic dispenser. The LED display and dial in front are easy to use, but the different cycles and features displayed almost run together, creating a busy design. The overall functionality of washer dryer is quite good however.","Equator has several contact options in case you have questions or concerns. There are contact numbers and email addresses for the different offices around the world. The main page for the combination washer dryer has reviews from other customers and a video that explains how to use the machine. The online manual has helpful information, but it lacks full PDF functionality so you can’t do keyword searches to find specific topics you’re looking for. The warranty is only the standard one year on parts, service, motor and drum."]},"id":"cce59bd1-3e4d-481a-a954-434c955e4e44","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9c3beba8-15a7-4495-9606-7574e84543ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Equator EZ4400CV has both venting and condenser capabilities, which is nice if you have external venting that you prefer over hooking it up to a faucet.
