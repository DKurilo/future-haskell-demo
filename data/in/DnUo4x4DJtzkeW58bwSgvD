It’s a great choice for anyone who is comfortable with drawing programs like Photoshop or Affinity Photo as it gives you access to a wide range of brushes and art assets to help you design the perfect scenes in your hand-drawn animations. The assets library is filled with posable 3D models so you can create realistic and complex poses. But, you will need to purchase a separate program if you want to add audio.","We recommend that you use a drawing tablet with this software as it is drawing intensive and responded beautifully to our Wacom tablet. We were able to scan in our drawings and clean them up using this software. Among the many options available to you, you’ll be able to change the opacity and pressure of the brushes, pencils and various other drawing tools. Since this is a more intense drawing program, it also gives you access to clipping masks, several selection tools and paint bucket fill tools. Using a tablet allows your pen to respond to firm verses light strokes which helps give more life to your drawings.","The onion skinning tool allows you to see the image before and after the current frame you are on so you can draw additional movements and make your scene flow. We found the layers window much like what you’d find in Photoshop as it allows you to lock, select, edit and create layers quickly and easily. The included color palette gave us access to every color imaginable so you can choose the specific hues you envision for your freehand characters. You can also import drawings and have the software trace them as vector images.","This biggest downside to this program is that you cannot record nor import audio. This means that lip-syncing, while not impossible, is much harder to do in this software. If you want to add audio, the company suggests you use OpenToonz and gives a link to that program. If you’d prefer a program that allows you to add and record audio, you might be interested in <a href=\"/anime-studio-review\">MOHO Debut</a>. Clip Studio Paint offers the widest selection of backgrounds, objects and character templates of any program we tested. They aren’t pre-animated, but they can be manipulated to move in your scenes using the drawing tools. You will find plenty of still effects like fire, smoke, weather elements and explosions.","The feature that blew us away was the library of posable 3D figures. There are hundreds of pre-posed human figures that you can place into your scene and draw over in order to capture complicated body positions. These figures are also completely adjustable and respond to gravity so we could can bend and rotate joints to get any realistic pose we could think of.","This software is compatible with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator files, as well as JPEG, PNG, BMP image files. You can also import MOV and MP4 video files. You cannot import any audio files. When you are ready to export, you can save your work as AVI, MP4, GIF and PNGs. Since this is a comic book drawing program, it also has specific settings to export your work on Kindle.","Clip Studio Paint is used by thousands of people across the world, which helped us find user-created video tutorials on YouTube. You can also access the company’s knowledgebase to find official tutorials, an active user forum and a FAQs page. If you need further assistance you can email the company. This program works with both Windows and Mac computers so you won’t have to worry about compatibility.","Clip Studio Paint is first and foremost a comic book drawing and illustration program. However, it offers some animation tools that are appealing to more traditional animators. You won’t find bone rigging or animation paths in this software, but it does offer a wide range of professional drawing tools and an onion skinning feature to help you create hand drawn characters. The biggest downside to this software is the lack of audio tools. You can neither record nor import audio, so you’ll need to use an additional program if you want to add lip-syncing to your stories."]},"id":"09625e19-6def-45d4-8b26-d5adf6a82999","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70115","url":"/clip-studio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-16T19:33:20Z","datePublished":"2018-07-16T19:33:20Z","name":"Clip Studio Paint EX","synopsis":"Clip Studio Paint is first and foremost an illustration and comic drawing software that has animation features built into it.","review":{"rating":73,"verdict":"This is first and foremost illustration software, meaning that it has limitations compared to other programs.
