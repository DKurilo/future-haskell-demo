The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-french-door-refrigerators\">French Door Refrigerators</a>Â here</em><em>.</em>","The AGA Marvel Professional series is a line of matching appliances that includes a counter-depth french door refrigerator. The AMPROFD20SS comes in a stainless steel finish and has a total capacity of 19.8 cubic feet. The freezer alone holds 5.4 cubic feet of the capacity, which is average for a fridge of this size. While this french door fridge has a few of the advanced features we looked for, other advanced features were conspicuously absent. LED lighting is found in many high-end refrigerators because it is energy efficient and the bulbs lasts longer than incandescent bulbs. However, this fridge is missing LED lights. Many of our higher ranked refrigerators cost less and have more high-end features like LED lighting.","This refrigerator has four split and adjustable shelves and one stationary full-length shelf that rests on the crisper bins. The four adjustable shelves only move up and down, so if you need to place a taller item in the fridge you will have to either move the whole shelf up or take it out completely. Among the advanced features found in this fridge are the two humidity-controlled fruit and vegetable crisper bins and temperature-controlled full-width deli drawer. The humidity controls allow you to better control the environment in the bins to lengthen the life of your produce. The deli drawer is not reserved for meats and cheeses; since you can adjust the temperature, you can thaw foods or store beverages in the drawer as well.","This AGA Marvel fridge has six door bins, one of which is a dairy compartment and another is designed to hold four beverage cans. Two of the door bins were designed to hold gallon-sized containers. This fridge has a lot of fresh food storage, including room in the door, but this comes at the expense of a through-the-door ice and water dispenser. There is a filtered water dispenser in the fresh food compartment, but the icemaker is in the freezer compartment so you will have to bend down to get ice.","To contact AGA, you can either fill out the online email form or call the company directly. However, your best option for support is to contact a certified dealer or servicer near you. Should you need it, you can find a copy of the user manual on the website. The company website does have video tutorials, but none of the current videos relate to the refrigerators."]},"id":"93a20e2c-62aa-4696-9a13-0837c22f6c35","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b4858390-617c-4445-b4ea-bd88f6c0d4cb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the AGA Marvel Professional french door refrigerator has some quality features, it falls short of excellence due to its lack of a through-the-door ice and water system and LED lighting.
