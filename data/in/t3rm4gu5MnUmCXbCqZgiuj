I played the songs through a car stereo and evaluated the signal clarity by listening for imbalances in the mix, distortions and noise. To measure signal strength, I measured the maximum volume reached on each song with the volume setting on the stereo maintaining the same level. One of the biggest complaints with Bluetooth car kits is the weak audio signal, requiring you to turn your stereo up.","For signal quality, the Anker SoundSync Drive earned an A grade. Even at full volume, the audio was clear and well balanced. Bluetooth tends to have audio clarity issues, even with AptX, because of compression issues.
