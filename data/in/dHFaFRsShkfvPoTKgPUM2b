The data transfer speed has been improved and the presence of dead spots, once a major shortfall, has been drastically reduced. This is in large measure due to the development of MIMO technology, a helpful acronym for Multiple-input/Multiple-output.","As wireless signals are transmitted through a house or office, they run into myriad obstacles such as walls and furniture. The signals bounce around and, with previous Wi-Fi products, confused the hardware creating dead spots and reducing effective range. MIMO allows the bouncing signals to return to the adapter and be redirected in a more efficient way, which practically eliminates the dead spots and increases range.","The Wi-Fi n standard also uses a functionality called Wi-Fi Multimedia, or WMM, which allows traffic on the network to be prioritized when the user is multitasking. In this way, data with the highest priority is not interrupted by lower priority traffic.","On the down side, the Buffalo Nfiniti is a single band router that operates in the 2.4GHz frequency range. Though Wi-Fi’s good neighbor functionality is good at rejecting interference, it still occurs in this band because so many other products use it. Competing devices include wireless electronics that use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, remote controlled toys and some household appliances. Dual band adapters can also operate in the 5GHz range, which has few competitors and very little possibility of interference. The higher frequency range is also better able to transmit high bandwidth data like streaming audio, video and voice applications."]},"id":"78ac2588-c520-40ed-96a4-04498d4bcb38","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Security"},"id":"31b19153-a957-4066-a54a-f588e5976791","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Putting sensitive information on any network carries some risk. Fortunately, the Buffalo adapter incorporates sophisticated encryption standards that can prevent unauthorized access to critical data while keeping hackers from gaining access to the network. The first generation Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which is susceptible to cracking, is supplemented by two levels of Wi-Fi Protected Access, WPA and WPA2. The latter, in particular, using Advanced Encryption Standard, gives a level of protection that both governments and corporate users find sufficient to protect their most important information.","Secure pairing of the device with a compatible wireless router can be achieved with the push of a couple of buttons using Wireless Protected Setup, or WPS, a feature which Buffalo rebrands as AirStation One-Touch Secure System."]},"id":"eb716dca-2fbd-41d9-9e2d-c4c9d2dc9582","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"0e59caee-60cd-4f6a-b4cf-e8c13787ea18","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Buffalo Nfiniti adapter works only with the 32-bit version of Windows Vista, Windows XP and Windows 2000.
