Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Roost Smoke Alarm makes an appearance on our list of the best <a href=\"/best-smoke-detectors\">smoke detectors</a> because it detects carbon monoxide and natural gas in addition to smoke. After you connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network, you can download Roost’s mobile app to remotely monitor your house and receive notifications in the case of an emergency. However, it’s somewhat challenging to install and has a much shorter lifespan than the devices we ranked higher.","When our reviewers installed the Roost Smoke Alarm, they were somewhat frustrated with the manual electrical work required to set it up correctly. The <a href=\"/nest-protect-review\">other models we reviewed</a> have a simple plug you insert into your existing smoke alarm locations, but Roost has a proprietary connection that requires you to manually wire the smoke alarm into your home’s electrical system. So, make sure you turn the power to that room off when you install it to avoid potential electrocution. If you’re unfamiliar with electrical work in general, you may want to enlist the assistance of a knowledgeable friend or hire a professional.","This smoke detector’s box advertises “No more 3 AM chirps.” However, when our reviewers installed the device, it immediately began chirping. Even when it was hardwired to a power source and the backup was battery installed, they could never get the chirping to stop.","Once you have the smoke detector installed, you can connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. This allows it to communicate with Roost’s mobile app, which you can install on your smartphone or tablet to monitor your home’s safety remotely and receive real-time notifications if there is an emergency.","In addition to detecting smoke, the Roost Smoke Alarm monitors your home for dangerous levels or carbon monoxide and natural gas. It’s the only device we reviewed that monitors for all three of those threats.","We sprayed simulated smoke from an aerosol can 5, 10 and 15 feet away from device. From 5 feet, it only took 14 seconds to sound the alarm and send notifications to the app. However, from 10 and 15 feet away, it didn’t detect the simulated smoke at all, even after we expended an entire can of it. This means that a great deal of smoke needs to accumulate before the alarm sounds if the source is more than a few feet from the device.","The higher-ranking smoke detectors have a lifespan of 10 years. The Roost Smoke Alarm only lasts about five years, which is curious because the company offers a 10-year warranty."]},"id":"8577f848-647e-41f0-9e90-5563d8f1504e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7ad36294-4a9e-48ed-9d79-6a875992684f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Roost Smoke alarm is an adequate solution for monitoring your home for smoke, carbon monoxide and natural gas – if you can install it correctly.
