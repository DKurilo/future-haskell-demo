The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 </em><a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\"><em>Home Theater Speakers here</em></a><em>.</em>","Andrew Jones, one of the most revered engineers in the speaker world, designed the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR bookshelf speakers. It should be no surprise the audio quality from these small bookshelf speakers is top notch when an engineer that generally works on $100,000 pairs of speakers designed them. These speakers’ shortcomings are not its audio quality, but its lower sensitivity and undersized enclosure.","The SP-BS22-LR produces pristine high-frequency tones that are on par with just about any high-fidelity bookshelf speaker. The high-efficiency soft-dome tweeter sounds natural and enhances clarity and audio tonality. The audio characteristics of these bookcase speakers make them a solid complement to your tower speakers as surrounds.","Standing alone, these Pioneer speakers simply don&#39;t have the driver size or the power to produce full-bodied, punchy bass. The 4-inch structured surface driver is one of the smallest woofers in our lineup. These speakers are also underpowered compared to others in our lineup. The 80-watt maximum power handling means that these speakers can’t supply the strength that some others can. This reiterates them being better suited as surround speakers as opposed to mains.","Though the small size of these bookshelf speakers is one of its shortcomings, it is also an advantage when it comes to speaker placement options. At 9.2 pounds, these speakers are relatively lightweight, and the 7.2 x 12.6 x 8.4-inch enclosure frame allow you to sneak these speakers into tight nooks and spaces.","The SP-BS22-LR carries a 6-ohm load and has a sensitivity rating of 85 decibels. This is one of the few speakers in our lineup that carry a 6-ohm as opposed to an 8-ohm load. The nominal impedance coupled with the low sensitivity rating means that you have to pair these speakers with a receiver with a decent amount of power if you want your speakers to perform to the best of its abilities. At 85dB, it takes twice the power to properly drive these speakers compared to a speaker with a sensitivity rating of 88dB or higher.","Pioneer offers a downloadable product sheet, but we were unable to find a downloadable manual or telephone number for support. You can fill out an extensive online form to get assistance from Pioneer, but response time is not prompt.","There is something to be said for the Andrew Jones-designed Pioneer SP-BS22-LR speakers. These speakers produce sparking high tones and are great for surround sound speakers. They don’t possess the power, nor the driver size to stand alone in your home theater setup, but they work as a solid addition to your current home theater system."]},"id":"f1ede237-5e45-401b-8b61-8f625b30835d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69405","url":"/pioneer-sp-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-30T16:11:13Z","datePublished":"2017-05-30T16:11:13Z","name":"Pioneer SP BS22-LR","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
