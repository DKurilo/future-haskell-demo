Ultimately, however, what makes a good speaker is the way it sounds, and the C5 falls short of what we’ve come to expect from KEF. Even the company’s web site refers to it as competent, which it is, but for the price, we think there are better choices.

It also represents a classic study in why specifications alone don’t tell the whole story when it comes to audio equipment generally and loudspeakers in particular.","The specs for the C5 indicate response across most of the sonic range on the low end and plenty of headroom for overtones on the treble end of the spectrum. Reaching down to 41Hz allows the lowest note played by a bass guitar or upright bass to be audible. Extending to 40kHz provides the ultrasonic overtones that make music rich and spacious.","Given all of that, we would expect these speakers to be alive and exciting. Somehow, they’ve missed that mark. Rather than providing the big, realistic sound that we expect from floor standers, if you didn’t see them, you’d expect to find them on a shelf. This is quite a step backwards in an era when tiny speakers are encroaching on the territory of bigger units."]},"id":"2cde30cf-edef-47e0-98c2-4169baf7723e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Peformance"},"id":"0b083d69-e7d0-4add-88ae-5d06c1d92598","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KEF C5 floor standing speaker has a respectable sensitivity rating of 90dB. That makes it just about average compared to other speakers in this survey. As such, it’s virtually silent when not driven but produces adequate sound levels while being driven with relatively little amplifier power.

With bass response that dips clear down to 41Hz and the crossover setting at 2500Hz, the two 5¼-inch hybrid drivers are being asked to do an awfully big job.","Producing deep bass means causing a speaker to vibrate in a manner that will produce very slow, power-hungry pressure waves. That in and of itself is a weighty task for such a small driver. Adding the responsibility of reproducing the full spectrum of mid-range frequencies creates a potentially untenable position.","The crossover sends frequencies higher than 2500Hz to a single 0.75-inch aluminum dome tweeter. We’d expect to hear more clarity in this range but the response still seems rather flat and unanimated."]},"id":"ffbed000-37fb-4501-a892-0078ae1683ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1e9b937d-3bb4-4aa4-af3d-806210b8ef22","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We found the overall sound quality of the KEF C5 floor standing speaker to be somewhat disappointing compared to its respectable specs.
