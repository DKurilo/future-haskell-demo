The Jerdon HL165CD is a wall-mounted <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">lighted mirror</a> that can be wired anywhere in your home. This style of mirror is commonly found in hotels and spas, and it has a range of features to give you a salon-like experience at home.","If you are a fan of the lighted wall-mounted makeup mirrors commonly found in hotel bathrooms, the Jerdon mirror may be a good option for you. It must be wired to your electrical system and does not come with a power cord. Because of this, you may want to consider using an electrician to install it for you. The 8-inch mirror is mounted to a base that allows for complete 360-degree adjustment. The arm itself extends up to 14 inches. You can use extension arm to help you see profiles of your hair from different angles. If you&#39;d prefer a mirror that you can easily travel with, you might be interested in <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">Tweezermate</a>.","Jerdon&#39;s five times magnification on this lighted mirror gives you a detailed view of your makeup application. This magnified mode can also help with maintaining your brow line, facial hair maintenance, shaving, contact application and more. The magnification is also useful if you wear corrective eyewear, as it allows you to put on makeup without having to wear glasses. You can use the mirror in normal mode for overall makeup and hair styling. The control switch at its base allows you to turn on the lighting only when you need it.","The mirror uses a 25-watt bulb. Replacement bulbs are available directly from the manufacturer&#39;s website. Mounting hardware and a replacement bulb are included. Jerdon provides a one-year limited warranty for additional security. The chrome finish makes it water resistant for bathroom installations. Note, however, that this is not a fog-free mirror.","This lighted vanity mirror is a fun option if you want to give your bathroom a modern, hotel-like look. The dual sided mirror has a powerful 5 times magnified side to help with difficult and detailed tasks like tweezing eyebrows and putting in contact lenses. The electrical wiring may require a licensed professional to guarantee proper installation. While the polished chrome is rust-resistant, the mirror is not fog proof."]},"id":"808f0121-831a-4a8c-88fe-18a4466dc943","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66156","url":"/jerdon-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-10T21:45:48Z","datePublished":"2015-07-10T21:45:48Z","name":"Jerdon HL165CD","synopsis":"A proper vanity mirror can convert any portion of your home into the ideal makeup counter.
