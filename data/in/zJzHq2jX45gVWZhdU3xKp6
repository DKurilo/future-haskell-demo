OnePlus has finally made a device with a bite to match its bark. There’s power unlike anything we’ve seen before and a slick, simple cleanliness to match.

Granted, it takes more than a few design cues from Samsung and Apple. Samsung phones usually sport that squarer camera bump and lozenge-shaped home button; Apple’s circle-hole speaker grille along the bottom edge seems like a subtle detail, but it’s nevertheless iconic. Still, I found myself not caring. The phone is thin without being painful to hold and elegant and stylish without being overstated.","I’m also a huge fan of bottom-mounted headphone jacks. By convention, most phones put them up top, which is annoying for two reasons. First, the cord can get in the way of the screen when you hold the phone in your hand. Even more of a nuisance, you have to drop it into your pocket upright so the cord doesn’t coil. When you reach into your pocket to grab the phone, you can’t just pull it out and look at it; you have to flip the phone around in your hand. By mounting the jack on the bottom, the OnePlus 3 avoids these issues. Are they nitpicks? Sure. But not dealing with them day-in and day-out is surprisingly refreshing."]},"id":"3037b9fc-da2b-4171-968c-06b08de14b88","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/VnLntdKFShNx9HQZUXPHp5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68093-oneplus-35.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnLntdKFShNx9HQZUXPHp5.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"VnLntdKFShNx9HQZUXPHp5","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnLntdKFShNx9HQZUXPHp5.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7e23c57c-ddf3-4f59-9d55-ad4500f79cb3","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["That’s really the story of the OnePlus 3: It’s refreshing to use. The fingerprint scanner worked every time for me, without fail. I never – I stress, not even once – noticed any software hiccups or glitches during use. Staples of the OnePlus line, like the dedicated three-notch toggle switch for notifications, are crisp, snappy and intuitive. And Oxygen OS, OnePlus’s take on Android 6.0.1, is utterly unobtrusive while still letting you customize things just a bit more than stock Android. I can’t believe I’m saying it, but I may actually prefer it to stock Marshmallow.","It’s not all good news, though. The single most glaring concern is the screen, which is only 1080p compared to the 1440p displays common to today’s Android flagships. Apple fans, of course, have never had 1440p displays and won’t feel the absence here, and in day-to-day use, you’d never notice the lack of pixels.

This means you have to work a bit harder to position your face so you don’t have on overly large chin or forehead in your picture, but it’s much easier to fit everyone into group selfies.","The rear-mounted camera is a big selling point for any top smartphone, and OnePlus has clearly tried to impress.

First, on this phone the processor doesn’t need to push as many pixels. With a display that’s only 1920 x 1080, there’s far less screen here for the processor to fuel than the displays of phones like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5.

These are decent scores comfortably in line with major flagships. There’s no wireless charging option like the Galaxy S7, though, nor can you remove and replace the battery like you can with the LG G5.","One battery feature worth mentioning with the OnePlus 3 is Dash Charge. The company’s take on rapid charging isn’t that different from its competition’s, promising over 60 percent charge in about 30 minutes. What is different is the power block, which handles most of the power management necessary for Dash Charge to happen. This greatly reduces the amount of heat buildup in the phone during charging but also means you have to use the OnePlus adapter if you want to take advantage of rapid charging technology. On the plus side, there’s a car charger for the OnePlus 3 that builds in that Dash Charge speed boost, so you can quick-fuel your phone on the move."]},"id":"7d87b4c8-c370-4e80-87db-dfafe89a0746","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"310c2d73-af21-4e1c-b74f-4d1941fc2d74","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For two years, I’ve been skeptical of OnePlus’s vision.
