In either case, <a href=\"/best-billing-and-invoice-software\">good accounting  software</a> can make this often tedious job easier. There are many excellent bookkeeping programs you can purchase, but if your needs are basic and your budget tight, you may find a free program that can help you track your profits without eating into them.","<strong>The Upside:</strong> Most free accounting programs can handle the tasks of basic bookkeeping, creating and sending invoices and generating reports. They can track billing status, handle recurring payments and set up payment reminders. You can program them to calculate VAT, GST or sales tax, and a few even work with multiple currencies and languages. A few are compatible with other programs.","<strong>The Downside: </strong>Most free accounting programs are available as downloads for desktop systems only. Very often, the basic version is free, and to get any extra modules, you upgrade to the next program. This is useful if you do well with the free version alone, or you need to upgrade and like the program. However, if you use the free version and find you need extra features not found in the upgraded version, you may spend a lot of time importing data or rebuilding information in your new program."]},"id":"fe5c4a9b-8faa-4eaa-8c1f-56797c88b16c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Find the Best Free Accounting Programs for You"},"id":"38d3f4d1-2a50-4c8e-a5dc-17abb00c5e47","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When looking at freeware for your accounting, think carefully about your accounting needs and growth plans. Your best choice will be one that not only meets your needs now but five years from now. Also find one that is easy to use.","<strong>Great Overall Choice: Wave: </strong>Our sister site, <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7545-best-free-accounting-software.html\">Business News Daily, ranks Wave</a> as the best  free accounting software because it&#39;s comprehensive, easy to use and has all the tasks you&#39;d expect in a basic accounting software you&#39;d pay for. It&#39;s also cloud-based so you can access it anywhere. It does not offer payroll features, and there&#39;s no customer support.","<strong>Heavy-Duty Accounting: GnuCash:</strong> If you are looking for straight bookkeeping, GnuCash offers double-entry bookkeeping, statement reconciliation, scheduled transactions, customer and vendor tracking, tax and billing terms and more. It can also handle stock portfolios and multiple currencies. It offers customizable reports and graphs to help you drill down on your numbers to understand your business better.","<strong>Accounting-Plus: ZipBooks </strong>offers completely free online accounting software. In addition to the usual billing and invoicing features offered by most applications, it also offers project and team management features and time tracking software, making it a good choice for contract work. It integrates with Stripe and WePay for credit card processing as well.","<strong>Accounting and HR: Adminsoft </strong>is a popular free accounting software app that can work for multiple users, companies or departments. It not only handles accounting information, but also customer details, supplier contact information and stock records. It has a payroll system, but it&#39;s optimized for the United Kingdom. However, the personnel section lets you store personal information, including next-of-kin, holidays and time off. It will work on any system, but for non-Windows, it requires Windows emulation.","When your business grows, you may find you need accounting software that is more feature-rich or compatible with other programs, and you may need to pay for those services. While your bookkeeping needs are simple, however, free accounting software may indeed fit the bill without costing you a cent."]},"id":"0a6efb41-dfea-429c-9275-72063cbe0d87","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10210","url":"/free-accounting-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-27T15:31:04Z","datePublished":"2016-10-27T15:31:04Z","name":"Why Pay If It's Free?
