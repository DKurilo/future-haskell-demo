This audio is designed to sound realistic, with the aim to bring the listener the same feeling as being in a live performance or show.","For the big movie buffs, there is an option to upgrade the PC and add a Blu-ray player. However, the PC does come with an HDMI-in port, so you can also connect your external Blu-ray player to the PC if you prefer.
