We found some of the best models out there and compared their features and specs. We also read articles and user reviews to learn about common complaints as well as features that stand out as the most important for our readers. This type of appliance tends to get mixed reviews – the wash cycles are generally better than the dry cycles, but that varies from machine to machine.","In addition, we’ve reviewed a variety of <a href=\"/best-washers-review\">washing machines</a> and <a href=\"/best-dryers\">dryers</a> for more than seven years. These include <a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">portable washers</a>, <a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">top-load washers</a>, <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-load washers</a> and clothes dryers. When we research these appliances, we often visit stores like Lowe’s and Home Depot to get a feel for how they work, to test their capacities and to talk to store reps to get their opinions. We don’t test big machines like washer dryers in our lab, but we research them online and get as much firsthand experience as we can.","We also spoke to industry experts, including Atul Vir. Vir is the founder and president of Equator Advanced Appliances, which is associated with multiple brands that make washer dryer combos, including Deco. He&#39;s been questioning the need for a separate washer and dryer since the early days of his marriage, decades ago. The family&#39;s laundry routine involved going to the laundromat and waiting for the washer to finish and then switching clothes over to the dryer. The whole process took hours.","&#34;It seemed like that was the weekend activity and it didn&#39;t seem very interesting,&#34; Vir said.","When that routine prevented them from going to the beach as a family one too many times, he decided he wanted to bring washer dryer combos to the United States. He lived in Europe before and had gotten used to not babysitting each load – waiting to change from washer to dryer. Washer dryer combos also require less space, so apartment dwellers can have their own laundry facilities and skip the laundromat.","Those benefits have helped him build quite the empire over the years, but he recognizes that not everyone is convinced. Part of the problem is most combos are small, designed to fit in tiny closets. Some folks need to do big loads. It&#39;s also a matter of habit – most Americans were raised with a separate washer and dryer, and the need is not as great for a compact appliance.","&#34;There are laundry rooms in most single-family homes, so it&#39;s not a space requirement,&#34; Vir said.","Washer dryer combinations also have a bad reputation for taking a long time and wrinkling clothes during the drying cycle. Even the best machines still struggle with that.","&#34;With our 28-year history it&#39;s a process and we keep learning. There&#39;s new technologies coming all the time,&#34; he said.","Vir said digital controls have made things much more convenient and engineers are working all the time to make other improvements to the washer dryer combo concept, including making them more intuitive in general and better at drying.","<strong>How Much Does a Washer Dryer Combo Cost?</strong>","The average price of the most popular washer dryer combos on the market is right around $1,300. Specifically, the average of the five best sellers on Home Depot, Best Buy and Lowe&#39;s was $1,356. The ones we reviewed had an average price of $1,238 and ranged between $600 and $2,000. That sounds like a lot until you realize you get two appliances in one, and if you are limited on laundry space that investment can still make a lot of sense. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We researched for more than 120 hours to find and compare the best washer dryer combos out there. We looked at specs pages to compare features and determined which are most important for consumers. In each of our reviews, we highlight the washer dryer’s strengths and weaknesses.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a Washer Dryer Combo</strong>","Functionality<br/>In general, washer dryer combos have capacities of around 2 cubic feet. That’s enough space to wash and dry about 8 pounds of laundry. We looked for machines with bigger drums, since they allow you to wash fewer loads and use less energy over time.","As you compare machines, look for one with multiple water temperature, soil level, wash cycle and dry cycle setting options. ","Washer &amp; Dryer Cycles<br/>The best washer dryer combos have many cycle settings and clean your clothes without damaging them. For example, they have settings for delicate fabrics and for washing colors that run.","Machines should also fully dry items of all kinds, even jeans and bulky towels. Some washer dryer combos only have one or two dryer settings, while others let you set the temperature, which is useful when you need to dry delicate fabrics.","Additional Features<br/>All the washer dryer combos we compared have automatic dispensers that release detergent at the right time during the wash cycle. Most also include a lock that protects your children and the machine during a cycle. In addition, they usually have a digital display that shows what is happening during a cycle.","Features like an automatic load sensor, which fills the drum with the right amount of water based on load size, are less common. This is a nice energy-saving feature, and machines that have it scored better in our review.","<strong>How Does a Washer Dryer Combo Work?</strong>","Although washer dryer combos may look like regular washers or dryers, these machines work rather differently. First, washer dryer combos do not need a dryer vent, because they use condensation drying. This means that, instead of expelling heat through a vent, they use heat to filter through the load before it passes through a heat exchanger that helps to cool the air and collects any vapor in a tank. Unlike regular washers and dryers, the combo units use the standard 110-volt power, so you don’t need to plug them into a special outlet. Washer dryer combos are typically much smaller than regular washers and dryers, are relatively lightweight and often have wheels so that you can push them around your home. This portability is one of the reasons these combo units are so popular in apartments and other small living spaces. Although they often take longer to complete the washing-and-drying process, they’re great for people who have limited space.","<strong>More Laundry Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"34bdef6e-45d1-4448-b83a-132a501126a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-washers-review\">The Best Washing Machines Overall</a>","<a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">The Best Top-Load Washers</a>","<a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">The Best Front-Load Washers</a>","<a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">The Best Portable Washers</a>","<a href=\"/best-dryers\">The Best Clothes Dryers</a>","<a href=\"/best-irons\">The Best Steam Irons</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e4b656f2-1187-436a-b2b4-3ebc43155318","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"cbcbcff9-9d46-4499-9ae0-9d0899708661","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/haier-hlc1700axs-review\">Haier HLC1700AXS</a>","<a href=\"/magic-chef-review\">Magic Chef MCSCWD20W3</a>","<a href=\"/midea-review\">Midea US-FC70-DS12DSH</a>","<a href=\"/haier-review\">Haier HLC1700AXW</a>","<a href=\"/lg-wm3488hs-review\">LG WM3488HS</a>","<a href=\"/summit-review\">Summit SPWD2200W</a>","<a href=\"/splendide-review\">Splendide 2100XC</a>","<a href=\"/lg-review\">LG WM3997HWA</a>","<a href=\"/deco-review\">Deco DC 4000 CV </a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"dc5e1176-9626-43a3-a263-7187d9506e6c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_37","url":"/best-washer-dryer-combos","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angela-parkinson","url":"/author/angela-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Angela Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4mNVTVXMirWtTXf6QMhCjd","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-16T19:31:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-16T19:31:00Z","name":"Best Washer Dryer Combos of 2019","synopsis":"We favored washer-dryer combos with larger drums: A few extra cubic inches means fewer loads, and less electricity and water wasted.","review":{},"strapline":"We favored washer-dryer combos with larger drums: A few extra cubic inches means fewer loads, and less electricity and water wasted.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-19T21:28:03Z","id":"9y9UC6GmMEfJWy6wVLR893","meta":{"title":"Best Washer-Dryer Combos 2019 -
