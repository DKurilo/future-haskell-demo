The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/software/multimedia/best-cad-software/\">CAD Software</a> here.</em>","DeltaCAD is by the far the most rudimentary application in our lineup of CAD software. The software claims to be the world’s easiest CAD application, an assertion that isn’t difficult to attain considering the software’s limited functionality. While its restricted functionality is definitely a drawback, it’s also beneficial in the sense that it makes the software an ideal starter application for beginners.","The software is a bit light when it comes to features, lacking custom tool palettes, a point marker tool and a command history that details all the previous changes made to a design. It does offer simple text editing and allows you to calculate the length and area of an object. The CAD software also contains a basic macro programming language that allows you to create your own macro commands.","DeltaCAD can be used for a wide range of projects, from designing house and landscape plans to mechanical components. However, you’re limited to two-dimensional designs since the CAD software doesn’t offer any 3D modeling – hardly surprising given the software’s so basic to begin with.","The computer aided software allows you to draw arcs, circles, lines, points and other shapes, and you can create and save your own symbols to use in your designs. There are also elementary snap tools and a color editor that allows you to add color to your designs. You can also display bitmaps (images) in the designs. Beyond that, the CAD software doesn’t offer much. There aren’t any transparency options, photorealistic rendering, textures or animations.","When it comes to file compatibility, the CAD software only imports and exports DWG, DXF and DXB (another drawing interchange binary format) files. While it doesn’t export bitmaps (BMP), as mentioned above, you can import them for display in designs.","The software’s ease of use is a direct result of its watered-down functionality. The user interface has a single navigation bar and a row of feature tabs that can be selected to access the software’s different features. We had no issues finding our way around the CAD software. If we were unsure of what a particular feature icon was, we simply hovered over it and its name would appear. Further enhancing the software’s ease of use is its built-in help section that can be searched by keyword.","Aside from its supplementary help section, help and support options are virtually non-existent. There’s no standard help guide, tutorials, training videos or an online FAQs section. The only options offered include a short section with troubleshooting tips and an online contact form to contact the company. The application should be easy enough to use that most, if not all, users won’t need any direct technical assistance."]},"id":"d808ee2f-e7d4-4b70-bf70-d4b7cc38984a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f653c635-7c4a-4dd9-8200-4267ab353001","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its extremely limited functionality and absent support options, DeltaCAD isn’t likely to appeal to very many users.
