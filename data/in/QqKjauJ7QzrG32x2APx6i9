The teaching method is detailed, helping you to learn several theoretical principles behind music and the guitar, which makes it a great option if you&#39;re a beginner guitarist. After a few lessons, you&#39;ll start learning skills like improvisation and scales. However, the program lacks the practice tools that we look for, and with only 31 lessons, you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere for more advanced techniques.","This guitar learning software covers a few basic subjects to help you get familiar with your guitar. You&#39;ll learn how to string a guitar, count time and read tablatures. The program teaches chords, rhythm and scales, all of which are crucial for any beginning guitar player. While most of the lessons cover basics, this guitar software also helps you learn how to improvise. Improvisation combines the knowledge of musical theory with the feel of other musicians, so with this skill, you can sit in on jam sessions, confident that you&#39;ll be able to keep up with the rest of the group.","As interesting as the lessons are, D&#39;Accord Guitar Method doesn&#39;t have any of the practice tools we look for, including tempo adjustment, interactivity or music tracking. Fortunately, there are audio samples with most lessons. The guitar software also uses cartoons as a visual aid, but these aren&#39;t as helpful as video of an actual guitarist would be.","This is among the technically clumsiest programs we tested. The version we downloaded came with lots of spamware, and after installing the guitar software, we were inundated with ads and had to deal with crashing windows. You can uninstall all of the spamware without losing any of the guitar lesson content, but it&#39;s bothersome that this software comes with so much junk.","In case you have any issues while you&#39;re using the website, it has a FAQs section. You can contact customer support by phone and email."]},"id":"e76502fc-01be-4818-b0a8-53a8e5f8ec56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"68cc7937-ca89-44fa-8e83-c4f211a1f93b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["D&#39;Accord Guitar Method is basic guitar lesson software with some interesting elements, particularly its ability to teach you how to improvise with your guitar.
