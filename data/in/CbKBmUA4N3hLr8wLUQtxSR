Over the years, we’ve researched and evaluated dozens of programs, compared their features, inspected their interfaces and workflows, and conducted hands-on testing to determine which one is the best.","Our team of reviewers used each program’s editing tools, effects and export options to create identical test DVDs. They timed how long it took to burn a new DVD, complete with menus and chapters when possible. Our video experts then played the new DVDs on a large-screen television and searched for imperfections such as compression artifact, motion blur and interlacing issues. The results of these tests, as well as our reviewers’ personal experiences using each program, were used to decide the programs’ final scores and ranks. All our tests were designed to replicate the experience of an average user as well as a veteran editor. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We subjected each DVD authoring program to a battery of tests to determine which applications are the best. During these tests, we evaluated the software’s interface, video editing features, and whether we could successfully build DVD menus and burn the videos onto discs.","Usability Tests<br/>All the applications we reviewed fulfill the same basic need; however, they differ greatly in their interface layouts, workflows and toolsets. In our tests, we assessed how easy each program is to learn and use. We also tracked how hard the application makes it to perform common tasks like editing video footage; adding effects, transitions and titles; picking menu templates; customizing projects; and burning finished DVDs. We found that all the programs are relatively easy to use once you know your way around the interface, although some were much more straightforward than others.","Timed Tests<br/>In our tests, we timed how long it took to install each application, import and organize video files, build a test video and menu, burn a disc, and more. We found that programs that take even a few minutes longer than other applications to complete simple tasks can end up adding hours to the total process. The best DVD authoring programs run fast and save that extra time you would otherwise spend babysitting a progress bar.","Quality Tests<br/>There is one major hang-up with DVD authoring software: DVDs were invented before the advent of high-definition video. As such, they can only display standard-def footage. Since most videos are now shot in HD quality, your DVD authoring program has to compress the footage before it can burn it to a disc. This compression resulted in significant quality loss in each of the products we reviewed.","Our video experts examined each of the test DVDs, looking for imperfections in the picture such as pixelation, compression artifact, general distortion and interlacing issues. While no program performed perfectly, the best ones minimized the quality loss caused by compression.  At the end of our evaluation, we gave each program a quality grade from A to F. <br/><br/>How Much Does DVD Authoring Software Cost?<br/>Depending on the product you pick, you can expect to pay $35 to $100 on DVD authoring software. But the best software is not necessarily the most expensive,  If you don’t plan to use all the advanced features you can opt for lower-tiered versions of the software we review, which cost less.","<strong>Key Attributes</strong>","Editing Tools<br/>The best DVD creator software should also have all the qualities of a top-notch <a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">video editing program</a>. There are DVD creators that focus solely on authoring and have few or no editing tools. If you just want to burn finished videos to DVDs, you may want to look into one of these applications. However, if you’re building your own creation from scratch, it’s best to buy an authoring program that has a robust set of video-editing features.","Extras<br/>All the products we reviewed can burn home movies to discs, but the best ones also allow you to add small but important features found in commercially produced DVDs. For instance, chapter breaks, surround sound and attractive menus elevate your work from good enough to excellent.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Building a DVD from the ground up can be difficult and time-consuming, and the best DVD creators makes it as easy as possible to use their features and tools. Some programs build tutorials directly into their interfaces, while others have free lessons, guides and forums on their official websites.  Additionally, many of the programs we reviewed have free trials, which you can use to determine if the application suits your needs before you pay.  ","<strong>Best DVD Authoring Software for Mac</strong>","It’s becoming increasingly difficult to use Macintosh computers to author optical media like CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs. That&#39;s because Apple has steadily eliminated the technology from their machines. It’s been years since any new Mac had a built-in optical drive, which you need to burn and play DVDs. So, you’ll have to take the extra expense of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cocopa-External-Portable-Rewriter-Windows10/dp/B07G54S9J8/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">buying an external drive</a>.","In addition to an optical drive, you’ll need DVD burning software that’s compatible with a Mac. Some of the Windows applications we reviewed, such as <a href=\"/adobe-premiere-elements-review\">Adobe Premiere Elements</a> and <a href=\"/wondershare-review\">Wondershare Filmora</a>, have Mac versions. However, their authoring capabilities are limited compared to our best overall pick, <a href=\"/cyberlink-powerdirector-review\">Cyberlink PowerDirector</a>, which does not have a Mac version.","The program we recommend for Mac DVD authoring is <a href=\"https://secure.2checkout.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=AISESFT&amp;AFFILIATE=1896&amp;PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aiseesoft.com%2Fdvd-creator-for-mac%2F%3FAFFILIATE%3D1896&amp;AFFSRC=DVD+Authoring\">Aiseesoft DVD Creator for Mac</a>. Unlike most of the Windows products we reviewed, this program focuses exclusively on DVD authoring, with limited video editing capabilities. You won’t find a timeline or a storyboard to craft video projects on, so you’ll have to edit your videos in another program like iMovie or <a href=\"/final-cut-pro-review\">Final Cut Pro</a>. Or you can use <a href=\"https://secure.2checkout.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=AISESFT&amp;AFFILIATE=1896&amp;PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aiseesoft.com%2Fvideo-editor%2F%3FAFFILIATE%3D1896&amp;AFFSRC=DVD+Authoring\">Aiseesoft’s free video editor</a>.","Aiseesoft DVD Creator for Mac is straightforward and easy to use, even your first time around. If you have your videos ready to go, all you need to do is drag and drop them into their appropriate place in the application. Creating menus and chapter divisions and adding extra features takes only a few minutes. Once you’re done, you’ll have a DVD with your own content that you can use in any DVD player just like a disc you bought at the store.","<strong>Fastest DVD Authoring Software</strong><br/>","When we tested the best DVD authoring software, we timed how long it took each program to create a new copy of our test disc. We found you can expect it to take between 30 min and an hour to burn a disc. PowerDirector, Pinnacle Studio and VideoPad were the fastest – each created the new disk in 25 minutes. Adobe Premiere Elements took 60 minutes to burn the disk, which was the slowest time by a good margin. The second slowest software was Nero Video, which took 45 minutes. The rest of the programs fell in the middle ground, usually taking between 30 and 40 minutes each. The overall category average was 34 minutes.","We also timed how long it took us to create the test disc with each program. In this test, Corel VideoStudio and Wondershare Filmora were the fastest at just five minutes each. Nero Video had the slowest time in this test, taking 40 minutes. The category average was 16 minutes.","Most of the programs we reviewed can create an ISO files, which is basically a DVD&#39;s blueprint – with it, you can make new copies whenever you need them. You can also play this type of file on your computer with DVD player software. Wondershare Filmora was the fastest at creating ISO files, taking just 15 minutes. VideoStudio took 28 minutes to create an ISO file, making it the slowest program in this test. The average across the category was 22 minutes."]},"id":"ff3ee0ab-2f4d-451c-af5b-76403c374333","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_255","url":"/best-dvd-authoring-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
