It directs you through the process of creating a movie, but it gives you few options for customizing your film. This video editing software comes with 26 filters. The advanced editing tools on this application include multi-trim, subtitles, export selected clips and create menu. These are all basic tools that you&#39;ll find in most of the other products we reviewed.","The tools for editing videos are limited in this application. You can clone, multi-trim, fade in and out, set mark in and out points, and split video. DVD MovieFactory also allows you to add text and voice recordings. This video editing application comes with some audio files in its library and allows you to import your own audio. You can also add filters to your movie. You can create custom and multilayer menus, divide your movies into chapters, and add music to the menus. If you want additional template options, you can download more through the application.","You can capture media from your computer or other devices such as miniDV, DVD and HDV, or you can import files from your computer. When it comes to exporting, the software supports AVCHD, DVD, Blu-ray, WMV, MOV, AVI, ASF, MPG, SVCD, VD, Video CD, Super Video DV, DV/Micro-DV and RealVideo. You can also upload your videos to YouTube.","When you edit video, you&#39;ll find that some aspects of this application are straightforward; however, other parts are unnecessarily complex. Some of the navigation needs better labeling. You will probably find it useful to consult the manual or customer service if you run into problems when using this video editing software.","Corel has email and phone information for technical support on its homepage. You can find a small amount of information in the FAQs and user forum regarding video editing software; however, most of the support seems to be for Corel&#39;s other products."]},"id":"b8099f7d-41af-48da-b56d-f8b382050ddc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97f1dbeb-5b93-4af0-8cd1-5a5a59c9a13a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, Corel DVD MovieFactory Pro has few editing tools.
