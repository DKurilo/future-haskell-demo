However, in the world of printers they have not always been the most well known brand. One thing that is said across the board by the majority of Canon owners is that the quality of their printers keeps them coming back for more, as new models come out. The Canon Pixma MX860 combines the quality and design of some of the other Canon models into an <a href=\"/best-all-in-one-printers\">all-in-one printer</a> that truly can do it all and then some. With a large 2.5 inch LCD screen picking and choosing what you want this printer to do is very user friendly. The Canon Pixma MX860 came in behind our No.1 pick the Canon Pixma MX870 simply because it offers a slightly better color print speed and is compatible with more memory cards. However, with its color resolution of 9300 x 2400 it definitely comes in ahead of our No.3 pick the HP OfficeJet Pro 8500."]},"id":"24ff4c1b-b18f-492f-82ab-04a768d227ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output Quality"},"id":"3b2ec8dc-cb0d-44b9-ba7e-ac14de09c881","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon Pixma MX860 is a powerful all-in-one printer that delivers outstanding 9600 x 2400 maximum color dpi with 1pl and 5 individual ink cartridges for ultimate color.
