It’s one of our favorites because its performance remains consistent over time. While the Panasonic Arc5 is newer, the Arc4 is more affordable.","The Arc4 uses a dual-blade cutting system with an outer foil and inner blades to provide a clean shave. It has an easy-to-grip ergonomic design that includes a switch-lock button as well as a pop-up trimmer for grooming facial hair and sideburns.","One of this shaver’s drawbacks is it can be expensive to replace its blades. The Arc4’s outer foil costs much more than the foil on the <a href=\"/wahl-bump-free-review\">Wahl Bump Free Shaver</a>, and it’s recommended you replace it annually. The inner blade needs attention less often – you only need to replace it every two years.","You can shave both wet and dry with the Arc4, and it’s waterproof for cordless use in the shower. Unlike <a href=\"/bald-eagle-smart-g-review\">Skull Shaver’s Bald Eagle</a> and Pitbull products we tested, the Arc4 works well with both shaving foam and gel. Gel can clog the Skull Shavers’ blades.","To clean the Arc4, you just wipe it down with a damp cloth or rinse it under running water during use. It also has a sonic vibration cleaning mode, and there’s a cleaning reminder on its handle.","This model’s LCD display has a 10-stage battery status indicator to let you know when it’s time to recharge. Just one hour of charge time gives you up to 45 minutes of use, or up to 14 three-minute shaves. This is much better than the <a href=\"/turnraise-review\">TurnRaise Bald Head Shaver’s</a> ratio – it requires 12 hours of charging for 50 minutes of shave time.","The Arc4 comes with a zippered storage case, a charging cord and a blade guard. With worldwide voltage adaptation, it’s well-suited for international travel.","Panasonic warranties this shaver for two years and provides customer service via phone, email and live chat. If you’re new to electric shavers, Panasonic recommends giving yourself about three weeks of use to adjust to any new method of shaving."]},"id":"cf1e9545-8d4e-4d8c-98e6-060d10080470","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69956","url":"/panasonic-arc-4-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-17T15:59:37Z","datePublished":"2018-05-17T15:59:37Z","name":"Panasonic Arc 4 ES-LA63-S","synopsis":"We’ve ranked the Panasonic Arc4 ES-LA63-S among the top 10 electric head shavers in several updates of our comparison.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"The Panasonic Arc4 isn&#8217;t the newest model in the Arc line of shavers, but it&#8217;s a consistent, solid performer.
