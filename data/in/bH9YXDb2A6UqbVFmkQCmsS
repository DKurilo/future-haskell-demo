You can email support personnel, but there is no live chat or phone number for you to utilize as the company is based in Japan.

It has many tools and effects to foster your creativity, including brushes, vectors and raster tools. It also lets you edit in layers. You can use predesigned page and character layouts or pose 3D models if your imagination hits a roadblock or if you simply want to make comics faster.
