It took us 12.3 minutes to cook the patties, which is about a minute over the average of the grills we tested. The pineapple rings we cooked turned out beautifully. We got fine results when we lined the grill surface with white bread slices, which showed even heat distribution.

The reversible metal plates feature a grill on one side and a flat griddle on the other, so you can mix and match to cook different foods simultaneously. You also get separate heat controls for each half of the machine, which gives you the option of cooking many more varieties of foods at once than a typical grill. The grill plates and drip tray can go in the dishwasher. We washed them by hand, as well as wiping the rest of the machine, and it took 6:07 minutes, which is less than the average time for cleaning the grills we tested.

This grill comes with a removable metal hinged cover, so you can cut down on any grease that might mess up your countertop.

Most smoke is mitigated by water you add to a tray on the bottom. Unfortunately, this grill released some poufs of smoke from either side of the lid when cooking hamburger, which contains more fat than our other test foods.

Reducing or eliminating cooking fumes also can be beneficial for your overall health.","The airborne pollutants from cooking, mainly with gas but also with electrically produced heat, can be harmful to your health, according to several studies. The online British newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cooking-with-gas-raises-risk-of-lung-cancer-1903000.html\">Independent</a>, reported: “Cooking fumes produced during high-temperature frying are already known to cause cancer. In China, high lung cancer rates among chefs have been linked to the practice of tossing food in a wok, often in a confined space, which increases the concentration of hot oil in the breathing zone of the cook.”","Other studies show cooking fumes create high levels of particulates whose safety thresholds have not been established, but are suspected of being linked to a variety of illnesses. Although nothing conclusive has been established in these studies so far, it’s clear that cutting down on smoke and fumes in your home is a sensible idea.","Avoiding as much smoke as possible during cooking also makes your home easier to clean. Smoke residue can create messes on ceilings, walls and other surfaces that can require plenty of work to remove. “The hardest thing about cleaning smoke from walls is the sticky residue it leaves behind. You can wear yourself out scrubbing smoke residue from walls once it&#39;s caked on,” Laurie Brenner writes in the online publication <a href=\"https://www.hunker.com/12130430/how-to-clean-smoke-off-the-walls\">Hunker</a>.","<strong>How Do Smokeless Electric Grills Work?</strong>","You may wonder what makes a smokeless indoor grill smokeless. We were curious, too, and as we tested and cleaned the 10 grills we ordered, we noticed some common designs for minimizing smoke. First and foremost, most have a pan of some sort that you fill to a designated level with water. The fat and grease that would normally fall through to the bottom of the grill or on top of heating elements falls into the water and is trapped, keeping it from being burned and turned into smoke. A rather simple but effective method of controlling the amount of smoke your grill produces.","The other styles of smokeless grills that we tested had solid grilling surfaces, much like a Foreman Grill. These grills either had a cover like a skillet to keep the smoke from escaping or had taller grill ribbing to expedite grease drainage. Our testers were amazed at how much less smoke these kitchen devices produced, much less than their regular electric grill counterparts.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","After reading and researching grills, we purchased 10 popular countertop electric grills, washed all applicable surfaces and read their instruction manuals. With our own testing methodology, we cooked chicken tenders and hamburger patties on each to see how every model performed. We chose those meats since our research indicates they are the most popular types to cook on grills. We then tried cooking pineapple rings to determine how each grill handled a non-meat food. We also lined each grill with white bread slices to see how uniform the heat levels were throughout the grill top, and to see if there were hot or cold spots."]},"id":"37a341db-3f59-41b7-ba4a-e4b9f85080d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Le44o8mKFTbdEBAfuhNi3G.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/smokeless-indoor-grills/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9SL0ovODA3MTAzL29yaWdpbmFsL0luZG9vci1HcmlsbHMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDQuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Le44o8mKFTbdEBAfuhNi3G.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Le44o8mKFTbdEBAfuhNi3G","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Le44o8mKFTbdEBAfuhNi3G.jpg","alt":""},"id":"6d301846-51c4-4e51-bfeb-c0a815590941","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/wAExecXgHkY28dMVqkzpcK.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/smokeless-indoor-grills/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9SL0gvODA3MTAxL29yaWdpbmFsL0luZG9vci1HcmlsbHMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDMuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wAExecXgHkY28dMVqkzpcK.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"wAExecXgHkY28dMVqkzpcK","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wAExecXgHkY28dMVqkzpcK.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d9dad757-a682-40fc-82ac-ef612309e023","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With the help of other enthusiastic cooks, we evaluated each grill and had them serve as taste testers to score and rank the foods as we cooked them. We added the admittedly subjective taste test results to our quantifiable data and then decided which models were best.<br/><strong><br/>How Much Do Smokeless Indoor Grills Cost?</strong>","Smokeless grills vary dramatically in price. You can get a perfectly fine grill for about $50, while the most expensive one we examined cost close to $280. There are excellent grills on the market in between those two prices, depending on what features you’re looking for and which brand you choose.","<strong>Results of the Rest</strong>","We encountered mixed results with the other five indoor smokeless grills we tested:"]},"id":"5ddee45f-25d2-4919-941b-1226948c47d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/8EUByZrqQiqY5tD4t7geMc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Hamilton Beach 3-In-1 Multi-Grill","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/smokeless-indoor-grills/w/195/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9TL0QvODA3MTMzL29yaWdpbmFsL0luZG9vci1HcmlsbHMtSGFtaWx0b24tQmVhY2gtMy1pbi0xLU11bHRpLUdyaWxsLTAwMS5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8EUByZrqQiqY5tD4t7geMc.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"8EUByZrqQiqY5tD4t7geMc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8EUByZrqQiqY5tD4t7geMc.jpg","alt":"Hamilton Beach 3-In-1 Multi-Grill"},"id":"0fa2dc3f-5379-4a1f-9bd9-2eb58d0a8848","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beach-25600-Electric-Smokeless-Removable/dp/B0179WV3HK/ref=sr_1_9?&amp;tag=ttr_smokeless-indoor-grills-20\">Hamilton Beach 3-In-1 Multi-Grill</a> showed even heat and it cooked food well as far as doneness and taste.
