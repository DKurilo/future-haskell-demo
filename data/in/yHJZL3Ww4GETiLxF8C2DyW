Not only do Nvidia and AMD have different tiers of video cards, other manufacturers can modify those cards. This means there can be a large difference in power consumption, noise and even performance between versions of the same card when they&#39;re built by different manufacturers.","When a new video card comes out, Nvidia and AMD release their plans, and this is what&#39;s referred to as a reference, or stock, video card. Third-party manufacturers like ASUS and Sapphire can negotiate with Nvidia and AMD to produce their own versions of those cards. Take, for example, the relatively new Nvidia GTX 970. Nvidia bases its specifications on the reference model, but the ASUS-built card differs from those specs.","Companies like EVGA and PowerColor can make extensive modifications to reference video cards, but they can&#39;t change the GPU itself. EVGA&#39;s GTX 970 has the same number of CUDA cores as Nvidia&#39;s reference model, 1,665. What EVGA can change is the card&#39;s clock speeds, power draw, amount of RAM and cooling solutions. These can all affect a card&#39;s performance in significant ways, but it&#39;s rare for a third-party manufacturer to produce a video card that completely outclasses its reference model.","<strong></strong>"]},"id":"2633d85f-4cdb-47e6-80d5-33d74639613c","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AMD R9 290X is also a great video card. The reference version runs fairly hot and loud, so having third-party manufacturers is really good for this card. In most cases, 290Xs from Sapphire, ASUS and PowerColor run much cooler and more quietly than the reference model. At least seven different manufacturers produce different versions of the 290X, so there are a lot of choices.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>","<strong> The Manufacturers:</strong><br/>So, which manufacturers are the best? That largely depends on what you want out of your video card and to what lengths you&#39;re willing to go to get it. You also need to consider cost. An R9 290X with a higher clock speed will perform better, but the manufacturer is going to raise the price. Most third-party cards are clocked at higher speeds than the reference models, which means that they&#39;re likely to sell for more than the reference model&#39;s MSRP. A good cooling system can make a world of difference for a video card. The best manufacturers find a way to balance all of these factors.","Some manufacturers come out on top in regards to product quality, warranty and extras. EVGA, Sapphire, ASUS, XFX, MSI and GIGABYTE are all excellent manufacturers that consistently sell top-quality products. Many other manufacturers sell good video cards, but they don&#39;t quite measure up to those top manufacturers. However, quality varies from one video card to another. Always check out reviews for a specific manufacturer&#39;s card to see how well it holds up.","<strong>What It Means:</strong><br/>Buying a video card is complicated. Now that you have a basic understanding of how the industry works, this is what you need to know for purchasing decisions: clock speed, amount of RAM, manufacturer reputation and price. If price is your main concern, then the $330 GTX 970 will probably work almost as well as the $400 GTX 970. But you might not get the best warranty or cooler for your video card.","Don&#39;t let the complexity of the graphics card market scare you. Once you know that all of the R9 290X video card variations are the same GPU with add-ons like better cooling solutions, then making a decision becomes fairly easy. While the video card industry can be daunting for first-time builders, it gives you many choices to find the best video card for your specific needs   which is a very good thing."]},"id":"8e3d8469-6968-494c-bc89-67633d7347c4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9079","url":"/first-time-builder-an-introduction-to-asus-msi-and-other-video-card-manufacturers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kyle-rollins","url":"/author/kyle-rollins","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kyle Rollins","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"GdUbdwhSh8EfhiDybZ79To","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-01-26T17:48:14Z","datePublished":"2015-01-26T17:48:14Z","name":"First-Time Builder: An Introduction to ASUS, MSI and Other Video Card Manufacturers","synopsis":"The world of PC video cards can be quite confusing and intimidating, especially for first-time builders.","review":{},"strapline":"The world of PC video cards can be quite confusing and intimidating, especially for first-time builders.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-01-26T18:21:45Z","id":"yHJZL3Ww4GETiLxF8C2DyW","meta":{"title":"First-Time Builder: An Introduction to ASUS, MSI and Other Video Card Manufacturers","description":"Don&#039;t let the complexity of the video card industry scare you away.
