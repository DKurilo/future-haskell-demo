The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">Aunt Farms</a> here.</em>","The Fascinations AntWorks Colors of Life ant habitat clearly lives up to its name. It is a gel-filled ant farm lit from beneath using an LED illuminator with four lights. You can set it to shine the various colors up through the ant farm, giving different looks to the ant environment that keep changing one at a time for a fun effect. If you want a particular hue to linger, you just touch a small sensor on the bottom and that color will stay in place.","Armed with these colorful alternating lighting effects, this is an attractive ant farm that will no doubt brighten any office cubicle, classroom or even serve as a novel nightlight for a child. There is a drawback, however, since this is a gel-filled ant farm, which means children will not need to do much of anything to take care of the ants once they are placed inside. This lack of engagement with the toy diminishes its educational and play value.","When you get this kit, there are instructions and an ant tunnel tool included inside. You use the tool to create holes in the gel that serve as starter tunnels for the ants, who initially might need a bit of an incentive to start digging away in their new environment. You also get a written informational manual.","Unfortunately, there are not any other learning tools that come with this gel ant farm. For the purposes of instructing children and keeping them busy playing with the ant farm, it would be nice to have some other tools included with this device such as a magnifying glass, specimen tray or specimen chart.","As with most ant farms, live ants do not come with this kit. However, you do not get free ants using a mail-in certificate. Instead, Fascinations&#39; website offers links to three online stores that you can use to buy ants.","You will receive these through the mail, but it is not uncommon to encounter delays since ants cannot be shipped in really hot or really cold weather because it will kill them.","You also can opt to buy ants from another online source, if you choose. Some stores offer free replacement ants if your first shipment arrives with all the ants dead, but that is not necessarily the policy of every store so you need to read their websites to find out if you get any replacement ants or not.","You also can go outdoors and catch your own for free. As long as these are larger than the air holes in the ant farm so they can&#39;t escape, they can try out this living environment. Avoid mixing ants of different species or colonies because they do not coexist well.","The gel used in this ant habitat was created as part of an experiment involving high school students and individuals at Syracuse University. It became the living environment for ants that got to fly in 2003 inside NASA&#39;s space shuttle Columbia.","This material is made from seaweed and contains water, sugars and amino acids along with a fungicide that prevents it from decomposing, which otherwise would happen in the wet atmosphere inside the acrylic container.","The gel works nicely for the ants since it is not only their source of food and water, but also provides them with a place to live and carry out their busy lives. The gel is not toxic for humans, but the manufacturer warns that no one should try to eat it.","Like most manufacturers of gel ant farms, Fascinations does not sell refill gel. However, you can find online stores that will sell this gel. Just know there&#39;s no guarantee your ants will like any new gel or will even live once inside.","The antquarium that actually holds the ants is a clear acrylic habitat that curves a bit and looks rather like an arc. This ant habitat stands 6.5 inches high and is 6 inches wide and 1.25 inches deep. It weighs 2.3 pounds.","Fascinations provides email support and quite helpful phone support should you run into any questions about your ant habitat."]},"id":"d900d37e-f7cd-4059-a58c-92761c3fefbf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7660a20c-9623-4b24-8b3c-404edacffde3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While this ant habitat is really quite pretty with its ever-changing rainbow look, it offers little in the way of play value or educational value for children since they do not have to do very much to keep the ants alive."]},"id":"7dd74643-8793-4a58-8c91-2ecdc811ecd9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55335","url":"/ant-factory-by-the-scholastic-store-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-07T15:23:48Z","datePublished":"2012-11-07T15:23:48Z","name":"Fascinations AntWorks Colors of Life","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
