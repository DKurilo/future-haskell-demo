You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Waring WPM10 Popcorn Maker uses a relatively small amount of oil to produce 20 cups of fluffy popcorn. This unique <a href=\"/best-popcorn-makers\">popcorn maker</a> works using an electrically powered halogen heater and automatic stirring rod.","In our tests, we used only 2/3 of a cup of kernels, and the result was a full 20 cups of popped corn. There were no burnt kernels. However, as soon as the popping slows, you would be wise to quickly flip over this popcorn popper to get the kernels away from the heating mechanism to avoid any hot steam when releasing the popcorn or you could get burned.","The popcorn tastes wonderful, although you do end up with a half-teaspoon of unpopped kernels, according to our testing. This hot oil popcorn popper comes with an on-off switch, which means you can avoid reaching past a hot popper to unplug the device to get it to turn off. This is a great safety feature in a home popcorn maker.","There are some puzzling missing pieces to this otherwise solid popcorn maker. Unlike the best popcorn poppers – and even some of the really low-priced ones – this unit does not come with a measuring cup. While this is not a make-or-break extra, it does come in handy, especially for students, newlyweds and others with few kitchen implements. If you really want a helpful measuring cup exclusively for your popcorn maker, check out the <a href=\"/cuisinart-cpm-700-easypop-review\">Cuisinart CPM-700 EasyPop Popcorn Maker</a>.","The Waring website offers no recipes for flavoring traditional popcorn and turning it into something really festive or out of the ordinary. The removable parts are not dishwasher safe, although it does not take much time to hand-wash them with soap and water. In addition, the plastic parts of the machine are not free from BPA, which the FDA has said is safe in low quantities but which worries some consumers.","A strong point in this popcorn popper&#39;s favor is its warranty, which outdoes the very best popcorn makers in our lineup. The warranty extends for a stunning five years, which is out of the ordinary in the popcorn maker world. You also get a user manual with this device, and if you have problems, you can contact the company through email or phone support. The website does not have a FAQs section or demonstration videos."]},"id":"f3a20212-aafe-44b5-b4b2-833b5fe7ae9e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"192f5531-b672-4d45-b8fa-141828ca5da2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Waring WPM10 is a nicely functional popcorn maker that produces good-tasting popcorn and offers an excellent warranty.
