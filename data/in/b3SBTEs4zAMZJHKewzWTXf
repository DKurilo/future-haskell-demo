also known as Pro/Engineer or Pro E, is an advanced <a href=\"/best-cad-software\">CAD software</a> that allows you to create complex designs and simulations. This software isn’t as easy to learn as others in our comparison, but it provides some of the most powerful results, and it has a wide feature set that is best suited for high-tech designs. The 3D rendering abilities look very realistic, so your clients can really visualize your designs. There’s also plenty of help on PTC’s knowledgebase and from the user-created tutorials you can find online. If it didn&#39;t cost so much, it would have scored higher in our comparison.","If you want to purchase this software, you will need to request a quote by filling out the form on PTC’s website or by contacting a sales rep through email. This software is one of the more expensive options on the market but the exact price will depend on how you plan to use it. You can test the software by downloading the free, 30-day trial. Note that Creo’s technical support is subscription based, so you will need to pay additional money if you want access to it.","Should you need help, you can contact the company via email but there is no phone number. You can also find a decent number of video tutorials both on PTC’s website and on YouTube. As stated previously, technical support is limited and requires you to pay for a subscription if you plan on using it long term. However, you can also get help from other users through the official community forum. ","PTC also offers a free student edition for grade and high school students, as well as college students and educators. You will simply need to fill out a form and provide proof of the school you’re attending.","PTC’s learning curve used to be really high, like <a href=\"/catia-review\">CATIA</a>, but – while it still isn’t very intuitive – the interface and tools have become much easier to navigate and use. That being said, this is advanced CAD software, so it takes a good deal of training and dedication to become proficient. If you are a beginner, we suggest you start with easier to use software like <a href=\"/autocad-review\">AutoCAD</a>. ","This software employs Creo Simulate, a feature that helps you recognize and fix design errors before prototypes are made, which can help save money. This feature is especially helpful when dealing with tricky materials, like plastics, or for identifying how human interaction can wear out your designs.","The program’s snap tools can be turned on and off to help you align your elements exactly where you want them. As with most CAD software, Creo also uses a layer manager so you can select, arrange and edit various sections without manipulating the entire design.","A popular feature in recent years is the ability to extrude 3D models from 2D images as well as create 2D images from 3D models. This program also has this ability.","The command line and ability to create macros help make the creation process more efficient since you can quickly make actions happen instead of repeating steps. And the measure command will help get exact dimensions between various elements of your designs, so you can keep everything accurate and spend more time creating. Additionally, like many CAD software programs, PTC Creo uses drag and drop functionality to help with workflow.","Creo works with DWG, DXF, STEP, STL, PDF and image files so you have a wide range of importing and exporting options when using this software, plus the ability to 3D print your designs. PTC also offers Creo View Mobile, an app that allows you to view and showcase your designs on your smartphone or tablet. This app can be especially useful when interacting with clients and customers, as it allows you to access your designs wherever you are.","Creo is a more advanced software that is best suited for high-tech designs like aerospace and defense systems, but it has become a more accessible program in the last few years, with the interface being more friendly and usable."]},"id":"d5bada25-fcdf-4716-9c05-05ade716907d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c208a0d5-8ba9-48ac-b0bd-1a1f1739f747","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" Creo is a more advanced software that is best suited for high-tech designs like aerospace and defense systems.
