It also comes in multiple color options and includes an excellent warranty. However, there are a few areas for improvement, including its range and the battery life, which would enhance the overall performance of this wheelchair.","The speed of this electric wheelchair is average: It can reach a maximum speed of 3.5 mph, which is slightly slower than other motorized wheelchairs we evaluated. It has a 26-inch turning radius, which does not allow for the tightest turns. Furthermore, it can only travel approximately 9.5 miles on a single battery charge. Some electric wheelchair models, by comparison, can travel up to 15 miles on a single battery charge, while others can travel 20 miles or more.","This electric wheelchair features a lightweight design, weighing 116 pounds. The wheelchair is designed to break down into four separate pieces, with the heaviest piece weighing 35 pounds, so transporting the chair is not cumbersome. Despite the lightweight frame, the chair can accommodate riders up to 300 pounds.","The seat and the backrest of the Golden LiteRider PTC are padded, allowing you to sit comfortably for extended periods of time. However, this electric chair doesnâ€™t come with a head rest. You can choose from three color options: blue, black or red, which is something few motorized chairs offer. It also features a storage basket underneath the chair to help you easily carry any of your personal belongings. Again, this is a feature we didn&#39;t find on other wheelchairs.","The LiteRider&#39;s frame is covered under a five-year manufacturer warranty. Furthermore, all electronic components are covered under a 13-month warranty."]},"id":"177cc1f4-07c1-4cdc-b841-ddddda72c7c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"10c4b633-2fb8-450e-8cff-23da598d8e24","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LiteRider PTC has a lightweight frame, ample storage and a long warranty.
