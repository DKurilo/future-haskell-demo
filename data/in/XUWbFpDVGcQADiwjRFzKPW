Though the best way to listen to music is live, it&#39;s hard to bring your favorite bands with you. So what&#39;s the next best thing to actually being there? Some of you may remember when cassette tapes came along and replaces vinyl records. Next CDs came along and everyone, whether gladly or reluctantly, made the switch to digital. Now with the rise of MP3s, some of you have probably scrambled to convert your CDs and maybe even <a href=\"/best-cassette-to-mp3-converters\">cassettes to MP3 files</a>. Certainly we&#39;ve made strides in making music more portable, but which medium is the best for listening to audio?","<strong>Vinyl Record</strong><br/>There are still people out there holding fast to their vinyl records, who won&#39;t give them up for anything. Why is that? Especially for those of you in the younger generations, what could a record have over an iPod? The truth of the matter is records in good condition have a high sound quality. Better in fact than even a CD or DVD. This is because the vinyl can pick up every single part of the sound wave. No information is lost. The records will hold the scale of the sound and you will get everything. If you want the true sound of your music, then records are the way to go. The downside is a small speck of dust or scratch will create noise and static.","<strong>Cassettes</strong><br/>While many music enthusiasts consider cassette tapes to be an embarrassment to the audio field, they had a use. While a few old cars actually squeezed a record player onto their dashboard, cassettes were a lot easier to deal with on the go. They were much more compact and resistant to bumpy roads, and anyone could record with them. However, the sound quality on the majority of them left a lot to be desired, and you can&#39;t forget about the tape-eating machines. Cassettes were great for portability, but few people minded when something better came along.","<strong>CDs</strong><br/>This is one of the first digital methods of storing audio available to the public. It didn&#39;t take much encouragement for people to leave their cassettes behind and purchase these. Not only did the audio sound cleaner, but CDs lasted longer since nothing actually touched the disc and wore it down. Though the sound quality was better than cassettes, it still didn&#39;t hold a candle to the vinyl records. This was because a digital file only caught some of the data. It recorded enough that the majority of the population wasn&#39;t bothered by the difference. Though CDs are still being manufactured, they too are starting to fall by the wayside.","<strong>MP3s</strong><br/>Now technology is moving in another direction Â  disc free. While some cheer at the fact that they can now hold 1,000 songs in the same memory space that 100 fit before, others cringe. The smaller the file, the more of the particulars are lost in the music. The MP3s sacrificed the range and quality so that more would fit. Some people may not even be able to tell the difference between an MP3 and the original vinyl recording and that&#39;s just fine.","Few options can even come close to the quality of a vinyl record. However, with this rapidly advancing technological society, many are willing to sacrifice that to carry more of their music around with them."]},"id":"ebd427c7-959f-45f6-b4f7-22bcdf41d070","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5821","url":"/the-best-medium-for-audio","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"emily-younker","url":"/author/emily-younker","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Emily Younker","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"VfHp7pxJMR2v9xyBcnugUm","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-04-19T19:22:36Z","datePublished":"2011-04-19T19:22:36Z","name":"The Best Medium for Audio","synopsis":"There are several different mediums for audio.
