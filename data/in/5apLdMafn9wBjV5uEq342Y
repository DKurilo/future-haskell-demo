Many have built-in trackballs and scroll wheels for added convenience. There are models suitable for business and travel, as well as console and home theater setups. Under the company’s gaming brand, Kaliber Gaming, you can also find wireless gaming keyboards for PC and console use.","These wireless keyboards all connect using 2.4GHz radio frequency via a USB receiver. Most models don&#39;t have USB pass-throughs or AV ports, so unless you&#39;re using other wireless peripherals, you need to stay fairly close to the connected device when you want to use your headset and mic. When using one of its PC gaming keyboards with your game console, you can use Kaliber&#39;s KeyMander to configure keystrokes and mouse buttons in place of the console&#39;s game pad, but this requires an additional purchase.","Most IOGEAR wireless keyboards have scissor switches, although some do come with plunger-style key switches. Plunger-style keys feel mechanical but cost less. Many of IOGEAR&#39;s keyboards have switches rated for 20,000 cycles or presses, so whether you&#39;re touch-typing or doing some serious enemy-slaying button mashing, these keyboards have solid lifespans.","Some of the basic models are very compact and simply don&#39;t have the space for special keys. They also don&#39;t have 10-key number pads. Full-size models do have number pads, along with a variety of special keys. Media player and Windows hotkeys are all commonplace on IOGEAR keyboards, along with programmable keys you can set with your own functions and macros. Some models feature a Windows lockout key that, when activated, keeps popups and Windows menus, programs, and functions from interrupting your gaming session or movie.","The majority of IOGEAR wireless keyboards are slim and lightweight, with low-profile keys, although its gaming boards are considerably chunkier. They don’t have many ergonomic features, although a number of these models feature a built-in laser or optical trackball and scroll wheel that lets you work comfortably with the board on your lap.","You can find gaming models with anti-ghosting on the eight most common gaming keys: W, A, S, D and the arrow keys. They also have polling rates of up to 1000Hz. The keyboards don&#39;t have backlighting, which makes working or playing in low-light conditions challenging."]},"id":"cb9ef594-2f3b-46c1-ba34-25ca1835590a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68442","url":"/iogear-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-21T18:41:28Z","datePublished":"2016-09-21T18:41:28Z","name":"IOGEAR","synopsis":"IOGEAR makes both full-size and compact wireless keyboards, and they have many features.
