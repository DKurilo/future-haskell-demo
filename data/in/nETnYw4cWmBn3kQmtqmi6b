It provides a good rewards points program but charges a slightly above-average annual percentage rate. There is no annual fee and no charge for using the card outside of the United States.","<strong>Annual Percentage Rate</strong><br/>The long introductory period of 12 months with zero annual percentage rate (APR) is certainly enticing. However, when the regular APR kicks in, it is not competitive in comparison with other student credit cards. Students will pay 13.9% - 19.9% (V) APR for purchases and balance transfers. Any cash advances charged to the card will cost 24.9% (V) APR. Even though the legally required minimum for a grace period is 21 days, this bank (Capital One) gives you a 25-day grace period.","<strong>Rewards &amp; Redemptions</strong><br/>Purchases that involve entertainment earn five points per dollar spent while card transactions at restaurants earn two points per dollar. Everything else returns one point per dollar. If you pay on time, you get 25 bonus points. Point redemption includes turning points into cash, merchandise, travel or gift cards. The rate of exchange for redemptions depends on what you select. Five thousand points will yield $25 in cash. A $50 gift card is worth 7,750 points. If you choose merchandise from the approved list, 20,000 points will buy $100 worth of gifts. Fifteen thousand points cover travel costs up to $150.","If you want to build your karma, you can donate your points to charity. Or if you would prefer to brush up on fun – this is, after all, the MTV® Visa® Card from Capital One® – you have access to MTV merchandise and tickets to MTV events. You can also redeem points for DVDs. Or if you want to create your own MTV experience, you can get backstage access to concerts and meet the MTV star of your choosing.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"ea9634ac-c92c-425f-a854-263de21505f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6b6d0ba0-f4d7-492a-b5e5-fbd2da53d2d8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MTV® Visa® Card from Capital One® doesn’t have the most competitive APR but it does have an interesting rewards points program.
