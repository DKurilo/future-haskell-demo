When we tried to access a malicious site, Bitdefender was quick to display a prominent message in the browser letting us know there was a threat there. And if we downloaded a malicious file that included a Trojan or rootkit, Bitdefender blocked it and immediately sent it to the quarantine folders.","This program’s personal firewall scans your computer and lets you know if there are weak spots where threats can get in. Sometimes you need to update your Windows operating system or an out-of-date program, such as Adobe, to the latest version to seal the vulnerability. Bitdefender also lets you know if you have a suspicious program installed on your computer. You can choose to have Bitdefender automatically take care of these weaknesses or just notify you so you can handle them yourself.","One of Bitdefender Internet Security’s best features is it automatically scans USB drives and emails, including attachments. It also includes tools that keep tabs when you visit social media sites. The program’s social network protection checks links posted and passed between you and your friends to ensure you don’t click on something malicious that could threaten your computer. If a link is dangerous, Bitdefender warns you so you can decide to back out or continue to the webpage.","Another reason we believe Bitdefender is one of the best personal firewall programs is it protects you and your family in other ways while you are online. In addition to monitoring for malware threats, the software includes a secure browser that lets you search and work on the web without sites attaching cookies or spyware to your computer to track your online activity. During testing, we found it wasn’t difficult to open and use this browser, and there wasn’t a noticeable difference between using the safe browser and Google Chrome.","Bitdefender’s password manager lets you store the passwords to all your online accounts in one secure place. You then use the manager’s password to access those individual accounts. This keeps hackers from snatching your passwords to access credit card, bank and email accounts to steal your identity."]},"id":"dff6a630-51f9-42c0-8ead-abaea14f66bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/EerH8vhkVhT4DAFmPcLR4L.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/49644-bit-defender-internet-security7.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EerH8vhkVhT4DAFmPcLR4L.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"EerH8vhkVhT4DAFmPcLR4L","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EerH8vhkVhT4DAFmPcLR4L.jpg","alt":""},"id":"83f87c17-ac6a-4669-bdd1-f1b3b946bbf0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We especially like that Bitdefender’s Internet Security program includes parental controls.
