Nexia Home Intelligence is compatible with Z-Wave peripherals and offers a simple mobile app that lets you control the system. Nexiaâ€™s customer support options are not as plentiful as on larger home automation systems, but they are sufficient for most support needs.","Nexia is compatible with nearly every type of Z-Wave home automation peripheral. However, the smart home system doesn&#39;t work with window coverings, such as blind and curtain motors, or home theater systems. The system works to monitor and improve your home&#39;s energy usage patterns while integrating security components such as security cameras, entry sensors and door locks.","The Nexia smart house system supports three hardware controllers: the Nexia Bridge, the Trane XL824 thermostat and American Standard Gold XV thermostat. Each of these devices can control the system using Z-Wave wireless frequencies. The thermostats both have built-in Wi-Fi that enables mobile app control of the Nexia smart home. However, the Nexia Bridge must be connected to a wireless router by an Ethernet cable to enable Wi-Fi capability. Nexia Home Intelligence does not support peripherals that use ZigBee, Bluetooth, Insteon, KNX, UPB or X10 home control technologies. As far as Wi-Fi peripherals are concerned, Nexia only controls Wi-Fi security cameras.","With Nexia, you can expect basic intelligent home system functionality. With relatively few features, Nexia is one the easiest to use in our review. The system supports randomized programming that can turn your home&#39;s lights on and off to confuse thieves into thinking you&#39;re at home even while you&#39;re on vacation. However, Nexia doesn&#39;t have a touchscreen option, voice control or wired smart home components.","Ingersoll Rand provides common customer support options such as email and telephone support. There are also two self-service support options: FAQs and a user manual. Nexia doesn&#39;t require professional help to install, unless you plan to use one of the above-mentioned thermostats as your system controller. There are no support options for live chat and online forums."]},"id":"6d02bdc5-1cc1-4a60-8e99-dba42bbc09d3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e263008-13bf-40cf-9aef-7abe5a1a6f8e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Nexia Home Intelligence is a good home automation system with support for many types of Z-Wave devices.
