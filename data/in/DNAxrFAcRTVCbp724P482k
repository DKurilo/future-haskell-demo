Different modes, including economy, standard and turbo, help you do a quick sweep or a deep clean. It may not as be easy to use as other programs, but TuneUp is efficient and quickly solves computer and system errors.","Once you install the software, the first thing you&#39;ll be prompted to do is run a report to analyze the state of your computer. You can also scan your PC performance separately from PC maintenance. To make a PC faster, TuneUp looks at the registry, hard drive, shortcuts, internet history, Windows and more. The report only took a few minutes to run on our test PC.","After your initial sweep, this utility software will walk you through fixing each problem. There are clearly marked buttons to help you fix errors like duplicate files and to securely delete data. Also, if you want more diagnostic control, you can look up individual processes and components in the all functions tab. A few important features are missing however, such as hard drive and hardware failure monitors. Without those features, you won&#39;t know in advance if one decides to malfunction.","There are many different options on the optimization tab of the software to make optimizing your core components much easier. This computer clean up software can handle defragging your hard drive, cleaning up your registry, managing your startup programs and much more. Also, if you find that you accidentally optimized something you didnâ€™t want to touch, you can undo any changes that you made with the rescue center button.","AVG offers email support should you run into any hiccups with your software. If you need a quicker answer though, try looking through the FAQs. You can also install TuneUp Utilities on three different computers which is a great feature if you have more than one PC."]},"id":"b48e45f2-6747-4fc7-bbf7-3abc79cb3c39","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4ebb32c8-826f-4965-9417-505a5de07cf7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This program has a clean navigation layout so you&#39;ll be able to find important tools quickly.
