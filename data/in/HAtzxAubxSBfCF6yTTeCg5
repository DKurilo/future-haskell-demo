Illegible writing incorrectly deciphered by nurses, office staff and insurance companies often resulted in costly and dangerous mistakes. With access to <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-medical-transcription-services/\">medical transcription services</a> and electronic filing, medical documentation has become more efficient for doctors in private practice and hospitals, helping to prevent those kinds of errors.","<strong> Here are some of the benefits of using a good transcription service.</strong>","<strong>Make Charting Easier</strong><br/>Thanks to toll-free phone dictation, handheld digital recorders and smartphone applications, dictating medical notes has never been easier. The ability to save time and money on administrative paperwork is a huge benefit. As a physician, you simply dictate notes using your favorite dictation capture method and you are ready to see you next patient in a matter of minutes.","A professional transcription service will type out your oral notes and proof them for errors. In 24 hours, you get them back into your hands so you can file them safely. You do not have to worry about searching for lost files or deciphering hand-typed notes. This is perhaps one of the most timesaving benefits of using a transcription service.","<strong>Improved Accuracy</strong><br/>Most transcription services offer several levels of quality control to make sure there are no typos, misspelled words or incorrect medical terms. Some transcriptionists train in specific medical specialties such as dermatology, neurology or cardiology to assist your office according to your individual needs.","Many companies employ professional editors and clinicians to proof your documents. In order to match that level of accuracy you would have to hire several in-house employees to get equal quality control.","<strong>More Free Time</strong><br/>Whether you want to spend more face time with your patients or get home in time for dinner, transcription companies can help solve time management issues. If you are tired of sitting in front of a computer for hours after work to catch up on your charting, outsourcing your dictation may be just what you need.","<strong>Save Money </strong><br/>It may be more cost effective to outsource medical transcription services rather than use in-house personnel. Consider the costs of hiring full-time transcriptionists. By the time, you add the salary, health insurance, payroll and unemployment tax for just one employee   much less a team   it may be cheaper to outsource.","Insurance companies do not make it easy to process claims, and if you forget to cross a T or dot an I, they can deny payment. Transcription services keep your chart notes in first-rate order so processing insurance claims can go smoothly. In fact, the transcription service may pay for itself by winning billing claims.","Whatever method of dictation you choose; keep in mind there is a service to fit almost every need. Many transcription services offer scalable options and can customize for practices of any size. Even if you have fallen behind and just need one-time help to catch up, there are companies out there with you in mind. Transcriptions services have set the standard for transforming unstructured notes into tidy medical reports, and it is easy to see why so many physicians use them.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"ade06d05-d819-48fb-8fe5-82799f7bcfb9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8380","url":"/the-benefits-of-using-a-medical-transcription-service","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"leah-stone","url":"/author/leah-stone","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Leah Stone","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"LSCnXVFEk3MkJutB5Jiugm","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-19T22:36:29Z","datePublished":"2014-03-19T22:36:29Z","name":"The Benefits of Using a Medical Transcription Service","synopsis":"It was not long ago when medical offices and hospitals relied on hard-copy charts to contain each patient's treatment and history notes.","review":{},"strapline":"It was not long ago when medical offices and hospitals relied on hard-copy charts to contain each patient's treatment and history notes.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-03-20T17:02:57Z","id":"HAtzxAubxSBfCF6yTTeCg5","meta":{"title":"The Benefits of Using a Medical Transcription Service","description":"Deciding whether to use a transcription service in your clinic?
