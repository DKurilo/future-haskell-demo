As such, it shouldn’t be too surprising that there are many shared characteristics between the cards.

It isn’t a big difference but there isn’t much that distinguishes the middle-of-the-pack cards from one another so it’s something.","Also noteworthy is that there is no monthly service fee for this card but that may not be as big of an advantage as it initially seems. In lieu of the monthly fee, there’s a fee for each purchase transaction. Specifically, there’s a $1.00 charge for each signature transaction and a $2.00 charge for PIN transactions. The same fees apply to online bill paying. That can all add up awfully quickly so if you’re likely to use the card for transactions that total $10 or more per month, this card isn’t a very good choice. On the other hand, if you do make fewer purchases, this could be just the card you’re looking for.","Other fees for the All-Access MasterCard include a $5.95 per month inactivity fee if the card isn’t used for a 90-day period. Like other prepaid cards, no monthly bill exists and a continuously updated account summary is always available online. If a printed statement is desired, there is a $5.95 fee for getting it. Cash withdrawals at an ATM or agent cashier cost $2.50 each and if a transaction is declined by an ATM there’s a $1.00 charge. There’s also a $ .50 fee for making a balance inquiry at an ATM. Transfers between All-Access MasterCards can be made free of charge online but calling the company’s customer support line to set up such a transfer costs $4.95. Finally, there’s a $9.95 charge for replacing a lost or stolen card."]},"id":"b216e71a-b1cf-41f9-b5e6-680ec9698f74","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Flexibility"},"id":"c9052c1c-4b6b-4eb5-8159-7e0b865194fc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>All-Access MasterCard</strong> imposes a $2,500 daily transaction limit for both signature and PIN purchases.
