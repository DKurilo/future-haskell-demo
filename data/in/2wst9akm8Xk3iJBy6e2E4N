With this kind of power, you can bring a stockpot to a boil in a matter of minutes. This range also has two six-inch burners with 1500 watts of heating power. These smaller burners are for simmering items or cooking smaller amounts of food. This electric range also comes with a digital clock and timer for reminding you when you need to check on your culinary creations. Because you will not have to be concerned about watching the clock, you are free to do other tasks in the kitchen."]},"id":"227a077c-19e3-4724-9783-4625e20a96fa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"34de22b8-a135-41bd-bdc3-9cddf6c1e745","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool RF263LXTQ is equipped with two oven racks that are adjustable to five different positions. This works well if you are baking something large and need to use most of the interior capacity of the oven. This is also a great feature to have if you like to bake multiple dishes at once. You have the flexibility to rearrange the racks so that you can fit multiple pans into the oven at the same time. For added convenience, this electric oven also comes with a pre-heated indicator light as well as an indicator beep.","This electric range comes with a great feature called Delay Bake that allows you to set the oven to begin cooking when it is more convenient for you. Another important feature that comes with this electric oven is its balanced bake system. This allows the boil coil and the main baking elements to heat up at the same time. However, in order to produce a balanced baking system, the broil element uses fewer watts when heating. This feature helps all of your dishes cook evenly. If you have ever experienced making a cake with a nicely browned top only to find out that the center is not fully cooked, you will appreciate this feature.","If you have spent a busy afternoon in the kitchen making a great meal for your family only to find out that someone&#39;s schedule has changed, you will appreciate the Keep Warm setting on this electric oven. This feature allows you to keep hot food in the oven warm until you are ready to serve it. This electric range will set the temperature to 170 degrees Fahrenheit and will keep your dinner warm for up to one hour. As an added safety feature, after that time, the oven will automatically shut itself off. If you need to continue using the Keep Warm setting, simply reset it for another hour or the appropriate amount of time needed.","Another excellent feature that this electric range comes with is the ability to set your own temperature when using the broil feature. This oven will allow you to change the temperature using five-degree increments and will allow you to set it between 170 degrees and 525 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a useful feature for cooking simple items that just need a bit of cheese melted or for broiling meat.","If you are concerned about having little children around that might be tempted to play around this oven and hurt themselves, there is a great bonus feature that you will appreciate. This electric range offers a lockout feature that will allow you to lock everything except for the clock, oven light and timer. This can give busy parents much-needed peace of mind."]},"id":"8155f9c2-7e14-4850-ab08-16b90bc06b09","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Conveniences"},"id":"3473d547-f542-45fc-8b3c-689c259fa00f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool RF263LXTQ electric range offers many features that are sure to make your life in the kitchen easier than it was before. This electric oven comes with an oven window and light that allows you to check on your food while it is cooking without having to open the door or lose heat. This will help you prevent food items from boiling over and creating a mess in the bottom of your oven.","While this electric range will not vacuum your floors or wipe down your countertops, it will clean the oven on its own without the use of harsh chemicals or spay cleaners. It does this by using very high temperatures to burn all of the spilled food items into ashes. Once the cleaning cycle is finished and the oven has cooled down, simply wipe up the pile of ashes with a damp cloth and you&#39;ll have a clean oven without ever having broken a sweat. For safety reasons, and because such high temperatures are used in this process, the oven will lock itself when the self-cleaning feature is engaged.","We found that cleaning the top portion of this electric range is quite simple. The burners are removable, enabling you to scrub stuck-on food and clean those hard-to-reach indentations on the stove. To clean the chrome drip pans, just toss them into a sink of warm, soapy water and wipe them with a plastic scrubber. For tough stains, Whirlpool suggests placing a paper towel soaked in ammonia on top of the stain and allowing it to soak in for a short time. This should allow you to remove the stain with a plastic scrubber.","To clean food off the range that has splattered up by the controls, all you have to do is simply pull off the knobs. You can scrub the surface behind the knobs while allowing them to soak in soapy water. Once you have cleaned the surface and the knobs, allow them to dry completely and then push them right back onto the oven-control areas. To clean the exterior of this electric range, simply wipe it down with a mild liquid cleaner or glass cleaner and it will sparkle.","We were also please to find that this electric range comes in your choice of four different colors to match your kitchen décor, which are: black, white, stainless steel and biscuit."]},"id":"b8e15666-b114-4e07-a649-cd34bddb0a0f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Dimensions &amp; Warranty"},"id":"5235015f-2bc6-45b3-bab4-cfcb50d5795d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Whirlpool has been in the business of making home appliances since the early 1900s.
