The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-pest-control-services\">Pest Control Services</a> here.</em>","BioGuard is a pest control service that went green early on, using products that are safe for your home, your family and the environment. The website only covers services, and you won&#39;t find a pest activity map, extra learning features or instructional videos on their website. The company does cover such a large variety of bugs that any pest problem you have will no longer be a worry for you. If you aren&#39;t satisfied with their service, BioGuard has a generous guarantee.","During your initial treatment, BioGuard looks at every part of your home. The company&#39;s exterior service creates a specialized barrier to keep the bugs outside, where they belong. The technician treats the foundation, the immediate yard around the home and other entry points. Technicians will even climb up high to reach the eaves of your home. This aerial defense is great against the nest builders: spiders and wasps.","Receiving an inspection is the only way you will obtain a quote on your home. We contacted a representative who informed us that every home is different and they don&#39;t have any standard pricing except for a one-time treatment. Even if you want a termite-only treatment, they require an inspection of the premises to determine what you will pay.","One thing that makes BioGuard a great home pest control service is they will go into the walls and get any nests that have formed inside. Technicians use effective yet responsible tools and treatments to ensure your family is safe while making your home clean from bugs and their infestations. However, this company only offers its services in Utah, Idaho, Tennessee and Virginia.","If at any time you aren&#39;t pleased with the service or see new pests starting to make their homes near you, BioGuard will return free of cost, exterminate the bugs and make sure you are satisfied. This return service will be unlimited throughout your entire contract. One drawback to their customer service is availability. Representatives aren&#39;t available 24/7. The company has standard business hours and a form you can submit for a free inspection on your home.","BioGuard makes it very clear that they cover a larger variety of bugs than their competition. While this may be true in word, their website only shows a small handful of pests. They still treat for a large amount of bugs; they just don&#39;t show all of them on the website. They do have bedbug and rodent control, snake treatments, and many other common household pests like moths, bees, spiders and fleas.","Everything about BioGuard makes it a top-tier service, and it would be ranked higher if it had a more informative website. There is no section for pest activity in your area or a page with solutions for current problems. The site is very basic, and while it does give you plenty of information regarding their service, there are no extra features."]},"id":"e7bff78f-9fb3-45ad-8c66-68ad2657d566","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7edcf3d7-387e-433f-b422-006d6bd0943e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["BioGuard pest control gives you a service that matches any other exterminator&#39;s on the market.
