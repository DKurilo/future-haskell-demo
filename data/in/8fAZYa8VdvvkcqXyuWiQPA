Just 2.6 inches from rotor tip to rotor tip, only 1.8 inches wide if you don&#39;t count the rotors and weighing less than half an ounce, it&#39;s the smallest RC helicopter we reviewed. That stature makes it a nightmare to fly in even a low breeze, but if you&#39;re inside and away from any air vents, it bobs and weaves just fine.","With a full charge, the Estes Syncro gives you about 4.5 minutes of uninterrupted flight time. The battery only takes about 30 minutes to charge, easily the shortest we&#39;ve seen from our lineup. Still, 30 minutes can seem like a long time when you want to get back to flying, and the 100-mAh battery is neither upgradable nor swappable. You just have to wait for the quadcopter to charge up again before tossing it back in the air.","The Syncro&#39;s radio remote transmits in the digital 2.4GHz spectrum, which is generally more stable and less prone to interference than an infrared connection. Like all quadcopter transmitters, it utilizes four signal channels, which lets the Syncro fly laterally without turning. Given how slowly even the best quadrotor RC helicopters can turn in the air, being able to move the craft in any direction without turning can be wonderfully liberating.","The Estes Syncro uses internal gyroscopes to help maintain stability during flight, but they give it an extra benefit: the ability to flip or roll with a flick of the thumbsticks. Should the Syncro crash while you try out different tricks, its plastic hull does a good job of protecting the internal electrical components. As with most RC helicopters, though, you want to hang on to the spare propellers, as they tend to be particularly fragile."]},"id":"f436f5c7-348c-46f0-b9a7-ffb1ca8d4fcc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"419c6cbe-c485-4f15-8330-f41dcd68f30d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Estes Syncro isnâ€™t the best remote control helicopter we&#39;ve seen, but its small size and impressive charge rate certainly demand attention.
