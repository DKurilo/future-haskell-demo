You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Canon Pixma MX472 is a <a href=\"/best-all-in-one-printers\">multifunction printer</a> with fax functionality and an automatic document feeder. It has slow print speeds, though, and is better suited for a home office or small business office than for a medium-sized or large office.","This printer has print, copy, fax and scan functionality. One of its best attributes is an exceptional color print resolution of 4,800 x 1,200 dots per inch. This means it can print high-quality photos, especially if you use specialty photo paper. It prints black-and-white documents at a resolution of 600 x 600, which, while not spectacular, is all the resolution you need to print professional-looking documents.","You can wirelessly connect to this printer in multiple ways. It supports AirPrint, which is Apple&#39;s wireless printing protocol. AirPrint allows you to easily send print jobs to the Pixma MX472 from any Apple device. It also supports Google Cloud Print, which enables you to print documents in the Google Cloud from anywhere, so you can print a document at home from your favorite coffee shop.","Android users can download Canon&#39;s app, which lets you print wirelessly from your Android phone or tablet. Windows users can follow the directions online to connect the printer wirelessly to their home router. Whatever operating system you use, you can send documents to the Pixma MX472.","This printer is rather slow compared to the best all-in-one printers. It prints 9.7 black-and-white pages per minute and 5.5 color pages per minute. These slow speeds are fine if only a few people use the printer, but if you have a midsized office, this simply isn&#39;t sufficient.","On top of that, Canon doesn&#39;t give the Pixma MX472 a monthly duty cycle rating. When we called to inquire about the lack of a rating, we were informed that this printer is not intended for heavy use. While it&#39;s a bit vague how Canon defines heavy use, you probably will be safe as long as you print less than 1000 pages per month.","One of this printer&#39;s best features is an ADF, or automatic document feeder. This automatically scans multiple-page documents, which is critical if your company does a lot of faxing. It lacks automatic duplexing, however, which means if you want to print on both sides of a page, you&#39;ll have to manually feed the page back into the printer.","We were quite impressed with the patient and knowledgeable Canon customer service representatives we interacted with. Canon ships this printer with a one-year warranty, which is standard for the all-in-one printer industry."]},"id":"97f17c3f-19bf-4147-8449-ffe84056ccd4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"acf4601c-afe7-4ea4-8f86-889108300e89","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon Pixma MX472 connects easily with a host of devices and prints at a high quality.
