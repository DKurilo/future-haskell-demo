You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Alienware Aurora can help you get your work done, watch hours of streaming video content and, of course, play all of your favorite games. It has the fastest, most powerful processor of any <a href=\"/best-home-computers\">home computer</a> in our comparison along with the most storage and memory. With its unique modern look and flexible connectivity options, it’s the ideal machine for gamers.","One of the reasons the Aurora is the best gaming computer is its processor. Built around a seventh-generation Intel Core i7-7700 3.6GHz processor, this machine can handle intensive programs, video streaming, gaming and data-heavy webpages. The CPU received a PassMark score of 10,794 – the highest of any computer we reviewed. This score comes from CPUBenchmark.net, a third-party evaluation site, and shows that the device can handle whatever you throw at it. While processors with scores over 5,000 are considered good, computers with processors that score over 7,500 are great for those who use their computers more heavily.","This gaming computer produces good graphics, thanks to its NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card with 8GB of GDDR5 memory. Whether you’re planning on playing Minecraft, Forza or Destiny 2, you’ll have crisp, clear gameplay worthy of the most serious gamers. This computer ships with Windows 10 Home 64-bit.","This machine has an impressive 16GB of DDR4 RAM, which is enough to keep up with your latest gaming adventures without worry of slowdown. The average home computer only needs 4GB of memory for light use or 8GB for multitasking, so having 16GB means you likely won’t deal with slow performance problems.","One of the computer’s best features is its dual-storage options. Included is a 2TB 7200RPM SATA and a 128GB SSD, so you can decide where to store your games, programs and other important files according to your preferences.","Unlike most of the computers in our lineup, this one offers extensive USB connectivity options. With one USB 3.1-A port, one USB 3.1-C port, seven USB 3.0 ports and six USB 2.0 ports, you can connect all of your favorite peripherals. Additionally, it has a DisplayPort for your monitor connection. It also has Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing you to set up your rig and peripherals exactly how you like. If you want a portable gaming laptop, so you can game anywhere, consider the <a href=\"/alienware-review\">Alienware 17 R4</a>.","Should you ever have any questions or issues with this computer, you can peruse the informational resources on the company’s website, including a FAQs section and a knowledgebase. Or you can opt to contact technical support representatives via phone, chat or email if you want to talk with someone directly.","The Alienware Aurora can keep up with all your gaming escapades as well as your less exciting adventures like paying bills or reading today’s news. It has the fastest processor of any computer we reviewed, as well the most memory and storage capacity. You have great control over peripheral connections and it is backed by excellent support options."]},"id":"dc3702fb-02d6-4f19-9c9a-0bf0098a03c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69668","url":"/alienware-aurora-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-10-24T16:15:08Z","datePublished":"2017-10-24T16:15:08Z","name":"Alienware Aurora","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":29,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-24T16:15:08Z","id":"9SdMwo7q7v4bkDSwUp8pnn","meta":{"title":"Alienware Aurora Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Alienware Aurora is a powerful gaming tower that can handle heavy-duty gaming as well as casual web surfing.
