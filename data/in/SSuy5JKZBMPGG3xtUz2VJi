This Lexmark wireless laser printer is fine-tuned to quickly accomplish high-volume print jobs. With a 35 pages-per-minute print speed and an incredible monthly duty cycle of 80,000 pages, the Lexmark X364dn Monochrome will print pages quickly and maintain exceptional durability.","This is, by far, the Lexmark X364dn Monochrome’s most impressive category. With a 35 pages-per-minute print speed, it can put out more than twice as many printed pages as some of the other wireless laser printers on our lineup. Additionally, with a monthly duty cycle of 80,000 pages, you’re likely to be using this printer for a very long time – unless you routinely print over 52,000 pages per month. We were very pleased with the Lexmark X’s performance in this category.","Even though the Lexmark X364dn Monochrome is a fantastic printer, it tended to be a bit fitful with us during testing. The wireless signal was difficult to grab at first, and it would occasionally cut out in the middle of transmitting a print job. It luckily knew where to resume the transfer after we manually resumed the print job from the computer, but it was a hassle. The issues with the wireless connectivity on the Lexmark X364dn Monochrome did not make the printer completely inoperable, but they were still an unnecessary inconvenience.","The Lexmark X364dn Monochrome offers little in the way of additional features. It does provide a surprising amount of built-in memory, amounting to a total of 128MB. While it’s unlikely you’ll need that much space for frequently accessed documents, it’s still a nice feature. Beyond that, the Lexmark X offers USB direct print capabilities, but no touchscreen, mobile printing app or mobile printing interface.","All of the standard support options come with your purchase of a Lexmark X364dn Monochrome, including a standard one-year warranty, support documentation in user manuals and FAQs sections, and live support available by email and phone."]},"id":"739f515a-d27c-4bbc-a893-44b0f09f763f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"df48390d-91a9-4b43-b9db-a225fe5ab6b6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite an impressive show of printing prowess, the Lexmark X364dn Monochrome ends up towards the bottom of our comparison of the best wireless laser printers.
