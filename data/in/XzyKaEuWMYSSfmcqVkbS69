If you live in Arizona, California, Colorado, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah or Virginia, you may be in Moxie’s coverage area. The company offers extermination and control of common pests, but it can’t take care of wildlife for you.","Moxie resembles some of the best <a href=\"/best-pest-control-services\">pest control services</a> in many respects, such as sending out technicians to take care of emergencies for its current clients. Typically, you can expect a tech to show up within 48 hours after requesting an inspection, and then you’ll get a quote for the work that needs to be done. To get exterminator prices from Moxie, you have to schedule an inspection first. The company will not give estimates or quotes over the phone. Once a treatment has been performed, the tech will provide you with a list of the areas that were treated.","You can get one-time treatments or an annual plan that’s customized to help eliminate the most common business or home pest control problems. The pests that the company can exterminate and then keep from coming back include ants, termites, spiders, roaches, beetles, wasps and more. However, the company can’t take care of wildlife such as bats and snakes.","Moxie will require a contract or service agreement of some kind to detail the treatments. Included in that agreement is a guarantee for return treatment, so if you still find bugs crawling around after a treatment by a tech, you can request someone to come back to spray again at no extra charge. Moxie’s website is slim on information, but you can at least get the basics on what the company does and the pests it can handle. You can submit questions through a contact form on the website, but there are no sections with commonly asked questions and their answers.","Although Moxie can’t remove larger animals, the company can take care of common pest infestations. Even if Moxie isn’t available in your area, you can take advantage of the tips the company offers on its website about pests and how to keep them out of your home."]},"id":"de4ca6db-c421-46ac-82ca-f74e8bbb5976","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63496","url":"/moxie-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-16T16:27:49Z","datePublished":"2015-03-16T16:27:49Z","name":"Moxie","synopsis":"Moxie may only be available in thirteen states, but the pest control company covers large areas within those states.
