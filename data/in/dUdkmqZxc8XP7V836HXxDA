The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 <a href=\"/best-floor-standing-speakers\">Floor Standing Speakers</a> here.</em>","The Cerwin Vega XLS 28 floor standing speakers aren&#39;t as tall or as powerful as many of the others we reviewed, but they have exceptional sound qualities that helped land them a spot in our lineup. These speakers feature a three-way design with two 8-inch woofers, one 6.5-inch midrange driver and one 1-inch tweeter, and each woofer is designed with a red ring on it that immediately lets you know this is a Cerwin Vega speaker.","We tested all of the tower speakers in our lineup with two tests – a frequency analysis test and a listening test to help us determine the best floor standing speakers within our product lineup. According to our test results, the Cerwin Vega produced highly accurate bass tones, but it showed some unnatural coloration in both midrange and high-frequency tones. Once the sine wave rose above 10kHz, the analysis started to show many large dips and valleys, which means that the speaker&#39;s tweeter began to struggle to produce those sounds accurately.","In our listening test, we were overall pleased with the sound quality these home stereo speakers produce, especially the bass tones. It was apparent that these speakers don&#39;t have any problem producing punchy bass tones. The bass was prominent and hard-hitting without becoming muddy or overbearing the rest of the soundtrack.","We noted that the Cerwin Vega tweeter made some of the high frequencies sound a bit hollow. There was also a hint of reverb in the high ranges that added to the hollow sound quality. Our listening tests fall right in line with the frequency analysis test, where the speaker showed struggles in the upper frequency range. The hollow sound is in comparison with other speakers that we reviewed, but overall, we enjoyed how this set of speakers sounded.","This is one of the only speakers we reviewed that carries a 6-ohm load (nominal impedance) instead of an 8-ohm load. This means that it has less resistance to power than other speakers. Make sure your amplifier can handle a 6-ohm load, to avoid damage to your components.","These home floor speakers have a sensitivity rating of 89.8 dB. We feel that anything below 91 dB is inefficient. Generally, speakers with high efficiency ratings tend to perform better and last longer than speakers that need more power to drive sound.","The XLS 28 floor standing speakers are covered by a three-year warranty. This is a shorter warranty than most companies offer on speakers. The standard warranty on floor standing speakers is five years. Cerwin Vega has excellent customer service, though, and you can reach it via email and phone. We sent an email to the company requesting product information, and a representative responded to us promptly and answered all of our questions."]},"id":"abb817ed-5f60-4191-8d10-18a628f25517","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d4ae39c7-00c8-4598-a389-f6d71b8f2d6f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cerwin Vega XLS 28 speakers pack deep bass punch, but they aren&#39;t as clear in the high frequency range as some of our top-rated speakers.
