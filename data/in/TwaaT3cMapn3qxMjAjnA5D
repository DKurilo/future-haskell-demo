It uses a tactile sensor that can interpret the pressure of your fingers and translate it into the movement of a cursor on your computer screen. It has different touch-sensitive areas that allow you to create various movements on your screen.","Trackpads started out as a common feature on laptop computers, but you can now purchase them as separate devices. These standalone touchpads are meant for use with a desktop computer to replace a mouse. They re designed to replicate the experience of using a laptop trackpad. If you ve already used a trackpad on a laptop, you ll be familiar with using one that functions separately. Three of the popular trackpads in the market are the <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-trackpads/apple-review/\">Apple Magic Trackpad</a>, <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-trackpads/lenovo-review/\">Lenovo Wireless Touchpad</a> and the <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-trackpads/perixx-review/\">Perixx PERIPAD-501</a>.","<strong>Trackpads: What to Look For</strong>","Although all trackpads will help you navigate around your computer screen, each product has unique features. When choosing the best trackpad for you, you should consider the platform (Mac or Windows) it supports, what gestures you can use, how the trackpad is powered and how it connects to your computer.","<strong>Supported Platforms</strong><br/>As with many computer accessories, trackpads are designed to work best with either Mac or Windows computers. This is the first feature you ll want to consider to ensure the trackpad you choose will give you the functionality you want and that it will work with your computer.","<strong>Supported Gestures</strong><br/>One important feature to consider when purchasing a trackpad is how you ll use it to navigate your computer. You should look for the ability to use a wide range of gestures, such as scrolling, clicking and zooming. This will ensure fast and fluid navigation. You ll also want to ensure the gestures are intuitive and easy to remember so you won t have to continually consult a manual.","<strong>How it Connects</strong><br/>Most trackpads connect wirelessly to your computer, so you ll have the freedom to move your trackpad around on your desk without being limited by the length of the wire attached to your computer. There are some trackpads that connect via Bluetooth, but most use a USB connection. This type of connection requires that you insert a USB radio dongle into a USB port on your computer. This makes it easy to set up, but takes up a USB port on your computer that you might want to use for something else. You ll also have to remember to bring the USB radio dongle with you if you want to use the trackpad with another computer.","<strong>How it s Powered</strong><br/>Most trackpads are powered by two AA batteries. You ll want to look at the specs for each manufacturer to see what type of battery life the product has. A rechargeable model that connects to a USB port on your computer for charging can save you the hassle of buying replacement batteries.","Although trackpads are designed primarily to replace a mouse and to be used with a desktop computer, they can also be a useful accessory if you use your laptop with a docking station or want to be able to navigate your computer from the couch when it s hooked up to your TV. Trackpads have many capabilities, and finding one that works best for you will help you get the most out of your trackpad."]},"id":"5835c0da-c7a8-4973-9ee1-3a0ac61bba99","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"5187cfd5-10c9-46b5-9cc0-db03efe258c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://aos.prf.hn/click/camref:1011l8gN/creativeref:290101/destination:http://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MJ2R2LL/A\">Apple</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EEJN6FO/?&tag=ttr_trackpads-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1808[art|NA[pid|66805[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Logitech</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CX85I8/?&tag=ttr_trackpads-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1808[art|NA[pid|66807[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Perixx</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EQW6M2S/?&tag=ttr_trackpads-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1808[art|NA[pid|66806[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Wacom</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c4d5f5b9-3492-4152-be4f-fae5cc37bc34","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1808","url":"/best-trackpads","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-08T16:54:01Z","datePublished":"2016-11-11T21:11:28Z","name":"Trackpads Review","synopsis":"The best trackpads use simple gestures that allow you to navigate your computer in a variety of ways.
