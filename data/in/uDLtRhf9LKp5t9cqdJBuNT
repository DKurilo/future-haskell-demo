While its large design makes for a comfortable ride and allows it to carry more weight, this scooter cannot make tight turns, and its assembled weight makes it difficult to transport.","This <a href=\"/best-power-scooters\">power scooter</a> is a good choice for running errands and going on long excursions. With a maximum weight capacity of 300 pounds, which is similar to the <a href=\"/riderxpress-review\">EV RiderXpress</a> and the <a href=\"/buzzaround-xl-review\">BuzzAround XL</a>, most users can ride this scooter and even carry additional items in the basket. It has a maximum speed of 5.25 mph, making it the fastest scooter we reviewed, and its 13-mile operating range allows you to travel a significant distance on a single charge. When charging the battery, you simply plug the unit in to a wall outlet. The medical scooter takes between eight and 14 hours to reach a full charge. ","Assembled, this scooter weighs 131 pounds. With such heavy components, the Victory 9 is not a good scooter for the elderly. It is comprised of five main components with the heaviest weighing 59 pounds. The large design and heavy weight make it difficult for people with limited mobility to assemble and transport.","This four-wheel scooter has solid, flat-free tires. These type of tires require very little maintenance; however, they do make for a rougher ride. The scooter sits 2.25 inches off the ground, so it runs best over flat surfaces. The scooter may incur damage on uneven terrain because of its low profile.","The mobility scooter has a wide turning radius of 51.5 inches – of all the scooters we reviewed, the Victory 9 makes the widest turns. While it makes smooth turns outdoors, it can be difficult to maneuver indoors and around tight corners. The scooter’s ability to climb steep inclines also makes it good for outdoor use. You can climb 8-degree ramps using this model.","With its design and optional accessories, this scooter is comfortable to ride on. It has a deep-seat stadium-style cushion, adjustable armrests and a delta tiller handle. This design provides proper support so you can go on long excursions in comfort. You can also purchase an attachable cup holder or other parts on the Pride Mobility website.","Pride Mobility offers some of the best warranties. The company provides a lifetime warranty on the scooter’s frame, two-year warranties on the drive train and electronics, and a six-month warranty on the battery."]},"id":"c00192ca-7c29-4f76-95fd-092a6c060982","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0ab5b3da-ee42-4eb6-9a51-7bb7d27575ff","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pride Mobility Victory 9 scooter’s superior design makes it comfortable to ride on long excursions and quick trips to the grocery store.
