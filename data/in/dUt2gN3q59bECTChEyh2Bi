It offers a massive selection of security equipment and monitoring services; no other company in our review even comes close. However, the company lacks a few customer service and alert features.","Geoarm sells equipment from 14 different manufacturers. By comparison, only one other company in our review sells products from two manufacturers. This equipment selection means that you can find whatever you need, including security cameras, motion sensors, door sensors, panic buttons, security key fobs, sirens, pet-immune sensors and glass-break sensors. You can also find a number of starter kits as well.","A few things hold Geoarm back. The company acts as an intermediary between you and the security manufacturers. This allows it to sell a large selection of equipment, but it also means that you need to contact the manufacturer or a third party monitoring service to get assistance with your DIY home monitoring system. Because of this, the alerts that Geoarm offers may not be available with all types of equipment.","You can get alerts for intrusion, flooding, freezing temperatures, carbon monoxide, smoke, fire and medical emergencies. However, you need to spend extra time researching each individual company to be sure that you can get the alerts you want.","Geoarm can put you in touch with nine alarm monitoring companies, but again, this makes it difficult to determine which features fit with your system. These DIY alarm monitoring services offer 24-hour monitoring, status reports, remote browser access, smartphone apps, home automation, and cellular or internet monitoring. Each DIY home monitoring service has different fees associated with these features, but it&#39;s nice to have a large selection from which to choose.","With Geoarm, you get reliable customer service, but only during East coast business hours during the workweek, not on the weekends. While this is acceptable in most cases, it makes it difficult if you live on the West coast. When Geoarm technical support is available, you can contact it via email, phone and live chat.","Furthermore, Geoarm has no warranty policy, relying on manufacturers to repair or service your equipment. It can be very hard to track down a manufacturer&#39;s warranty policies let alone that of 14 different manufacturers. Geoarm also has FAQs and tutorials to help you install your system. The company can connect you with certified installers in your area as well."]},"id":"9ad4bda6-b268-4929-b8f0-2f985d5ed2ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"09269219-c600-4821-9a8f-1b3d5b739961","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In theory, Geoarm has a good strategy that allows you to choose from numerous equipment manufacturers and monitoring services.
