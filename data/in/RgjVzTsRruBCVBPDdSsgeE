It’s important to remember that these fees are on top of the settlement amount you pay your creditor.

The amount you’ll deposit is determined based on your income, how much you owe, how many accounts you owe to and other factors. Fees paid to Freedom and penalty fees and rates are calculated into the payment as well.","Freedom can begin negotiations as soon as two months after you join the program.
