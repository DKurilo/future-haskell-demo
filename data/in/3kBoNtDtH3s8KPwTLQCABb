You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool GU2475XTVY is a fantastic choice for a user looking to purchase an energy efficient, high load and sleek-looking <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a>. It also has concealed controls and a stainless steel exterior for kitchen eye-candy, but has a very limited warranty that protects only parts and labor for a year. Different features matter more to some users than others, but all in all, this dishwasher is one of the best on the market.","With a tall tub design and a 14, 5-piece capacity, this is a dishwasher power house. You even have six different wash cycles with six different options to get your dishes perfectly clean. You may want to implement the delay start timer before powering through a mountain of dirty dishes because at 57dB, the Whirlpool GU2475XTVY is the loudest dishwasher in our lineup. And although 57dB is still fairly quiet, on sound level charts it is compared to conversation in a restaurant, background music or an air conditioning unit. The extra noise may be worth it though; you can operate this Whirlpool Energy Star Qualified dishwasher for the low, low, estimated yearly operating cost of $34.","Plastics beware, this Whirlpool dishwasher doesn’t have a concealed heating element and one touch from you will result in a smoky, melted mess. It does, however, have nylon top and bottom racks though with light item, side and utensil clips to secure items in place during the wash cycle and prevent accidental melting. An optimum wash sensor, NSF certification, status and rinse indicator and a delay start timer are just a few of the additional features included with this washer. One big feature this dishwasher doesn’t have is a stainless steel interior. Instead, it has a slate plastic interior that Whirlpool boasts reduces tub stains. However, a non-stainless steel tub doesn’t conserve as much heat as a stainless steel interior.","This under-the-counter dishwasher will fit in any standard space at approximately 34.5x25x24in (hxdxw). Once installed, its sleek design with integrated controls and stainless steel exterior will give your kitchen an upgraded, modern feel. Whirlpool’s Hidden controls not only look good, but they also prevent unwanted changes in wash cycles by curious little children.","The Whirlpool GU2475XTVY dishwasher excelled in all of our dishwasher ratings categories except for warranty coverage. In fact, if its warranty had been better, it probably would have been in our top five products. However, the warranty included pales in comparison with others –  one-year parts and one-year labor is not impressive. Fortunately, if you are unsatisfied, Whirlpool backs up their products with a 30-day money back guarantee."]},"id":"ca3a3782-bae0-48cb-ad53-a64d2eda4ed5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d79c48ed-b7ba-4f2e-9123-ad8dd804c391","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When looking to upgrade your dishwasher, you have the right to be picky. Right off the bat you can see that the Whirlpool GU2475XTVY dishwasher is missing key elements like a concealed heating element and a stainless steel interior. When looking deeper, you’ll find that the warranty is limited and really doesn’t protect the buyer for very long. However, the aesthetically appealing exterior and power house washing capability may make up for those lacking elements. Compare this with our other dishwasher ratings and side-by-side matrix to narrow down your search for the perfect, quiet dishwasher."]},"id":"3c1a11c7-01fb-42a1-a162-2e943f8c312f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51056","url":"/whirlpool-dishwasher-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-11T14:15:38Z","datePublished":"2010-10-11T14:15:38Z","name":"Whirlpool GU2475XTVY","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":86,"verdict":"Our top ranked products include identical features with much better warranties.","pros":["All controls on this dishwasher are fully integrated for a sleek appearance."],"cons":["The included warranty is very limited."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-10-11T14:15:38Z","id":"3kBoNtDtH3s8KPwTLQCABb","meta":{"title":"Whirlpool GU2475XTVY Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Whirlpool GU2475XTVY dishwasher lacks a concealed heating element and a stainless steel interior, but is a powerhouse that will effectively clean dishes."},"products":[{"slug":"whirlpool-gu2475xtvy","url":"/product/whirlpool-gu2475xtvy","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","name":"Whirlpool GU2475XTVY","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","id":"RpFDNBWsFamSLJ8XUnZeon","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FggdZCTocniapo6x9ivV5E.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"51028-whirlpool-gold-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/51028-whirlpool-gold-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","id":"FggdZCTocniapo6x9ivV5E","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FggdZCTocniapo6x9ivV5E.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Whirlpool GU2475XTVY Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Whirlpool GU2475XTVY dishwasher lacks a concealed heating element and a stainless steel interior, but is a powerhouse that will effectively clean dishes."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FggdZCTocniapo6x9ivV5E.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"51028-whirlpool-gold-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/51028-whirlpool-gold-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","id":"FggdZCTocniapo6x9ivV5E","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FggdZCTocniapo6x9ivV5E.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Whirlpool GU2475XTVY Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Whirlpool GU2475XTVY dishwasher lacks a concealed heating element and a stainless steel interior, but is a powerhouse that will effectively clean dishes."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/kitchen/best-dishwashers/whirlpool-dishwasher-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"large-appliances","url":"/kitchen/large-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","name":"Large Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:37:41Z","id":"yvFeBy7UFkUJPFU92wJqXS","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
