This principle applies to anything from art to mathematics and basketball to beekeeping. Culinary arts are no exception. Even if you&#39;re an experienced cook, but new to cooking with a gas cooktop, it&#39;s best to start with an easier method than to just jump into the more complicated cooktops. If you&#39;re new to the culinary game, looking to remodel your kitchen, or simply want to cook more often, look for basic, easy to clean models in your price range.","The Maytag 36-inch gas cooktop (model number MGC4436BDW) is a great beginner&#39;s cooktop if you aren&#39;t experienced with using natural gas to cook your food. The simple design comes in black and white color options, so the porcelain-enamel surface can match most kitchen decor. A common complaint about gas cooktops is heat control and range, but this is quickly changing in many cooktop models — including this one. The Power Center combines electricity and natural gas to deliver high-performance and cooking versatility. The five burners feature two Power Cook burners reaching 10,500 to 12,500 BTUs for fast boiling and searing. The remaining three burners produce 9,200 BTUs on average for canning, frying and simmering.","The frameless design makes it easy to clean and install. The pilotless electronic ignition keeps the flame strong and steady, while the electric auto re-ignition brings the flame back to life if boil overs or spills occur. The removable burner caps and dishwasher-safe cast iron grates make cleaning easy, and the recessed surface collects spills without bleeding into the burners and interfering with the flame."]},"id":"7e5151b5-563d-43e5-a090-527ffba8984f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/foa8o9un4tor6Yfzvr8p6V.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Installation is an easy drop-in process, and the cooktop is compact, but you&#39;ll need to call a qualified service technician to connect the gas supply.
