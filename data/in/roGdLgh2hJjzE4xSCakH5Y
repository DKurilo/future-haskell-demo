You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Citia Silver is a straight <a href=\"/best-stairlifts\">stairlift</a> from ThyssenKrupp Access. There are two models of this stairlift: the AC model and the battery-operated system (BOS) variant.","While the AC model of the Citia Silver only runs on domestic power supply, the battery-operated model packs two 12-volt batteries as backup. With its batteries fully charged, the BOS model remains functional during power outages. Both stairlifts use a rack-and-pinion drive system pulled by a motor that delivers 0.5 horsepower and a self-locking worm gear brake that gently stops the carriage. The extruded aluminum track has an ivory-white powder finish that gives it a premium look and complements any decor. However, this coat peels and leaves powdery residue after a while.","The Citia Silver has a seat that measures 21 inches wide and 18 inches across, so it takes up a sizable proportion of the stairs even with a folded seat, because its arms are fixed. Therefore, it is not the right stair elevator for homes with narrow stairs. On the other hand, the Silver&#39;s seat is padded and premium. It has a herringbone fabric and a taupe or gray vinyl upholstery.","With a maximum weight capacity of 375 pounds, the Citia Silver is sturdy enough for all but the heaviest users. It also has a contoured seat back that is both ergonomic and comfortable. To keep you safe when riding, this handicap stairlift has a seat belt, obstruction sensors in its footrest, final limit switches and a swivel seat cut-off switch. A diagnostic LED is built into its arm to display the status of the stairlift. There is also a handheld pressure control and two wireless remote controls for sending the carriage up and down the stairs.","There are two charging stations for the Citia Silver, and they are located at the top and bottom of the stairs. This means that the batteries in the carriage can only charge when parked at these locations. This arrangement lengthens charging time, and it is the reason why the Silver charges its batteries more slowly than stairway lifts with charge strips along their tracks. To signal low battery, the LED indicator blinks, a loud alarm sounds and the carriage slows down. While these are useful signals, they can startle you and make you wonder if your stairlift is faulty.","The Citia Silver is both luxurious and flawed. On one hand, it is sturdy, aesthetic and full-featured. On the other hand, it is unfit for narrow stairs, has a poor battery system and does not work as a curved stairlift."]},"id":"3bd3b928-040e-4ea9-8d11-0e5451791426","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60689","url":"/citia-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sheryl-huggins-salomon","url":"/author/sheryl-huggins-salomon","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sheryl Huggins Salomon","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"PEDnkfQBmpWyHpYTiEznSY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-02T15:42:12Z","datePublished":"2014-10-02T15:42:12Z","name":"Citia Silver Stairlift","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
