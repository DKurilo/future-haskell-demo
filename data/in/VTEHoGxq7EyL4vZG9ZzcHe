You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you want a fully capable <a href=\"/home/hvac/best-wall-air-conditioners/\">wall-mounted air conditioner</a> that offers plenty of features, but don’t want to pay extra for an expensive name-brand product, the Haier HTWR12VCK is a great option. Of course, going off-brand can sometimes result in sub-standard options, but Haier holds its own in offering at least the basics.","This wall air conditioner sports 12,000 BTU cooling power, four-way directional airflow, three fan-only speeds and three cooling speeds to keep you at the perfect temperature inside, no matter how hot it is outdoors. With a 9.4 energy efficiency and Energy Star rating, running the unit won’t break the bank. Buying this wall AC unit to replace an older, perhaps less energy efficient model shouldn’t be a problem, either. The included universal trim kit covers space between the sleeve and the unit to ensure a perfect fit.","Braille writing for the visually impaired on the remote is another handy feature found on this unit. The 24-hour timer lets you program this through-the-wall air conditioner to turn on or off when you need it, ensuring the unit won’t be running when you’re not home to enjoy it. While there is an energy saver mode, there is no auto fan mode, or sleep mode. The handy filter reminder function will let you know when the air filter needs to be cleaned or changed, and the dehumidifier function can remove up to 3.6 pints of water per hour.","This wall air conditioner comes with a one-year limited warranty on parts and labor, and a five-year warranty on the sealed refrigeration system. Its user manual is comprehensive, easy to understand and readily available on Haier’s website. There is a toll-free support phone number, and links to several social media outlets are present, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and more. Unfortunately, while the FAQs page has a section for window AC units, it offers nothing related specifically to wall AC units. The window AC unit FAQs are fairly generic, however, and may provide some answers to questions you may have."]},"id":"ba4ce4c4-d80d-4916-8b41-67cc3d828094","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58555","url":"/haier-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-04T21:51:31Z","datePublished":"2014-01-04T21:51:31Z","name":"Haier HTWR12VCK","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
