The one feature that sets this product apart from other will-writing software is the ability to create foreign wills. As such, this is one of the few will-writing programs designed for families of mixed nationalities or citizenship.<br />\n<br />\nA significant downside to consider, however, is the lack of spellcheck. Since you can't preview the documents until you've finished answering the questions, it is difficult to go back and fix spelling errors which can result in potential legal issues when it’s time to execute your estate. In addition, Will Writer doesn't feature a checklist or worksheet tool for keeping your information organized when filling out documents. ","<a href=\"/will-writer-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"83d19f0e-1c26-4abf-9c97-762eeb454972","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Why Trust Us? </strong>","During the last six years of reviewing legally binding will software, we found all the helpful and quirky features that make better programs stand out. Our recommendations are based on hands-on experience with these programs while we created hypothetical last wills and testaments. We noted of how easy the software platform was to navigate and which creation tools made that process more intuitive.","While you can hire an attorney to create your will for you, most charge a minimum of $50 per hour. This is quite costly, especially if you don&#39;t need an overly complicated will. We started testing and reviewing will software to find a more cost-effective alternative for anyone comfortable using a software platform.","<strong>How Much Does Estate Planning Software Cost? </strong>","With will writing software, you can plan your estate for between $15 and $70, though the average product costs around $35. With legal consultation services, such as Rocket Lawyer, you either pay $40 per document or for a monthly subscription, a purchase recommended only if you require significant help with legal matters. Either way, when you consider the average estate lawyer charges between $100 and $500 per hour, will-writing software saves you considerable time and money.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>  ","Our testing process for will software was focused on finding the easiest program to use. Before we started creating a hypothetical last will and testament with each program, we researched all the necessary documents associated with estate planning and located them in the software. We then filled them out to make sure we recommended a service that has all the things you need to make a thorough and legally binding will.","We also contacted the support team for each software manufacturer to see how quickly we received answers to questions about the interface. We don’t suggest contacting the support team if you have legal questions, but we did find the lawyer directory helpful if you think you might have questions that aren’t answered in the FAQ pages on the manufacturer’s website. Our reviewers also contacted the support staff on popular social media platforms which was the quickest way to get answers to most questions about using the software. ","<strong>What to Look for When Considering Will Software </strong>","Online vs Downloadable<br/>When considering will software, you have to choose between a downloadable program or one you can access online. Both can help you write your own will and, after being signed by the appropriate number of witnesses, your will is recognized as a legally binding document. Online software doesn’t require you to permanently download the program or any documents onto your computer, but most online services charge a monthly fee. Downloadable programs allow you to create as many documents as you want for a one-time fee and can be downloaded on multiple computers or transferred to a new computer if you upgrade.<br/><br/>Document Creation Tools<br/>The best will-creating programs have the most tools. Interview formats and step-by-step instructions make it easy to record important information that the program then automatically adds to a legal last will and testament. The best will software includes a spellchecker to ensure everything you add is accurate, checklists so you know what information you need to gather before starting your will, and worksheets to keep your assets and beneficiary information in order. Saving the final document in a PDF format is important since it’s a secure format that you can’t accidentally edit after its saved.<br/><br/>Documents Created<br/>A last will and testament is only one of several important documents that you should create while planning your estate. Most of the programs we reviewed have the tools to help you create other legal documents, such as a health care directive, (or living will) schedule of assets and power of attorney. Caregiver and survivor instructions are synopses of your will and highlight additional final wishes that may not necessarily be included in a last will and testament. They usually include a notification letter that you can send out to those you&#39;ve named as executors and caregivers for your children and pets so they’re aware of those responsibilities long before your death.<br/><br/>Help &amp; Support<br/>Fortunately, each of the software solutions we reviewed is simple-to-use and navigate without reading instruction guides or getting in touch with support personnel. However, in case you do have any questions or concerns, it&#39;s nice to know you can connect with the right help. Most software developers don&#39;t have email or telephone support, relying instead on FAQs sections. Some programs come with legal support, either in the form of a legal reference guide or as a lawyer directory that lets you search for a real-life attorney in your area. Social media platforms are also a good way to get in touch with live tech support.","<strong>Common Mistakes in DIY Wills</strong>","You can save significantly by using a program to write your will – this type of software typically costs around $50, whereas you may pay up to $1,000 for a lawyer to help you write your will. If you strike out on your own and use a program, watch out for these common mistakes:","<em>Naming an Executor:</em> This is a difficult choice that can affect how your estate is closed. Don’t just pick someone close to you – choose an executor with some legal or financial acumen.","<em>Listing Every Asset:</em> You don’t have to account for everything you own when making a will. Possessions change over time, and you don’t want to have to update your will every time you buy something new. It&#39;s better to be general about possessions and designate specific items that may have emotional value.","<em>Confusing a Will for Something Else:</em> Wills are read after funerals, so instructions for your funeral should not be included in your will. Likewise, any instructions about what to do if you fall into a coma or are put on life support need to go in a living will, which is a separate legal document.","<em>Forgetting Beneficiaries:</em> One peril of using a will program is you can forget to name a residual beneficiary. This is the person who gets everything not explicitly named in your will. Take an inventory of the beneficiaries on your life insurance policies and 401(k)s, and make sure they match up with whoever you’ve designated on those accounts. If you want those proceeds to go to someone else, you need to update those accounts to match your will.","<em>Doing It Yourself When Your Estate Is Too Complicated: </em>If you have a large or complicated estate, hiring a lawyer decreases the likelihood your will may be contested. You also want to hire a lawyer to help if you want to disinherit a spouse."]},"id":"e5983701-dc1d-4db1-be1b-a6753ac04348","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_143","url":"/best-will-software","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T22:03:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T22:03:00Z","name":"Best Will Software of 2019","synopsis":"Online will software is generally compatible with Mac and PCs.
