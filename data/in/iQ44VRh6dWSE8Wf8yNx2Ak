The Evap2 can convert 2 gallons of water into mist every 24 hours and works well in rooms up to 600 square feet. You can set it to run continuously, or the built-in humidistat can regulate the humidity levels in the room, turning the unit on and off as needed. On the highest fan setting, though, the Evap2 is louder than the other humidifiers on our lineup.","Because the Vornado is an evaporative humidifier, it does not leave behind the fine white dust that ultrasonic humidifiers expel when used with mineral-laden water. Additionally, as it moves the moistened air out into the room so effectively, you can place it on surfaces like hardwood floors without damp spots collecting under the path of the mist.","The Vornado does not function as a warm mist humidifier; it works only as a cool mist humidifier, as it does not contain internal heaters to produce hot water or steam. This makes the humidifier safer for children and a better humidifier for a baby than some other models. Warm mist humidifiers can pose a safety risk if a child gets too close or tips over the humidifier; however, it would be nice to have the option of soothing warm mist when children aren&#39;t around to potentially tip the machine over.","Because you can run the Vornado Evap2 as a fan as well as a humidifier, it does not have an automatic shut-off feature. Instead, when it is out of water, the stand-alone fan remains on with less risk of overheating.","The sleek black and blue Vornado Evap2 is compact for the amount of moist air it produces. It has well-lit display buttons that allow you to operate the controls in the dark. If you have it next to your bed at night, you do not have to turn on an overhead light to make adjustments.","This room humidifier comes with an impressive five-year warranty, which is the longest warranty of any humidifier we reviewed, including our top pick, the <a href=\"/boneco-review\">Boneco 7135</a>, which only has a three-year warranty. If you encounter problems, you can check the product manual on the company&#39;s website. You also have access to a toll-free phone number or email support if you need help setting up, using or cleaning the device."]},"id":"fbed3541-7e43-4321-9a8d-8e98c65deed1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a67562c4-0c89-4c9f-8e9a-30988e728542","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vornado Evap2 is a full-featured evaporative humidifier that pushes out moist air with a powerful fan.
