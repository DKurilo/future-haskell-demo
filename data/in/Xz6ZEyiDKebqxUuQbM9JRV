Unlike the Pioneer DEH-P4200UB, no adapter is required to sync this <a href=\"/best-car-audio-systems\">car audio head unit</a> with your Bluetooth-ready device. This Kenwood car stereo does not have the thorough support system of the JVC KD-A615, but it is still one of the top three best in-dash receivers in our review. As our <strong>TopTenREVIEWS Silver Award</strong> winner, it has practically everything you could look for in a modern car receiver."]},"id":"710cbb4a-e91d-4bf6-a05b-ec9778a6cb81","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"8ff25c90-f3d8-460a-bf51-cf0c2666affd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Regardless of which modern musical medium you wish to use, the Kenwood KDC-BT645U has got you covered. This car audio receiver has a CD deck which can play WMA, MP3 and AAC formats. As the songs play CD text or audio file text is displayed on the screen, so you can see what song is playing. If you&#39;ve moved on from CDs, like many people have, you can plug in your iPod or other MP3 player into the head unit by using the front panel auxiliary input port or the USB port.","When using the USB 1-wire Direct Connect feature, you gain high-speed control of your iPod or iPhone. This means you can change tracks, choose artists or create playlists without having to look down at your device. Having the car audio controls on the in-dash receiver will keep your eyes up so you can avoid being distracted while driving.","As previously mentioned, the Kenwood KDC-BT645U has built-in Bluetooth connectivity. You can set up this in-dash receiver to dial phone numbers or answer/end a call. It also has a built-in microphone, so you can keep your hands on the wheel while the car audio head unit picks up your voice loud and clear. The caller&#39;s voice is simply played through your car&#39;s speakers. The Bluetooth feature also offers SMS support, so you can see when text messages has been received without having to look down to check your phone.","In order to keep people from stealing your stereo, simply detach the front panel and put it in the included carrying case. You can either take the car audio panel along with you, or hide it away in your car. Removing the face will prevent would-be stereo thieves from even wanting to break into your car.","While this Kenwood car stereo has recommended power output of 22 watts, it can handle up to 50 watts of power per channel without overloading the circuitry or causing irreparable damage. It uses a MOSFET (or metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) amplifier to give increased power output without overheating or excessive distortion."]},"id":"8a0e25a4-7561-4abd-ac38-f9e36edac072","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"c99a9913-d49e-496f-b55b-a399e0dd6e26","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In case you want to hear what&#39;s on the radio, this car audio head unit has a built-in AM/FM tuner.

It also offers a wide range of frequencies on both the FM and AM bands, so you can get almost every station that you want, no matter where you are.","If you want to get HD radio, you&#39;ll have to purchase the KTC-HR300 HD radio tuner. This little box is easily plugged into the Kenwood KDC-BT645U car audio receiver. If you want Satellite radio, such as Sirius Radio, you&#39;ll need to purchase the KCA-SR50, which is another adapter.

You can adjust the settings on the subwoofer preamp output to give you the bass sound that you desire.","There is also a built-in lead on the back of the in-dash receiver for steering wheel control.
