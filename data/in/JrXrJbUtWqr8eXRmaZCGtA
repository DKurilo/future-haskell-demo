Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Affordable <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D printers</a> are a rare commodity, and the Ditto + is one of them. For under $2,000 you can print high-quality ABS or PLA models from your own home, office or classroom. The Ditto + 3D printer excels in ease of use, large printing capacity and overall design.","With print speeds up to 100 mm per second and a high-performance resolution of 0.1-0.3 mm, the Ditto + prints high-quality models each and every time. The print volume the Ditto + can produce is also well above average. While comparable printers can only print 5 x 5 x 5 inch objects, the Ditto + can print 3D models up to 9 x 7.3 x 8.3 inches.","3D printing materials for the Ditto + include both ABS and PLA in 1.75 mm or 3 mm sizes. Tinkerine recommends you only use its brand of plastics, but the Ditto + can print with universal cartridges if you&#39;re looking to save money on filament. Only one print head is installed on the Ditto +, so unfortunately it is not multicolor print capable.","This 15-pound 3D printer is a pre-assembled machine, but you can also buy the Ditto + as a 3D printer kit if you want to build it yourself. The birch plywood chassis isn&#39;t as sturdy as aluminum or steel printers, but the lightweight construction keeps it easy to move around the office or at home. If you want to print with ABS, you can. The print plate is heated, so you don’t have to buy an additional platform for ABS-specific 3D prints.","Tinkerine may be a new 3D printing company, but there are many different ways to get in touch. Email and phone support is available on the website along with a blog, forum and FAQs. Even though the company is headquartered in Canada, we found that representatives are quick to answer questions thoroughly. A manual is also provided in the forum under Printer Assembly so you can always have access. With a warranty of only seven days, coverage might seem short for the Ditto +, but many 3D printers are not covered by any warranty at all.","To print 3D models, use the included USB cable and print directly from your computer, or just save files to an SD card and then plug it into the printer. 3D printing with your home or office computer is easy, as any Windows or Mac operating system is compatible with the Ditto +.","Everything you need to get started comes in the box: power supply, USB cable, maintenance tools and a starter filament cartridge. Tinkerine provides free modeling software for the Ditto + so you can create, modify and print your own or other&#39;s creations. The Coordia software is designed for beginners, but it doesn&#39;t limit the creativity of more advanced 3D model designers."]},"id":"d9ab7246-e008-4a34-b041-eecdb011c34d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"60f4128c-6b53-4d7a-898f-e5151907efa8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This easy-to-use 3D printer makes creating prototypes, models and other objects a piece of cake.
