You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","A tool may be well constructed, but if it isn&#39;t convenient then people will not use it. The Comark PDT300 embodies this principle by being both well-constructed and convenient. This pen style pocket <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">digital thermometer</a> helps you get multiple temperature readings from the meat you are cooking without hauling around a bulky thermometer. The slim profile lets the Comark PDT300 fit into any pocket, or roll up the sleeve of a chef&#39;s jacket.","The convenience doesn&#39;t stop with the size of the thermometer. The digital readout is easy to read, providing information both in Fahrenheit and Celsius. This helps the home chef to follow different recipes without having to do complicated temperature conversions. The 1.6-mm probe tip gives you a temperature response time in under than six seconds. This is perfect to help you prepare your meat without interrupting the cooking process, a common mistake that results in losing taste and flavor of grilled meat.","With any digital meat thermometer, it is only as good as the information it provides. The Comark PDT300 has a range of -58 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 to 150 degrees Celsius). This is sufficient for any meat you would like to grill. It has a nice hold feature that allows you to save the last temperature reading on the digital screen. This helps you to track the cooking progress of your meat over time without having to remember or write down the previous reading. The Comark PDT300 also has a field calibration ability. This allows you to recalibrate the thermometer whenever you would like. By placing the metal probe in a slush-ice mixture, you can recalibrate the BBQ thermometer within two degrees of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.","While the Comark PDT300 is waterproof, it isn&#39;t dishwasher ready like many other pocket size thermometers. This means it will be a little more difficult to clean; however, a thorough cleaning of the metal probe and recommended use of a bactericidal wipe will help get the food thermometer ready for safe use. This pocket thermometer also includes BioCote antimicrobial protection. This coating helps to prevent bacteria from growing on this grill thermometer.","The compact design makes the Comark PDT300 digital meat thermometer convenient to use. Plus, it’s ideal for giving consistent reliable readings. It is a great kitchen tool whether you&#39;re a professional chef needing something to fit in your sleeve or a home culinary pro looking for a convenient way to improve your cooking."]},"id":"f85a430d-6b8d-4c32-ac0f-4a95364ae185","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58140","url":"/comark-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T20:38:56Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T20:38:56Z","name":"Comark PDT300","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-11-13T20:38:56Z","id":"m8trSWnGEozqNm6xdS5Zxn","meta":{"title":"Comark PDT300 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Comark PDT300 is a grill thermometer that delivers quick results and is small enough to fit in a chef&#039;s sleeve or pocket.
