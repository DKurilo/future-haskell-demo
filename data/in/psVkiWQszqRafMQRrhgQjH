The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-smart-locks\">Smart Locks</a> here.</em>","The Kwikset SmartCode 916 is a good example of a home-automation-enabled smart lock. The lock&#39;s touchscreen keypad has a modern design that matches both traditional and contemporary aesthetics. Additionally, the lock has good security options. The lock depends heavily on smart home systems for its best features, so it doesn&#39;t fare as well as other smart locks with direct smartphone control.","Security is a defining quality of the Kwikset SmartCode. The smart door lock has an ASNI/BHMA Grade 2 rating, which makes it more physically secure than an ordinary deadbolt. The lock has a built-in alarm that goes off and disables the keypad when someone enters the wrong code too many times.","The touchscreen keypad has a unique feature that helps improve your home&#39;s security. During the unlock process, the keypad displays two random numbers that you touch before inputting your key code. This scatters fingerprints all over the touchscreen so a stranger can&#39;t tell which digits belong to your code. There are some security gaps in this lock as well. It doesn&#39;t detect tampering, when someone uses a key to unlock the deadbolt or if the lock fails to lock your door properly.","When you compare the convenience of the Kwikset SmartCode to that of other smart locks, it is average. Most of this comes from the lack of a dedicated mobile app. You have to manually program guest keys, and the lock only has remote access when you connect it to a home automation system. You can override the system with a physical key in the keyhole, and the lock has an auto-lock function that relocks your door 30 seconds after you unlock it.","In our review, locks are self-contained if they have a dedicated mobile app that doesn&#39;t depend on extra hardware. Kwikset SmartCode doesn&#39;t meet this requirement but is compatible with Z-Wave and ZigBee <a href=\"/diy-home-automation-systems\">smart home systems</a>. It is the only smart lock in our review compatible with ZigBee systems.","This lock replaces the deadbolt on your door and also has Kwikset SmartKey technology. This allows you to rekey the lock to match your existing keys, as long as they&#39;re compatible with your lock. With this tool, you can add this lock to your apartment, though it is a good idea to check with your landlord before you make the switch. The lock has an average battery life of 12 months and comes in three finishes: satin nickel, polished brass and Venetian bronze.","Kwikset offers good telephone and email support resources. However, the company&#39;s support website doesn&#39;t have any dedicated FAQs or video tutorials specific to the Kwikset SmartCode 916. The digital door lock&#39;s warranty covers its electronics for one year. All Kwikset locks have lifetime mechanical and finish warranties."]},"id":"d6754403-c950-4cdf-b99b-c79b465320fa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60659","url":"/kwikset-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-01T18:08:07Z","datePublished":"2014-10-01T18:08:07Z","name":"Kwikset SmartCode 916 Touchscreen","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
