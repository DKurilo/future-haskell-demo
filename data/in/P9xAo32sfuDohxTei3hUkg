You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The FreeStyle Lite is one of the smallest <a href=\"/best-glucometers\">glucometers</a> on the market, which makes it a great choice for people on the go. Its compact casing easily fits in your pocket or purse so you can test anytime and anywhere. While the test strips are available in most stores, they are among the costliest available.","We visited local pharmacies and over 15 online stores to evaluate the availability and cost of the test strips the FreeStyle Lite uses. On a positive note, the test strips were available in almost every store, which means it’s not difficult to find refills, especially when you need them most. However, the average cost of each strip in a 100 pack was $1.22. While it isn’t the most expensive test strip on the market, it’s more expensive than most. For comparison, the cheapest test strips in our glucometer review are less than $0.25 each. This price difference can add up really quickly, especially if your insurance doesn’t offset the cost.","The FreeStyle Lite glucometer is known for its small size and rapid test results. The unit measures 1.57 x 2.90 x 0.65 inches and weighs only 1.4 ounces when loaded with the required CR2030 battery. It has a speedy test response time of five seconds when testing blood glucose levels between 20 and 500 mg/dL, which is equal to or exceeds the result times of many meters in the industry. However, the meter’s small size means it has a small display, and it lacks a high-contrast screen. The display is only 0.7 inches, and the text is only 0.375 inches. If your diabetes affects your sight, then this isn’t the glucometer for you.","The test strip only needs 0.3 microliters of blood, which is the least amount required of any glucometer we evaluated. It can also use blood taken from the fingertips, palm and upper arm, although blood from the fingers yields the most accurate results when hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels are suspected.","The FreeStyle Lite doesn’t require coding to start testing, and the strips use patented ZipWik technology for fast blood-draw times. A test-strip port and backlit display make it possible to test in adverse light conditions.","The FreeStyle Lite can be used with two computer programs: FreeStyle CoPilot Health Management System and FreeStyle Auto-Assist. CoPilot is a free Windows-based program that helps you and your physician evaluate trends from past test results and other key information. The FreeStyle Auto-Assist Software is both PC- and Mac-friendly, and it interacts with your glucometer to log test results and other information you choose to input manually such as time of day and insulin doses. Both health management systems require a USB cable for access.","With its small size, speedy testing and lifetime warranty, the FreeStyle Lite is a good glucose monitor for those who have active lifestyles or need a device that is easy to see in any lighting condition. This meter requires a very small blood sample and has a lot of useful features that make it worth considering."]},"id":"6b3868a7-bdff-47dc-a775-f9c60bd157f8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60915","url":"/freestyle-lite-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:54:21Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:54:21Z","name":"FreeStyle Lite","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-23T15:54:21Z","id":"P9xAo32sfuDohxTei3hUkg","meta":{"title":"FreeStyle Lite Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The FreeStyle Lite is a small glucometer that holds up to 400 readings.
