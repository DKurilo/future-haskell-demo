The best sport watches will give you quick access to data so you can stay focused on improvement. They should be lightweight, comfortable during sweaty workouts and easy to read. If you&#39;re a track athlete or a CrossFit junkie, you&#39;ll need an accurate counter for tracking the speed of quick laps during high-intensity interval training. Accuracy is essential, so look for a men&#39;s sports watch that records your time to 1/20th of a second, though 1/10th should be enough. Especially for fast bursts like a 40-yard dash, those split seconds can be important to track. For longer distances, an easy-to-read chronograph and a start-and-stop function are incredibly helpful. If you&#39;re training for a marathon, you can take a quick glance at your watch and see how you&#39;re doing on a specific mile by looking at the time since your last mile marker. Staying on pace is essential. You&#39;ll fall behind if your pace is too slow and you may burnout if your pace is too fast. The Seiko Sportura collection has up to three additional dials on its face so you can measure your time in as high as 60-minute intervals to as low as 60-second intervals. You can start your time, reset your time and track your total time for your run overall. The stopwatch feature is useful for getting an accurate assessment of your time so you can work on increasing your speed during your next training session."]},"id":"e08c3f98-4a8c-46cb-9887-46878ddacb84","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/7Vkaky3viAiBiwKL5hqCoB.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"https://www.toptenreviews.comhttp://cdn.toptenreviews.com/rev/prod/large/54032-seiko-sportura-snae67-box.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Vkaky3viAiBiwKL5hqCoB.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"7Vkaky3viAiBiwKL5hqCoB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Vkaky3viAiBiwKL5hqCoB.jpg","alt":""},"id":"3db199b8-1f1e-4ff6-bb5e-14217cee6238","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Seiko Sportura\", \"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"Visit Site","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HPJZWC/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|54032[tid|NA[bbc|NA","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"button","review":{"rating":0,"url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-gps-watches,review-2638.html","name":"Seiko Sportura","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-gps-watches,review-2638.html\">Seiko Sportura</a>","pros":["Empty List"],"cons":["Empty List"]},"id":"291c4052-a642-4aea-a98c-46fae793378f","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Seiko Sportura Series is a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-gps-watches,review-2638.html\">men&#39;s sport watch</a> that uses a chronograph and quartz movement technology to keep very accurate time for athletic activities.

When the crystal receives power, it vibrates thousands of time every second, sending the second and then the minute hand precisely around the watch face. The included battery should last up to four and a half years before you &#39;ll need to replace it.","Because watches aren&#39;t a particularly new technology, most people already have certain features in mind that every watch should have. However, no two watches are exactly alike. When you&#39;re shopping for a men&#39;s sport watch, you&#39;ll want to pay attention to the functionality and features it offers, as well as the design and the support from the manufacturer, including the warranty.","Sports watches are designed to complete certain tasks, like keep dual time, split time to track laps and overall time, and more. If a watch is labeled as a chronograph, that generally means it is equipped with additional counters: 30 minutes, 1/20th of a second, etc. These dials are located on the face of the watch and are perfect for timekeeping and stopwatch functions.","Water resistance is a key function for a sports watch. Be sure to note, however, that water resistant and waterproof aren&#39;t synonyms. Water resistance is generally measured by the depth of water the watch can be immersed in; most can&#39;t handle over 200 meters, or roughly 650 feet. If you are looking to scuba dive with your watch, look for one that has an atmospheric pressure rating (ATM) of at least 4ATM (or 30 meters). For experienced recreational divers, 5ATM (or 40 meters) is more than enough.","Of course, timekeeping functionality is key, but a few features on the side make the best fitness watches stand out from the pack. Around the rim of many sports watches you&#39;ll find a tachymeter, a scale used to calculate an average speed between two distances. You can see how fast you&#39;re swimming a lap or how quickly your car is moving in units per hour. This feature is essential for runners and sailors. Look for watches with luminescent hands or a night mode that allows you to view the time even in the pitch black.","Men&#39;s sports watches are equipped with complex features. In case you need help using the features or your device malfunctions, &#39;a good help and support system is essential. Look for a sports watch that comes with a comprehensive user manual as well as online support. Watches of this caliber will need to be serviced for general maintenance from time to time, so an online service center finder and a stellar warranty are must-haves.","Your next training exercise or outdoor adventure can be enhanced with a men&#39;s sports watch that has great time-keeping functions and athletic features, such as a chronograph or tachymeter. The best sport watches have versatile features, which you&#39;re sure to make good use of on your next adventure, whether it&#39;s running, hiking, boating or diving."]},"id":"8dbd0989-721e-4592-a2c9-0180886c6872","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"2423c6d6-3157-4f25-b9dc-f08af9813156","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U9N14W/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|54037[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Timex SL Series</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009DRP9RU/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|59546[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Citizen Blue</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GBYPKA/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|59547[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Victorinox Original</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K3RWTA/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|59548[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Victorinox Infantry</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7568922-10854177?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopcasio.com%2Fproduct%2Fg-shock-ga110ts-1a4-grayorange%26promoCode%3DCSOAFFILWEBMACSS&cjsku=CSO+GA110TS-1A4\">G-Shock</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HPJZWC/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|54032[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Seiko Sportura</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7568922-10305569?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fossil.com%2Fwebapp%2Fwcs%2Fstores%2Fservlet%2FProductDisplay%3FlangId%3D-1%26storeId%3D12052%26catalogId%3D25005%26categoryId%3D230540%26productId%3D22086196%26cm_mmc%3Dcj-_-feed-_-2013-_-CH2573%26mr%3AtrackingCode%3D2EEBCD89-C081-DE11-B7F3-0019B9C043EB%26mr%3AreferralID%3DNA&cjsku=CH2573\">Fossil Decker</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BWPDFW/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|54028[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Citizen</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N2TY8A/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|54035[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Casio AMW</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WY8ZHO/?&tag=ttr_mens-sport-watch-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|923[art|NA[pid|54034[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Luminox</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4809c2a5-9755-4124-aa05-d2afb0ada7fd","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_923","url":"/best-mens-sport-watches","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-12-08T15:31:28Z","datePublished":"2016-08-18T22:22:43Z","name":"Men's Sport Watches Review","synopsis":"Men's sport watches can keep your workouts on track without sacrificing style.
