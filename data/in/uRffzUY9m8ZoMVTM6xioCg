You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sony is known worldwide for electronics, and it is no stranger to the world of car audio. Sony offers several different styles of new car audio head units, and the models in the DSX series are strictly digital media receivers. A digital media receiver is a mechless head unit, which means that it does not have a CD player and is intended to play digital media files.","The Sony DSX-S310BTX sounds great, with 52 watts of peak power delivered to your standard four speakers. Couple that with three sets of RCA outputs at 4 volts each, and you have more than enough power to drive your car stereo system. One pair of RCA outputs is specifically designed for a subwoofer, so you could expand your current setup by adding an amplifier and subwoofer for full-spectrum sound. The DSX-S310BTX also comes with a seven-band equalizer, which gives you more freedom to tweak your car audio system to your taste. You have seven bands to adjust the way the audio sounds and more fully customize it to your particular vehicle.","As stated before, the Sony DSX-S310BTX and other models in the series do not have CD players. However, they were built to provide access to your media files. While this head unit has Bluetooth capability, it also has a front auxiliary port and two USB ports, one on the front and the other in an internal space designed specifically for an iPod/iPhone or a Walkman. You can attach a thumb drive to the USB port, along with an adapter that connects it to an iPod. The whole mechanism slides in and hides behind the flip-down faceplate. This helps eliminate clutter that cords can create. The USB port and the Bluetooth are capable of playing MP3, WMA and AAC files. For further customization in music, the DSX-S310BTX is both satellite and HD radio ready, so you only need to buy the adapters to access these functions."]},"id":"e9471f80-689f-4062-ab92-30fd5435d468","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f93f0064-0e85-4093-b48a-d2a11f392896","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sony provides a standard one-year limited parts and labor warranty for the DSX-S310BTX.
