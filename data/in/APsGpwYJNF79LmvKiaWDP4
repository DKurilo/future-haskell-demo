This ultrasonic humidifier produces a high mist output and, while designed for spaces up to 500 square feet, does best in rooms around 400 square feet in size. Because it is a cool mist humidifier only, the HM2610 reduces the risk of scalding that is present with warm mist humidifiers and is an ideal humidifier for a baby or small children, but the best humidifiers at least offer the option of both.","This Holmes model uses ultrasonic vibrations to convert water into a fine mist. However, unlike the best humidifiers in our lineup, it has no demineralization filter to remove impurities, like calcium or magnesium, from the water. So, unless your tap water is naturally free from hard-water minerals or you use distilled water, you may find your furniture coated with an unwelcome fine white dust.","The HM2610 has three output settings to control how much mist it dispenses, though the output is high even on the lower settings. There is a directional spout on top of the unit, but it does not rotate. To aim the mist, you have to turn the entire humidifier in the direction you want the moisture to go.","The humidifier can operate for 24 hours on one tank of water and has an automatic shut-off feature that lessens the risk of overheating damage and potential fire. It does not have an onboard humidistat, which you can find on five other units we reviewed, including the <a href=\"/winix-review\">Winix AW600</a>, so you will need to purchase a stand-alone one if you want to monitor the room&#39;s precise humidity levels. In addition to its functional features, this unit has an integrated holder for aromatherapy tablets so comforting vapors are nearby if you are suffering from a cold or trying to rid your home of stale air.","The HM2610 is designed for easy use and maintenance. The 1.5-gallon tank is made from shatterproof plastic and sits flat in your kitchen sink. With water weighing over 8 pounds per gallon, not having to balance the tank while you refill it is a considerable benefit. It is not a noisy humidifier, but there is a slight hum, and it makes loud gurgling sounds from time to time as water moves through the system.","You can get customer assistance by email or telephone. You can also find the model&#39;s manual online, and Holmes offers a product education center where you can learn more. Holmes covers this unit with the typical one-year warranty."]},"id":"a41bf2fa-ae97-48e7-ac06-79602b34d024","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fdf43fef-82a0-4a1f-bcb7-dd3a964f225a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Holmes HM2610 humidifier does not have a built-in humidistat or demineralization filter like the best humidifiers do, but this basic model is well designed and easy to use.
