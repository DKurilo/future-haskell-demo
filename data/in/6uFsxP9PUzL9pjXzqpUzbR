Here s more on choosing a product to meet your needs, along with detail on how we arrived at our ranking of 10 products.</em>","Sergers serve as a specialty machine to help create professional-looking seams and edges. Sewers use sergers to overcast, sew over and enclose raw edges of fabric. This process adds stretch to seams, prevents fraying and helps clothes look professional. In addition to overcast stitches, the best serger machines can roll hems, create decorative stitching and cover stitch.","While sergers open up more possibilities for your sewing projects, they do not function as a stand-alone machine. You will need a sewing machine for garments that need zippers, buttonholes and topstitching. For more information on how to choose a sewing machine and to see our top-rated products, check out our <a href=\"/best-sewing-machines\">sewing machine review site</a>.","Household sergers come with anywhere from two to five spools of thread. Using only two spools creates narrow and delicate edges, whereas five spools can seam heavy fabrics together. You also need a five-spool serger if you want to create a cover stitch, a seam that allows stretch. With multiple thread spools, threading the machine can be complicated. Most sergers have threading guides on the machine to help, and some sergers even have automatic threading.","Sergers share similar parts to sewing machines, including a needle, presser foot, feed dog and pedal to control speed. However, sergers use multiple needles and loopers as well. Loopers create loops of thread that pass from the needle s thread to the edge of the fabric. This creates a seam that protects the edges of the fabric from unraveling. The distinctive difference between a sewing machine and a serger is the blade. Sergers have a blade parallel to the needle that trims off excess seam allowance. A tray on the front of the machine collects the excess fabric. For more information about sergers and how they differ from sewing machines, check out our <a href=\"/home-and-garden\">articles on sergers</a>.","Depending on the brand, you can purchase sergers at sewing machine stores or online. Generally, local sewing machine stores include classes to help you learn how to use this specialized machine. Otherwise, the operating manual and instructional videos serve as good resources. For the purpose of testing, we only reviewed serger sewing machines that are available to purchase online.","<strong>Serger Sewing Machines: What We Evaluated, What We Found</strong>","Personal preference plays a large role in finding the best serger, so we focused on key features that most beginner and intermediate sewers look for in a machine. We also focused on how easy each machine was to use. We paid close attention to the various stitches you can make on each serger and assessed how easy the serger was to thread or convert between stitches. We also noted the resources and accessories each serger offers.","<strong>Stitching with the Serger: Wide Range of Capability</strong><br/>The number of stitches you will need depends greatly on what you plan to make with your serger. If you are a beginner, the basic overlock and hemming stitches will suffice. However, if you want to grow into your machine, you will want one with more stitches. As an intermediate sewer, you will want the basic stitches, as well as decorative ones. If you plan to make clothing, you will want the cover stitch. Only expensive sergers and cover-stitch serger machines offer this type of stitch.","The stitching you can perform on each serger varies greatly. We focused on some of the most common stitches you use, including overlock, overedge, flatlock, chain, rolled hem, safety and cover stitches. Our top-rated sergers offer a wide assortment of these functional and decorative stitches, including overlock, chain and rolled hem stitches. While several of the best sergers present over 20 stitches for you to choose from, we found that most of the sergers offered less than 10 stitches altogether. However, each machine had basic overlock and rolled hem stitches.","<strong>Ease of Use: Threading the Machine</strong><br/>Sergers are known for being difficult to thread. We found that sergers with color-coded threading guides, needle threaders and a pair of tweezers were the easiest to thread. The various tools were extremely helpful in showing where the thread goes and helping us put the thread through tight areas of the machine. For the most part, we found that the serger sewing machines all shared the same difficulties with threading the machine. The sergers with a needle threader helped, but the assistance was minimal.","<strong>What Else Is Important in Selecting a Serger Sewing Machine?</strong>","While usability serves as a key factor in finding the best serger, the resources and accessories also play an important role. Instructional manuals and DVDs help you learn the ins and outs of your specific serger. These resources are also beneficial to learn your serger&#39;s accessories, help you get started and maintain the machine.","<strong>Serger Sewing Machines: Instructional Material and Repair</strong><br/>When you are first learning how to use a serger, instructional manuals, DVDs and classes serve as an immense help. Depending on where you buy your serger, many come with free instructional courses. Otherwise, DVDs and online instructional videos help you learn the basic functions of your serger. Regardless of where you buy your serger, it should come with a manual that shows you how to thread it, perform basic stitches and maintain your machine.","Before purchasing a serger, you will want to make sure that a service repair center is relatively close to where you live. Sergers have long lifespans, but they usually need general maintenance and repair at some point. Having a nearby service center helps.","<strong>Serger Sewing Machines: Accessories</strong><br/>Similar to sewing machines, sergers require several peripherals to help you adjust the machine to perform all of its different tasks. When the serger already includes those peripherals, it not only helps financially, but you also receive accessories that you know are compatible with the machine. Most sergers also come with tools that help you maintain and repair the machine, including tweezers, a cleaning brush, screwdrivers and a dust cover.","<strong>Serger Sewing Machines: Our Verdict and Recommendations</strong>","We found that the Singer 14T968DC Professional 5, the Brother 1034D and the Brother Designio DZ1234 are the best sergers. These machines offer a wide selection of stitch options, superior capabilities and a user-friendly design.","The Singer Professional 5 is the only serger in the lineup to include the cover stitch. While the Singer Professional 5 costs significantly more than the other sergers we reviewed, you can convert the serger into a cover-stitch sewing machine with its five thread spools and additional needles. It is easy to convert and saves you from adding another machine to your sewing room.","Both the Brother 1034D and the Brother DZ1234 are inexpensive machines that offer a wide assortment of stitches and sewing features. The two Brother sergers offer 22 stitches. These are the best sergers for beginners and serve as the best value. They have the features you need to learn and grow for a relatively low price."]},"id":"db7c1ce1-d647-4f75-9779-b98ac03e00ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8c58d5f2-cddc-419a-98a1-b0e767364c83","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PDZTT2/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|65565[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Singer 14T968DC</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CBK1L/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|58950[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Brother 1034D</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJW5OTC/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|65564[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Brother Designio</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085IP2AC/?tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|58947[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Singer Stylist II 14J250</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARMP39E/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|58952[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Janome Magnolia 7034D</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014134IO/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|65566[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Juki MO644D</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015VHUGA/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|58951[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Reliable Dreamstitcher 787</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J14UVQ/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|65567[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">American Home</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARMIWE2/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|65568[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Janome 8002D</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RC0UVX2/?&tag=ttr_serger-sewing-machine-review-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1204[art|NA[pid|65569[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Consew 14TU854</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"df0be60e-5215-46c0-9dbb-7bb5c500ab76","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1204","url":"/best-serger-sewing-machines","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-04T22:10:41Z","datePublished":"2015-06-17T18:11:51Z","name":"Serger Sewing Machine Review","synopsis":"If you enjoy making clothes, then you will want to try a serger sewing machine.
