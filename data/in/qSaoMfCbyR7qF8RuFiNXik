The TCL Roku TV is an intriguing option because it offers many of the same features you expect from the best LED TVs, but has a much more affordable price tag. This TCL TV has also partnered with Roku to bring streaming internet apps to this budget TV.","TCL is a large brand internationally, and it has started to make more products domestically. This TV is available in a multitude of sizes but does not have any options for a 60-inch or bigger screen. The display quality isn’t awful on this TV, but it is nowhere near what the best LED TVs produce. The audio system is a little weak on the TCL Roku TV as well. Standard LED TVs have two 10W speakers, which is passable for most sets. The TCL Roku TV has two 8W speakers. An extra sound system to boost the audio is recommended. The smallest size TV in the series also does not feature a full high definition picture.","Most of the top LED TVs feature built-in Wi-Fi and smart TV features that allow you to access streaming video apps such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video. Those same TVs, however, cost about twice the price of the TCL Roku TV. With Roku in the name, this TV obviously offers streaming video services, through your TV without needing separate peripherals like a separate Roku box. The Roku system gives you a Roku hub to access your favorite video streaming sites for your convenience. TCL offers a mobile app so you can control the TV from your smartphone or tablet and even mirror the content from screen to screen. These are rare features for a TV this affordable.","TCL&#39;s customer service is also better than expected for a lesser-known brand. For any pre-purchase inquiries or support questions after purchase, you can use the TCL website to download manuals or check the FAQs section. You can contact an operator through live chat or a toll-free number. You can also email customer support with your query. TCL was above average in our customer helpfulness and friendliness test."]},"id":"37c5f6d8-cf4a-49b1-9863-86c0e4c7fa28","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3aff144d-2259-4d15-a713-c0376f2e5dd5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TCL may not be one of the most well-known brands in the U.S., but the TCL Roku TV certainly holds its own – and at one of the most reasonable prices on the market.
