You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The JVC GZ-EX310 is a small <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD camcorder</a> that is easy to use and ready to film right out of your pocket. If you want to see what&#39;s going on in your house or broadcast what you&#39;re recording, the onboard Wi-Fi easily connects to secure networks for others to see what your camera sees. Its small size also makes it comfortable to carry and hold. Unfortunately, none of these positives redeem its poor video quality.","If you&#39;ve never used an HD video camera before, you probably won&#39;t notice the poor video quality. The full HD camcorder films in 1080p at 60 fps. On paper, this is excellent, and for most casual users, it does a good job of preserving memories. However, despite is full 1080p HD sensor, the image looks grainier than those of other camcorders in our lineup. If you use the camcorder with a stable platform or tripod, the image looks better, but once you start moving the camera, it has trouble keeping the video crisp.","The EX310&#39;s small size is useful, since it fits in nearly any bag and large pockets. If you are on vacation or taking your child to the park, you can have your camcorder on hand and ready to record. It has 16GB of integrated storage, and the battery lasts about two hours. If you need more recording time, you can use an SD card in its single memory card slot.","The JVC GZ-EX310 also has a few standout features. While its image stabilizer and face detection leave much to be desired in terms of overall image quality, you can film fast with the intelligent auto mode. You can also add a personal touch to your video and images with one of the filters. One of the best aspects, though, is the built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. You can stream your video through Ustream or watch your home while you&#39;re away. Even if you aren&#39;t using your HD camcorder to film a vacation, you can still use it to broadcast directly to the internet."]},"id":"02fd4a11-92de-4ce1-83f3-4901e8ef6905","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d91df2a7-f851-48e6-87d3-ae76a4fbfac7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The JVC GZ-EX310 is a small HD camcorder that fits in any bag or purse and can slip into large pockets.
