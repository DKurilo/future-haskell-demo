Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Big Boss Egg Genie is designed to make soft-, medium- and hard-boiled eggs quickly, as well as poached eggs and even steamed vegetables. This <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a> comes with clear instructions and even some helpful recipes. However, our testing showed some difficulty getting hard-cooked eggs with thoroughly cooked yolks, even though we precisely followed the instructions in the user manual. For greater predictability in cooking, check out the <a href=\"/cuisinart-review\">Cuisinart CEC-10</a>.","During our testing of the Big Boss, we used the egg piercer located on the egg tray to poke a little hole in each egg to avoid cracking during cooking. We used seven eggs, added the correct amount of water as shown on the included measuring cup, and plugged the machine into the electric socket to begin the cooking process. There is an indicator light in front that shows it is heating. However, you do not get an on/off button, which is unfortunate since you must reach past the hot machine to unplug it to turn it off.","The results showed eggs with whites that were thoroughly done, but each egg yolk had a center section that was closer to medium-cooked than hard-cooked, even though we followed the instructions to the letter. It took 14 minutes, which is typical for electric egg cookers, and we ended up with one cracked eggshell.  If you get this device, you&#39;ll probably want to experiment with water levels, which determine cooking time, in order to get the texture of hard-cooked eggs that you want.","There were some benefits to using the Big Boss Genie Egg cooker: There was virtually no dripping or mess when cooking the eggs. In addition, if you happen to get distracted by something else, this egg cooker emits a very loud buzzing noise letting you know the eggs are done. With a buzzer this loud, you&#39;ll never overcook eggs – especially since the sound continues until you unplug the machine.","At 8 inches wide and 6 inches high, this egg-dome topped cooker is compact and easy to store. The set includes accessories to aid the cooking process, such as a measuring cup, egg-holder rack, poaching tray and steamer rack. The poaching tray holds up to four eggs at a time, and you cook them in triangle shapes. The steamer rack can be positioned over the water reservoir to steam vegetables."]},"id":"da8e1062-3ede-486f-88e9-458292222c35","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63183","url":"/big-boss-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T19:10:19Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T19:10:19Z","name":"Big Boss 8863 Genie","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":73,"verdict":"The Big Boss Egg Genie isn&#8217;t as precise as we&#8217;d like, but it lets you steam vegetables as well as eggs.","pros":["The &quot;eggs done&quot; alarm sound is so loud you won&#039;t miss it."],"cons":["Even when we followed the instructions carefully, the device struggled to make perfect hard-cooked eggs."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","id":"RFMFPtLRtmrYveQJHNvgJj","meta":{"title":"Big Boss Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Big Boss 8863 Egg Genie lets you cook eggs or steam vegetables in a compact kitchen appliance that takes little time for cooking."},"products":[{"slug":"big-boss-8863-genie","url":"/product/big-boss-8863-genie","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","name":"Big Boss 8863 Genie","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","id":"NMyBwz98nRCAzcFLiqNweG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fKM7G5exwzMwXEfReSSeVn.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","mimeType":"","name":"6dc819089ef36ec0d6c63ab60e49cce4.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6dc819089ef36ec0d6c63ab60e49cce4.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","id":"fKM7G5exwzMwXEfReSSeVn","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fKM7G5exwzMwXEfReSSeVn.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Big Boss Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Big Boss 8863 Egg Genie lets you cook eggs or steam vegetables in a compact kitchen appliance that takes little time for cooking."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fKM7G5exwzMwXEfReSSeVn.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","mimeType":"","name":"6dc819089ef36ec0d6c63ab60e49cce4.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6dc819089ef36ec0d6c63ab60e49cce4.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","id":"fKM7G5exwzMwXEfReSSeVn","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fKM7G5exwzMwXEfReSSeVn.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Big Boss Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Big Boss 8863 Egg Genie lets you cook eggs or steam vegetables in a compact kitchen appliance that takes little time for cooking."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/kitchen/best-egg-cookers/big-boss-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"specialty-appliances","url":"/kitchen/specialty-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","name":"Specialty Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:12:26Z","id":"pjGYR2Qzeeo67PAvh7vTML","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
