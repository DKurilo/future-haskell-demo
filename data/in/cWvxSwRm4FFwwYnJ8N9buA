Rotator Powered Lift-Away Vacuum eventually cleaned our test messes, but not before scattering them a little first. Other units did a faster, more efficient job of cleaning overall. This might be worth a look if you are looking for a traditional upright– especially if you plan to use it on drapes, furniture and other added tasks – but it mostly seemed heavy and outdated compared to others we tested. If you prefer something more lightweight, consider the <a href=\"/shark-duoclean-review\">Shark DuoClean Powered Lift-Away Speed</a>.","This bagless model has a large dirt cup capacity of 105.6 ounces. With this capacity, you can vacuum without having to empty the canister very often, saving both time and energy. In addition, the <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum</a> comes equipped with a lifetime HEPA filter designed to seal over 99.99 percent of the dirt and allergens inside the vacuum. With a lifetime guarantee, you do not have to worry about replacing the filter; however, it requires cleaning every so often.","By adjusting the suction, you can use the motor of this vacuum to effectively clean your bare floors and carpeted areas. When cleaning bare floors with the hard floor attachment, you want enough suction to clean everything off the floor since it does not employ a brushroll.","Weighing 15.6 pounds, this vacuum can be cumbersome when cleaning stairs. However, you can remove the canister from the base, making it into a much lighter canister vacuum that can reach edges and under furniture more effectively.","This hardwood floor vacuum has a cleaning path of 12 inches, which is one of the widest in our comparison. It also has one of the largest dirt cups. With the 105.6-ounce dirt container, you can vacuum for long periods without having to clean out the vacuum. The dirt cup empties from the bottom at the push of a button. The design also helps reduce your exposure to dust particles and allergens.","This Shark comes with a 30-foot cord. The length allows you to clean freely without having to plug in the cord multiple times. While the extra-long cord lets you vacuum a large area without having to plug it in multiple times, it is not retractable and can be tiresome to wind up. The model also rides on top of rubber wheels. The rubber protects the vacuum from scratching delicate flooring like wood.","The crevice tool helps you reach into narrow areas like baseboards and in between sofa cushions and hard-to-reach corners. The dusting brush uses soft bristles to clean all kinds of surfaces and helps pull hair off furniture. The turbo brush lifts dirt and hair with ease from stairs and upholstery, and the hard floor attachment uses a micro-fiber pad to safely vacuum and dust hard floor surfaces. While it helps protect your floors, it requires cleaning often.","The vacuum comes with a relatively long warranty – five years after the original purchase date. If you need to contact the company, Shark&#39;s website lists both an email address and a telephone number. In addition, it has resources for each vacuum model, including video tutorials, online product manuals and FAQs for each product. While the website significantly helps with troubleshooting, it lacks a service center locator."]},"id":"809fcf7d-820e-44c4-9a97-995048c7a246","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6007fbec-e763-4ba9-9c69-400d3f00ffad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Shark Rotator Powered Lift-Away Vacuum has the versatility to clean multiple types of flooring in addition to other surfaces like furniture and draperies.
