It has an Intel Core i5-8250U processor with 8GB of RAM, which is enough power to perform everyday tasks fairly smoothly. We opened a YouTube video and about 12 browser tabs and only saw a couple pauses while flipping between tasks and scrolling.","We use the Geekbench performance test to measure how well a computer can multitask, and this computer got a score of 9,278. That&#39;s significantly slower than the much more powerful <a href=\"/apple-imac-21-5-inch-review\">Apple iMac</a> desktop we tested, which scored a 19,588. But that’s a rather unfair comparison since this is a moderately priced computer and the iMac is a top-of-the-line machine. You should decide what kind of computer best suits your needs and then compare those kinds of machines against each other for the best results. That said, this Acer did much better than the 8,446 average score for comparable laptops. You also get 256GB of solid-state storage, which is impressive for a computer this small.","Speaking of size, this laptop has a 15.6-inch screen, but the display output just isn&#39;t great. The 1080p resolution gives you a detailed image, but while we watched videos on it we noticed usually vibrant colors appeared dull. Colors look particularly dark when you tilt the screen downward a bit. Our screen brightness test showed it only puts out 200 nits of brightness, which falls below the category average of 229 nits from laptops like this one.","Also in our tests, the Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card did better on average than comparable notebooks, but this laptop simply isn&#39;t built for high-level gaming. We played Dirt 3, a racing game, and while it did play better than the category average, there are other computers out there better suited for gaming, like the Dell XPS 15.","No matter what you&#39;re using it for, the Aspire E 15 might get a little warm, so be careful if you&#39;re letting your children use it in their lap. In our tests we streamed 15 minutes of video and found the touchpad stayed at a cool 83 degrees Fahrenheit, but the underside and hinge area both got several degrees hotter than our 95-degree comfort threshold. It’s also pretty heavy for a laptop, weighing in at 4.9 pounds, so it’s not very comfortable to leave in your lap for long anyway. Although it gets pretty warm, you can count on the battery lasting all day. In our tests it lasted 9 hours and 20 minutes, making it one of the longest-lasting laptops we tested for home computer use."]},"id":"388ab093-1313-472d-8434-a0d18953f3c8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53851","url":"/acer-aspire-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-10-24T14:02:18Z","datePublished":"2011-10-24T14:02:18Z","name":"Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576G-5762","synopsis":"This laptop isn’t as cutting edge as some of the computers we tested, but it will handle the needs of most households.","review":{"rating":49,"verdict":"The Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576G-5762) offers impressive performance and useful features, like good battery life and a DVD drive, but is still affordable.","pros":["The battery lasts more than nine hours."],"cons":["It&#8217;s rather heavy."]},"strapline":"This laptop isn’t as cutting edge as some of the computers we tested, but it will handle the needs of most households.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-21T00:00:00Z","id":"6VWqP8NMhJmmkUXgVUmogH","meta":{"title":"Acer Aspire E 15 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576G-5762) offers impressive performance and useful features, like good battery life and a DVD drive, but is still affordable."},"products":[{"slug":"acer-aspire-e-15-e5-576g-5762","url":"/product/acer-aspire-e-15-e5-576g-5762","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","name":"Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576G-5762","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","id":"eYFdNpRvuQMMNaJ7tVvVQ9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/QXNnhyQ3obD2ui8uRumsQN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","mimeType":"","name":"9d87136eaaff3fe9bf41ec06ecf11d35.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/9d87136eaaff3fe9bf41ec06ecf11d35.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","id":"QXNnhyQ3obD2ui8uRumsQN","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXNnhyQ3obD2ui8uRumsQN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Acer Aspire E 15 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576G-5762) offers impressive performance and useful features, like good battery life and a DVD drive, but is still affordable."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/QXNnhyQ3obD2ui8uRumsQN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","mimeType":"","name":"9d87136eaaff3fe9bf41ec06ecf11d35.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/9d87136eaaff3fe9bf41ec06ecf11d35.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","id":"QXNnhyQ3obD2ui8uRumsQN","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXNnhyQ3obD2ui8uRumsQN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Acer Aspire E 15 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576G-5762) offers impressive performance and useful features, like good battery life and a DVD drive, but is still affordable."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/computers/desktops/best-home-computers/acer-aspire-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"computers","url":"/electronics/computers","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","name":"Computers","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:59:55Z","id":"o7A3TAPY7RTrVES9Lb9iRS","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
