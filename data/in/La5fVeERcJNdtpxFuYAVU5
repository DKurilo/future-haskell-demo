The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</a> here.</em>","The KitchenAid Architect II KHMS2040BSS over-the-range microwave is a standard unit with all of the basic features. It does not stand out in any way, but it is still a very decent appliance. While this unit is relatively expensive compared to similar models, the stellar warranty provides some extra peace of mind.","Although the KHMS2040BSS over-range microwave does not have convection cooking, the humidity sensors will come in handy when you&#39;re cooking commonly microwaved items. By sensing the amount of moisture in your food, the microwave will automatically adjust the cooking time to ensure your items reaches the proper temperature without over doing your food and drinks. Sensor-cooking options include popcorn, beverages, baked potato and dinner plate.","For foods that do not have sensor-cooking options, there are auto cook programs designed to manage certain foods, helping to eliminate some of the guesswork. And the warm hold will keep your food at the right temperature if you aren&#39;t ready to eat immediately.","If you find yourself eating a lot of leftovers, the sensor reheat will be a useful tool. Just like with sensor cooking, the over-range microwave will detect the amount of moisture in the air to make sure your leftovers are properly heated but not dried out. Sensor defrost will also thaw your frozen meats and veggies without cooking areas, as some microwaves with only auto defrost tend to do.","The size and power of the Architect II KHMS2040BSS are average. The exterior of this built-in microwave is average sized, and the interior has slightly more capacity than other models on our lineup with 2 cubic feet. The 1,000 watts of power and 10 power levels is right on par with similar models, and other models in the series have 1,200 watts if you&#39;re looking for more.","The ventilation system is standard and can be installed to vent to the outside of your home or recirculate and filter the air, depending on the design of your kitchen. It will pump the air at three different speeds with a maximum clearing power of 300 cubic feet per minute, which is typical of similar models. The fan starts automatically when it senses too much heat or smoke coming from your range, which is a feature we like to see.","This over-the-range microwave oven is pretty basic looking, but it is attractive in a simplistic way. It comes in three different colors – black, white and stainless steel – so you can match it with a number of different color schemes. The keypad is simple and easy to use, and the flat keys allow for easier cleaning.","The manufacturer&#39;s website is intuitive and easy to navigate. It has the phone number and email address for customer support, and it also has a live chat option, which is a helpful resource. What is really impressive and stands out among its competitors is this over-range&#39;s warranty. In addition to the standard one-year warranty on parts and labor, the manufacturer also offers a five-year warranty on the main cooking component – the magnetron – and on the parts of the touch-control system. Further, KitchenAid offers a 10-year warranty on the stainless steel interior."]},"id":"7ddc937d-ae4f-4d9f-aefd-d44d8e526bd0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f3e5d660-d994-4692-a039-dcaca23102a0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KitchenAid Architect II KHMS2040BSS has features and power that are about average, and the unit does not really stand out in anyway.
