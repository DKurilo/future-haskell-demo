For example, <a href=\"/kaspersky-review\">Kaspersky Anti-Virus</a> doesn’t include a personal firewall or parental controls, but the more expensive <a href=\"/kaspersky-review\">Kaspersky Internet Security</a> does.<strong><br/></strong>","Typically, internet security programs build on the same engine used in the developer’s antivirus software, so the level of protection doesn’t change with the more expensive internet security program. But this isn’t always the case. During our in-house tests we learned that <a href=\"/f-secure-review\">F-Secure Anti-Virus</a> isn’t as capable at stopping internet threats from downloading and infecting our computers as its internet security solution, <a href=\"/f-secure-review\">F-Secure Internet Security</a>. This is because the basic antivirus program lacks secure browsing features that are included with the other program.","One other difference between basic antivirus software and internet security suites is the number of user licenses you get. Most antivirus solutions come with a single license to protect one computer. Internet security suites, however, usually come with at least three licenses, and are sometimes compatible with mobile phones and tablets so you can protect multiple web-enabled devices at once.","<strong>What should internet security software come with?</strong>","Because internet security programs are a step up from basic antivirus software, they should include several additional malware protection and privacy tools – typically a personal firewall, a password manager and a system vulnerability scanner. These tools give you added protection against hackers and identity thieves who try to sneak into your system by swiping passwords, piggybacking on your internet connection or exploiting out-of-date software.","We spoke with Mitch Stephens, a security consultant with Emagined Security. He suggests that keeping your system and program patches up to date is a good way to stay secure from online threats. Programs, such as ESET and Avast, use vulnerability detection scans to make sure the most recent software versions are installed on your computer, and if not, they provide you with a legitimate link to where you can download the latest updates. Without these patches, hackers and ransomware can take advantage of these weak points and use them to attack your computer.","Parental controls are also good to have. These tools allow you to limit the time your child is online as well as block inappropriate content. They are also good for blocking cyberbullies and predators. Kaspersky Internet Security includes internet filter categories that make it easy to quickly block harmful content, including vulgarity, profanity and violence.","The best internet security software comes with multiple licenses or a single license that can be used to protect multiple computers or mobile devices at once. Sometimes, the only difference between a top-rated security program and the best premium security suite is the number of licenses you get.","<strong>How much does an internet security program cost?</strong>","Internet security software costs about $80 for a year subscription and should include a minimum of three user licenses. These programs are a step up from basic antivirus software, which costs less but typically doesn’t include advanced tools like a firewall, safe banking features or a password manager. Premium-grade software typically goes one step further to include all the security tools a developer has to offer. For example, Trend Micro Internet Security doesn’t include a password manager, but Trend Micro Maximum Security does.
