The warranty is long and the chair has many convenient features that make it an excellent choice for most buyers, as long as they can fit in it. The white glove delivery service isn’t as convenient as you’ll find with other chair manufacturers.","Like many other higher-end <a href=\"/best-chair-massagers\">massage chairs</a>, the Osaki OS-4000 uses a mixture of nodes, rollers and air bags to give full body massages and zero gravity massages. It has many features that add to user convenience. It offers eight preset options at the touch of a button. You can adjust the speed and intensity of your massage between five different levels to find the settings that fit you best. If you plan to share your chair with others, this helps ensure that you all find your preferred massage levels. The nodes run on an S-track system down your back, which is designed to follow the curve of your spine and give you consistent pressure throughout your massage.","The chair weighs 213 pounds and is best suited for individuals who are 6 feet 2 inches or shorter. When we contacted Osaki, we were informed that the maximum weight limit is 270 pounds, which makes it one of the sturdier products on the market. The chair features body scanning technology, which helps get the rollers in place to perfectly match your body type. There is also an auto leg scan feature, which extends the footrest to its full length before retracting again. When the footrest reaches the ideal position, you stop the retracting process by firmly pressing your feet down.","The chair comes in four different colors: black, brown, charcoal and cream. These color options make it easier to match the décor of your home or office. The chair is covered in PU material, which makes the massage experience softer. You can choose whether or not to have your lower back heated during a massage session. The airbags work your neck, sides, back, hips, arms, calves and feet. In addition to a full-sized control panel, this chair comes with a small remote control so you can adjust the chair&#39;s settings without sitting up from a reclined position.","The company offers free curbside delivery, though the chair comes boxed and unassembled. You can choose the white glove delivery option for an additional $250, but this only pays for someone to make an indoor delivery, remove the parts from the packaging and take the boxes away. You will still need to assemble the chair yourself. If you want the chair placed in a certain room or think you might have difficulty getting it up a flight of stairs, it might be worth the extra cost.","The Osaki OS-4000&#39;s remote control, ability to adjust intensity and speed, body scanning technology and auto leg scan feature all work together to create a customized massage. Since there are a variety of colors to choose from it should be easy to choose one that suits your tastes. The only downside to this chair is that even though Osaki&#39;s white glove delivery includes indoor delivery to any room, it does not include assembly. If you want a massage chair company that offers assembly, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/kahuna-review\">Kahuna LM6800</a>."]},"id":"692a7448-0618-4233-a13a-d456ee364b68","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69526","url":"/osaki-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-13T16:47:10Z","datePublished":"2017-07-13T16:47:10Z","name":"Osaki OS-4000","synopsis":"The Osaki OS-4000 is built to provide relaxation through customizable massages.
