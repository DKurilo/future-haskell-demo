Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because USAA has stopped selling extended vehicle warranties to its members. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","USAA is probably the only <a href=\"/best-extended-car-warranty-services\">extended car warranty provider</a> most people recognize.  This financial institution has been around since 1922 and serves military members and their families. Vehicle service contracts are only a small facet of what USAA offers, as this company also deals in insurance, investing, banking, real estate, health insurance and retirement plans. USAA has been really good at developing a devoted membership, but this membership requirement is also its one major downside. To be eligible for a USAA extended car warranty, you have to be eligible for membership, which means you or a parent must have served in the U.S. military.","<strong>Quoting Process</strong>","The quoting process USAA uses was undeniably the fastest and easiest to use, earning it an A+ grade. I was able to get full quotes on multiple vehicles in less than five minutes. You simply enter the year, make, model and mileage of your vehicle and it calculates the quote immediately. You can purchase the plan without taking a sales call. It&#39;s all done in the online portal. The only downside is you must have a USAA membership to access the quoting tool. That said, USAA is a great example of how services should approach the quoting process.","The plans I got quotes for were short-term 12-month or 24-month options with 12,000 and 24,000-mile terms. By comparison, most services, like <a href=\"/autopom-review\">Autopom</a> and <a href=\"/endurance-review\">Endurance</a>, quote 48-month, 100,000-mile plans. As a result, the total cost of USAA&#39;s plans was the most affordable by a significant margin, though the cost per mile covered was average at $0.05. However, these short-term contracts are ideal because they allow you to reevaluate your satisfaction with the coverage.","The max pay period was six months for every plan. Most vehicle service contracts let you spread out the payments over a 24-month period, making the monthly cost more affordable, but since USAA&#39;s short-term plans are lower, the monthly cost for the six-month period is about the same.","One of the best features of USAA is the no deductible, no down payment policy. Every other service I reviewed requires a $100 deductible on repairs.","<strong>Coverage Options</strong>","USAA sells just three coverage plans, administered by the United Service Protection Corp. It has a comprehensive plan and a manufacturer wrap plan for standard vehicles and one for diesel vehicles. The comprehensive plan is comparable to the exclusionary plans offered by other services, as it covers nearly every component. The manufacturer wrap plan, however, has better coverage than most basic powertrain plans.","The mileage and age limitations are more limited than most services. Your car can&#39;t be older than 10 years or have more than 115,000 miles to qualify for the comprehensive plan. By comparison, some services have plans to cover vehicles as old as 20 years and with as many as 250,000 miles. In addition, the manufacturer wrap protection plans require the vehicles still be under the manufacturer&#39;s powertrain warranty. In other words, these plans run concurrent and expire with the factory warranty and are designed to fill the gaps of the warranty. European-manufactured vehicles aren&#39;t eligible either.","<strong>Vehicle Service Contract</strong>","Since USAA only has three vehicle service contracts, the contracts don&#39;t vary much and the length is just eight pages with a total of about 5,700 words. By comparison, the average contract length I reviewed is about 13 pages and 10,000 words. With less to read, the contract is easier for potential consumer to carefully read and consider before committing to a plan. In addition, the formatting is well done with clear delineations between sections using black bars and a conservative use of bolded text, as the contract typically only bolds terms defined on the first page. By contract, many contracts I read were so overly bolded, I had a difficult time getting through. Some had entire sections of bolded text.","The rental car reimbursement policy USAA offers its members is impressive. If your car is in the repair shop and you need a rental car, USAA reimburses you up to $50 per day with a maximum of $250. In addition, you can be reimbursed $300 for trip interruptions, covering meals and hotel rooms if your car breaks down while you&#39;re on a road trip. The reimbursement policies are among the best. Most services only reimburse $30 per day for a rental car, about half of what most budget rental cars cost per day.","If you are in the military or have any connection to the military, USAA is a great option for an extended warranty. The quote process is fast and simple. The contracts are among the easiest and shortest to read, and USAA is a trusted organization with so much else to offer."]},"id":"35700cb5-82f2-4f81-bd6b-9e167abbcd1e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56945","url":"/usaa-extended-vehicle-protection-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-07-03T13:49:45Z","datePublished":"2013-07-03T13:49:45Z","name":"USAA Extended Vehicle Protection","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because USAA has stopped selling extended vehicle warranties to its members.","review":{"rating":87,"verdict":"While the available plans have much shorter terms than other services, USAA is a trusted financial institution with a great quoting process and excellent reimbursement policies.","pros":["The quoting process is fast and easy."],"cons":["You must be a USAA member to qualify."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because USAA has stopped selling extended vehicle warranties to its members.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","id":"Hd5SUhzhu84f8KBZoEwuqD","meta":{"title":"USAA Extended Vehicle Protection Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While the available plans have much shorter terms than other services, USAA is a trusted financial institution with a great quoting process and excellent reimbursement policies."},"products":[{"slug":"usaa-extended-vehicle-protection","url":"/product/usaa-extended-vehicle-protection","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","name":"USAA Extended Vehicle Protection","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","id":"mwPBU2GYfwaVjv9kjqUgwJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5Bm9umr7qijJ8EtMU9AKaM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","mimeType":"","name":"0c87feafcc42f8e00bb0537677d97e8a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/0c87feafcc42f8e00bb0537677d97e8a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","id":"5Bm9umr7qijJ8EtMU9AKaM","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Bm9umr7qijJ8EtMU9AKaM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"USAA Extended Vehicle Protection Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While the available plans have much shorter terms than other services, USAA is a trusted financial institution with a great quoting process and excellent reimbursement policies."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5Bm9umr7qijJ8EtMU9AKaM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","mimeType":"","name":"0c87feafcc42f8e00bb0537677d97e8a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/0c87feafcc42f8e00bb0537677d97e8a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","id":"5Bm9umr7qijJ8EtMU9AKaM","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Bm9umr7qijJ8EtMU9AKaM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"USAA Extended Vehicle Protection Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While the available plans have much shorter terms than other services, USAA is a trusted financial institution with a great quoting process and excellent reimbursement policies."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/auto/best-extended-car-warranty-services/usaa-extended-vehicle-protection-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:31:05Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
