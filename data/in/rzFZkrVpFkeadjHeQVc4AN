After all, every other feature of your camera depends on it. What good is built-in Wi-Fi if you can&#39;t even capture clear images?","Fortunately, this isn&#39;t an issue for the Ti400, which comes with a 320 x 240-pixel thermal imaging sensor. This is the highest resolution in our lineup. It means you can get better definition, detail and clarity in a wider variety of situations than you would with most other infrared cameras.","The Ti400 also features an onboard 5-megapixel digital camera you can use to capture normal images at the same time you capture infrared ones. The Fluke can combine these images, overlaying thermal information atop the standard image. You can also capture standard images separately and use them to add context to your current project.","To ensure that these high-res infrared images come out looking sharp, the camera is equipped with an autofocus system. In certain situations, however, it&#39;s nice to focus manually. Thankfully, you can deactivate the autofocus if you want to take control.","The Ti400 has one major flaw in its imaging performance. The issue is file format. Rather than utilizing radiometric JPGs, which can open on nearly any platform, the Fluke uses its proprietary IS2 format to store thermal data. While this doesn&#39;t affect the actual quality of your images, because clients and coworkers who don&#39;t have Fluke&#39;s software can&#39;t open the files, it does make them more difficult to share."]},"id":"a83a2867-4bdc-4048-8142-fef68efedaf0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Thermal Precision"},"id":"5826cdf4-09e4-4c02-97fe-61a8cbc16f6d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/TyrasLPMd46DWjRuuBM4RE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60689-fluke-ti4005.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyrasLPMd46DWjRuuBM4RE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"TyrasLPMd46DWjRuuBM4RE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyrasLPMd46DWjRuuBM4RE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9540d882-b40f-4e44-827e-bb2b8ccb9f84","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like other top infrared cameras, this device is sensitive to gradations of 0.05 degrees Celsius.
