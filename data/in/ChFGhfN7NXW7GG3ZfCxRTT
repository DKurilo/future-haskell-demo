You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Boyo VTC424 is a wireless <a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">backup camera</a>. It lacks night vision, but other than that, it has everything you&#39;ll need to reverse more safely. It comes with a 4.3-inch color monitor that has a built-in wireless receiver and plugs into your vehicle&#39;s cigarette light port.","Like most rear-view cameras, the Boyo is bar shaped and screws in above your license plate. You won&#39;t need to drill any holes to mount the camera; you can use the screws that hold your license plate in place.","The most interesting feature of this camera is its built-in wireless transmitter. Most wireless backup cameras have a separate transmitter that sits in your trunk and is connected to the camera via a cable that provides both video and power. However, the Boyo has a built-in transmitter.","Unfortunately, unlike some competing systems, the camera doesn&#39;t have a battery, instead relying on power from your vehicle. This means that you&#39;ll still have to drill a hole behind your license plate and thread the power cables into the trunk, where you can connect them to your reverse light&#39;s power source. This somewhat mitigates the advantage of the camera having a built-in transmitter.","The transmitter has a range of 67 feet, which is more than adequate for vehicles of all sizes. The transmitter and receiver have an interesting design feature that makes them interference-proof. Most rear-view cameras transmit an RF signal over the 2.4GHz frequency. This makes them susceptible to signal-degrading interference from smartphones and other portable electronics.","However, the Boyo transmits using a Wi-Fi direct connection between the transmitter and receiver. This connection is digital, and thus immune to any interference.","The Boyo lacks infrared LEDs to provide night vision. Most cameras we reviewed have this feature, which makes the camera a bit more useful.","It does have a wide, 130-degree viewing angle. This is a bit wider than most cameras we reviewed, so even if you drive a large vehicle, you&#39;ll still get complete coverage."]},"id":"11bbf314-46db-4cb2-8cf3-dbc6009510c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ef44d0b1-c208-449a-93d6-6af9d68ec1db","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Boyo VTC424 lacks the night vision most rear-view cameras provide, but it does provide everything else you&#39;ll need.
