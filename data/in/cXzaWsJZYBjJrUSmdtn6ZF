While the pen is the closest in size to a typical ballpoint pen, its inconsistency is frustrating. When it works as it should, it captures your handwriting accurately. Unfortunately, the pen often fails to capture pen strokes at all, though it&#39;s unclear if the issue is the result of a faulty pen or a faulty pad.","Once you&#39;ve captured your notes or sketches, a USB cord connects to your computer to upload your digital pages to the DigiMemo Manager. From there you can organize, archive and edit your notes. The optical character recognition software MyScript is included to convert your handwritten notes to editable text. Unfortunately, MyScript is only included as a 30-day trial.","The DigiMemo Form software is where this electronic pen really shines. This software allows you to create customized data-entry forms that you can print, write on and sync back to the form in the program, leaving you with a physical copy and a digital copy.","For example, you can create a customer survey for your business. The information that your customers fill-out will be recorded to a digital page that will sync with the version in the software. This eliminates manual data-entry, saving time and money. This is great for maintenance reports, order forms, patient files or any form that requires a physical and digital copy.","The DigiMemo L2 is compatible with Microsoft programs. You can save files as PDF, TIF, BMP, JPG, GIF or PNG and work in any program that supports those files. You can even write directly in OneNote or send handwritten emails in Outlook.","The battery life for the DigiMemo topped our review with up to 14 months for the pen and 80 hours of use for the digital pad, which uses AAA batteries. You can also use the digital pad like a tablet pen when connected to your computer, though it lacks pressure levels sensitivity like other tablet pens. There are several buttons along the side of the digital pad that act as shortcuts.","The customer support for this digital pen is disappointing. The Contact link on the website doesn&#39;t work at all, forcing you to search through the website for an email or phone number if you have any questions or concerns. There isn&#39;t a FAQs  page, tutorials or online forums. There isn&#39;t even a Support section. In addition, you also have to contact a sales representative, through email, if you want to purchase products directly from the company."]},"id":"6fd7e344-cf4f-4a94-99a3-7f6e45ef890f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a37693aa-b14b-4431-8b30-435df720fc56","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The DigiMemo L2 is a digital clipboard and pen that captures your pen strokes as you write with ink across a sheet of paper.
