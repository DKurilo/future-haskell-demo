Email is simply not up to the task of project management. Task management software, on the other hand, not only lets managers delegate specific assignments but also creates a cloud-stored project base where the entire team can see the steps needed for completion, track progress, load and collaborate on files, and communicate with each other within the project. With mobile and computer-based interfaces and cloud storage, task manager software makes it easy to keep the team in the loop and on track to make your next big project a success.","All of the programs on our list have task delegation tools and collaboration features that make them suitable for program management in small or large businesses or other organizations. Each has additional features that made it stand out. For example, with <a href=\"#Todoist\">Todoist</a>, you can set reminders not only by time, but also by location, making it handy for companies who have projects whose parts are in multiple locations. A couple applications include a rewards system for giving quick kudos, while some have Gantt charts for visualizing timelines and core processes. Nearly all of these come with a free version, but the paid versions have more features and allow for greater interaction among team members.","Nonetheless, the products listed here are simpler versions targeted at project completion rather than full-out project and employee management. A few, such as <a href=\"#hiTask\">hiTask</a>, also have timers and accounting features like the ability to record billable hours. However, if you need a truly robust system that includes budgeting, request management, portfolio management, and <a href=\"/money/small-business\">employee scheduling</a> and tracking, check out our <a href=\"/money/small-business\">online project management reviews</a>.","<strong>Task Management Software: What to Look For</strong>","Each business has different processes and thus different needs for a task management solution. However, regardless of whether you create in-depth marketing for a client or design custom bicycles, you need software that lets you communicate easily, tracks your progress, holds important documents and responds to collaborators and clients. Thus, you should consider these aspects when evaluating a task manager program:","<strong>Simplicity</strong><br/>No matter how many exciting tools a task management program has, it&#39;s worthless unless everyone can use it. The best software is easy to work, with the most common tasks readily available, plain-language scheduling, and clear menus and search functions. Most have a simple to-do list/project organization, but some have different approaches. <a href=\"#DropTask\">DropTask</a>, for example, employs a mind-mapping approach that is colorful and visually appealing. Several, like <a href=\"#Basecamp\">Basecamp</a>, can store projects as templates, so that if you have specific products you create again and again, you can call up the template rather than reinventing it.","Several, like <a href=\"#Asana\">Asana</a>, allow you to not only have a team section for assigning tasks but also a personal section for errands and home projects. This not only allows you to clear your mind of tasks that need to be done later, but it also keeps them in one central interface so you don&#39;t have to switch programs or lists between work and home.","<strong>Task &amp; Reminder Setting</strong><br/>Task creation, delegation and reminders are the core of any program, so look for the interactivity and convenience tools that best suit your needs. Some, like DropTask, let you tie a task to multiple projects so when you cross off one task, you see the project&#39;s progress toward completion. <a href=\"#Mavenlink\">Mavenlink </a>lets you set alerts so that if a task is dependent on the completion of another task, the person responsible gets pinged when the required item is completed.","<a href=\"#Workboard\">Workboard</a> takes tasks and projects one step further by aligning them to company goals and metrics. That way, employees see how their daily action items contribute to the overall health of the company as a goal.","<strong>Collaboration with Employees &amp; Customers</strong><br/>Most productivity experts say the key to <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5352-smart-leadership.html\">effectively managing your time is to delegate tasks</a>. You can find plenty of articles about choosing which tasks are best to delegate and how to motivate your employees and coworkers. Team task management tools help you practice those principles. They let you create tasks, assign them to others, set deadlines and include notes. They store all the necessary electronic materials, such as files, charts, images and videos, in the project or task itself so things are easy to find and access.","The best task management software should also provide ways to communicate among team members, and some allow communication outside the team. <a href=\"#Producteev\">Producteev</a>, for example, allows you to set followers who do not have editing capability but can see the team progress and participate in conversations. Flow uses a unique function similar to Facebook&#39;s Like button so people can acknowledge they have read a notification without having to comment on it.","<strong>Reports &amp; Status Updates</strong><br/>While all task management software tracks project completion, businesses need more: a way to send status updates managers or clients, report generation tools to display overall progress and identify stopgaps, and charts that show deadlines and the relationships between tasks. Most of the software we profiled have some form of reporting, and a few have several report types plus export features so you can use the graphics and data when presenting to a client or briefing at your monthly update meeting. In fact, some of the companies we looked at suggest that with these tools, bosses can generate the reports at will and forego the meeting altogether.","<strong>Integration with Other Software &amp; Mobile Devices</strong><br/>Experts say that one issue with mobile devices is that people always feel pinned to their job, receiving pings about this or that task while they&#39;re unable to do anything about them. This is because often the tools they need are locked in the office computer, or the individual needs a specific program or contact they donâ€™t have on hand. By keeping everything stored in the project itself, task management software allows you to get the information you need to finish urgent tasks or to create or pass on a reminder to complete the action item the next business day.","Since the goal of task management software is to have everything needed for a project in a central location all collaborators can access, it&#39;s important that it works with third-party programs. Nearly all have functionality with Google programs like Gmail and Google Drive, but many integrate with Outlook, Dropbox, Evernote, and the best integrate with the most-used business software like QuickBooks and Salesforce. Wrike, in particular, is a powerhouse with 35 integrations.","Email collaboration is losing its efficiency in the cloud-based and increasingly mobile business environment. Task management software meets the needs of modern businesses by providing an easy-to-use and widely accessible platform for planning and collaborating on projects. With the right software, your company can save time, improve the quality of its work and make your customers happier.","<strong>Asana Review</strong>"]},"id":"fb9bad13-05e7-4280-8507-e912e35ca41d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/wYSw3Dzpq2VKuTgsrZf4cL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Asana&#39;s website says, &#34;Run your day, your team and your company.&#34; This task management software can work for personal task management, but its larger focus and company-oriented tools make it better suited for project management on a team level.

You can also assign priorities in order to organize your day. If you are on your email and come across something you need to remember or have someone else take care of, you can assign a task on Asana through the email.","Asana also has a conversation feature so that you can discuss a task within the task itself instead of in an email chain or other unassociated program. This makes sure conversations, instructions and files are all kept with the task they relate to, making it easier for you or your teammates to have all the information right at hand.","This software has a calendar function for seeing your tasks by the week or month. The dashboard tool gives teams and supervisors a high-level view of projects, tasks and priorities. If you need to put any of the information into different forms, such as a Gantt chart to track program progress and projections, you can integrate Asana with the Instagantt app. In fact, this task management software integrates with 37 other apps and programs from calendars to customer support software like Zendesk to email programs in case you just can&#39;t escape the email. With Zapier, you can forge connections to other apps as well.","The price for Asana varies by how many users you want to integrate. You&#39;ll find a sliding price bar on the website or can contact the company if your business has over 100 employees.","Asana is a robust program with strong project-management features.

This feature can help if you have many irons in the fire, but only a few that currently need your attention. There&#39;s also a calendar tab for deadlines and other important events as well as vacation notifications.","Clicking on a project takes you to the discussion and task section. Adding a task takes just a few clicks, and you can assign it to someone and set a deadline either when creating the task or later. You can also open a task to add notes, upload files, and notify people by typing in their email address or clicking on their name if they are involved in the project. You can also send files to a specific task via email or over your mobile device.","You can make templates for recurring projects. However, you cannot make recurring tasks or repeating deadlines. Templates can be modified for individual projects from within the project.","Basecamp has 20 different apps, but most are just different ways of running the program on your phone. There are a couple that add functionality, such as generating reports or syncing with Outlook. Neither the program nor its apps let you track time spent on a task, however.","You can find useful help features, including how-to videos and live lessons on using the program. There are FAQs and help guides, and you can contact support by an online contact form or through Twitter.","Basecamp&#39;s use as a personal task management solution is a bit limited.

The mind-map style allows you to put small tasks inside bigger projects and to show relationships between tasks so that you can see how accomplishing one item influences the progress of other projects. The unique interface puts tasks in circles, and those circles inside larger project circles. You can drag and drop circles into other circles and to group circles as well. Within a task circle, you have tabs with the icons of the people assigned to it, the due date, flags for priorities, importance and other attributes, and the files or notes attached to the tasks.","In addition, you can have arrows to link related tasks. For example, say you want to make a cake for a party. The cake is listed in the Party project, but the shopping is in the Errands for Friday project. With the link, you can put the ingredients you need to get from the shopping list and link it to the cake in the party project. It&#39;s also good feature when delegating tasks, because people can see how their efforts impact the bigger picture. This feature, called Task Dependencies, is only available with the Pro version.","As with most task management software, DropTask lets you assign due dates and priorities, and delegate to someone else. In addition, you can set the status (whether it&#39;s stopped, paused, in progress, and, of course, completed), its importance to the project and the projected effort required to complete the task. These extra tools can help you in planning your day. For example, if you know your most productive times are in the morning, you may want to start your day doing an important task that takes a lot of effort rather than an easy task that&#39;s marked as a priority but which you can quickly complete in the afternoon.","The large circles aren&#39;t as easy to see on a small screen, like with a smartphone, and some people prefer a more straightforward list rather than the colorful mind map. DropTask can convert to a traditional view for linear viewing by date or priority, and back to the mind-map to see the holistic view.","Both the free and Pro version integrate with Outlook, but the Pro version has other features, such as unlimited file attachments and project templates, so you can save a project format to use again. The Pro version also integrates with Evernote, Google Tasks and Calendar, and iMindMap.","DropTask provides a visual and fluid way to organize your tasks and set up projects. It lets you set priorities and due dates, but also has tools for noting the task&#39;s importance and the effort it requires.

Due dates are especially easy because you can set a single or recurring date using plain language such as &#34;Monday at 8 a.m.&#34; or &#34;every first Monday at 8 a.m.&#34; The software has tools to color-code tasks or projects and set labels and tags to make it easy to find. You can also add priorities, both via the dashboard or with the !! code. For example, !!1 makes a task priority 1.","You can set reminders to be sent by email or SMS. This task manager also offers location-dependent reminders. This is a great feature for when you have errands that aren&#39;t time dependent, such as picking up something from a specialty store. It&#39;s also useful for reminding yourself to do something once you get to the office after leaving an off-site meeting or business lunch. Location-aware reminders can be managed from any platform, including Outlook, but trigger to your mobile device.","You can add files or photos to the tasks. Photos can be added straight from your phone using the Todoist app. You can also use the app to send photos to others on a project. Todoist also has the ability to have conversations within a task.","For those who like to track their productivity, Todoist Karma is a visual tracking system that monitors your task management activities and displays your productivity trends.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Workboard Review</strong>"]},"id":"36754be7-46b9-4ee9-8e2a-132e36d28a4d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/kMNN6YjjK8hHhQmbmYpWdb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Workboard&#39;s team task management software does more than create projects and tasks: You can set short-term goals and define metrics for success.
