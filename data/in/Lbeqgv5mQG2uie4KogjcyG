The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about internet service providers <a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">here</a>.</em>","PeoplePC has had a rocky past, even after EarthLink purchased it, including entering into an Assurance of Discontinuance with the Attorney General of the State of New York in 2007 over misleading advertising. When we first reviewed this service in 2006, we noticed quite an extensive list of consumer complaints online concerning billing and unsubscribing. In the last few years, those complaints have continued to come in. However, to be fair, <a href=\"/best-internet-service-providers\">internet service providers</a> and cable services commonly receive an above-average volume of complaints and land on top of the worst customer service lists. In fact, other ISPs such as Comcast, Time Warner and AT&amp;T are on the same type of lists as the Department of Motor Vehicles for bad customer service. With all of this in mind, we decided to give PeoplePC a chance just like its competitors.","One thing that PeoplePC has successfully been able to provide is cheap dial-up internet service. The entry-level dial-up plan comes with email protection for up to four email addresses. It also comes with spam controls and a pop-up blocker, but this involves downloading PeoplePC&#39;s toolbar. PeoplePC also offers Symantec email virus protection. However, it does not provide internet security software or parental controls with the dial-up service, though the internet security software comes with a DSL service subscription. PeoplePC does offer a plan called Security Plus Dial-Up that costs more than just dial-up, but it includes antivirus, antispyware, a firewall and phishing protection. PeoplePC offers dial-up services nationwide, and you can easily check on the website to see if there are dial up access numbers available in your area.","The company also provides DSL services, which is called high-speed internet on the website. However, do not confuse this with cable internet. DSL still transfers via a telephone line and is slower than cable or fiber internet connections. When we looked for services for eight test addresses to get an idea of how many dial up access numbers might be available, we were pleased to discover that PeoplePC offers DSL services in rural locations. DSL is a good option for rural consumers since it can provide connections fast enough to enjoy the media common to modern websites, including streaming music and playing games. PeoplePC&#39;s DSL service includes the Internet Security Pack and eight email addresses with your subscription."]},"id":"f0c5383c-6b38-4677-ad62-0c791b9bbcad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3a6d4705-ff2c-47cc-819c-d357df30454a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We cannot state that PeoplePC is one of the best DSL or dial up providers.
