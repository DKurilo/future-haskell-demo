The line ranges from basic exercise machines to fully equipped cross trainers with a wide selection of extra features and accessories.","If you are not interested in lots of frills, the Vision X10 is a sturdy, basic elliptical cross trainer that can give you quite a worthwhile exercise session to strengthen various muscle groups and your cardiovascular system.","You get seven pre-programmed workouts with this elliptical trainer: manual, muscle toner, intervals, fat burn, incline, rolling hills and mountain. You can alter any one of these by changing the resistance levels, which extend from zero to 16.","You can track your progress by checking your heart rate through sensors on the device&#39;s stationary bars. You also can see such things as the time spent working out, calories expended and distance traveled on the LCD screen. Stay hydrated by keeping your water bottle in the handy holder and read to pass the time by propping books or magazines on the built-in reading rack.","There are a couple of drawbacks to the basic elliptical. Its stride length is set at 20 inches and the incline cannot be changed either. For many people, a 20-inch stride works fine, but for individuals who are very short or very tall, a fixed stride could prove troublesome.","The flywheel on this elliptical is 21 pounds and is fully enclosed, which is an important safety feature for people with small children in the home. The Vision X10 is 75 inches long, 26 inches wide and 66 inches high, and it weighs in at 188 pound. Thus, it is overall a good-sized and solid device. It can handle workouts by someone who weighs as much as 300 pounds.","When you buy this elliptical cross trainer, you get a lifetime warranty on the frame, a three-year warranty for parts and a one-year warranty for labor."]},"id":"37d83cad-2566-4fda-9830-d51555c8f3e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0c83b600-f889-463f-80bd-1b7857e1edd3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although you do not get many extras with the Vision X10 elliptical, it can provide a smooth and solid workout that will help you work your way toward your individual fitness goals."]},"id":"74e5bb0a-92d6-4949-ac3e-c3706e2a9dc9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58400","url":"/vision-x-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-10T21:12:38Z","datePublished":"2013-12-10T21:12:38Z","name":"Vision X10","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
