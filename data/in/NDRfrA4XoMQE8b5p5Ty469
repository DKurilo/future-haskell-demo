The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/auto/best-in-dash-navigation-systems/\">In-Dash Navigation Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Clarion NX405 is an affordable in-dash navigation system with built-in maps and some basic smartphone connectivity. It has a 6.2-inch resistive touchscreen.","This GPS has premium navigation, with TomTom providing the maps and over 11 million points of interest in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Unlike the very best in-dash systems, though, the NX405 does not have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, the latest developments in smartphone integration. However, it does offer HDMI and Bluetooth-enabled smartphone connectivity.","The HDMI connection allows you to mirror your phone&#39;s screen on the NX405. You can&#39;t use the NX405&#39;s screen to interact with the apps, though; you&#39;ll have to still use the smartphone&#39;s touchscreen.","Bluetooth allows you to make and receive hands-free phone calls. You can also play music from your smartphone directly on the head unit. Bluetooth enables Pandora internet radio playback that you can control on the NX405.","Unlike every other in-dash navigation unit we reviewed, the Clarion NX405 does not have a built-in satellite radio tuner. You&#39;ll have to pay extra to purchase a compatible tuner and then subscribe to a satellite radio service.","Like all the in-dash navigation units we reviewed, the NX405 can play DVDs and CDs. It also has an SD card slot. You can put music on the SD card and then play songs off it using the head unit&#39;s touchscreen. It can play MP3s and high-resolution FLAC files via this method. It also is one of the only head units we reviewed with a front-facing auxiliary input.","While the ability to play FLAC files is a huge positive for a music fan, the NX405&#39;s inability to receive HD radio signals is unfortunate. Many FM radio stations broadcast in HD as well as standard definition, and most of the in-dash GPS units we reviewed can pick up these stations."]},"id":"7b9f6409-3d0e-4393-a789-33124dc98bc8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e617c318-3217-4391-9b23-8a9ce1ef907f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Clarion NX405 is not feature-rich, but it is affordable and does offer all of the essential features for an aftermarket in-dash navigation system.
