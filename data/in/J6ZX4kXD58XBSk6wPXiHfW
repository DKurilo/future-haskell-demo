But it’s still difficult to find good clips, quotes and sound effects from your favorite movies and TV shows. So we’ve compiled a list of the best websites for finding free sound effects, free movie and TV quotes and free theme songs for all your multimedia needs. Whether you are creating a PowerPoint presentation, creating a photo slideshow or making a home movie, our list of websites will help you find the right clip.","<strong>Top 5 Movie and TV Quote Websites</strong>","These websites offer quotes and sound bites from a large selection of movies and TV shows. Some of the movie themes may only be partial clips. A few of these websites also have some great resources like pictures, bios and other added information.","1. <a href=\"http://www.moviewavs.com/\">www.moviewavs.com</a>","This website is by far one of the best when it comes to movie quotes. The list of movies is extensive and the number of quotes for each movie is pretty large. The list of quotes from TV shows and cartoons is shorter but still comprehensive. Occasionally, a clip of a song or theme from movies and shows will be included. One of the things we liked most about the site is that all quotes are offered in both WAV and MP3 formats.","2. <a href=\"http://www.moviesoundclips.net/index.php\">www.moviesoundclips.net/index.php</a>","This website is one of the best resources on this list because it has such a broad spectrum of sounds. There are large lists of audio quotes from movies and TV, and some of the shows even have clips of music or theme songs. The list of sound effects is shorter than most but still has some great entries. And as a bonus, the site also has a small collection of audio quotes from the American political stage, including Truman, Clinton, Reagan, Roosevelt and more. All sound files come in WAV format.","3. <a href=\"http://www.reelclassics.com/index.html\">www.reelclassics.com/index.html</a>","The entire website is an incredible treasure trove of information, pictures, videos, biographies and more about classic movies and actors. For audio clips, go to the link along the top called “AV Gallery.” This will take you to links for audio quotes and theme songs from the movie. The songs are only short clips, but the list is comprehensive. For the most part, quotes come in WAV format and music in MP3.","4. <a href=\"http://archer2000.tripod.com/1900.html\">archer2000.tripod.com/1900.html</a>","This website is more of a hodgepodge than the others on this list. It focuses more on history, pop culture and politics rather than movies and TV. But there are some real gems hiding in this website. There are quotes from famous men, politicians and entertainers or clips from news reports about famous events. You can also find clips of popular songs listed by decade, and the occasional clip from TV or movies. Files usually come in WAV format.","5. <a href=\"http://www.wavplanet.com/\">www.wavplanet.com</a>","Using this site to its full potential may be difficult because the full list of features is only available to members who sign up with the site. Nevertheless, there are quite a few resources open to nonmembers. Movie quotes, TV quotes and sound effects are all open to nonmembers. Joining the site will open up access to theme songs and clips of comedians. Files usually come in WAV format, though some come in MP3."," ","<strong>Top 5 TV Theme Song Websites</strong>","Websites in this category specialize in theme songs more than quotes. These sites have theme songs from daytime soap operas, primetime sitcoms, Saturday morning cartoons and many more shows.","1. <a href=\"http://www.melaman2.com/tvshows/\">www.melaman2.com/tvshows/</a>","If you want an impressive list of theme songs from any TV show you can think of, this website is probably your best bet. Ignore the tacky site design and color palette because this site has an exhaustive list of theme songs from every single show we love and quite a few we have never even heard of. Most of the files come in MP3 format.","2.  <a href=\"http://www.sitcomsonline.com/\">www.sitcomsonline.com</a>","This site specializes just in sitcoms; don’t bother looking here for clips from your favorite drama. The list of sitcoms is extensive, but not all of them include a link to a sound clip. So you will find clips from popular programs, but obscure or new sitcoms won’t have audio clips. Files are available in WAV and MP3 formats (though not every show will have files in both formats).","3. <a href=\"http://www.wavethemes.org/listing.html\">www.wavethemes.org/listing.html</a>","This site isn’t too pretty and is a little hard to navigate, but it has a huge selection of theme songs from primetime shows, sitcoms, gameshows, soap operas, cartoons and more. Files come in WAV format.","4. <a href=\"http://www.surf.to/commercials\">www.surf.to/commercials</a>","This is the best site to visit if you’re looking for quotes and jingles from commercials, especially commercials from big-name companies. Files come in WAV format.","5. <a href=\"http://timstvshowcase.com/\">timstvshowcase.com/</a>","This site is actually dedicated more towards information on TV shows and cast members than audio files. But if you look hard enough, almost every site for every show has a link about halfway down the page for a clip of the theme song. This site covers a lot more than just sitcoms and dramas; there are clips from news shows and other types of programming too. Files come in WAV format."," ","<strong>Top 3 Sound Effects Websites</strong>","These websites have a large variety of high quality sound effects from many different categories. These sound effects can be added to audio or video files to make them seem more professional or to improve the soundtrack.","1. <a href=\"http://www.findsounds.com/\">www.findsounds.com/</a>","This site doesn’t have a catalog of sounds, but it’s still extremely useful because it allows you to search for sound effects all over the internet. File formats can depend on what you search for.","2. <a href=\"http://www.stonewashed.net/sfx.html\">www.stonewashed.net/sfx.html</a>","This site catalogs a long list of websites that provide free sound effects. Each site has a list of the sound effects categories they provide and the file formats.","3. <a href=\"http://www.vionline.com/sound.html\">www.vionline.com/sound.html</a>","The sound effects page on this website has a shorter list of sound effects than many other sites but has a wide range of sounds, making it useful for a lot of different projects and presentations. Files come in WAV format."]},"id":"ff2a74a3-7625-40b2-a4f0-1009427f8fd1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_691","url":"/toptenreviews-best-websites-for-free-sound-clips","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"dan-hope","url":"/author/dan-hope","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Dan Hope","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"ciX3esGRJxxonvFVhNC6p6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2016-01-15T23:02:00Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Best Websites for Free Sound Clips","synopsis":"As music download services, like iTunes and Rhapsody, have become popular on the Internet, finding the right song has become a lot easier.","review":{},"strapline":"As music download services, like iTunes and Rhapsody, have become popular on the Internet, finding the right song has become a lot easier.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-01-15T23:02:00Z","id":"J6ZX4kXD58XBSk6wPXiHfW","meta":{"title":"Top Ten Reviews Best Websites for Free Sound Clips","description":"&nbsp; &nbsp; As music download services, like iTunes and Rhapsody, have become popular on the Internet, finding the right song has become a lot easier.
