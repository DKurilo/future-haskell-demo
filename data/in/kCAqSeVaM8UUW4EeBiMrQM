This type of microphone tends to be more sensitive than standard microphones and will pick up every sound around it, no matter how small. Using a filter can help eliminate some of the background noises. However, starting with a completely silent room is essentials since a studio condenser microphone is so sensitive it is capable of picking up small nuances and tones that other microphones can t. Condenser microphone models include the <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">Shure SM27 Multi-Purpose Microphone</a>, the <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">Avantone CV-12</a> and the <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">Rode M5</a>.","<strong>Condenser Microphones: What to Look For</strong>","While all condenser microphones work the same way, there are a few key points to look for when purchasing one. The microphone s mount is important, as it determines how much extra noise and vibration it picks up while recording. The accessibility of filters is also a key consideration, as filters help minimize extra sounds while speaking directly into the microphone. Power consumption is another vital factor. Some condenser microphones require more power than a simple USB port can supply.","<strong>Mounting Types</strong><br/>There are two different condenser microphone mounts to consider. The first is a standard hard mount. This type connects directly to both the microphone and the stand, but can pick up vibrations from the floors and microphone stand itself. Alternatively, some microphones come with a shock mount, which cradles the microphone between a set of bands that stabilize it and prevent it from picking up vibrations.","<strong>Pop Filters &amp; Windscreens</strong><br/>Because of the sensitive nature of condenser microphones, they can pick up external noises easily. Nearby environmental sounds, such as air conditioners, fans and computers, can be picked up and recorded, even if it s not loud enough for you to hear yourself. Pop filters help remove these sounds. A good filter can also help keep your vocals in check by preventing loud  s  and  p  sounds. Windscreens also perform the same function but fit over the studio microphones instead of clamping to the microphone or stand.","<strong>Power Needs</strong><br/>Some studio condenser microphones require only minimal power and you can use them with just a standard USB port. Others, however, need more power than a USB port can supply. These require either an external power source or an audio interface. The advantage of using an audio interface with a high-quality microphone is the ability to fine-tune the sound and levels before they make it to the recording device or computer.","<strong>Polar Patterns &amp; Proximity Effect</strong><br/>Certain types of condenser microphones exhibit different patterns that alter the way the sound records. Polar patterns determine the direction in which the microphone picks up the most sound. An omni-directional microphone picks up sounds from all around, with equal sensitivity. A bi-directional mic is sensitive at the front and rear, but sounds from the sides are ignored. Cardioid microphones pick up sound mainly at the front, partially to the sides, and ignore sounds coming from the rear. A multi-polar pattern mic allows you to switch between directional sensitivity patterns, which increases versatility.","The term proximity effect refers to an increase in the low-frequency response, or bass, when a sound comes from a source very close to the microphone. Essentially, it&#39;s a distortion caused by the use of ports to create directional polar patterns. Because of this, omni-directional mics are not affected by any proximity effect.","Regardless of the specific condenser microphone you re looking for, there are a number of models and types available. Knowing what features you need can help you narrow down your choices to select the right microphone for your needs."]},"id":"dc528e0b-1e51-44f0-9085-74517ee81857","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"ae4c2bac-7863-42fb-85e0-954a580ac69c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GHY8QA/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66308[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">AKG</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTNKNG/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66306[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Audio-Technica</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U7ANU4/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66312[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Avantone</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006DIA77E/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66309[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Blue Microphones</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O656GS/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66313[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">CAD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002GIRP2/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66314[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">MXL</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RUI3SS/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66305[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">MXL V87</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067NX0G/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66311[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Neumann</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GJW0JGI/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66310[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Rode</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039YQDXC/?&tag=ttr_condenser-microphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1537[art|NA[pid|66307[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Shure</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a2064640-f88f-43cc-a5d3-e2c20198302c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1537","url":"/best-condenser-microphones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T23:12:03Z","datePublished":"2015-08-24T16:45:11Z","name":"Condenser Microphones Review","synopsis":"A condenser microphone offers a full range of sound with sensitive recording capabilities while giving studio-quality audio.
