We focused our research on travel sites that take the place of travel agencies by offering entire vacation packages, not just flights or hotel stays. If you’re just looking to book a hotel room, look at our top picks for <a href=\"/best-hotel-booking-services\">hotel booking services</a>.","Full-service travel sites can book flights, hotel stays, rental cars, cruises and fun activities in your destination city. Additionally, the best sites let you mix and match reservations, and we rated companies that let us mix and match reservations higher than those that offer stricter packages.","Top Ten Reviews has been reviewing tech products and software for over a decade. We’ve published reviews about online travel sites since 2006.","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","We compared travel booking sites by performing similar travel searches on each site and seeing what reservation options were. We awarded a percentage score to sites that could find the best reservations. We also downloaded mobile apps for each site that offered an app and judged the usability and features of the app.","We also judged each site by the number of airlines it displayed in a basic flight search. If a site showed nine or more airlines it received a top score.","We also compared help and support options for each of the companies we researched. If a site had a FAQs page, live chat and phone and email support, it ranked highest. Additionally, we ranked each site on usability and navigability. Sites that allowed for flexible date searching and that let you register for price alerts on saved travel searches fared better in our comparison than those that didn’t.","<strong>Should You Book Online or Through a Travel Agent? </strong>","According to the <a href=\"https://www.asta.org/\">American Society of Travel Agents</a>, the average fee for booking a flight with a travel agent is $36. Online travel agencies (OTA) bundle their fee into the taxes and fees portion of a quote and it’s significantly less than a travel agent’s fee. Travel agents are paid commissions from hotels and airlines and have relationships that allow them access to upgrades and insider deals you don’t get with an OTA. If you have the time to shop and compare prices on multiple travel websites, you can save money. However, that free time might be worth more than $36 to you.","<strong>Key Features to Look for in an Online Travel Site </strong>","Booking Travel Packages<br/>Travel packages can let you combine flights, hotel reservations and car rentals together for a better deal than booking separately. Some companies, like <a href=\"/priceline-review\">Priceline</a>, pick hotels and flights for you, to get you to your destination for the lowest price. Other companies let you mix and match flights, hotels and car rentals to fit your schedule.","Booking Airfare<br/>One of the biggest reasons for searching on a travel site is to find cheap airfare. While there are dozens of airfare-specific websites, travel sites also give you the option to add hotel stays and car rentals. The best travel sites combine flight information from over nine different airlines and let you sort flights by price, number of stops, duration and flight class.","Booking International Travel<br/>Finding airfare for international travel is the easiest part of booking an overseas trip. <a href=\"/airgorilla-review\">AirGorilla</a> helps you find accommodations and rent GPS units with your rental car, so you can find your way around. Often, sites will recommend hotels that are far from your actual destination or event. Searching for reservations on a site that gives accommodation recommendations will help you schedule an international trip with less stress.","<strong>Best Hotel Booking Sites </strong>","We evaluated the services in this comparison based on the ease of booking an entire vacation, including flights, rental cars and hotels. However, if you book a flight directly with an airline, like Delta or Southwest, and you need a hotel reservation, you may want to consider using hotel booking sites that offer unique rewards and price-matching features not found on the travel aggregators we compared in this roundup. Here are some of our favorite online <a href=\"/best-hotel-booking-services\">hotel booking services</a>:","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8900250-10780389\">Hotels.com</a><br/>This hotel booking service has an easy-to-use search tool that yields a large variety of properties, including low-cost hostels, as well as the lowest prices of the 10 services we reviewed. The rewards programs is simple: Book 10 nights at participating hotels or resorts, and get one night free. There are no other restrictions or blackout dates, but the free night must also be at a participating hotel. Once you choose a location, Hotels.com displays pricing information and guest ratings from other Hotels.com users and TripAdvisor. You can’t use this service to book a rental car, but if you frequently stay at hotels, the rewards program and user-exclusive discounts make it the best place to find budget-friendly accommodations.","<a href=\"http://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=811935\">Booking.com</a><br/>Booking.com offers a price-match guarantee that reimburses you for the difference if you find a lower price on a different hotel booking site. The search results include hostels and apartments, and you can use Booking.com&#39;s subsidiary OpenTable to make a reservation at a restaurant near your hotel. You can also book airport taxis and trains using this service.
