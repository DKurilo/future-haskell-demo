The resemblance to RC monster trucks is mostly just skin-deep, however. Beneath these looks, telltale signs like spring-only shocks and a weak 27MHz transmitter hint at its true toy-grade identity.","Surprisingly, the Baja Beast does have many of the performance features of more expensive <a href=\"/best-remote-control-cars\">RC trucks</a>, just to a much lesser degree. Its large, rugged wheels and full suspension make it capable enough in rough terrain, but it lacks the power to climb over larger obstacles and can still get stuck if you&#39;re not careful.","The Baja Beast is fairly durable, with a nice protective outer shell and well-concealed internal components. Unfortunately, most of the vulnerable parts of its suspension system are made from plastic, which can break easily and lead to durability issues over time.","Included in the box with the Baja Beast is a user manual, a 27MHz transmitter, a NiMH battery and its charger. This car comes completely preassembled, so you don&#39;t have to fiddle with any delicate parts right off the bat.","The remote&#39;s design is essentially identical to the pistol-grip styles employed by higher-end brands, and it incorporates proportional steering and throttle. Rather than the all-or-nothing philosophy of other toy-grade car remotes, when you want the car to go slow, you can just pull the trigger slightly. When you want to make a small turn, you can make slight adjustments on your remote.","You can select from three different channels on the transmitter, which allows you to drive the Baja Beast with up to two other cars. Trim adjusters on the remote help straighten the vehicle out if you find it pulling to one side.","Steering with the Baja Beast can be a little sluggish, however. Sometimes it seems as though it reacts a split second after you send a command from the transmitter, which can result in overcompensating for delayed turns. This sort of issue is common with toy-grade cars and transmitters, and it isn&#39;t difficult to overcome and master with time.","A 30-day warranty begins with your purchase and protects you against defects in workmanship or materials. Although this doesn&#39;t cover normal wear and tear or abuse, it adds some peace of mind to your purchase. For other support concerns, you can easily contact Maisto via the phone number or email address listed on the company website.","The Achilles&#39; heel of this RC truck is the unavailability of replacement parts. As with many of the hobby-grade options this car is designed to mimic, the body of the car comes off easily for access to the internal components. Unfortunately, with the Baja Beast, this is merely for show, and if anything happens to break, your car will be indefinitely out of commission.","Despite falling short of its hobby-grade aspirations, the Maisto Baja Beast performs very nicely. It works well on road and off, thanks to its large wheels and full suspension, and it is easy to handle with its proportional steering. Hobby-grade RC vehicles afford you more power, durability and reparability, but the Baja Beast offers good looks, fun features and a great price in a solid, kid-friendly vehicle."]},"id":"efdebfc1-7dd9-49f9-be86-81a2192d301e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60458","url":"/baja-beast-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-11T16:36:43Z","datePublished":"2014-09-11T16:36:43Z","name":"Maisto Baja Beast","synopsis":"Built with full suspension, a removable outer shell and a pistol-grip transmitter, the Maisto Baja Beast is designed to resemble high-end hobby-grade RC vehicles.
