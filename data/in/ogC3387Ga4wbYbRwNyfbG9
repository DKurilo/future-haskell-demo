The Safety 1st Able 65 has an impressive weight limit, and it is the best front-facing <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> that we reviewed. However, if you are looking for an infant car seat that will convert to a toddler seat, you should know that the Able 65 is nearly impossible to use in its rear-facing position. Depending on the direction of the seat, it is either the worst infant car seat available or the best toddler seat you can use.","As a rear-facing car seat, the Safety 1st Able 65 supports a child from 5 to 40 pounds or 19 to 40 inches. This should last a child up to the recommended two years in a rear-facing seat. Unfortunately, this seat isn&#39;t great for preemies, since premature babies are usually born weighing less than 5 pounds. Also, installing the Able 65 in its rear-facing position is a nightmare. Although it has LATCH connectors, it is difficult to tighten these properly, and the seat feels wobbly. On top of that, it&#39;s difficult to tighten the harness from this position. Finally, the rear-facing car seat is too long for nearly any vehicle, and the front-seat passengers will sacrifice leg room for the seat.","When your baby is at least a year old, 22 pounds and 34 inches, you can turn the seat around. As a front-facing baby car seat, the Safety 1st seat is among the best we reviewed. It is easy to install and simple to use. You don&#39;t have to rethread the harness as your child grows, and the fabrics are easy to disconnect and clean. This convertible car seat comes with a detachable cup holder, but it is prone to breaking. Finally, in its front-facing position, the seat will stay with your child until he weighs 65 pounds or is 52 inches tall. For an average child, this means it will last until he is about 8 years old.","Safety 1st includes a one-year warranty with the convertible car seat, and if you lose your user manual, you can download a new one from the Safety 1st website. Customer service is available by email and telephone, but we had trouble getting in touch with agents through either method. When we finally made contact, the agent was not especially helpful."]},"id":"fdc3e649-04d5-4c82-b97e-5fda1d9201f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"556517de-6bb6-4116-8834-7c7f73ce7d02","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Safety 1st Able 65 is one of the best front-facing baby car seats we reviewed, but if you&#39;re buying it for your infant, you should know that this is one of the most frustrating rear-facing seats available.
