Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool Cabrio is another <a href=\"/best-dryers\">clothes dryer</a> that, while not being exactly cheap, is a much more affordable dryer than the high-end machines on the market. Yet, it comes loaded with a number of impressive features that make it a nice option for anyone looking for a dryer with a little more style and functionality than a basic model. It’s also a large-capacity dryer with 7.6 cubic feet of dryer space.","While it&#39;s not the sleekest looking machine in Whirlpool’s line, it’s also not bad looking and will not detract from your laundry space. Most importantly, this dryer performs extremely well. One of the features uncommon in this price range is the steam options. It comes with an impressive 11 cycles and a damp dry signal, steam and wrinkle reduction. Some of the cycles include Delicate, Bulky, Sanitize and the Enhanced Touch Up cycle that uses steam to further sanitize items like bedding and towels while minimizing wrinkles. The Sanitize cycle, according to the manufacturer, eliminates 99 percent of the most common household bacteria.","The estimated times for the cycles are all under an hour. For the most part, it comes close to meeting the estimated times. The only down side that it does use up more energy than its closest competitors. However, it does come with EcoBoost and Eco Monitor options and you can opt to extend run times to conserve energy.","The EcoBoost, as the name implies, boosts performance, while conserving energy. The Eco Monitor lets you see how the options you choose are saving both energy and money. Over the lifetime of the machine, the use of these options can cut utility bills by well over $3,000.","The advanced moisture sensors also help conserve energy by detecting when the clothes are dry and automatically ending the cycle. The lint trap is easy to clean and the dryer is easy to use overall, without a lot of complicated functionality.","All of the dryers in the Cabrio dryer series have a similar feature package. The primary difference being, only the WED8500BW offers a steam option and additional cycles for a marginal price difference.","Whirlpool Cabrio comes with a one-year warranty for parts and labor. You can download a PDF user manual from the manufacturer webpage that will help answer many question you may have as you are setting it up the dryer. Whirlpool can also be reached via phone, email or chat."]},"id":"729f04ba-2a1f-46a4-81a5-a907628f0ae5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"93f4e0d6-d877-4bd3-aa07-d162512cab05","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Cabrio is a laundry dryer with a nice feature package, which includes such extras as a steam cycle and a wrinkle reduction, and performs the way it’s supposed to.
