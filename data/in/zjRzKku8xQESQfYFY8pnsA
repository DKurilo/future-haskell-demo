While electric gas blowers are less powerful than the average gas snow thrower, this blower plows through a level of snow comparable to single-stage gas blowers. This, combined with a low price tag, makes it a popular choice among eco-minded homeowners on a budget. As you would expect from an electric single-stage snow blower, it is lightweight. At only 35 pounds, the device is easy to maneuver and guide through paved areas. It’s also great for decks, patios and other areas close to the house.","The Greenworks electric <a href=\"/best-snow-blowers\">snow blower</a> features a 13-amp motor, providing significant power toward not only picking up snow but also moving it a great distance. This snow thrower has a snow clearing width of 20 inches and a cut depth of 10 inches, which is remarkable for a compact machine. Then the machine can discharge snow up to 20 feet through its 180-degree-adjustable chute.","Without a gas tank and associated engine pieces, it reduces the overall weight and the potential for pieces to malfunction with age. An additional perk of electric blowers is you don’t need to purchase gas or perform seasonal cleaning of fuel engine parts. Unfortunately, this blower has no self-propulsion functionality, but it’s light enough that it shouldn’t be a problem in most situations.","The Greenworks snow blower turns on with the flick of a switch. You can adjust the rest of the device for comfort, such as the handle height and length to one of three settings. You can store the power cable in a cord lock along the handlebar, which means you don’t have to worry about the cable becoming a tangled mess.","The Greenworks 2600502 is one of the best electric snow throwers due to its maneuverability and durability. Greenworks is well known for its high-quality products, and combined with the eco-friendly nature of electric machinery over gas power, this snow thrower is a suitable solution for most any snow removal. The Greenworks snow blower proves quite capable of clearing snow from short driveways and small paved areas."]},"id":"70ad43cd-ba3d-476e-8e34-e633c2b61158","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57508","url":"/greenworks-snow-blower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-09-14T14:53:18Z","datePublished":"2013-09-14T14:53:18Z","name":"Greenworks 2600502","synopsis":"If you're looking for alternatives to gas-powered snow blowers, the Greenworks 2600502 is a great option.
