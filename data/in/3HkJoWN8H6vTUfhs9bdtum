It offers a high number of features for its price point, making it one of the best values on the aftermarket GPS market.","Like all the other in-dash navigation units we reviewed, the 572BH can play DVDs and CDs. It also has a satellite radio receiver, so it can receive signals from SiriusXM (you&#39;ll have to subscribe in order to listen to those channels).","Like other premium navigation units, the 572BH can receive HD radio signals. Many FM and AM stations broadcast in HD as well as standard definition, and the 572BH can tune to those stations (there is no extra charge for HD radio).","It has mediocre smartphone integration, with no native support for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. However, you can integrate the head unit with your smartphone using Bluetooth or HDMI. Through HDMI, you are limited to mirroring your phone&#39;s screen on the head unit. However, with Bluetooth, you have several connectivity options.","The most important Bluetooth-enabled function is the hands-free phone operation. You can make and receive calls using the touchscreen on the 572BH. You can also scroll through your phone contacts.","Bluetooth also enables you to control your music on the 572BH. You can even control Pandora internet radio from the head unit.","One of Kenwood&#39;s greatest strengths is that it uses Garmin as its maps provider. This means that you&#39;ll get premium maps and directions built into the unit. It also gives you a two-year traffic subscription, so you can monitor congestion on your daily commute.","This unit has a capacitive, smartphone-style screen. Its 6.2 inches measured diagonally, which is a bit smaller than some of the best aftermarket GPS systems.","Kenwood offers phone, email and social media support. The 572BH ships with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"abb677f1-0901-4524-96b6-da2012145404","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1bf53c49-e26f-4817-8125-9f9ebf056aef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenwood DNX572BH doesn&#39;t have the holistic smartphone integration boasted by the best in-dash navigation systems, but its Bluetooth and HDMI are sufficient integration options for most consumers.
