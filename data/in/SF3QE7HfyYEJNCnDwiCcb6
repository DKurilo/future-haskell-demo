Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Finding a printer to fit the demands of a busy office can be a difficult task. The HP Color LaserJet CP4025n can be an ideal match with its vast variety of features, excellent print quality and high performance. This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> produces beautiful prints with excellent print speeds and has a large paper tray. However, this printer still needs several improvements before it can beat out several similar devices to make it a top product in the printer market.","The CP4025n offers a maximum print resolution of 1200 x 1200 dpi (dots per inch). With this high of resolution, your prints are clear, vivid and bright. Rarely will you see a blurry image produced by this laser printer. A standout feature available on this device is its 100,000-page monthly duty cycle. This means you can print up to 100,000 prints per month without causing any technical damage to the printer. This is the largest duty cycle we saw on a laser printer, and it is large enough to meet the printing demands of a busy office.","The CP4025n also offers fast printing speeds. This printer features speeds of 35 pages per minute for both black-and-white and color prints. The only drawback we found with the printing features available on this device is that there is no automatic duplex setting available, which allows you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper. If you want to print on both sides of a page, you must turn the paper over manually. This printer will not complete the task for you.","This laser printer features a paper tray that can hold up to 500 sheets of paper. This is much larger than the paper tray you would find on an average laser printer, and it is a perfect addition to an office printer. The CP4025n lacks wireless printing capabilities, but it has a USB 2.0 port that makes it possible to print directly from a flash drive or even a camera.","This laser printer offers 512MB of installed memory and a one-year warranty. It is not an ENERGY STAR qualified device, however, and it uses a considerable amount of power. The CP4025n uses 740 watts while in printing mode, 72 watts while in ready mode, 19 watts while in sleep mode and 0.3 watts while off but still plugged in to an electrical outlet.","The HP CP4025n is a large printer. The large dimensions on this device can make it a hassle to have in any home because it takes up a considerable amount of space. This laser printer is 21.3 inches wide, 16.5 inches tall and 20.6 inches thick. It also weighs 84.6 pounds, making it large and difficult to move without help. It features a small display screen on the right-hand side of the device, which makes using it much easier and exploring the printer’s settings and features much simpler to do."]},"id":"bb3ef992-712e-42ce-a319-425c4de8897c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"462cc54d-bdcd-4bc7-bd19-7a48caf8a3e7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Color LaserJet CP4025n printer is an ideal device for an office environment.
