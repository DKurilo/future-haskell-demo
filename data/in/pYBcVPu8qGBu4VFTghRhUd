It has been in business for over 25 years, and it offers free quotes.","Some structured settlement annuity buyers such as <a href=\"/peachtree-financial-solutions-review\">Peachtree</a> and <a href=\"/annuity-transfers-review\">Annuity Transfers</a> promote selling your annuities as a last resort, but this company&#39;s website suggests that you can use your lump sum for everything from starting a business to paying off credit cards to doing &#34;something special&#34; for yourself. It has some articles about when a lump sum is not the best idea and what laws affect your structured settlement payments. The FAQs section is concise but short.","The website offers fast, personalized service. You can fill out the online form or call Stone Street to get a free estimate on how much you can get for your structured annuity settlement. Payments will depend on how much your settlement is for, how long it still has, and state laws.","You should also get more than one quote from other structured annuity settlement services and read the contract carefully before signing. In addition, many states require you consult a lawyer or financial counselor before selling a structured settlement. This stipulation may not apply to lottery winnings.","Once you have signed the contract, Stone Street will do the rest of the work filing the necessary papers for the court hearing to approve the sale of the settlement. In general, it takes this company two to four weeks after the hearing date to get you your money. It says it can provide cash advances immediately. Keep in mind that any sale of a structured annuity must be approved by the courts, so if for some reason you get an advance and the annuity transfer does not go through, you will owe Stone Street Capital the money.","Stone Street does not have a limit as to how large a lump sum payment it can make. It can make a lump sum for a portion of your settlement, rather than selling all of your settlement. There are some legal fees you&#39;ll need to pay in order to complete this sale. Fees vary by state."]},"id":"97fba1e4-f57e-4460-9ded-8734a38fecbb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68626","url":"/stone-street-capital-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-26T20:25:30Z","datePublished":"2016-10-26T20:25:30Z","name":"Stone Street Capital","synopsis":"Stone Street Capital offers lump-sum payments for structured payment annuities from settlements or lottery winnings.
