You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","MAGIX Rescue Your Videotapes is among the best <a href=\"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters\">VHS to DVD converters</a> because it lets you transfer your VHS tapes to DVD with relative ease. It walks you through the capture and conversion process step by step and even allows you to edit and enhance your footage afterward. But it falls short of the top spots in our side-by-side comparison because it’s missing some of the minor features we look for in this category.","When you launch MAGIX Rescue Your Videotapes, it gives you three options: create a new video project, load a video project or watch the intro video. If you choose to create a new video project, the program guides you step by step through the capturing process, eliminating the guesswork. This approach makes it very intuitive to record your tapes onto your computer.","When you’ve captured the footage you want, MAGIX Rescue Your Videotapes offers you an impressive video-editing array. You have the ability to trim away unwanted footage, make separate clips, and add transitions, effects and more. These tools have a slight learning curve, but after you’ve used the software for about an hour, you should get the hang of it. While these tools aren’t as comprehensive as those in the converters that ranked higher, they should suit your needs – especially if you’re uninitiated in video editing.","Once you’ve got your video project the way you want it, this program allows you to burn it to a DVD or Blu-ray disc. We created a test disc using this program, and it took about half an hour to burn a 40-minute DVD. This is a decent time considering that some products we reviewed took hours. However, the best VHS to DVD converters can do it in under 10 minutes. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"0260090f-1abd-48dc-8bb4-dca4c9705f39","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As good as this software is, it falls short in some areas. For example, it allows you to save your project as a stand-alone video file on your computer, but it only gives you one format option: WMV. The best programs let you export in up to seven of the most popular video file formats. Additionally, converters that ranked higher in our reviews allow you to optimize your converted tapes for playback on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. If MAGIX Rescue Your Videotapes allowed you to do this, it would likely rank higher in our review."]},"id":"736ebef9-4e40-4fdf-b804-eb43067f7590","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aad95f70-0d30-4cab-8051-2b98efbc5b78","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There’s not much to complain about with MAGIX Rescue Your Videotapes.
