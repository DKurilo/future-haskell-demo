In fact, there are quite a few similarities between the two. Moreover, the differences between each service are not significant enough for one to blow the other out of the water.","Security Essentials is basic free <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus software</a> developed and supported by Microsoft. In addition to their commercial antivirus service options, <a href=\"/avg-review\">AVG</a> also offers basic free antivirus software. The biggest point of differentiation between Microsoft Security Essentials vs. AVG is the general features of each.","The free edition of AVG Anti-Virus offers protection from different forms of malware such as computer viruses and spyware. AVG s integrated LinkScanner technology integrates with Internet Explorer and Firefox among other browsers to check the safety of webpages in real time while you browse the web. AVG also has a new social networking protection feature in its 2011 version.","Microsoft Security Essentials, by contrast, does not have integrated browsing protection. MSE is intended to work in conjunction with your web browser&#39;s integrated protection to guard against internet-based malware threats, but this form of web-based protection isn t as robust as what AVG offers. Security Essentials is designed to offer basic high-quality protection from different forms of malicious software without additional bells and whistles.","The difference in feature options between the two products can, in part, be explained by the different objectives Microsoft and AVG have for their free antivirus services. Microsoft developed Security Essentials to make antivirus protection easily accessible to all Windows customers. AVG uses the free edition of their antivirus service as a marketing tool to broaden awareness about its paid product line of antivirus and other security software.","Both AVG and Microsoft Security Essentials offer real-time, on-demand malware detection. Both services are also capable of updating their virus definitions automatically. Both AVG and Security Essentials consistently score high marks when it comes to detecting malware threats, but both have room to improve when it comes to actually blocking malware infiltration.","Both antivirus software options offer free web forums and online help and support services. AVG offers additional phone support services. Both antivirus software applications operate on Windows 7, Vista and XP operating systems; however, PCs must pass a Windows validation test during the Security Essentials installation process in order to install the software successfully. Consumers using a computer equipped with a genuine Windows operating system shouldn t have a problem installing the software.","In terms of performance, these products differ in subtle ways. AVG Anti-Virus Free 2011 provides markedly faster scan times than Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0. Nevertheless, Microsoft Security Essentials fairs a little better than AVG at fading into the background and not slowing down your PCs&#39; overall performance. In comparing the user interface between Microsoft Security Essentials vs. AVG, the Security Essentials&#39; interface is definitely a little cleaner looking and easier to navigate.","AVG s free Anti-Virus protection service has been around much longer than Microsoft Security Essentials, which was first released less than two years ago in September 2009. This explains why AVG is more widely used, currently serving 110 million computers worldwide in comparison to Security Essentials&#39; 30 million. Despite the difference in popularity, the performance level of each product ranks about same.","They are both good quality antivirus software, so which product comes out slightly ahead depends on what you are looking for in antivirus protection. To have access to a small number of additional options with a more efficient on-demand scanning feature, AVG Anti-Virus Free 2011 is the better product. For a basic virus protection service that blends into your system&#39;s processes with minimal disruption, Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 is a little better suited to the task. Overall, the differences between Microsoft Security Essentials vs. AVG are minimal.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"9e575263-cce4-41e2-a6c4-5f9556229f68","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5608","url":"/microsoft-security-essentials-vs-avg","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"maya-austen","url":"/author/maya-austen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Maya Austen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"J5ay6BKKtPm5BBbDWuZWFV","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-18T14:20:05Z","datePublished":"2011-03-18T14:20:05Z","name":"Microsoft Security Essentials vs. AVG","synopsis":"In Microsoft Security Essentials vs. AVG 2011 free anti-virus competition for superior product value, neither service truly gets the better of the other.","review":{},"strapline":"In Microsoft Security Essentials vs. AVG 2011 free anti-virus competition for superior product value, neither service truly gets the better of the other.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-03-18T14:35:11Z","id":"kpVDFwo8TnHmYfxCF6u4Vn","meta":{"title":"Microsoft Security Essentials vs. AVG","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
