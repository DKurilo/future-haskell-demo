It has a traditional design for a wired backup camera. The camera attaches to your bumper and a long video cable is run through the underside of the vehicle and up into the cabin, where it is connected to the monitor.","This installation can be extremely difficult if you don&#39;t have mechanical expertise, so most likely you&#39;ll need to pay someone to install the camera system. We called a few different national stores for quotes on wired backup camera system installations, and the estimates ranged from $80 to $150 dollars.","This camera has a viewing angle of 170 degrees, which is one of the widest among reversing cameras we reviewed. This means you&#39;ll easily be able to see if there is anything behind you.","It&#39;s waterproof and freeze-proof, so you don&#39;t have to worry about the rain or snow of freezing temperatures affecting its performance.","It also has night vison, so you can see what is behind you after dark. One of the few negatives of this camera is its cylindrical design, which protrudes a bit awkwardly from the rear of the vehicle. The license plate mounts of many of its competitors are a bit less noticeable. Because the camera is wired, it&#39;s protected from any of the interference problems that affect many of its wireless counterparts.","You&#39;ll get a clear picture that won&#39;t be interrupted by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signals.  The camera comes with a rear-view mirror monitor that acts as a mirror when the camera is not in use. When the camera turns on, 4.3 inches of the mirror becomes a LCD screen that displays what the camera sees."]},"id":"5cc7aadf-c0a8-4ff1-be04-60cb97c34a35","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d0e3ed4c-c57c-4b58-b38c-e81f67ad611b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is an ongoing debate about whether wired or wireless systems represent a better investment.
