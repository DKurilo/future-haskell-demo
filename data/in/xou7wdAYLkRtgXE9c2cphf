Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Among the <a href=\"/home/hvac/best-portable-air-conditioners/\">portable air conditioners</a> we reviewed, the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 is the most powerful and effective at cooling. This power comes at a cost, though, as the machine is the least efficient and costs you an extra $30 on average per year to run. However, if performance is your highest priority, this is the air conditioner to get. It operates in a variety of modes, including fan-only and sleep, and you can program the louvers to turn automatically for even distribution of air.","The Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 is strong enough to cool rooms up to 700 square feet. Although the <a href=\"/home/hvac/best-portable-air-conditioners/newair-review/\">NewAir AC-14100E</a> matches this cooling power, it doesn&#39;t quite match the FFPA1422R1&#39;s airflow. In fact, the FFPA1422R1 has the highest rating for maximum airflow among models we reviewed at 497 CFM, well above the industry average of 240 CFM. Additionally, it extracts up to 3.8 pints of moisture from the air per hour, making it one of the more effective dehumidifiers in our portable air conditioner reviews.","In addition to cooling performance, this floor air conditioner has an impressive variety of operating modes. Its fan-only mode simply circulates the air, flushing out stale air on days when you don&#39;t need to cool down the room. The energy-efficient sleep mode, a useful feature not all portable ACs have, gradually raises the room&#39;s temperature at night to keep you comfortable while you sleep. Another uncommon feature is the oscillating louvers, which move the fan slats automatically from side to side, more evenly distributing the air. It comes with a sleek LCD remote control that allows you to control the air conditioner from any location in the room.","Extra power comes with a cost: At EER 8.9, its low energy efficiency rating translates to an estimated cost of  $136 per year – about $30 higher than the average unit we reviewed. Of course, actual energy costs depend on how you use the unit in your home.","With a decibel rating of 55, this is the second-loudest portable air conditioner we tested. Although the quietest machine we tested, the <a href=\"/home/hvac/best-portable-air-conditioners/amico-review/\">Amico AP11000</a>, is only seven decibels less, there&#39;s a noticeable difference. At 74 pounds, the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 is heavier than average. However, since all portable air conditioners have casters or wheels on the bottom, this weight generally isn&#39;t an issue unless you plan to carry the machine upstairs.","The warranty on the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1&#39;s compressor lasts five years, the longest term we&#39;ve seen among portable AC units. The rest of the device is covered by a one-year parts warranty common to all portable AC brands. At the time of writing this review, the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 costs $542, making it the most expensive model we reviewed and about $120 more expensive than average."]},"id":"0ffeca3f-eb73-4e53-9404-ffd6671282c3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58316","url":"/frigidaire-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-04T23:10:37Z","datePublished":"2013-12-04T23:10:37Z","name":"Frigidaire FFPA1422R1","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":90,"verdict":"While the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 is more expensive to run, its powerful design and numerous features make it a solid option for cooling a large room quickly.","pros":["The Frigidaire FFPA1422R1&#039;s incredible airflow of 497 CFM makes this machine more powerful than the others we looked at."],"cons":["This portable air conditioner has an EER of 8.9, making it the least efficient unit in our comparison."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","id":"xou7wdAYLkRtgXE9c2cphf","meta":{"title":"Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 is more expensive to run, its powerful design and numerous features make it a solid option for cooling a large room quickly."},"products":[{"slug":"frigidaire-ffpa1422r1","url":"/product/frigidaire-ffpa1422r1","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","name":"Frigidaire FFPA1422R1","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","id":"6q3Q77JFWtBZoMU6mn62Bj","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mWqv9sDpRMMPpw7gpWm3RK.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","mimeType":"","name":"d21a97b57930b77faf78a779ff479652.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/d21a97b57930b77faf78a779ff479652.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","id":"mWqv9sDpRMMPpw7gpWm3RK","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mWqv9sDpRMMPpw7gpWm3RK.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 is more expensive to run, its powerful design and numerous features make it a solid option for cooling a large room quickly."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/mWqv9sDpRMMPpw7gpWm3RK.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","mimeType":"","name":"d21a97b57930b77faf78a779ff479652.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/d21a97b57930b77faf78a779ff479652.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","id":"mWqv9sDpRMMPpw7gpWm3RK","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mWqv9sDpRMMPpw7gpWm3RK.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"While the Frigidaire FFPA1422R1 is more expensive to run, its powerful design and numerous features make it a solid option for cooling a large room quickly."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/hvac/best-portable-air-conditioners/frigidaire-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-conditioning","url":"/home-and-garden/air-conditioning","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","name":"Air Conditioning","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:37:59Z","id":"pVrs4zPdxV4QVcV5FoWtAd","dateImported":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
