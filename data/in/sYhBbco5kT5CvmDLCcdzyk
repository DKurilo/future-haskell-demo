As a battery conservation measure, this outdoor <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/buyers_guides/camping-lantern-buyers-guide\">camping lantern</a> automatically shuts down after one hour. However, pushing a button lets the light stay on as long as you want, and when you remove the lid, it doubles as a bright flashlight.","This camping light measures 7.25 x 3 x 3 inches. It uses only one button to operate it, is resistant to weather, and offers a rubberized base and grips on the sides. Two settings are available on the lantern, and you push the button once for a bright light and once again for the nightlight mode. The bright mode of 260 lumens is enough to light an area of about 900 square feet. The low mode uses 20 lumens, which is suitable for use as a nightlight. The different light modes on this battery-powered lantern give you 15 hours of bright light, or 300 hours of light on the nightlight setting.","The sturdy handle and additional hook let you hand-carry or hang the lantern. This lantern also has a USB charger, so you can use it to charge your smartphone, MP3 player or other device.","The batteries required to operate this camping lantern are four alkaline D-cells that have a 1.5-volt rating. The weight of this outdoor camping lantern is 1.3 pounds, which is average. However, the four batteries boost the weight by about 1 pound. This may be a consideration if you are looking for a lantern to take along camping or hiking, since you&#39;ll want your backpack to be as light as possible.","The Mr. Beams UltraBright LED Lantern has a sturdy construction, with a carrying handle for when you are walking and a hook for hanging the camping lantern upside down in your tent. It runs for 300 hours on the nightlight setting and 15 hours on the high setting. In addition, it has a lifetime guarantee on the LEDs and takes up little room in your camping luggage or home storage."]},"id":"ef001d38-41db-4c34-b876-e12e92bda9c3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65245","url":"/mr-beams-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","datePublished":"2015-05-29T16:42:58Z","name":"Mr. Beams UltraBright MB470","synopsis":"The Mr. Beams UltraBright LED Lantern uses LEDs to light up your campsite, your path when you're hiking or hunting, or a room when the power goes out.
