The privacy software detects and deletes traces of your computer and internet history that can otherwise compromise your privacy. This sensitive data is effectively removed from your computer permanently to the extent that potential thieves won’t even know it was ever there. Unfortunately, Clean Space overlooks several areas. Clean Space scans for private files and then shreds them. It only removes internet traces if you’re using Firefox or Internet Explorer. It doesn&#39;t have a stealth mode or the ability to manually shred specific files. It does have a boss key function to hide your screen from sudden unexpected visitors.<br/><strong><br/></strong>The software helps users maintain privacy by deleting various tracks that are left behind from normal computer use. These traces include browser history, cache, temporary internet files and recent documents list. Clean Space erases your digital footprint from using Windows, the internet and several applications. You can choose between a handful of different deletion methods to make sure the private data is irrecoverable. And while the software doesn’t do as many passes as some, it does include anti-recovery methods that meet government level standards. This privacy software is effective at what it does, eliminating your history from several actions. However, the application simply isn’t as broad in scope as some of the best computer privacy software. Clean Space is easy to use partly because there isn’t much to it. For the most part, you simply click on one button and the program starts deleting garbage files. Or you can use the advanced cleaning mode for more control and flexibility. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"a801d444-9557-47e5-8060-43fe55d2ab59","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"62211a39-7184-4cb8-b9bf-b4001fc0d184","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Clean Space is a competent privacy program that works well and is easy to use.
