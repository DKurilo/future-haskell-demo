It not only has an appealing design, but also incredible power. Your child can experience some of the Mustang legacy with the Fisher-Price Power Wheels Ford Mustang, the child-equivalent of sports cars. It offers realistic details both inside and outside the vehicle, from sporty chrome wheel caps to pretend seat belts and a cup holder. The interior of the vehicle looks very similar to the real deal, complete with fake air vents, a fake GPS, and a pretend radio that plays real radio tunes.","The Fisher-Price Power Wheels Ford Mustang is equipped with a 12-volt battery, which promises to offer the power and speed any child wants to see in a vehicle.Â  This <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">ride-on toy</a> car has real doors that open and close, in addition to Power Lock Brakes, which are a must-have for any beginner driver. It operates at 2.5-MPH and 5-MPH when going forward and 2.5-MPH in reverse.","As is typical among Fisher-Price vehicles, the Power Wheels Ford Mustang has a one-year &#34;Bumper to Bumper&#34; limited warranty. If anything breaks down on the car, you can take it to one of 300 service centers throughout the nation for repairs. Each vehicle is tested prior to shipping with Fisher-Price&#39;s in-house quality assurance Test Track, though this doesn&#39;t catch every possible problem that could occur within the vehicle&#39;s first year of use.","The 12-volt battery promises a certain standard of performance that 6-volt models, such as the <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">Hummer H2</a> ride-on toy, simply can&#39;t compete with. A 12-volt system is ideal for children over 30 pounds in weight and also allows the vehicle to reach speeds of 5-MPH. Plus, it offers prolonged battery life for drivers.","Out of the box, you&#39;ll need to perform some assembly, which will take upwards of an hour. Adding the decals is oftentimes the most time-consuming part because they require the most attention and careful application. You&#39;ll want to take your time as you apply the decals because wrinkles can detract from the vehicle&#39;s overall appearance.","This series of Power Wheels Mustangs have undergone multiple revisions since their original release in 2006, which means that many of the defects have been worked out in recent years. The front alignment, actuation, steering rod, rear electric motors, battery connector and other key elements are all designed perfectly to deliver a high standard of performance.","While the Fisher-Price Power Wheels Ford Mustang isn&#39;t necessarily as educational as other vehicles, it&#39;s still an American rite of passage. The Mustang has a rich heritage in our culture, which is something that the children of today will want to experience. The vehicle is both reliable and entertaining, which is all you can really ask for with a Power Wheels ride-on toy."]},"id":"0b4679e2-85d3-43a2-ad2f-27b07ddbc508","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55500","url":"/ford-mustang-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-27T17:00:15Z","datePublished":"2012-11-27T17:00:15Z","name":"Ford Mustang","synopsis":"The Ford Mustang is the premier muscle car.
